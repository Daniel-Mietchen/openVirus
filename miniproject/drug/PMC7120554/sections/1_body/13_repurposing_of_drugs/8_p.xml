<p id="Par23">Perspectives for use of antiviral drugs in livestock animals are envisaged as the mass treatment for the control of the disease (on a large scale), whereas treatment in companion animals favours an individual approach. The main prerequisite for successful veterinary antiviral chemotherapy is a better understanding of the viral infection pathogenesis as well as development of sophisticated means for drug delivery. These will mainly focus on targeted approaches that aim specific molecular targets with a narrow niche, allowing for better specificity and less side effects of antiviral agents. Advances in the field of molecular biology, in particular computational approaches, would contribute to development of a new generation of antiviral therapy, which would be of importance in the control of various kinds of animal diseases.</p>
