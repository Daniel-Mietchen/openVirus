<p id="Par21">Idoxuridine and trifluridine are structurally similar thymidine analogues that inhibit synthesis of DNA. They have been applied in the treatment of feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), significantly reducing the number of viral plaques in vitro (Nasisse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1989</xref>). Idoxuridine has also exhibited therapeutic potential against equine herpesvirus type 2 (EHV-2) by alleviating the ocular symptoms caused by the infection (Collinson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1994</xref>). It has also been reported that idoxuridine in the concentration of 0.1% and 0.3% trifluridine can limit the viral replication but do not kill the virus (Plummer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2014</xref>).
