<p>Our basic first model acknowledges that the first few doses of antivirals dispensed per case can be targeted more effectively than a similar number of additional doses. That is, dispensing very many doses per cases is wasteful and likely to attract justified criticisms and objections. A practical way to dispense doses to close contacts only is to target household members of cases who present. Accordingly, our second model considers transmission through a community with a household structure and we considered delays in presentation. The conclusion that an attempt to contain transmission uses relatively few antiviral doses continues to hold in this setting. We also conclude that successful containment of transmission, if possible, requires early presentation by the primary household case. We cannot wait for laboratory confirmation of a strain-specific infection. The number of doses used by an attempt to contain transmission is so small that one can afford, while a chance of containing transmission remains, to be liberal in dispensing doses to household members of any early presenter with clinical symptoms that are consistent with a pandemic-strain infection.</p>
