<p>Next we allowed for failure by a fraction of primary household cases to present soon after onset of symptoms. The conclusion is that, even when antivirals are adequately effective, containment is not possible if more than a modest fraction of primary household cases fail to present early. In our illustration we required the proportion of primary cases who fail to present early to be smaller than 20%. This 20% includes asymptomatic cases, mildly-symptomatic cases who do not bother to present and symptomatic cases unable to gain timely access to a health service provider.</p>
