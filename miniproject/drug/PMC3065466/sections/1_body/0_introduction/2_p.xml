<p>The possibility of using antiviral drugs for prophylaxis, to mitigate transmission of pandemic influenza, arises because their use to protect against currently circulating strains of influenza indicates a reduced chance of being infected

Use of these observations in modeling studies suggests that stockpiles of antiviral drugs held by some nations are sufficiently large to defer the peak of the epidemic until a newly developed vaccine is available to control transmission
