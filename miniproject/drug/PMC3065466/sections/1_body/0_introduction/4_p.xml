<p>Some argue that using antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission merely wastes doses that are needed to treat cases experiencing severe disease. Here ‘dose’ means a course of antiviral drugs, typically lasting seven days. The fear of wastage is fed by the fact that the protective effect of antiviral drugs acts only for the duration of the dose (e.g. 7 days), so that individuals might need several doses during a pandemic. On the other hand, if prophylactic use of antiviral drugs is able to reduce the total number individuals infected then there will be fewer cases with severe disease in need of treatment with antiviral drugs. The optimal allocation of antiviral doses to treatment and prophylaxis depends on the size of the stockpile, effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treatment and protection from infection, as well as the transmission and disease progression characteristics of the new virus strain. Many of these factors will not be known prior to the pandemic. However, it is clearly worth asking whether a relatively modest number of antiviral doses used for prophylaxis might be able to reduce the eventual attack rate substantially.</p>
