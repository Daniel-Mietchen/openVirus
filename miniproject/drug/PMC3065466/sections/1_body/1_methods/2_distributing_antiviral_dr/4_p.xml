<p>Finally, we determine how many household outbreaks might need to be observed to provide evidence that the antiviral drugs are indeed effective against the newly emerged virus strain. Here we look at establishing effectiveness via a simple comparison of the mean outbreak size in households that receive antiviral drugs early with the mean outbreak size in households that receive them late. This comparison of means must accommodate heterogeneity in variances and a number of tests permit this. We have chosen to use the Alexander-Govern test
