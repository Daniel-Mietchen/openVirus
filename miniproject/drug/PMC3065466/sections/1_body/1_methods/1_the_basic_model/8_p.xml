 </inline-formula>, when planning to prepare for pandemic influenza, seems sensible on the basis of past experience. Attack rates observed during the pandemics of 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009 are, for the most part, consistent with

 </inline-formula>, or less. It is, of course, possible that a pandemic strain with a higher transmission rate might evolve. Indeed, the basic reproduction number of the 1918 pandemic strain was almost certainly substantially higher, but compliance with public health measures based on social distancing during this pandemic was high because of the recognised severity of the disease. This is evident by observing how incidence changed as social distancing measures were introduced and removed; see Caley 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Caley1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As a result, although susceptibility was uniformly high the effective reproduction number, prior to depletion of susceptibles, was about 1.5. A high level of compliance is also likely in the event of a future pandemic strain with severe disease, suggesting that an initial effective reproduction number below 1.5 is likely from social distancing measures alone.
