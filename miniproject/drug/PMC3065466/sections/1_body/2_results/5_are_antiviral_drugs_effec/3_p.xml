<p>The power curve corresponding to a given antiviral effect scenario was estimated by simulating 500 data sets, applying the test to each data set and noting the fraction that reject the hypothesis of equal mean outbreak sizes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017764-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows the estimated power curves for four antiviral effect scenarios similar to the ones considered by Glass and Becker 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which enables a comparison of results and illustrates the findings. These scenarios are motivated by data on antiviral effects for currently circulating influenza strains,
