<p id="para0003">Coronaviruses comprise the largest group belonging to the Nidovirales order, which contains the families Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae and Roniviridae. The family Coronaviridae is composed of large, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that are isolated from several species and were previously known to induce common colds and diarrhoeal illnesses in humans 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The subfamily Coronavirinae is one of two subfamilies in the Coronaviridae family, the other being the subfamily Torovirinae. The subfamily Coronavirinae is further subdivided into four groups, namely the alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. The viruses were initially classified into groups according to serology but are now labelled by phylogenetic clustering 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Only alpha and beta coronavirus are of interest for human and clinical virologists 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Based on epidemiological data before 2019, only six coronaviruses were proven to cause human respiratory diseases: (i) HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, which lead to only mild upper respiratory disease, rarely bring about severe disease in humans; and (ii) SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which attack the lower respiratory tract and induce severe respiratory syndrome. Sequence analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a typical genome structure of coronaviruses and belongs to the cluster of Betacoronaviruses that include SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It forms a clade within the subgenus Sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. It is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans so far
