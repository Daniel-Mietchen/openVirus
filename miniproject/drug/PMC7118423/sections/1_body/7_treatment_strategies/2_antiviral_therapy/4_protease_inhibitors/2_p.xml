<p id="para0020">Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, Aluvia) is a protease inhibitor used in combined therapy for human immunodeficiency virous (HIV) 
 <xref rid="bib0074" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Lopinavir inhibits cleavage of the gag-pol protein, whilst ritonavir inhibits cleavage of the gag-pol protein precursor and lopinavir metabolism to increase the concentration of lopinavir 
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. It has been shown that lopinavir/ritonavir could inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in vitro. In primate models, animals treated with lopinavir/ritonavir for MERS have a better prognosis than untreated animals 
 <xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. A non-critical SARS-CoV-2-infected patient in South Korea received lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra; AbbVie) on the eighth day of admission, after which the clinical symptoms improved and the coronavirus load began to decrease until undetectable 
 <xref rid="bib0077" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Animal models suggest that TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease) plays an important role in coronavirus transmission 
 <xref rid="bib0078" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. TMPRSS2 activates the S protein of highly pathogenic human coronavirus, which binds to the receptor ACE2 and enters host cells
