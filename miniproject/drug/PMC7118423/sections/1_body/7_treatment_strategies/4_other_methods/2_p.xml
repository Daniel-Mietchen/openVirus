<p id="para0024">Studies have shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, the S protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is human ACE2, which is one of the reasons for SARS-CoV-2 infecting humans

 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">37]</xref>. Using cell experiments, Zhou et al. reported that ACE2 was the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV-2 could bind ACE2 receptors of civet, bat, pig and human origin, but cannot infect cells without ACE2 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Therefore, application of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) inhibitors under the condition of close monitoring of blood pressure is likely to reduce the damage in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <xref rid="bib0088" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. XueBiJing is a traditional Chinese medicine injection commonly used to treat inflammation in severe cases. A randomised controlled trial shows that on the basis of Western medicine treatment, XueBiJing injection could significantly reduce the fatality rate of community-acquired pneumonia
