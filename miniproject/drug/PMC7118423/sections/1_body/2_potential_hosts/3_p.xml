<p id="para0005">Although many scientists believe that bats are the intermediate host, most species of bats live in tropical or subtropical rain forests and caves far from human populations, thus the probability of bats transmitting the virus directly to humans is unlikely. It is generally known that bats may spread viruses to other intermediate hosts such as wild animals or livestock, from which the viruses are then transmitted to humans. Ji et al. carried out a comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage bias among different animal species based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence 
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The result suggested that SARS-CoV-2 appeared to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and a coronavirus of unknown origin. They considered that snake was a most probable wildlife animal reservoir, but the conclusion was controversial. Guo et al. introduced VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses by deep learning algorithm and predicted that bat coronaviruses were assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The results illustrated that bat and mink might be two candidate reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. Lam et al. identified pangolin-associated coronaviruses belonging to two sublineages of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD by metagenomic sequencing 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Hence, pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts and should be removed from markets to prevent such zoonotic transmission.
