<p id="para0025">Traveller screening is a way to limit the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 following its recent emergence, with the aim of curtailing the geographic spread of the infection 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Traveller symptom screening depends on the natural history of the infection. Individuals who are infected are likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. However, traveller screening is also limited. Gostic et al. performed tests to estimate the effectiveness of traveller screening and found, within the narrow range of the tests, that traveller screening outcomes were sensitive at a short mean incubation period 
 <xref rid="bib0091" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. However, for longer incubation periods, a larger proportion of departing travellers will not exhibit symptoms. After long incubation periods they still feel healthy enough to travel and do not realise they have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is simultaneously difficult to detect
