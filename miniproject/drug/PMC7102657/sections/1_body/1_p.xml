<p id="par0010">Viruses of the coronaviridae family possess a single-strand, positive-sense RNA and have been identified in various avian hosts and mammals, seven of which could cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified, is similar to the coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV with &gt;79% sequence identity; but it is more distant from MERS-CoV (only 50% homology) 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For all coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, at least three structural proteins are shared on the membrane: spike (S), the membrane protein (M) and small membrane protein (E). Also, another four functional proteins were found in almost all coronaviruses: 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase. During the viral infection process, including intracellular transport of virions, proliferation and assembling of virions in the infected cell – not only structural and functional proteins but also some proteases – play a key part, suggesting that targeting these proteins or enzymes as a therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a promising strategy. To date, no special drugs or vaccines have been used to deal with human coronaviruses. Considering the seriousness and suddenness of the COVID-19 outbreak, ∼200 clinical trials on COVID-19 have commenced in China, and it is promising to report that certain targets and their agents have displayed strong antiviral potential, of which some have been permitted to be used in an attempt to combat the disease in clinical trials.
