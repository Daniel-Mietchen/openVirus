<p>Patent application WO2005081716 discloses compositions and methods for inducing/enhancing immune responses, particularly antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated responses, against antigens of the SARS coronavirus. An enhancement of the immune response involving particularly cytotoxic T cell immune responses is induced in vivo by chimeric nucleic acids that encode an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone polypeptide (e.g., calreticulin) linked to at least one antigenic polypeptide or peptide from SARS-CoV. Using gene gun delivery of DNA-coated gold particles, vaccination of mice against a calreticulinâ€“nucleocapsid fusion protein resulted in potent nucleocapsid-specific humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses. Vaccinated animals were capable of significantly reducing the titer of a challenging vaccinia vector expressing the N protein of the SARS virus.</p>
