<p>Patent application WO2015081155 discloses immunogens, which comprise consensus proteins derived from the MERS-CoV spike protein, for use in DNA-based vaccines targeting MERS-CoV. The consensus spike protein significantly induced both humoral and cellular immune responses, including increased titers of IgG and neutralizing antibodies. The induced cellular immune response involved increased CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cell responses that produced IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, or both IFN-γ and TNF-α. On March 3, 2020, Inovio Pharmaceutical, Inc. announced they had designed the DNA vaccine called INO-4800 to be planned for human trials in the United States in April.
