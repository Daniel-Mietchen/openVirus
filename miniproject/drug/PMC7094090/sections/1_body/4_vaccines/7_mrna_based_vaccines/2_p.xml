<p>Patent application WO2018115527 describes vaccines comprising mRNA encoding at least one antigen of a MERS coronavirus, preferably a S protein or a S protein fragment (S1), an envelope protein (E), a membrane protein (M), or a nucleocapsid protein (N), all of which were effective in inducing an antigen-specific immune response. Intradermal administration into mice of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA mixture encoding MERS-CoV S proteins was shown to result in translation in vivo and induction of humoral immune responses.</p>
