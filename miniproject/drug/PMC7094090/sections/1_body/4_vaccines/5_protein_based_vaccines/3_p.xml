<p>Patent application US20060002947 (Antigen Express, Inc., a subsidiary of Generex) discloses the preparation of hybrid peptides composed of three elements, including (a) an invariant chain (Ii) key peptide for antigen presentation enhancing activity, (b) a chemical structure linking the Ii to the antigenic epitope, and (c) an antigenic epitope that binds to a MHC class II molecule. The methodology was used to create Ii-Key/MHC II SARS hybrids. Recently, Generex announced that it is developing a COVID-19 vaccine following a contractual agreement with a Chinese consortium comprised of China Technology Exchange, Beijing Zhonghua Investment Fund Management, Biology Institute of Shandong Academy of Sciences, and Sinotek-Advocates International Industry Development. The company will utilize its Ii-Key immune system activation technology to produce a COVID-19 viral peptide for human clinical trials.
