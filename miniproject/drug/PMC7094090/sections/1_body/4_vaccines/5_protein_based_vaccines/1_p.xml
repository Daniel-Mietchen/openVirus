<p>Patent application WO2010063685 by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) discloses a vaccine capable of provoking a protective immune response against SARS. The vaccine comprises an S protein immunogen and an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant. An engineered ectodomain immunogen (soluble S protein), in combination with the emulsion adjuvant, GSK2, induced high levels of anti-SARS-CoV IgG2a or IgG2b antibody responses and neutralizing antibody responses in animal models. In late February 2020, GSK announced a collaboration with Chinese firm Clover Biopharmaceuticals to assess a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine candidate.

 </sup> This collaboration will involve the use of Clover’s protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate (COVID-19 S-Trimer) with GSK’s adjuvant system. By applying their Trimer-Tag technology, Clover has manufactured an S-Trimer subunit vaccine using a rapid mammalian cell culture-based expression system. The Trimer-Tag is an advanced drug development platform, which enables the production of novel, covalently trimerized fusion proteins that can better target previous undruggable pathways.
