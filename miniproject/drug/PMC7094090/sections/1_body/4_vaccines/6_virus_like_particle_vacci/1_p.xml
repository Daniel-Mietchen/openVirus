<p>In 2015, patent application WO2015042373 by Novavax disclosed an immunogenic composition composed of MERS-CoV nanoparticle VLPs containing at least one trimer of a S protein, produced by baculovirus overexpression in Sf9 cells. This VLP preparation induced a neutralizing antibody response in mice and transgenic cattle, when administered along with their proprietary adjuvant Matrix M (RN 1235341-17-9). In addition, preparations of sera from vaccinated cattle (SAB-300 or SAB-301) were injected into Ad5-hDPP4 transduced BALB/c mice prior to challenge with MERS-CoV. Both SAB-300 and SAB-301 were able to protect these mice from MERS-CoV infection with a single prophylactic injection. Novavax announced on February 26, 2020

 </sup> that it was beginning animal testing on potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates due to their previous experiences working with other coronaviruses, including both MERS and SARS. Their COVID-19 candidate vaccines targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 were developed using their recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology along with their proprietary adjuvant Matrix-M.
