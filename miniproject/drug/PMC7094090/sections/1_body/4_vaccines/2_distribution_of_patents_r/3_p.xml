<p>It was reported that viral S protein subunit vaccines produced higher neutralizing antibody titers and more complete protection than live-attenuated SARS-CoV, full-length S protein, and DNA-based S protein vaccines.

 </sup> Unsurprisingly, about half of the patents focused on protein vaccines comprising the S protein subunit vaccine and vaccines specifically targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral S protein. Collectively, S protein/gene is the preferred target site in SARS/MERS vaccine development, and the same strategy can be potentially useful in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. A condensed report on several patents that describe vaccines for generating immunity to SARS and MERS follows.
