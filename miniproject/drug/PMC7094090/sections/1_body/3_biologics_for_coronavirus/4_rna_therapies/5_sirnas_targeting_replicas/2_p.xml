  <xref rid="tbl11" ref-type="other">11</xref>
 </xref>, that target SARS genes encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, nucleoprotein N, and proteolytic enzymes. These siRNAs were able to inhibit or kill 50â€“90% of the SARS virus BJ01 strain, with the proteolytic enzyme-targeting siRNAs being the most effective.
