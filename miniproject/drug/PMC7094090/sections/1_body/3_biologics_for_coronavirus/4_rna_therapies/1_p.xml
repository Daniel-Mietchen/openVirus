<p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process wherein small complementary RNA duplexes target and neutralize specific mRNA molecules, resulting in inhibition of gene expression or genetic translation. Interfering RNAs include microRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are generally about 21â€“25 nucleotides in length. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are artificial synthetic RNA molecules designed to fold into a tight hairpin conformation that allows them to silence their target genes, and can serve as precursors of siRNAs. The expression of shRNAs in cells is typically accomplished by their delivery via plasmids or viral or bacterial vectors.

 </sup> Although microRNAs are noncoding and naturally found in plants, animals, and some viruses, synthetic versions are currently being used to silence a variety of genes.

 </sup> The ability to chemically synthesize modified analogues of microRNAs as well as siRNAs, which are capable of altering disease-related gene expression or inhibiting pathogen gene expression, has created a host of new therapeutic options.
