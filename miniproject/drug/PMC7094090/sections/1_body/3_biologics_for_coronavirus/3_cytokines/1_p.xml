<p>Cytokines are low-molecular-weight proteins that act as chemical signals in the immune response to pathogen invasion. The production of various cytokines in response to an invading pathogen such as a virus contributes to the host organism’s ability to eliminate the pathogen. Specific types of cytokines, including chemokines, interferons (IFNs), interleukins, and lymphokines, have been reported and characterized in the literature over the past 40 years. By early 2020, the CAS Lexicon contained over 700 terms for specific types of cytokines associated with 76 724 documents, including 11 837 patents.</p>
