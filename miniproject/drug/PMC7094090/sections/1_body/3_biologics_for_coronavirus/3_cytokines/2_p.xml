<p>During a viral infection, the most prominent cytokines produced are IFNs, which interfere with viral replication. IFNs are classified as type I (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-δ, IFN-ε, IFN-κ, IFN-ν, IFN-τ, and IFN-ω), type II (IFN-γ), or type III (IFN-λ) based on the receptor complex used for signaling as well as sequence homology.

 </sup> Because of their ability to interfere with viral replication, interferons and interferon fusion proteins have been utilized as therapeutic agents for treatment of viral infections for the past 20 years. A few patents disclosing these proteins and their use for treating SARS are described below.
