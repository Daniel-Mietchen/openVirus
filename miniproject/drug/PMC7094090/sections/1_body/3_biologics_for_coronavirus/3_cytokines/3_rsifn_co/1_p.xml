<p>Patent applications WO2011072487 and WO2016180335 describe the cloning of a recombinant interferon (rSIFN-co, CAS RN 2043378-94-3) as well as a method for determining its potency that was effective for treating various viral infections/diseases, including SARS. The invention relates that rSIFN-co has an identical amino acid sequence to Infergen (118390-30-0), but it has an altered spatial conformation and different biological potency. The rSIFN-co not only has an antiviral activity that is 20 times stronger than the clinically available interferon, but also has significantly stronger antitumor properties against breast cancer and cervical cancer than other recombinant human Î±-interferons. The invention further relates that rSIFN has reduced toxic and side effects and can be safely used in large doses (each dose can be &gt;10 million IU), making it possible to successfully treat some viral diseases or tumors that require large doses of interferon.</p>
