<p>An additional 38 patents contained information pertaining to other types of antiviral antibodies that were useful for SARS and MERS therapies. These included neutralizing antibodies or antibodies designed to target proteins such as IL-6/IL-6R, TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3), CD16, ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin), ICAM-3 (intercellular adhesion molecule 3), or IP-10/CXCL10 (interferon γ-inducible protein 10). Cytokine storm has been reported to correlate with disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients admitted to an ICU had higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, particularly G-CSF, IP-10/CXCL10, MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and TNFα, as well as elevated cytokines from T helper 2 cells such as IL-4 and IL-10.

 </sup> Patent application WO2005058815 discloses human anti-IP-10 antibodies, including bispecific molecules and immunoconjugates that bind to IP-10 with high affinity, for treating inflammation, autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, bacterial infection, and viral infection. Patent application WO2017095875 discloses the preparation of human antibodies and immunoconjugates specifically targeting chemokine IP-10, including an anti-IP-10 antibody shown to suppress free serum IP-10 in about 3 days at 0.5 mg/kg and in approximately 10 days at 10 mg/kg in Cynomolgus macaques.
