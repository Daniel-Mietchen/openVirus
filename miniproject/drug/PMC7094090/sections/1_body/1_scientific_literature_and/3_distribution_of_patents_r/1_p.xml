<p>As mentioned earlier, COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new type of coronavirus in the same genus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Viral proteins responsible for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and replication are structurally similar to those associated with SARS-CoV. Thus, research and development on SARS and MERS may offer insights that would be beneficial to the development of therapeutic and preventive agents for COVID-19. This report identified pertinent data from patents related to these two coronaviruses.

 </xref> shows the distribution of patents in the CAS content collection related to SARS (A) and MERS (B). The number of patents related to SARS is almost 12 times the number related to MERS, probably because the SARS outbreak occurred about 10 years before the MERS outbreak. Among SARS patents, about 80% are related to the development of therapeutics, 35% are related to vaccines, and 28% are related to diagnostic agents or methods. Because an individual patent may cover any two or more areas, the sum of percentage values is greater than 100%. A similar distribution pattern was also observed for patents related to MERS. Thus, for both diseases, more patents have been devoted to the development of therapeutic agents as opposed to diagnostic methods and vaccines.
