 </sup> In addition, millions of people’s lives have been affected as a result of mandatory isolations/quarantines. The ripple effect of the COVID-19 outbreak could potentially bring major challenges to worldwide health systems and have far-reaching consequences on the global economy if the spread of the virus is not effectively controlled.
