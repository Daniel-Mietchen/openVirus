<p>To date, there are no SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral agents. Researchers have been racing to find possible treatments to save lives and produce vaccines for future prevention. To support research and development efforts to discover effective therapeutic and preventive agents for COVID-19, CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society specializing in scientific information solutions, has analyzed scientific data related to the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines for human coronaviruses since 2003. The analyses presented in this report are based on the CAS content collection, a scientist-curated data collection covering published scientific literature and patents from over 60 patent authorities worldwide. For a subset of the analyses, both CAS and MEDLINE data were collectively analyzed.</p>
