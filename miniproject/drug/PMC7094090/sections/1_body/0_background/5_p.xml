 </sup> RdRp and 3CLpro protease of SARS-CoV-2 share over 95% of sequence similarity with those of SARS-CoV despite the fact that these two viruses demonstrate only 79% sequence similarity at the genome level.

 </sup> On the basis of sequence alignment and homology modeling, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a highly conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD), a domain of S protein, and 76% of sequence similarity in their S proteins.
