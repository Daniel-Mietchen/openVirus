<p>The interaction between viral S protein and ACE2 on the host cell surface is of significant interest since it initiates the infection process. Cryo-EM structure analysis has revealed that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 is about 10â€“20 times higher than that of SARS-CoV S protein.
