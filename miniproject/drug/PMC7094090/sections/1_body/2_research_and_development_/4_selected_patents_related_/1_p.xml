 </xref> shows selected patents associated with the aforementioned potential drugs, together with patents disclosing small molecules for treatment of SARS or MERS. The selection was based on the presence of important terms in CAS-indexed patents as well as the presence of the synthetic preparation role assigned by CAS scientists during document indexing. Patent applications WO2009114512 and WO2014028756 disclose preparation of compounds active as JAK inhibitors, one of which was later named as baricitinib and developed for reducing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Patent application JP5971830 discloses preparation of polycyclic pyridone compounds and their use as endonuclease inhibitors. Patent applications US20160122374 and US20170071964 disclose preparation of the nucleotide analog drug remdesivir that was later developed as a therapeutic agent for Ebola and Marburg virus infections (Patent US20170071964). Because of its promising results in at least two COVID-19 patients, remdesivir has now entered into phase III clinical trials.
