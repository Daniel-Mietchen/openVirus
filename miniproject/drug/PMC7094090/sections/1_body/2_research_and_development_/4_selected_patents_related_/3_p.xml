<p>Patent application WO2018042343 presents both preparation methods and biological assay results for compounds capable of inhibiting the SARS virus proteases. These compounds appeared to exhibit good enzyme-inhibiting activity (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> ≈ 7 or IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≈ 0.1 μM) and antiviral activity, which was assessed by host cell viability using cultured human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells infected with a specified virus (e.g., MERS virus) expressing the viral S protein. Drug administration routes were also mentioned in this patent.
