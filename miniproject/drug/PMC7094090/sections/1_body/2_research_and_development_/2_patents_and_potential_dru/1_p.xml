<p>The CAS content collection contains patents related to coronavirus key proteins listed above. 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref>
 </xref> lists the number of patents related to each protein target and associated therapeutic compounds with a CAS Registry Number (CAS RN) reported in these patents. CAS data show that targets 3CLpro and RdRp attracted more attention than other targets, and more compounds with therapeutic potential were identified for these targets, probably due to the work done for SARS-CoV which also contains 3CLpro and RdRp.
