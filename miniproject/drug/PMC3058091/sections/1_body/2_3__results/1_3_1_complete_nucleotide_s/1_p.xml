<p>The Korean ECV 5 genome was sequenced (GenBank accession number HM775882) and its amino acid sequence was deduced. The genome is 7,430 nt in length, excluding the poly(A) tail. The 5'NCR contains 738 nt, followed by an ORF that encodes a viral polyprotein consisting of 2,196 codons, between a start codon (AUG) at position 739 and a stop codon (UGA) at position 7,326. The 3'NCR is 104 nt in length (Table
