<p>Of the five antiviral drugs tested here (azidothymidine, acyclovir, amantadine, lamivudine, and ribavirin), only amantadine (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 1 μg/mL) and ribavirin (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 22 μg/mL) had antiviral activity against Korean ECV 5, with amantadine showing stronger effects than ribavirin. Therefore, the amantadine and ribavirin could be applied to patients infected with ECV 5. It was reported that the amantadine could suppress the IRES mediated translation, and ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activity by decreasing viral replication in EV71 [
