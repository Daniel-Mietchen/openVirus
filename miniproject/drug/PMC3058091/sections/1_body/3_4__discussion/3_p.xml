<p>In conclusion, this manuscript is the first report of the complete nucleotide sequence of the Korean ECV strain, as well as the first examination of its response to various antiviral drugs. This data should be useful in preventing future outbreaks of ECV5 and in treating patients infected with the strain. Accordingly, it is necessary to test more of the same kind of antiviral drugs and various enterovirus serotypes in future studies.</p>
