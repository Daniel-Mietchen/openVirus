<p>One day before infection, Vero cells were seeded onto a 96-well culture plate at a concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup>4 </sup>cells per well. Next day, the medium was removed and then washed with 1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Infectivity of the virus stock was determined by the SRB method and was determined as infectivity of the virus by SRB ID
 <sub>50 </sub>(50% infective dose). Following this, 0.09 mL of diluted virus suspension of ECV containing CCID
 <sub>50 </sub>(50% cell culture infective dose) of the virus stock to produce an appropriate cytopathic effects within 2 days after infection and 0.01 mL of medium containing an appropriate concentration of the compounds were added. The antiviral activity of each test material was determined with a 10-fold diluted concentration ranging from 0.1 to 100 μL/mL. Three wells were used as virus controls (virus-infected non-drug-treated cells) while three wells were used as cell controls (non-infected non-drug-treated cells). The culture plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2 </sub>for 2 days. After washing once with 1 × PBS, 100 μL of cold (-20°C), 70% acetone was added to each well and left for 30 min at -20°C. 70% acetone was removed and 96-well plates were left at dry oven for 30 min. 100 μL of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid solution was added to each well and left at room temperature for 30 min. Unbound SRB was removed and the plates were washed 5 times with 1% acetic acid before oven drying and were then left in a dry oven for 1 day. Bound SRB was solubilized with 100 μL of 10 mM unbuffered tris-base solution and plates were left on a table for 30 min. The absorbance was read at 540 nm by using a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a reference absorbance at 620 nm. To calculate the IC
 <sub>50 </sub>(50% inhibitory concentration) values, the results were transformed to percentage of controls and the IC
 <sub>50 </sub>values were graphically obtained from the dose-response curves. The percent protection achieved by the test compound in ECV-infected cells was calculated by the following formula:
