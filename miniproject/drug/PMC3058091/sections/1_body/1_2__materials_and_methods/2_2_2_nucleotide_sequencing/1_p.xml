<p>The complete nucleotide sequence of the Korean ECV 5 strain was determined using a primer walking strategy; the sequences of the genome termini were determined by random amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany). The purified DNA was added to a reaction mixture containing 2 μL of Big Dye terminator reaction mix (ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) and 2 pmoles of each primer. Sequencing reactions were subjected to an initial denaturation at 96°C for 1 min and 25 cycles consisting of 96°C for 10 sec, 50°C for 5 sec, and 60°C for 4 min in a Gene Amp PCR system 2700 (Applied Biosystems). The products were purified by precipitation with 100% cold ethanol and 3 M sodium-acetate (pH 5.8), then loaded on an automated 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).</p>
