<p>DDIs between regular outpatient medications and specific antiviral regimens were not uniform, but were dependent on the possible interaction mechanisms of each antiviral regimen and the concomitant medication. Overall, compared with the older regimens, interactions with the most modern DAAs were less frequently caused by CYP and P-gp pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). GLE/PIB (n = 46) DDIs were distributed between DDIs facilitated by organic anion transporting protein (OATP; 23.5%), pH-change (15.7%), P-gp (27.5%), and the CYP pathways (27.5%). ELB/GRZ (n = 73) interactions were mediated via CYP enzymes (49.0%) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; 27.5%) most of the time. This was mainly caused by interactions with statins. Some statins are metabolized by CYP enzymes and may also be transported via OATP1B1/3 and/or BCRP. ELB/GRZ is a weak CYP 3A inhibitor in vivo and blocks intestinal BCRP. Concomitant use may cause higher statin blood levels, and the risk for adverse events like rhabdomyolysis increases. In contrast to that, VEL/SOF ± VOX (without VOX: n = 58; with VOX: n = 9) interactions, in &gt;50% of cases (VEL/SOF: 56.8%; VEL/SOF + VOX: 60.0%), were due to a PPI increasing gastric pH, thereby causing lower absorption rates of mainly VEL. DDIs between regular outpatient medications and VEL/SOF ± VOX via BCRP (6.8%; with VOX: 20.0%), P-gp (15.9%; with VOX: 0.0%), and CYP enzymes (20.5%; with VOX: 20.0%) also occurred but were represented less in this part of the cohort (
