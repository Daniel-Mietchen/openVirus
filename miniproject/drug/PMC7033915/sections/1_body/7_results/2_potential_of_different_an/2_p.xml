<p>All outpatient medication was assessed with each individual antiviral drug/regimen for potential DDIs that might occur in case of coadministration. Among all treatment regimens, the combination of OBV/PTV/r and BOC (alone) showed the highest potential for DDI (ie, category 2, 3, or 4) with the analyzed concomitant medication (37.1%), whereas SOF (alone) showed the lowest (2.8%). When examining the different time periods in detail, it became obvious that in every treatment period DAAs with a considerable potential for DDIs were to be found. As expected, the first-wave PIs BOC and TVR had much higher potential for DDIs, affecting 37.1% and 36.3% of outpatient medications, respectively. In the following period, starting with the approval of SOF, the potential for DDIs widely differed between the individual drugs that were available. SOF, SIM, and DAC showed potential for DDIs with 2.8%, 25.2%, and 12.5% of the outpatient medication, respectively. Risk for DDIs increased in the era of the first DAA fixed-dose combinations. The IFN-free regimen OBV/PTV/r ± DSV showed contraindications because of DDIs (category 4) with 30 drugs from the outpatient medications of the patients (8.5%) and potential significant DDIs (category 3) with 86 out of 353 drugs (24.4%) (
