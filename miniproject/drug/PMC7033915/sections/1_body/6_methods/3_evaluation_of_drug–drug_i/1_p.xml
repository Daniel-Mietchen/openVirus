In case of missing information, a clinical pharmacist and clinical pharmacologist were consulted. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the antiviral substances and the regular outpatient medications were considered. Interactions were classified into 4 different categories: (1) no interaction expected, (2) potential weak interaction (additional action unlikely to be required), (3) potential significant interaction (additional monitoring, dose adjustment or therapy adjustment required), and (4) do not coadminister/contraindicated.
