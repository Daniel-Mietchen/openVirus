<p>Overall, 668 consecutive patients with chronic HCV infection who were treated with a DAA regimen at the hepatitis outpatient clinic of Hannover Medical School from January 2014 to July 2018 were included. To analyze the changing epidemiology and frequency of potential DDIs within the evolving field of DAA therapies, 3 different time periods were defined based on the approval of key DAA regimens that significantly changed HCV therapy at our center: (A) January 22, 2014 (first patient treated with SOF, and therefore IFN-free therapy became available), to November 28, 2014; (B) November 29, 2014 (first patient treated with LDV/SOF or OBV/PTV/r ± DSV, and therefore fixed-dose regimens became available), to August 14, 2016; and (C) August 15, 2016 (first patient treated with velpatasvir [VEL], elbasvir/grazoprevir [ELB/GRZ], or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir [GLE/PIB], and therefore pangenotypic therapies as well as highly effective re-treatment options became available), to July 31, 2018.</p>
