<p>Further research on DDIs in HCV therapy will be required to ensure a safe upscaling of HCV treatments, which is essential to meet World Health Organization goals and ultimately achieve HCV elimination. The HCV population will certainly see further changes over the next years that will affect the risk for DDIs, as well as the most relevant drugs and mechanisms involved. Unrestricted treatment of high-risk populations like PWID will require general considerations and strategies for how to handle the most relevant potential DDIs in this specific group, as adequate monitoring during therapy might not always be possible.</p>
