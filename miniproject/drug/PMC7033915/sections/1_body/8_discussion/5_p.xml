<p>The present work has some limitations. First, it is a single-center analysis from a tertiary referral center. Thus, a higher frequency of patients with more advanced liver disease is likely, as indicated by the higher-than-average rate of patients with cirrhosis. However, it should be noted that it was not patients with cirrhosis but rather elderly patients who showed a comparably higher risk for DDIs, as shown in our analysis and as previously reported [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Second, with the restrictions for elderly patients for clinical trials and the low likelihood for liver transplantation, we would not expect that elderly patients were over-represented in our institution. The same affects patients with current intravenous drug use (PWID). For PWID, we would rather quote that they were under-represented due to the fact that active drug users are more frequently treated at other centers. Third, under-reporting of concomitant medication and nonadherence to recommendations on DDI management cannot be excluded, as the collection of medication data was based on patient self-report and letters of referral from physicians. Additionally, physicians may have changed the concomitant medication in anticipation of antiviral therapy. Therefore, we tracked changes to the concomitant medication back before initiation of antiviral therapy to include any changes due to suspected DDI.
