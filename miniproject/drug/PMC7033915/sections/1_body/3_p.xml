<p>Since 2011, several new DAAs have been developed. Approval of the polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF) in January 2014 allowed for IFN-free therapy, which facilitated treatment eligibility [

In 2014–2015, the first fixed-dose combination of SOF and the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir (LDV) was approved, as well as the combination of omb-itasvir + paritaprevir + ritonavir ± dasabuvir (OBV/PTV/r ± DSV), which increased the rates of sustained virological response (SVR) [

 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20–23</xref>]. When looking at ritonavir in particular, a strong inhibition of CYP 3A4 affects the metabolism of various concomitant medications, leading to multiple clinical relevant DDIs. Finally, in 2016–2017, velpatasvir + sofosbuvir (VEL/SOF), elbasvir + grazoprevir (ELB/GRZ), glecaprevir + pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB), and velpatasvir + sofosbuvir + voxilaprevir (VEL/SOF/VOX) were marketed, which resulted in further improvements such as pangenotypic efficacy and the re-treatment of DAA failures [
