People who inject drugs (PWIDs) represent a relevant at-risk population for hepatitis C infection and transmission, yet treatment efficacy is often limited by poor adherence to clinical visits and drug intake. Our real world results showed that PWIDs with high risk of non-adherence to DAA therapy receiving their hepatitis C medication together with opioid substitution under the direct supervision of medical staff achieve excellent HCV cure rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec006"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause for cirrhosis, liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplantation and death worldwide. HCV treatment at an early stage of the disease can prevent the progression to cirrhosis and the development of liver-related complications, especially in patients infected at a young age[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Modern directly acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV facilitates virological cure at a favorable safety and drug tolerability profile in nearly all patients[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The latest pangenotypic treatment regimens induce excellent SVR (sustained virologic response) rates independent of HCV-genotype (GT), even in former difficult-to-treat populations including patients with cirrhosis, pretreated subjects and HIV-coinfected patients[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The consecutive decrease in HCV-associated HCC and decompensated cirrhosis lead to a recomposition of liver transplant waitlists with an increased donor organ availability for patients suffering from other entities of liver disease[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, in many countries of the world access to pangenotypic DAA therapy is still limited by the high treatment costs[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The 2015 Agenda for Sustainable Development committed to combating viral hepatitis and the WHO provided models for the elimination of HCV as a public health threat[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The suggested strategies in order to reduce HCV transmission include the overall achievement of blood and injection safety coverages of 100% and 90%, respectively, as well as a specific increase in syringe/needle exchange set supplies provided for PWIDs from 20 (2015) to 300 (2030) sets per patient per year. Furthermore, an increase in HCV diagnosis from &#x0003c;5% (2015) to 90% (2030) and in treatment uptake from &#x0003c;1% (2015) to 80% of all eligible patients (2030) are necessary to achieve the goal of HCV elimination. Additionally, HBV (hepatitis B virus) and HCV incidence shall be reduced by 90% from 6&#x02013;10 million (2015) until 2030[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The recent reduction or removal of reimbursement-restrictions concerning DAA therapy in Europe due to governmental programs and financial competition between pharmaceutical companies opened up new opportunities concerning the realization of these elimination targets[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One pangenotypic DAA combination that has recently become available in Europe is glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). Numerous phase III-studies have shown its excellent effectiveness and tolerability across various patient populations including HIV-coinfected patients, individuals with renal impairment or other relevant comorbidities as well as patients with a history of previous treatment failure[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Yet, real world data on G/P are still scarce, especially concerning PWIDs with and without ongoing injection drug use (IDU)[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, there are nearly no data concerning difficult-to-treat PWIDs who are reluctant to attend tertiary care centers and have a high risk of non-adherence to therapy. For these patients we used a specifically tailored approach to treat chronic hepatitis C and compared effectiveness of G/P in this difficult-to-treat PWID population with the outcome of patients treated in the standard setting of a hepatological center. While recent analyses of the German Hepatitis C-Registry showed promising results concerning the safety and effectiveness of G/P[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this is, to our knowledge, the first analysis of real world data on G/P from Austria. The results may serve as a basis for further HCV-microelimination strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>All DAA-na&#x000ef;ve patients with chronic hepatitis C, 18 years of age or older, who started treatment with G/P at our center (comprising a tertiary care hospital and a low-threshold facility in Vienna) between October 2017 and December 2018 were included in this analysis.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Setting of treatment</title><p>In Vienna there is a large population of about 6.500 PWIDs included in a nationwide OST program, receiving their OST on a daily or weekly basis at a pharmacy or a low-threshold facility. It is estimated that nearly one third of these patients suffer from chronic hepatitis C. According to our observations, a considerable percentage of PWIDs are reluctant to attend the outpatient clinic at a tertiary care hospital and hence cannot be treated there. We therefore built up a cooperation between the tertiary care center Wilhelminen Hospital Vienna and the Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien&#x02013;a low-threshold drug treatment facility in Vienna. A second outpatient hepatitis clinic was established at the Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien, where patients were seen by an experienced hepatologist (M.G.) and all equipment for pretreatment evaluation of patients including laboratory tests and Fibroscan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was available. This low-threshold facility combines HCV screening and treatment for PWIDs by offering an integrative management in a multidisciplinary setting that includes hepatological and psychiatric services as well as OST distribution and support by social workers.</p><p>In a high percentage of PWIDs on OST, especially in those with ongoing intravenous drug use, the team of physicians considered it to be unlikely for the patients to regularly ingest their HCV medication if a package for one month was handed to them for self-administration at home. To optimize adherence, this subgroup of PWIDs was treated according to our concept of &#x0201c;directly observed therapy&#x0201d; (DOT): Patients received their antiviral therapy together with OST under direct observation of a pharmacist, physician or nurse at a pharmacy or at the Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien on a once-daily basis (i.e. from Monday to Saturday and only the doses for Sunday were handed to the patient for self-administration at home) or, in a few cases, on a once-weekly, twice-weekly or thrice-weekly basis (&#x0201c;directly observed therapy group&#x0201d;).</p><p>Patients without a history of IDU and PWIDs in whom compliance was considered to be excellent were treated in the "standard setting" (SS) of the outpatient clinic of Wilhelminen Hospital Vienna: They received prescriptions for antiviral therapy every month and were only seen for routine laboratory tests at the outpatient clinic (&#x0201c;standard setting therapy group&#x0201d;).</p><p>The assignment to the different treatment groups (SS vs. DOT) was made by an interdisciplinary team consisting of an experienced hepatologist (M.G.), three addiction medicine specialists and the head nurse of the institution. The decision was based on the assumed likelihood of each individual patient to remain adherent to DAA-therapy if a monthly supply was handed to them for self-administration at home, as perceived by each member of the team. Every patient was seen by the entire team and the assignment to either of the treatment groups was made following a discussion among all team members. The frequency of visits to the drug distributing facility (daily vs. once, twice or three times a week) was based on the preceding frequency of OST dispensation: In order to maintain the previously well-established setting of directly observed OST-distribution, no changes were made in the preexisting drug distribution settings. The rationale behind this approach was that patients would not forget the ingestion of their OST, which is why simultaneous DAA and OST administration might ensure DAA adherence and hence HCV cure.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Pretreatment workup of patients</title><p>Pretreatment evaluation of patients was done at the outpatient clinic of Wilhelminen Hospital Vienna or Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien and included detailed history, physical examination, abdominal sonography, standard laboratory testing, measurement of the serum HCV-RNA level, assessment of HCV GT and stage of liver fibrosis. In PWIDs on OST treated according to the concept of directly observed therapy the socioeconomic status was characterized by recording social relationships, housing status, employment status and criminal record.</p><p>Serum HCV-RNA was measured using the COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche), with a lower limit of quantification of 15 IU/mL. The HCV GT and subtype were determined by use of the VERSANT HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay (Siemens). Prior to treatment, fibrosis stage was assessed by transient elastography using the Fibroscan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 502 Touch device with the M-probe (Echosens, Paris, France) and classified according to the METAVIR scoring system (F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = portal fibrosis without septa; F2 = portal fibrosis and few septa; F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis; F4 = cirrhosis). Cut-off values for liver stiffness (LS) were defined as 7.1 kPa for F &#x02265; 2, 9.5 kPa for F &#x02265; 3 and 12.5 kPa for F = 4[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

This patient showed up at the assigned pharmacy on a daily basis, yet we assume that the oral OST (as well as the antiviral medication) was not swallowed in order for the OST to be injected intravenously outside the pharmacy later. Unfortunately, due to very poor compliance to clinical visits HCV resistance testing could not be performed. All four patients without SVR12 reported ongoing IDU.

After the stepwise reduction of national reimbursement restrictions for DAAs, a high percentage of HCV-infected patients have been successfully treated in Vienna[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Yet, HCV prevalence among PWIDs remains high. Especially PWIDs with ongoing IDU represent a relevant source of continuing HCV transmission and are thus an important target population for national HCV-elimination programs.</p><p>Various studies have shown that DAA therapy for HCV is safe in PWIDs, even in the presence of ongoing IDU and/or OST, and leads to excellent cure rates that do not deviate much from patients without a history of IDU [<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We hypothesized that directly observed DAA therapy along with OST under the supervision of medical staff at local pharmacies or low-threshold facilities would further increase DAA adherence and improve HCV treatment outcomes in PWIDs on stable OST with or without ongoing IDU. The Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien, a low-threshold drug treatment facility in Vienna, offers integrative management combining HCV screening and therapy for PWIDs by providing hepatological, psychiatric and social support services as well as OST distribution in a multidisciplinary setting. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that the concept of DAA-DOT alongside OST is feasible in patients at high risk for non-adherence to therapy[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Based on these considerations and the available data, PWIDs on stable OST were included in this study and received directly observed HCV therapy with G/P. The included PWIDs showed excellent adherence to therapy with only a very limited number of scheduled DAA-ingestions being missed and, most importantly, an SVR rate of 98.6%&#x02014;which was in fact similar to the SVR rate of 98.6% achieved in patients with presumed &#x0201c;excellent compliance&#x0201d; with G/P self-administration. The observed excellent safety profile of G/P as well as the high SVR rates that did not relevantly deviate from the treatment outcomes in patients without a history of IDU go in line with literature and support the recommendations of broad access to HCV treatment [<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>From our results we conclude that directly observed DAA therapy along with OST might be an efficient strategy to achieve SVR rates comparable to patients without a history of IDU in PWIDs with high risk of non-adherence to DAA therapy even in the presence of ongoing IDU. This concept represents a relevant public health strategy in the attempt to eliminate hepatitis C in Austria.</p><p>In accordance with previous studies, SVR rates after treatment with G/P were excellent and no serious adverse events related to therapy occurred[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. During follow-up, only one HCV reinfection was detected which might be due to the integrated management of PWIDs at our low-threshold facilities in Vienna that offer counseling and syringe exchange services along with medical treatment for PWIDs[<xref rid="pone.0229239.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>We present results of a monocenter study including part of the Austrian PWIDs population: n = 74 PWIDs with suspected poor compliance out of about 6.500 PWIDs who live in Vienna and are included in the nationwide OST program were treated according to the DOT-concept. The outcome of these patients was compared to a cohort of patients with presumed excellent compliance (including 11 patients on OST) who were treated according to the SS of HCV care. The specific characterization of the real-world treatment outcome of G/P in difficult-to-treat PWIDs with and without ongoing IDU using the setting of DAA-DOT alongside OST represents the major strength of this study. Yet, the assignment of PWIDs to either DAA self-administration or to DOT with G/P at an OST distribution facility was based on subjective assessment of presumed compliance by the study physicians and therefore poses a potential limitation. Another limitation is that some patients did not attend their OST distribution facility on a daily basis but only once, twice or thrice a week and received their corresponding OST and DAA doses for interim self-administration, according to the subjective estimation of the study staff assessing the patients&#x02019; individual risk for non-adherence to therapy. Overall, this study focuses on PWIDs with an unfavorable prognosis assumed by ongoing IDU, previous imprisonment and unstable socioeconomic factors. The inclusion in an OST program was considered a positive prognostic factor and was used as a connecting point for HCV treatment. Aside from this PWIDs population that is already linked to care, a relevant number of PWIDs in Vienna perform IDU and are not included in an OST program, most of whom would not show compliant behavior concerning medical treatment. HCV infected patients belonging to this subgroup of "chaotic PWIDs" currently cannot be treated because a regular ingestion of drugs cannot be achieved.</p><p>In order to address these especially difficult to treat patients, we are planning to introduce a peer-based HCV screening and treatment program for PWIDs in Vienna. The project shall focus on PWIDs who have successfully been cured from HCV or are currently on treatment bringing their friends along to the diagnostic facility and thereby linking HCV infected PWIDs to treatment who would otherwise not attend a medical facility.</p><p>To enhance the relevance of our results, further studies including multicenter studies investigating a broader variety of patients are needed. Yet, our results add important and encouraging information to the still scarcely available real-life data on HCV therapy in PWIDs with ongoing IDU.</p><p>In conclusion, our results underline the safety and the excellent efficacy of G/P in a large real world cohort of PWIDs with mostly ongoing IDU. The concept of tailored HCV therapy using DOT with DAA alongside OST may represent a key measure in order to contribute to the HCV elimination target in difficult-to-treat PWIDs on OST with a high risk of non-adherence to DAA therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0229239.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0229239.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAA</term><def><p>directly acting antivirals</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOT</term><def><p>directly observed therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FU</term><def><p>follow-up</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>G/P</term><def><p>glecaprevir/pibrentasvir</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GT</term><def><p>genotype</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBV</term><def><p>hepatitis B virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCC</term><def><p>hepatocellular carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCV</term><def><p>hepatitis C virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDU</term><def><p>injection drug use</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p>interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LS</term><def><p>liver stiffness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mITT</term><def><p>modified intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OST</term><def><p>opioid substitution therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PWIDs</term><def><p>people who inject drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RNA</term><def><p>ribonucleic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SS</term><def><p>standard setting</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SVR</term><def><p>sustained virologic response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0229239.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Polaris Observatory HCV Collaborators</collab>. <article-title>Global prevalence and genotype distribution of hepatitis C virus infection in 2015: a modelling study</article-title>. <source>Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol</source>. <year>2017</year>;<volume>2</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>161</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>76</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S2468-1253(16)30181-9</pub-id>
