 <xref rid="pone.0229239.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The suggested strategies in order to reduce HCV transmission include the overall achievement of blood and injection safety coverages of 100% and 90%, respectively, as well as a specific increase in syringe/needle exchange set supplies provided for PWIDs from 20 (2015) to 300 (2030) sets per patient per year. Furthermore, an increase in HCV diagnosis from &lt;5% (2015) to 90% (2030) and in treatment uptake from &lt;1% (2015) to 80% of all eligible patients (2030) are necessary to achieve the goal of HCV elimination. Additionally, HBV (hepatitis B virus) and HCV incidence shall be reduced by 90% from 6–10 million (2015) until 2030[
