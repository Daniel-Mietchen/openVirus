<p>Yet, real world data on G/P are still scarce, especially concerning PWIDs with and without ongoing injection drug use (IDU)[

Furthermore, there are nearly no data concerning difficult-to-treat PWIDs who are reluctant to attend tertiary care centers and have a high risk of non-adherence to therapy. For these patients we used a specifically tailored approach to treat chronic hepatitis C and compared effectiveness of G/P in this difficult-to-treat PWID population with the outcome of patients treated in the standard setting of a hepatological center. While recent analyses of the German Hepatitis C-Registry showed promising results concerning the safety and effectiveness of G/P[
 <xref rid="pone.0229239.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this is, to our knowledge, the first analysis of real world data on G/P from Austria. The results may serve as a basis for further HCV-microelimination strategies.
