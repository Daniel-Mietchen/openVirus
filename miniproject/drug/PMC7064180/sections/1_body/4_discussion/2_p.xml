<p>Various studies have shown that DAA therapy for HCV is safe in PWIDs, even in the presence of ongoing IDU and/or OST, and leads to excellent cure rates that do not deviate much from patients without a history of IDU [

We hypothesized that directly observed DAA therapy along with OST under the supervision of medical staff at local pharmacies or low-threshold facilities would further increase DAA adherence and improve HCV treatment outcomes in PWIDs on stable OST with or without ongoing IDU. The Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien, a low-threshold drug treatment facility in Vienna, offers integrative management combining HCV screening and therapy for PWIDs by providing hepatological, psychiatric and social support services as well as OST distribution in a multidisciplinary setting. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that the concept of DAA-DOT alongside OST is feasible in patients at high risk for non-adherence to therapy[

Based on these considerations and the available data, PWIDs on stable OST were included in this study and received directly observed HCV therapy with G/P. The included PWIDs showed excellent adherence to therapy with only a very limited number of scheduled DAA-ingestions being missed and, most importantly, an SVR rate of 98.6%—which was in fact similar to the SVR rate of 98.6% achieved in patients with presumed “excellent compliance” with G/P self-administration. The observed excellent safety profile of G/P as well as the high SVR rates that did not relevantly deviate from the treatment outcomes in patients without a history of IDU go in line with literature and support the recommendations of broad access to HCV treatment [
