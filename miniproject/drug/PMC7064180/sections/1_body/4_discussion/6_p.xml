<p>In order to address these especially difficult to treat patients, we are planning to introduce a peer-based HCV screening and treatment program for PWIDs in Vienna. The project shall focus on PWIDs who have successfully been cured from HCV or are currently on treatment bringing their friends along to the diagnostic facility and thereby linking HCV infected PWIDs to treatment who would otherwise not attend a medical facility.</p>
