<p>In Vienna there is a large population of about 6.500 PWIDs included in a nationwide OST program, receiving their OST on a daily or weekly basis at a pharmacy or a low-threshold facility. It is estimated that nearly one third of these patients suffer from chronic hepatitis C. According to our observations, a considerable percentage of PWIDs are reluctant to attend the outpatient clinic at a tertiary care hospital and hence cannot be treated there. We therefore built up a cooperation between the tertiary care center Wilhelminen Hospital Vienna and the Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien–a low-threshold drug treatment facility in Vienna. A second outpatient hepatitis clinic was established at the Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien, where patients were seen by an experienced hepatologist (M.G.) and all equipment for pretreatment evaluation of patients including laboratory tests and Fibroscan
 <sup>®</sup> was available. This low-threshold facility combines HCV screening and treatment for PWIDs by offering an integrative management in a multidisciplinary setting that includes hepatological and psychiatric services as well as OST distribution and support by social workers.
