<p>Patient characteristics are shown as median (IQR, interquartile range) for continuous variables or numbers (and percentage) of a certain characteristic for categorical variables. P-values were calculated using Studentâ€™s t-test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-test or Chi-Squared test, depending on the type of variable and the presence of normal distribution. In the primary efficacy analyses, two-sided 95% exact confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. The programs RStudio 1.0.44 for Windows and IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 25 for Mac were used for statistical analyses.</p>
