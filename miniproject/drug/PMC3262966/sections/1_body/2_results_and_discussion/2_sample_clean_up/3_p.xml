<p>The PBA material has multiple interaction mechanisms. The strongest is the covalent binding at high pH with 
 <italic>cis</italic>-diol groups, as present in ribavirin. Other mechanisms include van der Waals interaction, π–π bonding and ionic interaction. Therefore, the results using this type of material are hard to predict. Ribavirin, oseltamivir, amantadine, rimantadine and arbidol are retained by the PBA cartridge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate do not interact with the PBA material and elute during application of the extract and the washing procedure. It stands out that both compounds containing a carboxylic acid moiety are left unretained by the PBA material. No explanation was found for this observation.
