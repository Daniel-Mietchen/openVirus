<p>From these results it is concluded that a combination of SPE materials is needed to obtain a satisfactory clean-up for all antiviral drugs included in this study. A tandem SPE procedure was developed, a schematic of which is given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. All compounds except ribavirin were separated from matrix constituents by retaining them on a Strata-X C cartridge. The breakthrough of this cartridge, containing ribavirin, was basified, centrifuged and applied onto a PBA cartridge to retain ribavirin in order to separate this drug from matrix constituents as well. Eventually, the eluents of both cartridges were combined and the solvent was evaporated. Finally, the residue was redissolved in 250 μL of water. The matrix effects of the optimised clean-up procedure were determined using the C
 <sub>18</sub> and the column-switch system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) and the recovery of the sample preparation procedure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) was determined.
