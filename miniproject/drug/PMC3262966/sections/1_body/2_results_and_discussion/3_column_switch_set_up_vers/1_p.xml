<p>As an alternative to the use of the column-switch set-up, the use of two individual injections on the RP and the Hypercarb column was tested. This solely affects the results for zanamivir and ribavirin, because the RP system remains as it is in the column-switch system. The matrix effects of zanamivir and ribavirin were evaluated after injection of a cleaned extract on the Hypercarb column and were both found to be 39%. It is observed that the matrix effects for zanamivir using injection on solely the Hypercarb column are increased compared to the column-switch set-up. It is concluded that additional matrix interferences are removed in the first phase of the column switch set-up, which is advantageous for the analysis of zanamivir. For ribavirin no statistically significant differences were observed and thus it is concluded that the column-switch system is advantageous in terms of the removal of matrix effects and the analysis time (20 min instead of 40 min). Therefore, the use of the column-switching system is preferred.</p>
