<p>Stationary phases using three different interaction mechanisms were tested to obtain sufficient separation power and separate the antiviral drugs from matrix constituents. Therefore, a retention factor of at least 2 should be obtained. The use of zic-HILIC was reported by Chan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] for the screening analysis of some antiviral drugs. However, using zic-HILIC no retention was obtained for arbidol, the most non-polar compound we studied and which was not included in the screening method reported by Chan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Only slight improvement in the retention time (RT) was made by protonating arbidol (p
