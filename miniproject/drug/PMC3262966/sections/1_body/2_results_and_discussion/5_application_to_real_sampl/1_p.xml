<p>Two amantadine-affected muscle samples were analysed using the developed method. The results were 4.9 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> for the poultry muscle and 15.3 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> for the turkey muscle sample. These levels are in good agreement with the indicated amantadine concentration, being approximately 4 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> for the poultry muscle and 8–25 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> for the turkey muscle. From this it is concluded that the developed method is applicable to real muscle samples.
