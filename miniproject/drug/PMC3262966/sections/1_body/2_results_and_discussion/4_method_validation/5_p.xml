<p>During the method development some critical steps were identified. Firstly the pH values of the solvents used during the SPE clean-up procedure are critical. The acidic methanol should be at pH ≤ 2 to retain zanamivir on the Strata-X C material and the alkaline MeOH should be at least pH 12 for the elution of amantadine and rimantadine. Incorrect pH results in a severe decrease of the recovery. Secondly, it was found critical to centrifuge the basified breakthrough of the Strata-X C cartridge before applying it onto the PBA cartridge to prevent clogging. For ruggedness testing, three slight deviations to the procedure that might occur in practice were specifically tested: (1) extraction for 30 min instead of 15, (2) dry the PBA cartridges by applying vacuum for 1 min after applying the extract and after washing the cartridge and (3) evaporation of the solvent at 55 °C instead of 50 °C. The duplicates analysed by incorporating these deviations in the method showed good trueness and acceptable duplicates, indicating that the tested processes are robust.</p>
