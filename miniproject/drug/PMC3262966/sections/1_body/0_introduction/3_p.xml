<p>To be able to detect extra-label use of antiviral drugs, analytical methods are needed that not only detect the presence of antiviral drugs in poultry muscle, but are also able to quantify the concentration present and to confirm the identity of the compound present at levels as low as reasonably possible. Single-residue methods for the quantitative analysis of antiviral drugs in biological matrices using mass spectrometry have been published for zanamivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], ribavirin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], oseltamivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (some of them including oseltamivir carboxylate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), oseltamivir carboxylate only [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], amandatine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], some of them including rimantadine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and arbidol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Recently, Chan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] reported a multi-compound method for the analysis of antiviral drugs in poultry muscle using zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (zic-HILIC) in combination with mass spectrometric detection. However, this method is suitable for screening purposes only and it is limited to the analysis of basic and amphoteric antiviral drugs.
