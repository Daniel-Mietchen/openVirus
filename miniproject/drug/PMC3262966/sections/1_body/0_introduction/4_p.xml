<p>For efficient control of antiviral drug usage, a quantitative confirmatory multi-method is needed that is adequate for analysis of the antiviral drugs that are applied in poultry breeding including zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir including its active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, rimantadine and arbidol. The main difficulty in the development of a multi-method for the analysis of antiviral drugs is their broad range of physical and chemical properties. The antiviral drugs include the extremely polar zanamivir and ribavirin, whereas arbidol is reasonably non-polar. Furthermore, the selection includes basic, amphoteric and neutral drugs.</p>
