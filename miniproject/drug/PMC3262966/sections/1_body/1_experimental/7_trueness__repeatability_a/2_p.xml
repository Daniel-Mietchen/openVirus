<p>The repeatability and within-lab reproducibility were calculated using single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). According to 2002/657/EC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] the relative within-laboratory reproducibility (RSD
 <sub>RL</sub>) and relative repeatability (RSD
 <sub>r</sub>) are considered acceptable if they are below the value calculated from the Horwitz equation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and two thirds of that value, respectively (i.e. below 31.7% and 21.1%, respectively, at a validation level of 10 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). Thompson [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], however, demonstrated that the Horwitz equation is not applicable to the lower concentration range (&lt;120 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) and suggested a complementary model. On the basis of this model the RSD
 <sub>RL</sub> and RSD
 <sub>r</sub> are acceptable if they are below 22% and 14.7%, respectively. The latter, more stringent criteria were adopted for this validation study. It is stated that because different poultry muscle samples were used within 1 day, the repeatability is not the pure repeatability as stated in 2002/657/EC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, using different poultry muscle samples within 1 day provides a better understanding of the between-sample variation and the validation better reflects a routine analysis situation.
