<p>On each of the 3 days seven different blank poultry muscle samples were selected and analysed as such and spiked at 5, 10 and 15 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>. For each sample the level of the individual antiviral drugs was calculated using the calibration line constructed on the same day. The trueness was calculated for each level by dividing the overall average calculated concentration by the nominal concentration. According to 2002/657/EC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] the trueness at the selected validation levels should be between 80 and 110%.
