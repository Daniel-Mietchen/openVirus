<p>A Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA) Strata-X C 200 mg/6 mL strong cation exchange SPE cartridge was conditioned with 4 mL 0.5 v/v % FA in MeOH, pH 2. A clean PP centrifuge tube was placed under the Strata-X C cartridge before the acidified sample extract, followed by 1 mL of MeOH, pH 2, was applied onto the cartridge. The total breakthrough was collected in the PP centrifuge tube (fraction A). After addition of 200 μL of 25% ammonia, fraction A was centrifuged (3,600 
 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min) and set aside. The Strata-X C cartridge was washed with 4 mL of MeOH, pH 2. A clean PP centrifuge tube was placed under the SPE cartridge and the antiviral compounds were eluted from the cartridge using 4 mL 0.75 v/v % ammonia in MeOH, pH 12, which was collected in the PP centrifuge tube (fraction B). An Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) Bond elute phenylboronic acid (PBA) 100 mg/3 mL SPE cartridge was conditioned with 2 mL 0.5 v/v % FA in H
 <sub>2</sub>O, pH 2, followed by 4 mL MeOH, pH 12. The basified fraction A was applied onto the PBA cartridge, which was subsequently washed with 4 mL MeOH, pH 12. The PP centrifuge tube containing fraction B was placed under the PBA cartridge and ribavirin was eluted from the cartridge using 4 mL MeOH, pH 2, which was combined with fraction B. The solvent of the combined fractions was evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream at 50 °C until dry. The residue was redissolved in 250 μL water and transferred into a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) autosampler vial.
