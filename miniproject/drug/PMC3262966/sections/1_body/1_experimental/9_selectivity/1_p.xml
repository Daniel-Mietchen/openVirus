<p>The selectivity of the method was studied on the basis of a practical and a theoretical study. Firstly, the 21 analysed blank samples were checked for interferences at the retention times corresponding to the antiviral drugs. Secondly, databases were searched for compounds having a molecular mass equal to the antiviral drugs that could possibly be present in poultry muscle samples. Standard solutions of 100 μg L
 <sup>−1</sup> of androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD), 5-hydroxyflunixin and tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), indicated as possibly interfering compounds, were analysed using the developed method. The resulting chromatograms were checked for interferences at the retention times corresponding to the antiviral drugs.
