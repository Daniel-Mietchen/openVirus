<p>During method development recovery and matrix effects were monitored. Recovery was calculated by dividing the signal of a blank poultry sample with addition of the compounds before sample clean-up (matrix-matched standard, MMS) by the signal of a blank poultry muscle sample with addition of an equivalent amount of the compounds, based upon 100% recovery, after sample clean-up (matrix-matched recovery standard, MMRS). The matrix effect was calculated by dividing the signal of the MMRS by the signal of a standard solution in water at equivalent concentration. No matrix effects are present if the result of this calculation is 100%. If the result is below 100%, suppression occurs and if the result is above 100%, signal enhancement occurs.</p>
