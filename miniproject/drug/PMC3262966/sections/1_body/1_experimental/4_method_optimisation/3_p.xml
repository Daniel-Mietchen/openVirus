<p>SPE using strong cation exchange and PBA were tested for sample clean-up. A 50 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> spiked methanolic sample extract was acidified and applied onto a Strata-X C cartridge. The breakthrough during application and washing were collected separately. These and the eluent were analysed using the LC–MS/MS system. The same procedure was followed for the PBA cartridges, but then the spiked methanolic extract was basified prior to application.
