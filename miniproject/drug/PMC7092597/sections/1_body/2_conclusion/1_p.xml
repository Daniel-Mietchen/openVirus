<p id="Par18">We demonstrated the antiviral activity of PoGNP in comparison with non-porous gold and silver nanoparticles in this study. Nanoparticle morphology and interaction with IAV was observed by TEM analysis and the interaction between PoGNP and HA was further proven by coprecipitation during centrifugation. Precipitation of PoGNP-treated IAVs showed lower real-time Cq values, indicating that more viruses precipitated with nanoparticles than were free in the supernatant. Furthermore, PoGNP showed more effective inhibition of viral infection compared with the non-porous sGNP and AgNP because of its extensive surface area. We suggested that the viral inhibition mechanism was due to blocking of viral attachment associated with membrane fusion, which ensued from the cleavage of disulfide bonds in HA. The results indicate that the disulfide bonds in HA could be an effective antiviral target, presenting possible development of antiviral vaccines for various IV strains. Likewise, we suggest that PoGNP could be applied to other enveloped viruses that have considerable spike proteins on the surface, such as human immunodeficiency virus or coronavirus, by cleaving disulfide bonds in their spike proteins. In addition, PoGNP has numerous electromagnetic hot spots compared to non-porous gold and silver nanoparticles, and the application of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) should be considered for future analysis. The findings of this study imply that a facile detection of IAV can be achieved by developing PoGNP as a multiplatform for detection and inactivation of the virus.</p>
