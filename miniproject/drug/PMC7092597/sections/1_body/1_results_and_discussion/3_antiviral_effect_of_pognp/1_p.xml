<p id="Par13">To observe the antiviral effect of nanoparticles, H1N1 virus was exposed to each nanoparticle suspension for 10 min and 60 min prior to infection of the MDCK cells. The antiviral effect of the nanoparticles was determined by WST-1 cytotoxicity assay by observing the optical density of treated cells at 450 nm. Compared with the other nanoparticles, PoGNP showed much higher antiviral activity on H1N1 virus, whereas AgNP showed only minor antiviral activity over 0.1 mg/mL AgNP. 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP successfully inactivated H1N1 virus after exposure for 60 min. In contrast, sGNP had no antiviral effect regardless of its concentration or exposure time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Comparing PoGNP with sGNP, the difference in nanoparticle antiviral activity is the result of differences in their specific surface areas despite similar diameters; each nanoframe of PoGNP behaved as a single reactant for disulfide bonds that could interact with HA. AgNP was able to agglomerate on viral HA and had extensive specific surface area for interaction compared with sGNP due to its small size; however, PoGNP showed higher inactivation of the virus at 0.2 mg/mL. PoGNP’s superior virus inactivation ability compared with AgNP and sGNP is due to both its stability under saline conditions and its high affinity for HA. The antiviral effectiveness of AgNP is restricted because AgNP aggregated in the culture media at higher concentration and it should only be treated at concentrations lower than 0.1 mg/mL due to toxicity concerns. As observed by lower attraction of sGNP to viral HA in the binding efficiency test with centrifugation, sGNP exhibited lower antiviral activity, as expected. Indeed, the inactivation of H1N1 virus by sGNP was much lower than that of PoGNP, although sGNP also exhibited affinity for HA at higher concentration. This result endorsed the fact that inactivation of H1N1 virus was caused by the cleavage of disulfide bonds ensuing from the influence of metallic nanoparticles because the relatively flat surface of sGNP made contact with the disulfide bridge difficult in contrast to PoGNP’s rough surface.
