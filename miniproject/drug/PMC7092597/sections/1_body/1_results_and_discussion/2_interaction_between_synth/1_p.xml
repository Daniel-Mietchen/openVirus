<p id="Par12">Interaction between the prepared nanoparticles and IAV HA was evaluated, as we hypothesized inactivation of IAV to be induced by cleaving disulfide bonds required for viral membrane fusion with the host cell. TEM analysis was first conducted for a simple confirmation of the interaction between the virus and the nanoparticles. IAV suspension was incubated with 2 × 10
 <sup>−1</sup> mg/mL of nanoparticles for 10 min, and then the mixtures were prepared for TEM analysis. However, interaction was difficult to observe in the TEM images with larger NPs such as PoGNP and sGNP. On the other hand, AgNP agglomerated on the viral surface as expected, since the small size of AgNP facilitated migration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Another technique was considered to prove the affinity between HA and the larger sGNPs. As the isolation of IAV requires ultracentrifugation over 20,000

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] or gradient centrifugation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], we centrifuged the samples at 6000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to monitor whether H3N2 precipitated with the nanoparticles. We assumed that the nanoparticle-treated H3N2 virus would precipitate with the nanoparticles in contrast to the H3N2 virus sample alone. Definitively, the real-time cycle quantification (C
 <sub>q</sub>) value of PoGNP-treated H3N2 virus in redispersed precipitate solution was much lower than that in the supernatant, indicating that H3N2 virus could interact with PoGNP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In addition, PoGNP attracted more H3N2 virus than sGNP at lower concentration according to the real-time C
 <sub>q</sub> values of precipitated samples, which indicated that PoGNP had much higher affinity for HA compared with sGNP. The difference in attraction resulted from their surface structure; the foam-shaped porous outer surface of PoGNP created more surface area for interaction with HA than the sGNP surface.
