<p id="Par16">We determined that viral infection was suppressed by obstructing viral attachment, therefore we further experimented to prove that the disulfide bonds in HA have important role in viral infection. To support the hypothesis, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reduction assay (Ellman’s assay) was proposed to quantify the reduced disulfide bonds in virus hemagglutinin which had been in contact with 0.2 mg/mL of PoGNP, sGNP and AgNP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). As the higher sulfhydryl group concentration in the virus means the more reduction of disulfide bond has occurred, Ellman’s assay was considered as a valid method for proving relationship between viral disulfide bond reduction and its attenuated infectivity. As described in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, absorbance at 412 nm (A
 <sub>412</sub>) of influenza virus that was exposed to 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP showed higher A
 <sub>412</sub> than sGNP and AgNP counterpart at the same concentration, indicating that PoGNP have higher affinity to the disulfide bonds in HA. Despite the size of PoGNP slightly larger than sGNP, PoGNP’s higher relative surface area made a big difference in disulfide bond reduction while AgNP still displayed reductive reaction on the bonds in HA. TCEP was chosen as a positive control group of disulfide bond reducing agent since TCEP structure do not have any disulfide bond after reduced the S–S bond in HA, and thus it has little effect on DTNB reduction after reacting with disulfide bonds in HA.
