<p id="Par10">The morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles was observed by TEM and their average size was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. TEM images of synthesized PoGNP exhibited rough surfaces with 6 nm-sized nanosphere bundles, composing 150 nm sized spherical structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) whereas sGNP and AgNP exhibited narrow monodispersed spherical structures with smooth surfaces (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, c, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Cumulative size of PoGNP, AgNP, and sGNP was 154.24 ± 37.05 nm, 140.23 ± 25.10 nm and 20.52 ± 4.49 nm, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Zeta potential of the formulated PoGNP was rather neutral charge (− 3.5133 ± 1.1548 mV), compared to sGNP (− 12.4733 ± 1.1243 mV) and AgNP (− 25.6167 ± 0.9810 mV).
