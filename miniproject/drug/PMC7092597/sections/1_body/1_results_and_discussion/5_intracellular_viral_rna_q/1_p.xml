<p id="Par15">We had inferred the inactivation mechanism of the virus as the cleavage of disulfide bonds, because the high affinity of the disulfide-gold interaction and abundant presence of disulfide bonds in HA would expedite inhibition by PoGNP. The viral inhibition mechanism of PoGNP was then identified by quantitative analysis of intracellular viral RNA from MDCK cells infected with nanoparticle-treated viruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). MDCK cells were infected with PoGNP-treated H3N2 virus for 24 h and the cells were lysed with Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, followed by calculation of logEID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL values by standard EID curve (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). PoGNP-treated H3N2 virus showed lower intracellular viral RNA levels indicating that the amount of IAV in the endosome of MDCK cells was clearly reduced in the nanoparticle-treated samples. Also, the amount of intracellular viral RNA was clearly influenced by the exposure time. The gene content level of viral RNA in the host cells was higher for viruses treated for 10 min compared with 60 min. Intracellular viral RNA quantification data corresponded well with the MDCK cell viability test results, revealing that the antiviral activity of PoGNP was affected by time and concentration, especially 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP was effective after exposure for 10 min. Furthermore, the result also confirmed that PoGNP blocked viral infection by inhibiting viral entry.
