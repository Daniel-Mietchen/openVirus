<p id="Par24">300 μL aliquots of H3N2 virus suspension were exposed to 2 × 10
 <sup>−1</sup> mg/mL to 6.25 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mg/mL of nanoparticle (PoGNP and sGNP) solution and incubated at RT for 1 h. Subsequently, the incubated samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to separate the virus-bound nanoparticles from the supernatant solutions. The supernatants were transferred to other test tubes while the precipitates were dispersed in DPBS. Thereafter, real-time RT-PCR analysis was conducted on the prepared solutions to determine the binding efficiency of the nanoparticles.
