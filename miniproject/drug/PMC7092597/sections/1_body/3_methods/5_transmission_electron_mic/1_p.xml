<p id="Par29">30 μL of the nanoparticle and virus suspension mixtures, as previously described in cytotoxicity assay part, were incubated at RT for 10 and 60 min and then transferred by pipette to carbon-coated copper TEM grids (400 mesh). After 10 min at RT, the liquid was blotted with filter paper and a droplet of 3 wt% PTA solution was loaded onto the grid for negative staining. The excess PTA solution was blotted with filter paper after 10–40 s, followed by washing 2× with a droplet of deionized water, and the grid was dried for 4 h prior to analysis. TEM images were obtained with a JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).</p>
