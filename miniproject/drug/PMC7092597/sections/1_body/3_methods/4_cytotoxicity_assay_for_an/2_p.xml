<p id="Par26">In order to evaluate the antiviral activity of the nanoparticles, various nanoparticle concentrations (3.125 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> mg/mL to 2 × 10
 <sup>−1</sup> mg/mL of PoGNP, sGNP, and AgNP) with twofold serial dilutions and 300 μL aliquots of IAVs (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2) were prepared. 75 μL of each nanoparticle solution was added to the virus aliquots, for a final nanoparticle concentration of 6.25 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mg/mL to 2 × 10
 <sup>−1</sup> mg/mL. Samples were incubated at RT for 10 min and 60 min, with vortex mixing every 10 min. In the meantime, the MDCK cells were washed 3× with 100 μL of PBS. Then 100 μL aliquots of nanoparticle-treated IAV samples were added to each well and incubated for an additional 1 h. The nanoparticle-treated IAVs were then removed, cells were rinsed once with PBS, and then incubated for an additional 72 h with 200 μL of fresh DMEM.
