<p id="Par25">The water-soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (WST-1) assay was performed to determine the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticle-treated IAVs on MDCK cells using the Ez-cytox cell viability assay kit (Daeil Lab Service). Twenty-four hours prior to the infection experiment, 2.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were seeded into 96-well plates with 100 μL of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing DMEM.
