<p id="Par31">10 mM of DTNB in 10% ethanol solution and 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was prepared. Then 50 μL of 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP, sGNP and AgNP aliquot was mixed with 50 μL of H3N2 virus and left for 60 min at RT. 100 μL of 1 mM DTNB solution was set as a negative control for the signal, and 100 μL of H3N2 virus suspension reacted with 10 mM TCEP for 60 min was prepared as a positive control. Subsequently, 20 μL of 10 mM DTNB solution was added to the mixture. Centrifugation of reactant was followed to remove nanoparticles in the mixture. Next, absorbance at 412 nm (A
 <sub>412</sub>) was observed using the UV–Vis SpectraMax 190 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA).
