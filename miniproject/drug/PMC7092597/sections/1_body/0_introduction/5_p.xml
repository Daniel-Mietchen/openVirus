<p id="Par8">In the present study, influenza A virus (IAV) was treated with PoGNP to show that PoGNP inactivates the virus (SchemeÂ 
 <xref rid="Sch1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To visualize this inactivation ability, the amount of post-infection intracellular viral RNA was measured after nanoparticle treatment. In addition, various IV strains, including H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2, were analyzed to confirm the inhibition efficacy of PoGNP regardless of IAV mutation.
