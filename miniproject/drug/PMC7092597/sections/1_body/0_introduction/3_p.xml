<p id="Par6">Meanwhile, inorganic metals such as gold and silver have been investigated for their ability to neutralize HA activity by cleaving HA disulfide bonds using their strong affinity for gold and silver. Especially, it has been reported that the silver-thiol interaction between HA disulfide bonds and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) could inhibit IV infection by cleaving disulfide bonds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, various modifications of noble metallic nanoparticles have been tested to mitigate viral infection, i.e., tannic acid-modified silver nanoparticle [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] multivalent gold nanoparticles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and gallic acid-functionalized gold nanoparticle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These noble metal-based nanoparticles suppressed viral infection by blocking viral entry to the host cell.
