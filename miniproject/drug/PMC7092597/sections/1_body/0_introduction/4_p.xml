<p id="Par7">Here, for an improved antiviral treatment agent using metallic nanoparticles, we introduced the porous gold nanoparticle (PoGNP) for cleaving disulfide bonds. PoGNPs permit a facile fabrication process that does not require additional heat or surfactant, while Ag-based nanoparticles should be modified with a capping agent for stabilization under in vitro conditions and to reduce their cytotoxicity. In addition, PoGNPs possess extensive surface area due to their unique nanobundled structure [

Moreover, PoGNPs are expected to have high affinity for disulfide bonds due to gold-disulfide bond formation and their extensive surface area can effectively inactivate the IV by cleaving disulfide bonds, which blocks membrane fusion and viral entry to the host cell.
