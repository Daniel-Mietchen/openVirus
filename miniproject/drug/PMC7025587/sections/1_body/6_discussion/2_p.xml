<p>As for the follow-up of patients, the application of DAAs therapies is so recent that there are still not many long-term trial data available to evaluate whether DAAs improve the morbidity and mortality of SVR patients. The patients should be periodically monitored and the follow-up should include the confirm of viral negativity, and the overall assessment of liver disease, particularly in thalassemia and sickle cell disease patients who have an additional risk factor caused by the iron overload. More studies should be performed to evaluate whether the risk of carcinoma is reduced and progressively declined after SVR, but it is still early to make an assessment.</p>
