<p>All patients were treated with a cycle (12 weeks) of DAAs, only two Thalassemia major patients were treated for other 12 weeks because they were non-responder to the therapy. No patient required dose reduction or termination of antiviral treatment, and 32/34 patients (94%) reached SVR12 with negative follow up. Two thalassemia major patients with severe comorbidities and treated for 24 weeks, were not responder with infection relapse after 1 month. One of them had hepatocellular carcinoma, and the other had severe dilatation and restrictive cardiomyopathy with liver from stasi. Moreover, a SCD patient died of cholestasis and severe liver failure at 6 months from the end of 12 weeks DAAs therapy without viral recurrence. Already before the treatment the patient had significant hepatic impairment with a high degree of fibrosis (F4), a high fibroscan value 34.8 KPa, liver T2
 <sup>*</sup> 13 ms, and normal serum ferritin value (187 ng/mL). To our knowledge the patient did not have a primary sclerosing cholangitis.
