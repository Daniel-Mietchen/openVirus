<p>HCV is a heterogeneous virus with at least seven genotypes up to now identified. Each genotype includes multiple subtypes which differ to one another from 31 to 33% over the whole viral genome (Petruzziello et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This genetic heterogeneity influences the efficacy of the antiviral therapy as response rate, since it must be specific for different viral strains as concerns type and duration of treatment. Detailed knowledge of HCV genotype has a great clinical relevance since the efficacy of antiviral therapies is greatly influenced by genotypes and subtypes distribution. HCV genotypes are geographically heterogeneous and are characterized by “epidemic subtypes,” such as 1a, 1b, 2a, and 3a in high income countries and the “endemic” strains in restricted areas, such as West Africa, Southern Asia, Central Africa, and Southeastern Asia (Petruzziello et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Regardless to Europe, genotype 1 is the most frequent and seems to be equally distributed among European countries (between 50 and 70%) followed by the genotype 3 (between 20 and 29%). About 8.9% of genotype 2 is more frequent in Western Europe, while about 4.9 and 5.8% of genotype 4 may be observed in Central and Western Europe, respectively (Petruzziello et al.,
