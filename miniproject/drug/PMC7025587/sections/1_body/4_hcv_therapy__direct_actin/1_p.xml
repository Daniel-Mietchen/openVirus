<p>In 2011 the development of DAAs gave a breakthrough to the treatment of patients with chronic HCV. The therapy with DAAs was initially performed together with PEG-INF plus RBV for patients with genotype 1 and this led to an increase in SVR to about 70%. The limitation of these treatments consisted of the combination with PEG-INF plus RBV. In 2013, simeprevir and sofosbuvir were introduced. These two drugs were proposed to treat genotype 1 infections with no interferon, and in October 2014 the FDA approved the combination ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to manage HCV genotype 1. Several clinical trials demonstrated a SVR ranging from 94 to 97% after 12 weeks in previously treated and untreated patients, respectively (Afdhal et al.,
