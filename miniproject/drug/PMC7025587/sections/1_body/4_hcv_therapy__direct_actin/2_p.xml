<p>At first the indication of DAAs administration were for patients with advanced cirrhosis or needing liver transplantation over time, while recently all regimens have been approved to treat patients with various HCV genotypes, stages of liver disease, and comorbidities. Recent outcomes from clinical trials showed a SVR higher than 95% when LDV/SOF (treatment from 8 to 12 weeks) was used to treat HCV genotypes 1 and 4, including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection and cirrhosis (Moon et al.,

The development in recent years of highly effective and increasingly selective DAAs toward different viral genotypes has led to a real revolution in the HCV eradication for patients with thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies, leading to negative viremia and SVR between 90 and 98% (Materazzi et al.,
