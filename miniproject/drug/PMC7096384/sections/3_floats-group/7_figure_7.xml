  <p>The effect of CATH-B1 on HA and NA activity. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> NA activity of H1N1/PR8 was directly measured using MUNANA substrate in presence or absence of CATH-B1. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Desialylated N-glycans of fetuin were detected using HRP-conjugated ECA lectins, after incubation with H1N1/PR8 in presence or absence of CATH-B1. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of two independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. *
