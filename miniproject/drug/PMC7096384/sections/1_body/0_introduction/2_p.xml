<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is an important pathogen of human and animals. Infection with IAV causes acute respiratory diseases leading to morbidity and mortality in human and many animal species. In the past 100 years, influenza A viruses, such as H1N1 in 1918 and H3N2 in 1968, have caused severe pandemics in human (

This latter virus has been reported to infect humans with a mortality rate of 52.8% from 2003-2019 (source: WHO). Moreover, due to rapid genomic variation of IAVs, novel variants are emerging (such as H7N9 in 2013) that pose a new threat to human health (

The efficacy of vaccination is, however, limited in part due to antigenic variation, while the use of anti-IAV drugs is limited by the development of resistance. Therefore, novel preventive and therapeutic options against IAV infection are needed.
