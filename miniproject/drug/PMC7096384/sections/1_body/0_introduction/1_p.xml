<p>Cathelicidins are short cationic peptides with an important role in the innate immune response against infections. They are mainly expressed by leukocytes and epithelial cells at infection sites in the host. Cathelicidins have been found in all vertebrates, including pig, dog, human and chicken, but with some diversity in number and structure. For example, only one 37 amino acid-long cathelicidin (LL-37) is present in human, while chicken has four cathelicidins (CATH-1, -2, -3 and -B1) with varying length. Cathelicidins have direct antimicrobial activity against a broad range of bacteria and also possess many immunomodulatory functions on host cells (
