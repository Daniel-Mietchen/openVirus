<p>Human neutrophil peptides as antiviral therapeutics are gaining interest with the increasing knowledge on their antiviral potential. However, the antiviral mechanism of action can be quite different from one HDP to another, and is also depended on viruses. Human cathelicidin LL-37 has been found to directly interact with the IAV virion thereby limiting viral replication and virus-induced inflammation

 <italic>In vitro</italic>, LL-37 was described to directly induce disruption of the IAV viral membrane (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tripathi et al., 2013</xref>), although we did not observe this in our current study, possibly related to differences in the viral strains used. Human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) have been shown to induce viral aggregation and inhibit infectivity mainly through direct interactions with virus without any inhibition of HA activity of IAV (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hartshorn et al., 2006</xref>). Another group of HDPs, defensins, also showed antiviral activity against IAV and HIV-1 but mainly through immunomodulatory effects during viral infection (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>). The current study showed that CATH-B1 binds to viral particles but this was not accompanied by any obvious disruption of the viral membrane. Instead, peptide-virus aggregates were observed using electron microscopy, indicating that CATH-B1 might exert this mechanism of aggregating pathogens to block infection for viral invasion.
