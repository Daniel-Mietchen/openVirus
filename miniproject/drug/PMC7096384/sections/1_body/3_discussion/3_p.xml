<p>Four chicken cathelicidins (CATH-1,-2,-3,-B1) were used in this study together with a porcine (PMAP-23), canine (K9CATH) and human cathelicidin (LL-37) for comparison. Our results showed that CATH-B1 has the strongest anti-IAV activity against all three tested virus strains in this study. Comparison of the peptides does not give a clear indication what the main determinant for antiviral activity might be. All peptides have a (predicted) helical structure, are highly cationic and amphipathic. However, the sequence homology itself is quite low between peptides (except for CATH-1 and CATH-3 that also seem to have comparable activity). CATH-B1 is slightly longer than the other cathelicidins tested but it is unclear if that contributes to antiviral activity. Only for LL-37 some structure- antiviral activity studies have been performed which indicated that the central 20 amino acid fragment of LL-37 played a critical role in inhibiting the infection IAV (
