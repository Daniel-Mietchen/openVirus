<p>Some host defense peptides, such as human neutrophil defensins, have been shown to induce viral aggregation, which might contribute to their antiviral activity (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hartshorn et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Doss et al., 2009</xref>). Other peptides such as LL-37 have been found to directly disrupt the viral membrane (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tripathi et al., 2013</xref>). To study the effect of CATH-B1 on viral morphology, H3N1 was used in this study as an example. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, there is no clear alteration of the viral structure upon incubation with 20 μM CATH-B1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), CATH-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), or LL-37 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>), However, large aggregates were observed that contained viral particles and electron dense material at high concentration (20 μM) of CATH-B1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), while some smaller aggregates were observed at this concentration for CATH-2 and LL-37 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6F,G</xref>). At 5 μM CATH-B1, smaller aggregates were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>), but not for the two other peptides (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6I,J</xref>). These results indicate that binding and aggregation of virus particles is likely involved in the antiviral mechanism of CATH-B1.
