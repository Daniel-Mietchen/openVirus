<p>Activation of macrophages is important for viral clearance during IAV infection, but an excessive inflammatory response might cause morbidity and mortality (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Coorens et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Coorens et al., 2017</xref>), we analyzed to what extent the presence of CATH-B1 affected these responses induced by infection of cells with IAV. To this end, virus-induced gene expression of cytokines in HD11 macrophages was determined by qPCR in the presence or absence of CATH-B1.
