<p>The inhibitory effect of CATH-B1 on virus infection and induction of cytokine responses is only observed when the peptide is present during inoculation of cells with virus, but not when cells are exposed to the peptides prior to, or immediately after virus infection. This suggests that a direct interaction of the peptide with the virus is required for its antiviral effect. To further investigate the antiviral mechanism of CATH-B1, a series of experiments was performed using H1N1. Firstly, a crucial role for a direct interaction of CATH-B1 with virus particles was analyzed by removal of unbound CATH-B1 using Capto Core 700 beads. As controls, incubation of virus itself with the beads did not affect virus infectivity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, orange bar), indicating that CATH-B1 was efficiently removed from solution by the beads. However, when CATH-B1 and virus were mixed prior to their treatment with Capto Core 700 beads, the antiviral activity of CATH-B1 was maintained indicating that CATH-B1 is directly associated with the virus and not captured by the beads (light green bar, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The proposed binding of CATH-B1 to virus is almost instantaneous because in the absence of the 30 min incubation time upon mixing of virus and CATH-B1 prior to addition of the beads, a similar antiviral activity of CATH-B1 was observed (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using MDCK cells (
