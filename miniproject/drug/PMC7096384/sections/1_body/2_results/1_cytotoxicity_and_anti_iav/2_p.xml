<p>The inhibitory infectivity of CATH-B1 was dose-dependent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), with an almost complete inhibition of viral infectivity of the H1N1 and H3N1 strains, while inhibition of H5N1 reached 85% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The observed reduction in infected cells was not due to toxicity of cathelicidins toward the mammalian cell lines as shown by the WST assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Nevertheless, cytotoxicity was observed for CATH-1 and CATH-3 at 10 Î¼M to HD11 cells (
