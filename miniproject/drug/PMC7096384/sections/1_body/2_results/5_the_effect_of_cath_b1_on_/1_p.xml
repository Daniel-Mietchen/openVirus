<p>Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are important functional proteins on the surface of IAVs. During viral infection, the function of HA is binding to sialic acid receptors on host cells and subsequent membrane fusion, while release of newly assembled virus particles requires the sialidase activity of NA. First, we analyzed the ability of CATH-B1 to interfere with the receptor-binding properties of HA by performing a hemagglutination inhibition assay. Unfortunately, CATH-B1 to some extent induced lysis of erythrocytes, which precluded further analysis of the hemagglutination inhibition assay. Next, we analyzed the ability of CATH-B1 to interfere with NA activity using the substrate MUNANA. Clearly, even at the highest CATH-B1 concentrations, no inhibition of NA activity was observed (

Cleavage of fetuin by NA in this assay depends on the activity of NA, but also on the activity of HA, as receptor-binding by HA contributes significantly to NA cleavage (
