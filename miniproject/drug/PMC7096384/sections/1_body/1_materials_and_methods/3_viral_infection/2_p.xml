<p>To investigate whether a direct interaction of CATH-B1 with virus was present, and possibly required for CATH-B1’s activity, Capto Core 700 beads (GE Healthcare) were used to remove CATH-B1 that was not bound to virus. To this end, viruses were pre-incubated in opti-MEM medium with or without CATH-B1 for 30 min at 37°C, after which Capto Core 700 beads were added to the samples and samples were incubated for 20 min at 4°C while rotating. Afterward, beads were spun down and supernatants were collected. To control for the efficient removal of CATH-B1, samples containing CATH-B1 but no virus were subjected to the same procedure. Cells were inoculated with the supernatants (or combinations thereof) and processed to determine the number of infected cells as described above.</p>
