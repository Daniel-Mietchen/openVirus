<p>MDCK-II and HD11 cells, seeded in 96 well plates and grown to confluency, were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in the presence or absence of cathelicidins for 1 h at 37°C. In pre-incubation studies CATHs were added to the cells for 1 h, washed away with PBS after which IAV was added for 1 h. Post incubation studies were performed similarly but with the order of peptide and virus addition reversed. All the initial infection and cathelicidin incubation steps were performed in the absence of serum. After these incubations, unbound virus or unbound peptide were removed by washing the cells twice with PBS (supplemented with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>). MDCK-II and HD11 cells were incubated for another 7 h with opti-MEM or RPMI 1640-glutaMAX supplemented with 2% FCS, respectively, at 37°C. Subsequently, cells were fixed with cold methanol at −20°C for 5 min, after which cells were stained with primary mouse monoclonal antibody HB65 (1:1000) specific for the nucleoprotein and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Donkey anti-Mouse IgG antibodies (Life technologies, Eugene, OR, United States) (1:1000) as described previously (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Vries et al., 2011</xref>). Cells were visualized using the nuclear stain DAPI (Thermo Fischer Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three images per well were taken using an EVOS FL microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the infected cells were counted. The number of infected cells in inoculated, mock-treated wells was set at 100%.
