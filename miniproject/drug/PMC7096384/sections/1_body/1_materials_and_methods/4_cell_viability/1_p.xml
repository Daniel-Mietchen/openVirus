<p>Cell viability was determined using the WST-1 assay following the manufacturer’s protocol. In short, cells were incubated with peptides for 1 h at 37°C, then peptides were washed away and cells were further incubated for either 7 h or 23 h at 37°C (corresponding to the incubation times used for immunohistochemistry and detection of cytokine gene expression, respectively). Cell culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh culture medium containing 10% WST-1 reagent. After 20 min incubation, absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader and was corrected for absorbance at 630 nm.</p>
