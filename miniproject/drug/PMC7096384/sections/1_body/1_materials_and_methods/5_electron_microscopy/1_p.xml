<p>Influenza A virus (H3N1) was incubated in the presence or absence of CATH-B1 for 1 h at 37°C and 10 μl sample was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid. Grids were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min. Next, grids were washed two times with PBS and four times with MilliQ. Subsequently, grids were shortly rinsed with methylcellulose/uranyl acetate (pH 4) and incubated for 5 min with methylcellulose/uranyl acetate (pH 4) on ice. Finally, grids were looped out of the solution and air-dried. Samples were imaged on a Tecnai-12 electron microscope (FEI).</p>
