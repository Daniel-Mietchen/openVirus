 <italic>in vitro</italic> and clinical trials started in China during the last month with the first approved drug, Favilavir, by the National Medical Products Administration of China is announced yesterday (18 February 2020) in Zhejiang province. Different directly acting antiviral drugs are approved against other viruses, by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), such as Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin against RdRp of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). These drugs are nucleotides derivative competing with physiological nucleotide for RdRp active site [

 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Additionally, a huge number of attempts to develop anti-RdRp compounds are under clinical testing against different viruses. The half-maximal Effective Concentration (EC50) for Ribavirin against COVID-19 is 109.5 μM, while its half-maximum Inhibition Concentration (IC50) against Dengue virus is 8 μM [

 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We build the COVID-19 RdRp model using homology modeling after sequence comparison to the available structures in the protein data bank [
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Molecular docking is then performed to test some direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs against COVID-19 RdRp (Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Remidisvir, IDX-184). Additionally, the native nucleotides GTP and UTP, from which IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir are derived, are also tested against COVID-19 RdRp model. The results are promising and suggest possible inhibition for the currently available therapeutics against the newly emerged coronavirus.
