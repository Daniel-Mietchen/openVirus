<p id="p0090">To summarize the abovementioned data, we can say that IDX-184, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin can tightly bind to the newly emerged coronavirus RdRp and hence contradict the function of the protein leading to viral eradication. Additionally, IDX-184 show more promising results then comes Sofosbuvir as a potent inhibitor against the newly emerged COVID-19 strain of HCoV. Further optimization of these two compounds can result in a more potent compound able to stop the newly emerged infection.</p>
