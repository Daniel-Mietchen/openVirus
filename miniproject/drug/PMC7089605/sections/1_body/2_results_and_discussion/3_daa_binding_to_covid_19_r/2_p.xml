<p id="p0080">Before performing the docking study, the structures of the small molecules (GTP, UTP, Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Cinnamaldehyde, and Thymoquinone) are prepared, ensured to be in the optimized triphosphate form. Optimization is performed using MM3 then PM6 force field after that further optimization is accomplished through B3LYP functional of Density Functional Theory (DFT) quantum mechanics [

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the docking score values for COVID-19 (blue columns) and SARS HCoVs (orange columns). The SARS solved structure (PDB ID: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>, chain A) is used to dock the same ligands in order to compare its binding energy to that of COVID-19 RdRp. The grid box (30 × 30 × 30 Å) for SARS RdRp is centered at (141.2, 138.5, 149.4) Å. As reflected from the docking scores, the eight compounds, including the physiological GTP and UTP and the four drugs IDX-184, Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir can bind to both COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps with good binding energy (−6.5 up to −9.0 kcal/mol). Despite SARS HCoV RdRp show slightly higher binding energies (lower in binding) compared to COVID-19 RdRp, the difference is still non-significant for Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Sofosbuvir and its parent nucleotide, UTP. On average, 0.95 kcal/mol is the difference between the SARS and COVID-19 RdRps' binding energies for these compounds. On the other hand, the difference between COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps' binding energies to IDX-184 and its parent nucleotide GTP are 2.3 and 1.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, all the tested compounds show lower (better) binding energies to COVID-19 RdRp compared to SARS RdRp. The negative control compounds Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone both show lower binding affinities to either SARS or COVID-19 (higher than −5.6 kcal/mol).
