 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A shows the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of RNA dependent RNA polymerases from Different HCoV strains including the 
 <italic>Alphacoronaviruses</italic> (229E and NL63) and the 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> (OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19). SARS HCoV secondary structure is shown at the top of the MSA (PDB ID: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link> chain: A) while its water accessibility found at the bottom of the MSA. Highly accessible residues are in blue boxes, while buried residues are represented in white at the bottom of the MSA. The black-dashed rectangle marks active site residues (successive aspartates residues D255 and D256). The active site aspartates are protruding from the beta-turn joining the β15 and β16. As implied from the MSA, the active site is highly conserved (highlighted in red). Also, the 5 Å region surrounding the D255 and D256 is highly conserved in all HCoVs, as shown by the blue-dashed rectangles. This region includes Y114, C117, N186, N190, M251, I252, L253, S254, A257, V258, E306, F307, C308, and S309. The active site residues and most of the 5 Å region surrounding it are surface accessible, though can bind to the free nucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) [
