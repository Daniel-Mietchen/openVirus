 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B shows the structure of the COVID-19 RdRp model in the green ribbon (right) and green surface (left) representations. Active site residues D255 and D256 are in red for clarification (see the enlarged panel at the center of the figure). The active site is surface accessible as we can see from the surface representation allowing the interaction with the free nucleotides passing through the nucleotide channel of the RdRp. Although some insertions found in COVID-19 RdRp, these insertions are apart from the active site aspartates and have little effect on the model quality (see the Ramachandran plot). Additionally, the homology built model is minimized using the MM3 force field to ensure its reliability before performing the docking study.
