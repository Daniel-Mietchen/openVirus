<p id="p0075">COVID-19 RdRp model (801 residues) is built by the aid of the automated homology modeling, Swiss Model, web server using SARS HCoV RdRp (PDB ID: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0025" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>, chain A) as a homolog. The model has a very high (97.08%) sequence identity to the template suggesting the high-quality model that could be obtained. The model is valid based on the values we obtain from the validation web servers. The Ramachandran plot shows 100% of the residues in the allowed regions, 97.5% in the most favored region (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Additionally, 89.9% of the residues have averaged 3D-1D score ≤ 0.2 based on the Verify 3D software, while the overall quality factor of ERRAT is 95.9%.
