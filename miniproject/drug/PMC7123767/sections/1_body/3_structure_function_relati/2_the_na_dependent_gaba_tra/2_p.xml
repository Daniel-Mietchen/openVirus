<p>More recently, also glycosylation has been proposed to be involved in regulation of the transport function. Mutations in the glycosylation sites (see N

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">8.4</xref>) indeed lead to altered transport. The example illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">8.5</xref> shows that mutation of two of the three asparagines (N) to aspartic acid (D) leads to reduced sensitivity for extracellular Na
