<p>The N-terminus is the area, which shows the highest degree of diversity among the different isoforms of the 
 <italic>α</italic> subunits, and may, therefore, account for isoform-specific function in different tissue. In fact, mutations (like truncation as illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">8.2</xref>) or chemical modifications (by, e. g. regulatory phosphorylation, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">8.1</xref>) within the N-terminus leads to altered transport function including external cation interaction and external binding of the specific inhibitor Ouabain. It is interesting to mention that the highly flexible, cytoplasmic N-terminus interferes with the external interactions. This finding is an example illustrating the allosteric interaction within the complex protein structure.
