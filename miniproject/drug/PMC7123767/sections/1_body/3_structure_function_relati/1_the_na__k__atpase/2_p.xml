<p>Measurements of the electrogenic current generated by the Na
 <sup>+</sup>,K
 <sup>+</sup> pump confirm that mutation of Q
 <sub>118</sub> and N
 <sub>129</sub> to the charged residues R and D
 <italic>,</italic> respectively, causes insensitivity of the ATPase to the cardiac glycoside Ouabain. The 
 <italic>ß</italic> subunit is necessary for proper folding of the 
 <italic>α</italic> subunit and for assembly and proper insertion of the entire protein into the cell membrane. The combination of an 
 <italic>α</italic> subunit with different 
 <italic>ß</italic> subunits results in a different function and, therefore, a regulatory role of the 
 <italic>ß</italic> subunit has been discussed. In addition, a γ subunit has been identified, which also seems to have a regulatory function. One option to monitor modulation of the ion transport is the measurement of a pump-mediated current under voltage clamp.
