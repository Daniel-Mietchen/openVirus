<p>Inactivation at positive potentials of Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> channels has been ascribed to a positively charged ball at the N-terminus blocking the internal channel mouth (bal at a chain), which leads to an inward-rectifying steady-state IV relationship (cf., e. g. also Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_5). A similar interpretation has been suggested for the PTX -modified Na
 <sup>+</sup>,K
 <sup>+</sup> pump. Indeed, the truncated mutant does not show inactivation anymore (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3b</xref>), while application of the truncated N-terminal peptide restores inactivation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3c</xref>).
