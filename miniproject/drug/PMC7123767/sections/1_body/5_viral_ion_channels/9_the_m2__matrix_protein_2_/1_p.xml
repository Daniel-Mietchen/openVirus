<p>The genome of the influenza A virus (swine flu virus) encodes for an ion channel. As for the Vpu, this M2 protein has only a single transmembrane segment, but the channel is formed by a tetrameric structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">8.22a</xref>) that exhibits low conductance for protons. With decreasing pH, the M2-mediated current increases dramatically (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">8.22b</xref>). The activity of the channel also plays an essential role in virus production (see de Clercq 2006).
