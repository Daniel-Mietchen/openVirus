<p>In conclusion, the activity of various viral ion channels seems to be essential for virus reproduction in the infected cells. Hence, inhibition of channel activity by drugs will counteract that process, allowing the infected body to build up or strengthen its own immune system. Viral ion channels are, therefore, potential candidates for developing new antiviral drugs, and voltage clamping is an easy method to screen drugs, and detect and analyze inhibition of the ion channels. Screening of a large number of natural drugs revealed that kaempferol derivatives and anthraquinones may be interesting candidates.</p>
