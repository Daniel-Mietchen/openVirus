<p>In this section, we will present the strategy how electrophysiology can be combined with virology and pharmacology to develop new drugs against viral infection. As example, we will use the viral ion channels as a target for antiviral drugs. An interesting source for the development of new medicines are drug components of traditional Chinese herbs. The finding of artemisinin extracted from
