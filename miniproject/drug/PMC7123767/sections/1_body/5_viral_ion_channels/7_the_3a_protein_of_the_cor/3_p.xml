<p>Voltage clamping is an easy method to detect and analyze function of the viral ion channels. Again using the model system 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte as an expression system (cf. Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_7), drugs can be screened with respect to their interaction with the 3a protein. As a general rule, a method has to be elaborated that allows extracting the current component of interest from the total membrane current. Injection of cRNA for the 3a protein results in elevation of the membrane current that can be blocked by 10 mM Ba
