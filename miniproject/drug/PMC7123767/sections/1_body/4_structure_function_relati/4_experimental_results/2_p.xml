<p>The data shown in the following were recorded by the two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) technique (Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_3 (
 <italic>The Two-Microelectrode Voltage Clamp</italic>)) with 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_7). Therefore, the currents represent simultaneous activity of a huge number of ion channels (millions) leading to currents in the µA-range. 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes do not possess endogenous nucleotide receptors and are, therefore, an ideal tool for studying these channels after injection of the appropriate cRNAs.
