<p>Although the exchange time of 100–200 ms is fast with respect to the large size of the oocyte, one should keep in mind that the currents that are elicited by a solution exchange (for example, ATP application to P2X receptors) are greatly influenced by the concentration change that occurs during the first 200 ms. A significantly faster solution change in intact oocytes will be difficult to achieve, and if this becomes necessary, one has to use the cell-free patch-clamp method (Sects. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_3 and 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_3), which allows for exchange times even in the sub-millisecond range.</p>
