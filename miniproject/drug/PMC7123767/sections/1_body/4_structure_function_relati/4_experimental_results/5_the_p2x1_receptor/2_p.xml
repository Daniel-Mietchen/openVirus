<p>The receptor desensitizes in the presence of ATP completely within about 1 s. After a period of 5 min in ATP-free solution, typically only about 25 % of the initial receptor current can be restored. This means that desensitization is fast but the recovery from the desensitized state is slow. As a matter of fact, tens of minutes are necessary to restore the full initial current response. The response of the P2X
 <sub>1</sub> receptors is dependent on the extracellular ATP concentration with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value (the concentration that is needed for half-maximum response) of about 1 µM.
