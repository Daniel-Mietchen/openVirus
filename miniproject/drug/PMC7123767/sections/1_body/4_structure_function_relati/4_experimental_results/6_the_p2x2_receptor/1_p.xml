<p>As an example for a nearly non-desensitizing P2X receptor we introduce the P2X
 <sub>2</sub> receptor, which, like all members of the P2X family, opens an intrinsic ion channel after extracellular application of an appropriate agonist. Analogous to the P2X
 <sub>1</sub> receptor, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8.12a</xref> shows P2X
 <sub>2</sub> currents activated by different ATP concentrations and Fig.

 <sub>50</sub> value of about 30 µM.
