<p>Mechanosensitive channels are involved in all kinds of mechanosensation, including, e.â€‰g. touch sensation, hearing or regulation of the tone of smooth muscle fibres. The transfer from an open to a closed configuration can be governed by mechanical forces on the membrane protein via the lipid bilayer or via tethered cytoskeletal or extracellular structures.</p>
