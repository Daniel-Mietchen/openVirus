<p>Another interesting group of ion channel s are those that are gated by mechanical stress, allowing transduction of mechanical forces into electrical signals (see, e. g. Delmas and Coste 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>; Ranade et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>). In particular, the patch-clamp technique of applying mechanical or osmotic stress to a cell and recording electrical responses reveals a continuously growing number of mechanosensitive or stretch-activated (SAC) ion channels (Nilius and Honoré 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>). A class of mechanosensitive channels that was conserved throughout evolution is formed by the Piezo channels (Bagriantsev et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>). Another large class of ion channels sensitive to physical stimuli is formed by the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (Christensen and Corey
