<p>The ENaC family consists of more than 20 sequenced proteins exclusively from animals. There exist voltage-insensitive ENaC homologues in the brain. Some of these proteins are involved in touch sensitivity; other members of the ENaC family, the acid-sensing Na
 <sup>+</sup> channels (H
 <sup>+</sup>-gated), ASIC1-3, mediate pain sensation in response to tissue acidosis. The (FMRF-amide)-activated Na
 <sup>+</sup> channel is the first peptide neurotransmitter-gated ionotropic receptor that was sequenced. All members of this family exhibit a topology with intracellular N- and C-termini, two transmembrane spanning segments, and a large extracellular loop. Three homologous ENaC subunits, 
 <italic>α, β</italic> and 
 <italic>γ</italic>, have been shown to assemble to form the highly Na
 <sup>+</sup>-selective channel with the stoichiometry 
 <italic>αβγ</italic> in a heterotrimeric architecture.
