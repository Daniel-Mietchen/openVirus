<p>The K
 <sup>+</sup> channels usually consist of homotetrameric structures with each subunit possessing six transmembrane domains (see also Fig. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_6). At least ten types of K
 <sup>+</sup> channels are known , each responding in different ways to different stimuli: voltage-sensitive (Ka, Kv, Kvr, Kvs and Ksr), Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-sensitive (BKCa, IKCa and SKCa) and receptor-coupled channels (KM and KACh). There are also tetrameric channels in which each subunit possesses two transmembrane (TM) domains that are homologous to TM-domains 5 and 6 of the six TM-domain types (inward rectifier Kir).
