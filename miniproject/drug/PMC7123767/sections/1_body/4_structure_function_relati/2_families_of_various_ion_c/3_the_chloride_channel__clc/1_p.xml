<p>The large ClC family consists of dozens of sequenced proteins derived from bacteria, plants and animals. These proteins exhibit 10–12 putative transmembrane 
 <italic>α</italic>-helical domains and appear to be present in the membrane as homodimers. While one member of the family, 
 <italic>Torpedo</italic> ClC-O, has been reported to have two channels, one per subunit, others are believed to have just one. All functionally characterized members of the ClC family are permeable for Cl

These channels are involved in a variety of physiological functions (cell volume regulation, membrane potential stabilization, signal transduction, transepithelial transport, etc.). Different homologues exhibit different anion selectivities, i. e. ClC4 and ClC5 share an NO
