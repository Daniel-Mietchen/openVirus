<p>Gap junctions consist of clusters of closely packed pairs of transmembrane channels in adjacent cells, the connexons, through which small molecules diffuse between neighbouring cells. The connexons consist of homo- or heterohexameric arrays of connexins, and the connexon in one plasma membrane docks end-to-end with a connexon in the membrane of a closely opposed cell. Over 15 connexin subunit isoforms are known. They vary in size between about 25 and 60 kDa. They have four putative transmembrane 
 <italic>α</italic>-helical domains. A dodecameric channel is formed by two hexamers, and therefore, consists of 48 transmembrane domains in total.
