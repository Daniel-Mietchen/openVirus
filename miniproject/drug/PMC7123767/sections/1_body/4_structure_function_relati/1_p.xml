<p>Ion channels are classified due to their diverse modes of function or molecular structure. This can be ion selectivity, modes of gating, number of subunits comprising the functional channel, number of transmembrane domains or sequence homologies. Classically, ion channels are divided into major families having important properties in common like gating mechanisms and ion selectivity. Some of the families will be briefly presented in the next paragraphs.</p>
