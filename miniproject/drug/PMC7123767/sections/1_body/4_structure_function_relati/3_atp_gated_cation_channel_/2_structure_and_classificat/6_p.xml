<p>Fast inactivation within about a second has been found for P2X
 <sub>1</sub> and P2X
 <sub>3</sub>, and slightly slower for the P2X
 <sub>4</sub> receptors, whereas the other subtypes desensitize only slowly and incompletely. A special feature of the P2X
 <sub>7</sub> receptor is the formation of a large pore with a diameter of 3–5 nm after prolonged application of the agonist. Similar behaviour, where at least the ion selectivity changes after prolonged activation, is also discussed for the other subtypes.
