<p>From hydropathy analysis, a now commonly accepted secondary structure with intracellular N- and C-termini, a large extracellular loop and two transmembrane domains were derived (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">8.6</xref>), which resemble the architecture of the ENaC family. As is also known from other ion channel proteins, the functional channel unit is composed of more than one subunit. A quaternary structure of three subunits forming the functional receptor has been published (Nicke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1000">1998</xref>); a stoichiometry that is different from what is known for other ligand-gated ion channels that are usually composed from tetramers or pentamers.
