<p>Nowadays, seven isoforms (Tableâ€¯
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">8.1</xref>) and various splice variants are known, which have more or less different pharmacological and functional properties (Burnstock 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1999</xref>). Since all of the seven isoforms are ionotropic ion channels (meaning that receptor and channel function are localized on the same protein multimer), electrophysiology is the method of choice to characterize their functional properties.
