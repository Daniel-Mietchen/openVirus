  <p>Viral lifecycle of SARS CoV. Binding of viral spike protein with angiotensine-converting-enzyme-2 receptor of the host cell is followed by virus uptake, uncoating, and transcription and translation of the viral genome. After assembly of new viruses, 3a channel activity stimulates exocytotic release of the viruses from the host cell</p>
