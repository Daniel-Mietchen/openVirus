  <p>Summarised enrichment analysis profile of proteins differentially expressed in PBMCs as a consequence of compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> treatment. PBMC isolates from three different donors were used as biological replicates and the lists of genes up- or down regulated by treatment with compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> were determined. GO-terms, canonical pathways, and MeSH terms enriched in either HIV-exposed PBMC (↑ up-regulated, ↓ down-regulated) or PBMC exposed to compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> in the absence of HIV (also up- and down-regulated) were determined and shown as heat map. Summary terms are shown color-coded on the left. The heat map is coded by colour saturation (in %): p-value range =% colour saturation: e
   <sup>−3</sup> to e
   <sup>−5</sup> = 20, e
   <sup>−6</sup> to e
   <sup>−8</sup> = 40, e
   <sup>−9</sup> to e
   <sup>−11</sup> = 60, e
   <sup>−12</sup> to e
   <sup>−14</sup> = 80, ≥e
   <sup>−15</sup> = 100. Shared enrichments are boxed in blue, HIV-exposure specific enrichments are boxed in red. More detailed information about terms and proteins are shown in Supplementary Table
