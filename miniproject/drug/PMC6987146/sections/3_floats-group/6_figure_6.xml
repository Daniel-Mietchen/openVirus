  <p>Combinations of compound #7 with reverse transcriptase or integrase inhibitors exhibit synergistic anti-HIV activities. Drug combination effects were determined in LC5-RIC cells exposed to HIV-1
   <sub>LAI</sub> and analysed by the Chou-Talalay theorem as described in Materials and Methods. Combinations of compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> with RT inhibitors 
   <bold>(a,b,c</bold>) and integrase inhibitors 
   <bold>(d)</bold> resulted in synergistic inhibition of HIV infection. No synergisms were observed for combination of compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> with a protease inhibitor 
   <bold>(e)</bold>. 
   <bold>(f)</bold> Shows results for combinations of two anti-HIV drugs with reported synergisms for reference. Isobolograms and their combination indices (CI) are shown for 90% (ED
   <sub>90</sub>) and 75% (ED
   <sub>50</sub>) HIV inhibition. In the isobolograms, data points that lie to the left of the respective hypotenuse indicate synergism, data points on the hypotenuse additive effects and data points to the right of the hypotenuse antagonism. CI values &lt;0.7 indicate synergistic effects (highlighted yellow), 0.85 to 1.20 additive effects (grey shading) and &gt;1.20 antagonistic effects (no shading)

   </sup>. The following clinical drugs were used: RT inhibitors Emtricitabine (FTC; panels a,f), Lamivudine (3TC, panel b), Efavirenz (EFV; panels c,f); integrase inhibitor Dolutegravir (DTG; panel d); protease inhibitor Saquinavir (SQV; panel e). Depicted are the means of at least three independent experiments with biological triplicates (n ≥ 3; m = 3) and standard deviations.
