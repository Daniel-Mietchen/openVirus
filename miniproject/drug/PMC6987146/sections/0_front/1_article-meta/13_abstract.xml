 <p id="Par1">Overcoming the global health threat of HIV infection requires continuous pipelines of novel drug candidates. We identified the γ-pyrone polyketides Aureothin/Neoaureothin as potent hits by anti-HIV screening of an extensive natural compound collection. Total synthesis of a structurally diverse group of Aureothin-derivatives successfully identified a lead compound (
  <bold>#7</bold>) superior to Aureothin that combines strong anti-HIV activity (IC
  <sub>90</sub>&lt;45 nM), photostability and improved cell safety. Compound 
  <bold>#7</bold> inhibited 
  <italic>de novo</italic> virus production from integrated proviruses by blocking the accumulation of HIV RNAs that encode the structural components of virions and include viral genomic RNAs. Thus, the mode-of-action displayed by compound 
  <bold>#7</bold> is different from those of all current clinical drugs. Proteomic analysis indicated that compound 
  <bold>#7</bold> does not affect global protein expression in primary blood cells and may modulate cellular pathways linked to HIV infection. Compound 
  <bold>#7</bold> inhibited multiple HIV genotypes, including HIV-type 1 and 2 and synergistically inhibited HIV in combination with clinical reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors. We conclude that compound 
  <bold>#7</bold> represents a promising new class of HIV inhibitors that will facilitate the identification of new virus-host interactions exploitable for antiviral attack and holds promise for further drug development.
