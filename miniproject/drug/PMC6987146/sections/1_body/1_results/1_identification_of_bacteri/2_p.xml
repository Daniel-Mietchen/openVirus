<p id="Par8">The polyketide Aureothin and the related molecule Neoaureothin (Spectinabilin) were identified as hit candidates by single-dose screening (10 µM) and validated by assessment of dose-dependency of HIV-inhibitory activities. Aureothin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.3 ± 0.40 nM) and Neoaureothin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.2 ± 0.06 nM) showed very potent anti-HIV activity, which was comparable or only moderately lower than that of several clinical drugs assayed in parallel (Protease inhibitor Saquinavir
