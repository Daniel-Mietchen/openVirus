<p id="Par31">In order to address that a majority of uninfected cells might have obscured HIV-infection related proteomics effects we carried out proteome analysis as described for the PBMCs with CD4+ enriched cells (~94% CD4+ cells) from three additional donors. The results were generally similar but showed fewer associated GO-terms and pathways for the infected cells and almost no such enrichment for the uninfected cells (Supplementary TableÂ
