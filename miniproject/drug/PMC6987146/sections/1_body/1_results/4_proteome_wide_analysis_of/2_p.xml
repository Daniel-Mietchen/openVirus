<p id="Par26">We carried out semi-quantitative analysis of the proteomes of PBMCs treated with compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>, with or without exposure to HIV (Data provided in Supplementary data file S2). Treatment experiments were performed with PBMC isolates from three donors. Effective inhibition of virus production in compound treated, HIV-exposed samples was confirmed by quantification of infectious virus levels in culture supernatants.
