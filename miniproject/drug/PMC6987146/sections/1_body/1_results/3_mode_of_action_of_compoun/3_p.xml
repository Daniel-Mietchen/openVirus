<p id="Par19">For further analysis of antiviral effects of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>, we investigated effects of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment on levels of integrated proviral DNA and cellular viral proteins and mRNAs in LC5-RIC cells, under conditions fully inhibiting HIV production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Treatments were also performed with compounds 
 <bold>#4</bold> or 
 <bold>#18</bold>, which are at least 400-fold less active against HIV than compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) as negative compound controls.
