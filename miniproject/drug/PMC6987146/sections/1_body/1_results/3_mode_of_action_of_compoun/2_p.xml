 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows data from multiple experiments comparing effects of compound treatment on reporter gene expression and infectious virus production. As expected, treatment with Flavopiridol yielded both very strong inhibition of DsRed1 expression and infectious virus production. In contrast, compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment displayed highly variable effects on DsRed1 expression, whereas it strongly inhibited virus production in all experiments. Indeed, even in experiments in which DsRed1 expression was not or poorly inhibited, compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> strongly blocked infectious virus production. These results indicate that while compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment can have inhibitory effects on early viral gene expression, this inhibitory effect is variable and is thus not the major effect blocking infectious virus production.
