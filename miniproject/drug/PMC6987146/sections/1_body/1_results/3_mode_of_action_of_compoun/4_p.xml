<p id="Par20">Levels of integrated proviral DNA in HIV-exposed LC5-RIC cultures treated with compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> were evaluated by Alu-PCR. Parallel assays were performed with two reference compounds that prevent HIV integration, the reverse transcriptase inhibitor Efavirenz (EFV), and the integrase inhibitor Dolutegravir (DTG). Treatment with either compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> or with reference drugs was performed at concentrations yielding full inhibition of infectious virus production (&gt;2x IC
 <sub>90</sub>). Treatment with EFV or DTG strongly reduced levels of integrated proviral DNA (&gt;90%), confirming that our experimental conditions allow detection of compound-mediated reduction of proviral DNA levels (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with the HIV transcription inhibitor Flavopiridol (FLV) or the control compound 
 <bold>#4</bold> did not reveal reduction of proviral DNA levels, as expected.
