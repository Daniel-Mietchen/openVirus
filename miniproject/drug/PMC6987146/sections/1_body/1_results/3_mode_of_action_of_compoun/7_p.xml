 </sup>, forming three classes of HIV mRNAs (unspliced, singly spliced and multiply spliced HIV mRNAs; see overview in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). HIV Gag is produced from unspliced mRNAs, which, together with singly spliced mRNA, predominate in the late phase of HIV gene expression. We determined relative levels of these transcript classes in untreated and compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treated HIV-exposed LC5-RIC cultures by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis with primers specific for each transcript class. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, levels of unspliced transcripts as well as singly spliced transcripts were strongly diminished in cells treated with compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>, compared to untreated cells. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis with primers designed to recognize all transcripts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) showed that compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment reduced the overall abundance of HIV mRNAs. Interestingly, treatment with compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> did not reduce relative levels of multiply spliced transcripts in these experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). This is in contrast to the effect of Flavopiridol, which showed a much stronger inhibitory effect on levels of multiply spliced transcripts than compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>.
