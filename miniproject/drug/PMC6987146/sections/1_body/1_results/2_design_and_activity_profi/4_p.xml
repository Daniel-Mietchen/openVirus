 </sup>. Therefore, we investigated the photostability of Aureothin/Neoaureothin and derivatives by comparing their anti-HIV activities after exposure to light for 24 h with those of the same compounds kept in the dark. The high-activity compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> retained over 95% anti-HIV activity after exposure to light, similar to several other synthetic compounds (
 <bold>#4</bold>, 
 <bold>#9</bold>, 
 <bold>#13</bold>, 
 <bold>#14</bold>, 
 <bold>#15</bold>, 
 <bold>#19</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In contrast, Aureothin (
 <bold>#1</bold>) and several synthetic compounds (
 <bold>#10, #16, #17, #18</bold>, and 
 <bold>#21</bold>) showed ≥50% loss of anti-HIV-activity compared to the non-illuminated controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Photostable compounds included both compounds with high and low anti-HIV activity, indicating that the chemical determinants of photostability and anti-HIV activity are not identical.
