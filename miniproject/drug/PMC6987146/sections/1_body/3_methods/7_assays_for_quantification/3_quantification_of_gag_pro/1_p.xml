<p id="Par64">LC5-RIC cells were plated, treated with compounds and inoculated with virus as described for Alu-PCR above. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS and incubated in 200 µl of PBS + 5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 400 g, supernatants collected, diluted 1:10,000 and Gag-p24 was detected by p24 Antigen Capture Assay (ABLinc) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
