<p id="Par63">LC5-RIC cells were plated, treated with compounds and inoculated with virus as described for Alu-PCR above. Cells were then harvested and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For cDNA synthesis, 1 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. qRT-PCR was performed with the Roche Light Cycler
 <sup>®</sup> 480II 96 (Version 1.5.0.39), using LightCycler
 <sup>®</sup> 480 SYBR Green I Mastermix (Roche). Quantitative PCR for HIV-1 transcripts was performed with primers specific for unspliced, singly spliced or multiply spliced HIV-1 transcripts as well as for ‘all HIV transcripts’; RNA Polymerase II transcripts were analysed as internal reference gene. Primer sequences are given in Supplementary Methods and binding sites shown in Supplementary Fig.
