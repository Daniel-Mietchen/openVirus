<p id="Par52">Infectious titres of virus samples were determined by measuring the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), using LC5-RIC HIV reporter cells. Briefly, 10,000 LC5-RIC reporter cells per well were plated into black 96-well plates, incubated for 24 h and inoculated with serial dilutions of the virus sample (initial dilution 1:6; 11 dilution steps of 1:5, six replicates of each dilution tested). Plates were incubated for 48 h; wells were visually inspected for cells expressing the fluorescent reporter DsRed1 by fluorescence microscopy. Wells with at least one DsRed1-positive cell were counted positive. TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated as described by Reed
