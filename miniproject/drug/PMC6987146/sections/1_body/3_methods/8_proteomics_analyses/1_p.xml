<p id="Par66">Stimulated PBMCs or CD4+ cells (5,000,000 cells) were seeded into 12-well plates before compound treatment and inoculation with HIV-1
 <sub>LAI</sub> at an MOI of 0.5, followed by 48 h incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. HIV inhibition was confirmed by quantifying infectious virus production in LC5-RIC cells as described above. Protein lysates were prepared from cells harvested, washed with PBS and lysed by incubating the cells for 10 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 150 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton-X100) and centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C, 16,000 g to clear protein lysates. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Pierce
 <sup>TM</sup> BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The proteomes of PBMCs from three different donors were analysed by LC-MSMS and data enrichment analysis was carried out using GeneRanker (Intrexon).
