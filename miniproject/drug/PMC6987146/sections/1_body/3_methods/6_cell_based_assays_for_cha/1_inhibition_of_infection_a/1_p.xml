  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Briefly, LC5-RIC cells were first exposed to virus and compounds (first step of the assay). Compound effects on infectious virus production were determined by transferring aliquots of supernatants of compound-treated cultures to secondary plates and measurement of fluorescent signal intensities in secondary plates after 72â€‰h (second step of the assay). Fluorescent signal intensities determined for compound-treated cultures were normalized to those determined for untreated virus-exposed cultures. Cells were exposed to the designated virus strain at an MOI of 0.5.
