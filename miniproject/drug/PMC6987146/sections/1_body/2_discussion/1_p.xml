 </sup>. We identified the γ-pyrone polyketides Aureothin/Neoaureothin as potent hits during screening of a natural compound library for HIV inhibitors. Only very limited preliminary information supporting antiviral activity of Aureothin is available to date

 </sup>. Our study provides in-depth information on the anti-HIV activity of these γ-pyrone polyketides by identifying a highly active, synthetic variant with improved features, elucidating its mode-of-action in the context of the HIV replication cycle, demonstrating activity against a wide spectrum of HIV genotypes and providing evidence for synergisms with clinical anti-HIV drugs.
