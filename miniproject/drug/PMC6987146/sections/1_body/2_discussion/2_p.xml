<p id="Par40">We showed that derivatization strategies can be used to improve properties of the Aureothin scaffold impeding drug development (i.e. toxicity, photolability) without eliminating antiviral activity. To this end we generated a collection of fully synthetic Aureothin derivatives, which we gave the acronym MAGIC (Multiple Antiviral Gamma-pyrone Inspired Compounds). These contained various modifications at the aryl moiety designed to replace the potentially toxic nitro group with more favourable substituents like fluorine. Selective introduction of fluorine residues has been used to improve biological properties of numerous drug candidates

 </sup> and many clinical anti-HIV drugs contain one or more fluorine atoms (Emtricitabine, Raltegravir, Dolutegravir, Efavirenz).
