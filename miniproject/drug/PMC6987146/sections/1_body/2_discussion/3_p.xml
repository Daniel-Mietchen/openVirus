<p id="Par41">Parallel profiling of cell tolerance and anti-HIV activity in PBMCs showed improved cell tolerance for all derivatives compared to Aureothin. Several fluorine-containing derivatives were identified with similarly potent anti-HIV activity as Aureothin (
 <bold>#6</bold>, 
 <bold>#7</bold>, 
 <bold>#14</bold>). Particularly compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>, which contains a trifluoromethyl- replacing the nitro-group, was most effective in achieving&gt;90% inhibition of HIV infection in PBMCs (IC
 <sub>90</sub> &lt;45 nM). Substitutions by chlorine (compound 
 <bold>#3</bold>, 
 <bold>#13</bold>) resulted in weaker compounds (IC
 <sub>90</sub> ~2000 to 3000 nM).
