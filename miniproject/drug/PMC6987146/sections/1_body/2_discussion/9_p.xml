<p id="Par47">In this study we show that compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> effectively inhibits a spectrum of clinical isolates that includes all HIV genotypes (HIV-type 1 and HIV-type 2) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), including a virus isolate with multiple drug resistance mutations. The broad and potent inhibitory activity of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> against multiple HIV genotypes is in line with a cell-focused mode-of-action. In contrast, some compounds designed to interfere with viral components show selective inhibition of individual HIV genotypes. For example, the HIV fusion inhibitor Enfuvirtide and the NNRTI Efavirenz, standardly used for treatment of HIV-1, are ineffective against HIV-2 because the virus is intrinsically resistant to these compounds

 </sup>. This suggests a therapeutic potential of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> for treatment of HIV-2 infections, which often remain undetected and may not be effectively treated with regimens designed for treatment of HIV-1.
