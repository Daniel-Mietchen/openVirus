<p id="Par6">The aim of this study was to identify new anti-HIV structures that differ both chemically and functionally from current therapeutic drugs. We report a new class of synthetic HIV inhibitors with a scaffold based on the natural polyketide Aureothin. HIV inhibitory activity of prototypical compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> was apparent in primary HIV-target cells, directed against multiple HIV genotypes, including clinical HIV-type 1 and HIV-type 2 isolates, and synergized with clinical anti-HIV drugs. Compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment inhibited expression of HIV structural components on protein and RNA levels. We conclude that this class of compounds has the potential to advance the development of novel anti-HIV therapeutic agents and to expand options for anti-HIV treatment.
