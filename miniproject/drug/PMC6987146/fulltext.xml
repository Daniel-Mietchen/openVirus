Thus, the mode-of-action displayed by compound <bold>#7</bold> is different from those of all current clinical drugs. Proteomic analysis indicated that compound <bold>#7</bold> does not affect global protein expression in primary blood cells and may modulate cellular pathways linked to HIV infection.

HIV treatment was revolutionized by the development of potent antiviral drugs. Their availability and use in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has turned a positive HIV diagnosis from a certain death sentence to a manageable disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Successful drug therapy (i.e. sustained suppression of virus load to undetectable levels) has also been shown to dramatically limit rates of transmission in serodiscordant couples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, antiviral drugs taken as prophylactic measure prior to exposure strongly reduce the risk of virus transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, further demonstrating the importance of anti-HIV drugs for transmission control. Overall, anti-HIV drugs are key to controlling and overcoming the HIV pandemic and preventing AIDS.</p><p id="Par3">The main goal of cART is to suppress virus replication to undetectable levels and to minimize the emergence and transmission of drug resistant variants. Unfortunately, global HIV drug resistance is on the rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This pertains both to pre-treatment drug resistance levels, which in 6 of 11 countries exceeded 10%, as well as prevalence of drug resistance acquired during cART treatment (4&#x02013;28%). Therefore, a major target of the global action plan for overcoming HIV/AIDS is the intensification of research for the development of new treatments and drugs. These are also needed to improve individualization of antiretroviral therapy and to block HIV production by cell populations with persisting, integrated HIV proviruses.</p><p id="Par4">Clinical anti-HIV drugs interfere with the HIV replication cycle at the steps of HIV entry, reverse transcription, integration and maturation of virus particles after release from the host cell. Most clinical drugs inhibit steps of the replication cycle catalysed by HIV enzymes (i.e. protease, integrase and reverse transcriptase). cART combines three active drugs, of which two are nucleotide or nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI) inhibitors and the third is from a different class, i.e. a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease or integrase inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Currently no approved clinical drugs prevent expression of virion components from integrated proviruses.</p><p id="Par5">Natural products provide a rich source of novel structures for drug discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. About 50% of drugs approved by the FDA between 1981 and 2010 were derived from or inspired by natural compounds. These also include a number of anti-infective drugs.</p><p id="Par6">The aim of this study was to identify new anti-HIV structures that differ both chemically and functionally from current therapeutic drugs. We report a new class of synthetic HIV inhibitors with a scaffold based on the natural polyketide Aureothin. HIV inhibitory activity of prototypical compound <bold>#7</bold> was apparent in primary HIV-target cells, directed against multiple HIV genotypes, including clinical HIV-type 1 and HIV-type 2 isolates, and synergized with clinical anti-HIV drugs. Compound <bold>#7</bold> treatment inhibited expression of HIV structural components on protein and RNA levels. We conclude that this class of compounds has the potential to advance the development of novel anti-HIV therapeutic agents and to expand options for anti-HIV treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of bacterial &#x003b3;-pyrone polyketides (Aureothin/Neoaureothin) as potent HIV inhibitors</title><p id="Par7">To identify natural compounds with anti-HIV activity we screened a collection of 10,000 natural compounds: Anti-HIV activity was evaluated by determining compound effects on infectious virus production by LC5-RIC cells which are highly susceptible for HIV and contain a DsRed1-encoding reporter gene activated by HIV-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

This was also observed for CD4+ enriched cells (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Enrichment analysis of GO-, MeSH-terms and pathways identified various terms connected with the immune system and with viral (including HIV) infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Several terms were enriched only in HIV-exposed compound <bold>#7</bold> treated cultures. However, the overall results indicate that whole proteomics analysis, by itself, is not sufficient for identification of specific signalling pathways and single genes targeted by compound <bold>#7</bold>. Thus the effect of compound <bold>#7</bold> on cellular processes specific for HIV-exposed human primary blood cells awaits further elucidation, possibly by combining results from multiple systems approaches.</p><p id="Par47">In this study we show that compound <bold>#7</bold> effectively inhibits a spectrum of clinical isolates that includes all HIV genotypes (HIV-type 1 and HIV-type 2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), including a virus isolate with multiple drug resistance mutations. The broad and potent inhibitory activity of compound <bold>#7</bold> against multiple HIV genotypes is in line with a cell-focused mode-of-action. In contrast, some compounds designed to interfere with viral components show selective inhibition of individual HIV genotypes. For example, the HIV fusion inhibitor Enfuvirtide and the NNRTI Efavirenz, standardly used for treatment of HIV-1, are ineffective against HIV-2 because the virus is intrinsically resistant to these compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. This suggests a therapeutic potential of compound <bold>#7</bold> for treatment of HIV-2 infections, which often remain undetected and may not be effectively treated with regimens designed for treatment of HIV-1.</p><p id="Par48">The standard anti-HIV drug therapy involves the combination of drugs from different classes that target at least two different steps of the HIV replication cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Since compound <bold>#7</bold> acts on a step different from all known drugs it is an excellent candidate for combination anti-HIV therapy. In support, we demonstrate its capacity to synergize with several clinical anti-HIV drugs.</p><p id="Par49">We conclude that the compounds described here represent a promising new class of powerful HIV inhibitors that are chemically and functionally different from all current clinical anti-HIV drugs. The prototypical compound <bold>#7</bold> inhibits HIV gene expression, with strong effects on production of components of virus particles, thus interfering with a stage of the virus replication cycle not attacked by clinical drugs so far. Proteomics analysis of treatment effects on PBMCs indicated no general disturbance of cellular protein expression, and revealed moderate HIV-selective responses. In addition we show that these compounds can synergize with selected clinical drugs in cell culture experiments and that they are active against multiple HIV genotypes. Future studies will be directed towards the use of these compounds to identify virus-host interactions that represent novel points of attack for HIV inhibition as well as further exploration of the potential of these compounds for development into drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Viruses and virus production</title><p id="Par50">HIV-1 stocks of the laboratory isolate HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> were produced by transfection of HEK293T cells with the proviral plasmid pLAI.2 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH, from Dr. Keith Peden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>) as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par51">Isolation of primary clinical HIV-isolates HIV-1M<sub>MVP899-87</sub>, HIV-1O<sub>MVP5180-91</sub>, HIV-1<sub>V13-03413B</sub> and HIV-2<sub>MVP10668-93</sub> is described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.
