<p>To evaluate the robustness of the model, a univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) was performed. The listed transition probabilities were varied via their minimum and maximum values, while the outcomes, direct costs of the disease status were varied by ±25%. For changes in pension benefits, indirect costs were also varied by ±25%. Based on a high dynamic in the costs for DAA drugs, the individual cost components of medical care were varied by ±50%. Additionally, the effect of cirrhosis on the result was determined by assuming that all patients entering the model were allocable to the (non-)cirrhotic disease status.</p>
