<p>In the second and last part of this evaluation, we carried out a prospective study using results from retrospective analysis. Within this analysis, the SVR12 rate was used as a clinical parameter for measuring the medical effectiveness of antiviral treatments on HCV infections. This approach is in line with the decision of the Joint Federal Committee (GBA) and the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWIG). In the absence of information on the achievement of SVR12, the corresponding cost and performance curves were considered and one or no SVR12 was assumed. Most of the study cohort had an HCV genotype 1 infection and prior experience with treatment. The main DAA regimen used was sofosbuvir (SOF) combined with ledipasvir (LDV) (Â±RBV) [
