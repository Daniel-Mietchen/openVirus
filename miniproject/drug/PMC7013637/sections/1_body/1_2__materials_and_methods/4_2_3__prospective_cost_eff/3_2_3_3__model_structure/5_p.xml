<p>To enable a comparison of the benefits and costs of DAA therapies with alternative therapies from the past, the model was run using the same cohort treated with triple therapy. Here, relevant model assumptions such as SVR12 and cost parameters were adjusted accordingly. Because cost calculation was not possible based on the data, we assumed the cost of triple therapy to be approximately 50% of the cost of DAA therapy. Information from literature supports this assumption [

The model was programmed for both therapies using Microsoft Excel Version 3.0, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA (released 2013).
