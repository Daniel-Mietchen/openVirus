<p>To determine the long-term cost effectiveness of interferon-free drugs, a Markov model was developed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-00440-f001">Figure 1</xref>). A Markov model was used to predict the clinical course of hepatitis C in the case of unsuccessful therapy and the associated long-term costs for the BGW. The model takes into account the costs incurred by patients in the year subsequent to the treatment. This allowed direct costs associated with medical treatment and indirect costs such as pension benefits to be allocated to the stages. The majority of HP with recognised CHC had a HCV genotype 1 infection and experienced previous treatment [

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The model takes into account the clinical progression of a CHC infection. Progress is denoted by various disease statuses (non-cirrhotic, cirrhotic, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, (post-)liver transplantation, liver-related death).
