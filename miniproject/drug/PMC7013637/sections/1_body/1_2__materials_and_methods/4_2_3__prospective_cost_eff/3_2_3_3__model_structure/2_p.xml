<p>Given the lack of clinical information in the data set, differentiation was performed based on disease status (e.g., cirrhosis). In line with Westermann and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we assumed that cirrhosis was present where RWA was at least 50%. To verify the correlation between an RWA ≥50% and the presence of cirrhosis in the DAA study cohort, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used. The significance of the correlations was tested using Fisher’s exact test.
