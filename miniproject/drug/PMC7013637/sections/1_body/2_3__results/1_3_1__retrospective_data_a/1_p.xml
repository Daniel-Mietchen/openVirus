<p>We analysed data from 820 HP affected by an occupational HCV infection between 2000 and 2017. The expenses for pensions and medical benefits of HP are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-00440-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Compensation payments for medical treatment (outpatient and inpatient treatments and drugs) and pensions have developed differently over the period under review. Annual expenses rose from €29,000 to €3.9 million from 2000 to 2005, remaining at an annual expense of approximately €4 million between 2005 and 2011 before peaking at around €11 million in 2015. In all years except 2014 and 2015, payments for pensions dominated the cost of compensation. With the introduction of the second-generation DAAs in 2014, there was also an increase in costs for the BGW. This was due to the fact that the costs for drug therapy were significantly higher compared to those for interferon-based therapy. In addition, many cases from previous years in which treatment was unsuccessful were again treated with DAAs, especially when DAAs had just been introduced. The total annual expenditure and the costs for medical treatments have declined since 2015. In 2016, the cost for drugs alone went below the annual cost for pension benefits.
