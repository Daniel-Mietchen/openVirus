<p>Assuming that pension payments will fall by 25% over the following years due to the higher recovery rates, this would also have a strong impact on the total costs for the BGW. Where costs increase, the result reacts sensitively. The fibrosis/cirrhosis status of the patient also has a considerable impact on total cost. Treatment of insured persons without cirrhosis correlates with a cost reduction. Varying transition probabilities in the model only have a minor effect on the overall result (
