<p>The use of DAA therapies has fundamentally changed the treatment of CHC infections. However, the high success rates (SVR12) do come at higher costs compared to triple therapies. The results of the CEA show that DAA therapies are more effective, but also more expensive. At the same time, sensitivity analyses show that the statutory accident insurance can save costs if the treatment is carried out promptly. In addition, variations in costs and SVR12 rates also had the greatest impact on the results under the Markov model. In particular, the recently introduced, more favourable DAA regimens promise to improve cost effectiveness through shorter treatment duration and higher success rates. To examine the impact of DAA treatment more comprehensively, prospective studies are required. These should document relevant clinical and patient-related endpoints and analyse the long-term benefit of the new drugs.</p>
