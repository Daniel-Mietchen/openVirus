<p>These data, based on BGW benefits records, only allow average direct costs to be calculated for the stages “SVR12—non-cirrhotic”, “SVR12—cirrhotic”, “non-SVR12—non-cirrhotic”, and “non-SVR12—cirrhotic”. Cost values expressed by Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were used for all remaining stages in the model. Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] based their work on findings by Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Siebert et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and Wasem et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These used values apply to the circumstances of a statutory health insurance. Expenditures specific to accident insurance such as costs for reports and expert appraisals have not been taken into account, whereas pension payments were obtained from occupational disease records. This means that the average cost for the BGW in the “decompensated cirrhosis” and stages of progression from there may potentially be understated. This CEA is based on real-world data from insured HP of the BGW, reflecting the distribution in the population studied. It was expected that the insured HP would mainly be women (typical for the gender distribution in health care professions in Germany) with many years of experience in illness and therapy [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], advanced age has no negative influence on successful DAA treatment.
