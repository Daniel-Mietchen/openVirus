<p>Restrictions that generally apply for secondary data also apply to the data from the BGW in this analysis. [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The lack of disease-specific information is a particular limitation of the model. The data on the effectiveness of interferon-based and DAA therapies used in the model are based on the results of a literature review. These are only applicable to clinical practice to a limited extent. Data from the occupational disease database confirm the high SVR12 rates for DAA treatment, amounting to 97%. In contrast, the SVR12 rates according to Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] used in the model for the DAA regimen are 95.4% or 96.1%, depending on cirrhosis status, so the effectiveness is understated somewhat. The use of cirrhosis as a predictor for significantly reduced success rates (SVR12) is not reflected in the model. While no significant difference between SVR12 rates in relation to DAA treatment and cirrhosis is apparent in Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a previous study by Westermann et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found a significant reduction in SVR12 in cirrhotic patients. The assumed recovery rates in the case of triple therapy (BOC + PEG-IFN + RBV) are based on the study by Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The benefits of DAA therapy would probably be greater if a comparison was done with PEG-IFN + RBV therapy instead of triple therapy. In patients without available information regarding the cirrhosis status, we assumed a correlation with RWA levels â‰¥50%, which was confirmed to be positive to a statistically significant degree (
