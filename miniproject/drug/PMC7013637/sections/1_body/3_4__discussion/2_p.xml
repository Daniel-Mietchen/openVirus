<p>Several studies have analysed the cost effectiveness of DAAs in an international comparison, however for Germany there are as yet only a small number. In our analysis, the SVR12 rate was used as a clinical parameter for measuring the medical effectiveness of treatments on HCV infections. The benefit value was therefore applied in additional SVR12 percentage points. This approach is in line with the resolution of the Joint Federal Committee (GBA) and the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWIG), thus the results of this CEA can be applied directly in clinical practice. As in our study, the benefits were measured using the SVR12 rate in a CEA from Germany [

In contrast to the present study, the Markov model was developed for treatment-naive patients treated with the DAAs SOF and/or simeprevir (SMV). The ICER for Gissel et al. [
