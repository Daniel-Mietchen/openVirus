<p>Based on a group of insured HP, the cost effectiveness of DAA treatment regimens could be analysed for the first time in Germany, taking pension payments into account. Our results show cost effectiveness for these treatments assuming willingness to pay of an additional €35,167 per patient over 20 years. This result is comparable with findings from available literature [

This means that it takes €766.19 to generate an extra percentage point for the SVR12 as a result of the switch from triple therapy to DAAs. DAA therapy proved to be an effective treatment strategy. After treatment with the DAAs, an RWA of &lt;50% was documented for 82%, whereas this value was 77% before treatment. In the study cohort, treatment with DAAs was also associated with a reduction in life years lost. This result is consistent with information from available literature [
