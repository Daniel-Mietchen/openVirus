   </sup> mice infected intradermally with CHIKV C21 (10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU) and killed at the appearance of paralysis. (

   <bold>d</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>) Effect of daily tivozanib (tivo) treatment on C57BL/6 mouse survival, paralysis and body weight change in response to CHIKV C21 infection. (
   <bold>g</bold>) Health status of each mouse with paralysis, estimated by measuring the area under the body weight curve. (
   <bold>h</bold>) CHIKV viral load measured 3 days post infection in the indicated organs obtained from mice treated with tivozanib as in 
   <bold>c</bold> (
   <italic>n</italic>=9 for all data sets). (
   <bold>i</bold>,

   <italic>per os</italic>, 
   <italic>n</italic>=15 for both data sets) or TOFA (i.p., 
   <italic>n</italic>=11 for both data sets) or the corresponding vehicles before infection with CHIKV C21 (10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU). Data in 
   <bold>b</bold>,

   <bold>h</bold>,
   <bold>i</bold> and 
   <bold>j</bold> as the median±interquartile range; each dot represents one mouse. All data obtained from at least two independent experiments. Statistics were calculated using Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test in 
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>d</bold> and 
   <bold>e</bold>, two-sided 
   <italic>t</italic>-test for two independent samples in 
   <bold>g</bold> and Mann–Whitney test in

   <bold>j</bold>, (*
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05;
