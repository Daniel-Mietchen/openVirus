  <title>Primary screen for CHIKV host cell factors.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Outline of screening procedure. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Heatmap of all identified proviral and antiviral hits showing replication data (
   <italic>Z</italic>-scores) of the four most efficient siRNAs. Arrowheads indicate genes experimentally characterized in this study. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Requirement of identified proviral factors for other viruses based on published loss-of-function studies. Viruses other than CHIKV are indicated by specific colours, and colour-coded boxes contain genes shared between CHIKV and the corresponding virus. White boxes contain genes shared between CHIKV and more than one other virus. Full details in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Heatmap illustrating the replication capability of CHIKV in Cas9-positive HEK-293T cells expressing the indicated gRNAs. Cells were infected with CHIK-GFP at MOI 6 for 24 h (
   <italic>n</italic>=9). (
   <bold>e</bold>) Validation of CLK1 as CHIKV relevant host factor. Infection rate of A549 cells depleted for CLK1 by CRISPR/Cas9 (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref> for more details) and infected with CHIKV-GFP for the indicated periods of time (
   <italic>n</italic>=9 for each data set). Data represent the means±s.e.m. of three independent experiments and were analysed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post test. (*
