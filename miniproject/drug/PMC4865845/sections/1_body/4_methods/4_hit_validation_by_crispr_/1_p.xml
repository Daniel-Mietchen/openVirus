<p>Cas9-expressing HEK-293T and A549 cells were generated by transducing them first with lentiviruses based on the plasmid lentiCas9-Blast (Addgene number 52962), followed by selection with blasticidine for 10 days. Cells were then transduced with lentiviruses derived from the plasmid lentiGuide-Puro

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>. Cas9-positive HEK-293T cells expressing individual gRNAs were generated by keeping cells under selection medium containing blasticidine (5 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) and puromycin (2 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) for an additional 10 days. A549 cells depleted for CLK1 were generated accordingly, but in this case single-cell clones were generated, which were kept under selection medium containing blasticidine (10 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) and puromycin (2.5 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) for an additional 10 days and subsequently analysed using the GeneArt Genomic Cleavage Detection Kit (Life Technologies) and the following oligonucleotides: CLK1_up: 5′-TGGAGTAGAGTGGCACGATG-3′; CLK1_down: 5′-GGATGCTTTAAGGCTTCTCTGA-3′ (uncropped gel presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). After the selection process, gRNA-expressing HEK-293T and A549 cells were infected with CHIKV-GFP for the periods of time and at MOIs as indicated.
