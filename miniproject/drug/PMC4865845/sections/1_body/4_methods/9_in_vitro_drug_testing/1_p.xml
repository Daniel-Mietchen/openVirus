<p>The following drugs were used following solubilization in DMSO: tivozanib (Selleck, 43.96 mM stock), cerulenin (TEBU, 50 mM stock), KH-CB19 (R&amp;D Systems, 10 mM stock), bafilomycin (50 μM stock), pimozide (10 mM stock), W7 (53 mM stock), TOFA (10 mM stock), BMS-303141 (25 mM stock) and (15:3)-anacardic acid (10 mM stock; all from Sigma). To determine the step of the viral cycle affected by chemical compounds, HEK-293T cells (seeded the day before on poly-
 <sc>L</sc>-lysine-coated plates) were either treated 2 h before or 2 h after cell infection with CHIKV C21 (MOI 40) and left until 8 h p.i. Viral infection was quantified by flow cytometry measurement of the % of capsid-expressing cells. Equal amounts of supernatants (3 μl) from the 2 h post treatment conditions were then measured for viral infectivity on Vero cells (final volume: 150 μl). The percentage of infected cells was measured by flow cytometry at the end of the experiment. For cell viability analysis, we took advantage of the high-precision measurement of the acquired volumes made by the MACSQuant VYB cytometers. Then, knowing the initial volume of cells, the acquired volume and the acquired number of events, we estimated the total number of cells per well. Cell staining for these experiments was performed in V-bottom 96-well plates (Nunc).
