<p>All animal experiments were conducted according to project #2014-0019, which was approved by the Institut Pasteur Animal Ethics Committee on 17 October 2014. Two different mouse models of CHIKV infection were used for our studies: (i) the intradermal infection model of neonatal mice, characterized by CHIKV dissemination through the bloodstream, replication in different organs (liver, spleen, muscles and joints) and association with paralysis and death

 <italic>Clk1</italic> conditional knockout mice (C57BL/6NTac-Clk&lt;tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi&gt;/Ics) were purchased from ICS, France. Clk1 cKO mice were subsequently mated with Flp deleter (C57BL/6-Glipr2&lt;GtIST12674H5TIGM&gt;/J) and Cre deleter transgenic mice (B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J) to remove the Î²Geo cassette and the critical exons to generate 
 <italic>clk1</italic> null alleles. Constitutive 
 <italic>clk1</italic> knockout mice were further backcrossed into the C57BL/6J background (
 <italic>N</italic>=9, 
 <italic>F</italic>=4). The wild-type C57BL/6J mice used for backcrossing were derived from the same unit and exposed to the same diet as the Clk1 null mice that were used as controls in those experiments. Mice were intradermally infected with CHIKV C21 (10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU), weighed daily and killed at the appearance of paralysis.
