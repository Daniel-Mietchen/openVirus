<p>HEK-293 cells were used for the screening because of their concomitant permissiveness to CHIKV infection and to high-efficiency siRNA transfection. Transfections of siRNAs in a 384-well plate format were carried out as recently described
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Briefly, all siRNAs (Qiagen Hu_Genome 1.0 and Human Druggable Genome siRNA Set V2.0; Qiagen) were arrayed in 384-well plates. To each well, 8 μl of serum-free RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 3.75% HiPerFect (Qiagen) was added. After 20-min incubation at room temperature, 30 μl of cell suspension containing 1,250 cells was added to give a final siRNA concentration of ∼20 nM. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 72 h before infection with 3.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> plaque-forming units (PFUs). At 18 h post infection, cells were fixed and nuclei stained with Hoechst. Infection protocol was set-up to reach ∼50% of infected cells at the end of the experiment, thus enabling the identification of both proviral and antiviral genes.
