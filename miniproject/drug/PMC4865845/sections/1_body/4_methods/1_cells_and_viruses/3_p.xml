<p>A CHIKV replicon vector, expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) fused with nsP3 and firefly luciferase (Ffluc) under the subgenomic promoter (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>, cells were infected with a CHIKV replicon vector expressing only Fluc under the subgenomic promoter. Chikungunya viral replicon particles (VRPs) were produced using the split-helper system as described previously
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In short, three different vRNAs were produced 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion)) from separate plasmids: replicon RNA (including the 5′ and 3′ CHIKV replication signals but lacking the structural genes) and two different helper RNAs for the expression of capsid protein and envelope proteins. Three transcribed RNAs were electroporated into BHK-21 cells and kept at 32 °C for 72 h before collecting the media to collect VRPs. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to titre VRPs.
