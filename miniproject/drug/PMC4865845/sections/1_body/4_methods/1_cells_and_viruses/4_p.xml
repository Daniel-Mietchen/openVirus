<p>GFP-expressing recombinant viruses used in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> were cowpox virus strain Brighton Red vBRFseR (CPXV; provided by K. Tischer, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany), herpes simplex virus 1 strain KOS K26GFP (HSV-1; provided by P. Desai, John Hopkins University, USA) and Adenovirus serotype 5 expressing GFP from CMV immediate-early promoter (Ad5). Virus stocks were grown in Vero E6 cells (HSV-1, CPXV) or HEK-293 cells (Ad5) for 5–10 days before being collected, resuspended in PBS and lysed by three sequential freeze–thaws. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, stocks were frozen at −80 °C until use. Highly pure stocks of adenovirus were generated by two sequential CsCl centrifugation steps followed by dialysis and freezing at −80 °C until use. Viral titre of the frozen stocks was determined by both GFP expression at 1 day post infection and plaque formation at 7 days post infection of Vero E6 or HEK-293 cells. Virus stocks were &gt;98% pure for GFP expression. The IAV/WSN/1933(H1N1) (provided by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, USA) was produced by reverse genetics as described
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, subsequently propagated in the allantoic cavaties of 9- or 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and used for experimentation.
