<p>The HEK-293 cells (CRL-1573, ATCC-LGC) used for the genome-wide screening, the drug screening and the drugs testing on different viral species were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies 31966-047) supplemented with 4 mM 
 <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, 100 U ml
 <sup>−1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FCS. The HEK-293T cells (CRL-3216, ATCC-LGC) used for the CRISPR/Cas9 validation were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies 31966-047) supplemented with 4 mM 
 <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, 100 U ml
 <sup>−1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FCS. The HEK-293T cells (CRL-3216, ATCC-LGC) and HeLa cells used for follow-up studies were cultured in DMEM (high glucose, GlutaMAX, pyruvate) supplemented with 100 U ml
 <sup>−1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies 15140-122) and 10% FCS. Human lung epithelial A549 cells (CCL-185, ATCC-LGC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 4 mM 
 <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U ml
 <sup>−1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FCS. Vero cells (CCL-81, ATCC-LGC) were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 100 U ml
 <sup>−1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin and 5% FCS for cell passaging and 2% FCS for viral titration with the TCID50 assay. C6/36 cells (CRL-1573, ATCC-LGC) were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Life Technologies 11415-049) supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.01 g ml
 <sup>−1</sup> tryptose phosphate broth and 1 × minimum essential media (MEM) non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies 11140-050). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> with the exception of C6/36 that were cultured at 28 °C with no CO
 <sub>2</sub>.
