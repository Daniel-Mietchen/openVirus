<p>The validation was performed based on the primary hit list, thereby focusing not only on proviral but also on antiviral factors. Although the validation was experimentally identical to the primary screening, the hit selection varied slightly: after filtering out 133 toxic siRNAs, the

However, instead of using the RSA analysis, which has limitations in analysing data sets consisting of siRNAs that should theoretically all influence CHIKV replication, we computed the cSSMD based on the normalized per cent inhibition of individual siRNAs, by assessing the collective activity of multiple siRNAs relative to the control
