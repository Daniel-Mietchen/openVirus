<p>For identification of primary hits, mainly the inhibitory effect on CHIKV, replication was taken into consideration. To reduce possible off-target or other unspecific effects and to maximize the robustness of the hit selection, two additional parameters were analysed: (i) non-expressed genes were excluded by determining constitutive or inducible expression via microarray profiling of non-infected and infected HEK-293 cells (7,561 genes were filtered out). (ii) Using the microscopic assay applied throughout the primary screen, toxic siRNAs, which reduced total cell numbers (&lt;1,000 cells per well) on transfection were excluded. In this way, 3,274 siRNAs (targeting 2,635 different genes) were excluded from further analysis. The statistical analysis of the revised raw data was performed using cellHTS2 (ref.
