<p>To analyse primary infection of herpes simplex type 1 strain KOS (HSV-1), cowpox strain Brighton Red (CPXV) or adenovirus strain 5 (Ad5), HEK-293 cells were washed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with small molecules (73-0.033 μM in eight steps, alternatively for Bafilomycin 73-0.033 nM in eight steps) or an equivalent of DMSO under normal culture conditions. Cells were subsequently inoculated with GFP-expressing HSV-1, CPXV or Ad5 at MOI 5 (HSV-1) or MOI 2 (CPXV and Ad5) for 24 h before being fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. All virus strains expressed GFP, and the presence of GFP was determined by microscopic analysis performed as described previously
