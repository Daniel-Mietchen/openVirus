<p>For screening of compounds with CHIKV, HEK-293 cells were pretreated on 384-well plates with the various substances in eight different 1:3 dilutions 2 h before infection. Infection was performed using 3.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU CHIKV-GFP per well. At 18 h p.i., cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and the percentage of infected to non-infected cells quantified by staining nuclei with Hoechst, followed by automated microscopy and single object analysis. On the basis of the results of the eight different dilutions, dose–response curves were calculated using the R software package drc
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and the half-maximal inhibitory concentrationvalues of each compound determined. All multi-well pipetting steps were performed as described above.
