<p>The same compound concentrations were used to test the antiviral efficacy against IAV/WSN/33 (IAV) viruses. Human lung epithelial A549 cells were pretreated with small molecules for 2 h and then inoculated with WSN at MOI 0.02. After 40 min, infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 4 mM 
 <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, antibiotics and TPCK-treated trypsin (1 μg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>), Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the cells were incubated under normal culture conditions for 36 h. Virus load was determined by inoculating MDCK cells (seeded the day before) with the supernatants, followed by fluorescence microscopic analysis of infection. For this, MDCK cells were washed and inoculated with undiluted supernatant for 1 h. Virus was removed and MDCK cells were cultivated for 6 h under normal culture conditions with infection medium. Cells were stained for viral NP protein and nuclei, and the infection rate (that is, the rate of NP-positive cells) was determined as described previously
