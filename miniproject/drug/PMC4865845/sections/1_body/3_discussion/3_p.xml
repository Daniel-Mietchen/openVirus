<p>This proof-of-concept study, based on a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, led to the identification of antiviral targets, pathways and compounds for which antiviral efficacy was proven 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, although it did not completely block viral replication in this setting. Additional studies will be required for the selection of the best target inhibitors and lead optimization, before clinical development. Since our approach led to the selection of a number of independent targets and pathways, and for each of those to the identification of multiple antiviral compounds, pre-clinical studies may exploit the potential synergistic effect of drug combination. With this in mind, we showed that the combination of two drugs targeting independent cellular pathways (TOFA and pimozide) have an increased activity when combined 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, where it exhibits a therapeutic antiviral effect.
