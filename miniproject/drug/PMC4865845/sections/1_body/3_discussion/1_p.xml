<p>Despite major outbreaks over the past decade in Africa, the Indian Ocean and Asia and its recent emergence in the Americas, still little is known regarding CHIKV cell biology. CHIKV infection in human is associated with acute and chronic symptoms, which pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and there is no commercially available vaccine or drugs to tackle this global public health issue. To better characterize CHIKV interaction with human cells, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and report here on the identification of 156 cellular factors required for CHIKV life cycle and 46 antiviral factors. Importantly, follow-up studies of those hits led to the identification of molecular pathways and cellular functions required for multiple steps of CHIKV life cycle, from viral entry, replication to viral release. For example, we demonstrated the critical role of the vacuolar ATPase in viral entry, and lipid biosynthesis in vRNA replication and release. Therefore, our study represents a major advance in the field of CHIVK cell biology, and will pave the way for detailed mechanistic studies for each of the pro- and anti-CHIKV host factors we have identified, similarly to other loss-of-function screens published for other human viruses
