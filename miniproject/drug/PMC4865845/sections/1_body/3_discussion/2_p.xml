<p>We followed an innovative translational approach by directly exploiting the results of the genome-wide loss-of-function screen to identify druggable pathways and corresponding antiviral compounds. Indeed, using a drug repositioning strategy, we identified a series of chemical inhibitors, directed against five druggable proviral hits, with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral activity, either alone or in combination. Since some of the drugs are already Food and Drug Administration approved for other diseases, this has the potential to considerably shorten the time-consuming and expensive ‘hit-to-lead' and ‘lead-optimization' phases, making our approach of particular interest for antiviral drug discovery in the field of emerging infectious diseases. Importantly, most of the identified proviral hits and all druggable targets we followed up are also critical for the replication of other very diverse viral species (including IAV, SINV, HIV-1 and HCV; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), highlighting the relevance of this strategy for the identification of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds and the potential for broadly active, host-directed, antiviral therapies (for example, pimozide that had an antiviral effect both for CHIKV and HSV-1 in
