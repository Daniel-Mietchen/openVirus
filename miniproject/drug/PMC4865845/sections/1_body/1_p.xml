<p>RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated loss-of-function screens have enabled the identification of novel host factors and pathways that are either important for replication (proviral) or limit replication (antiviral) of different viruses

Here we perform a host genome-wide loss-of-function screen to identify the host factors implicated in CHIKV replication in human cells. We analyse the cellular pathways and factors necessary for CHIKV infection and identify antiviral drugs with both
