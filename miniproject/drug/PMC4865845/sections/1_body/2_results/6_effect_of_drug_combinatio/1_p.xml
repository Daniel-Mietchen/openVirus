<p>Having identified and characterized compounds with anti-CHIKV activity both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we combined drugs to improve antiviral activity. We focused on pimozide and TOFA, since they both demonstrated an antiviral effect in the same mouse model of CHIKV infection. We initially tested the effect of drugs administrated in combination on HEK-293T cells infected with CHIKV for 1 h. In comparison with monotherapy, TOFA and pimozide combination resulted in increased inhibition of CHIKV infection rate (5 μM each, interaction effect=0.44; lower=0.36; upper=0.54; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, two-factor design method) and CHIKV release (5 μM each, interaction effect=3.44; lower=0.68; upper=17.41; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.133, two-factor design method), with no deleterious effect on cell viability (

 <italic>in vivo</italic>, in adult mice therapeutically treated with pimozide and TOFA alone or in combination. Importantly, pimozide and TOFA combination caused a significant reduction in CHIKV replication (

 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, two-factor design method) and in CHIKV-induced joint swelling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>) (interaction effect=0.94; lower=0.79; upper=1.13; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.506, two-factor design method), when therapeutically administrated to infected adult mice, suggesting that combining different drugs identified in the RNAi screen increases their antiviral effect.
