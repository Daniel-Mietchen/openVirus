<p>Since five of these six druggable hits were also identified as proviral factors in other RNAi screens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>), we sought to characterize the efficacy of inhibitors of these hits on the replication of a wide spectrum of viral species. Cells were treated with specific inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, calmodulin signalling, FLT4 and vATPase, and infected with cytosolic double-stranded DNA virus (cowpox, CPXV), nuclear double-stranded DNA virus (herpes simplex type 1, HSV-1, or adenovirus type 5, Ad5) or negative-stranded segmented RNA virus (IAV) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, differences in the antiviral activity of these compounds were observed between viral species, suggesting that the identified cellular pathways are required for the replication of several, but not all virus types, and that the antiviral effect observed for CHIKV is genuine and not the consequence of a general toxic effect on cell metabolism induced by the inhibitors.
