<p>We next characterized the step in CHIKV replication cycle targeted by the specific inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, calmodulin signalling and FLT4 that act after entry. Infected HeLa cells were exposed to cerulenin, TOFA, pimozide, W7, tivozanib or vehicle only (DMSO). All the tested inhibitors significantly reduced vRNA synthesis (
