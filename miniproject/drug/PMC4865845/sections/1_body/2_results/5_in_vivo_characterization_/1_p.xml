<p>We next aimed at translating these 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We therefore generated C57BL/6
 <sup>
  <italic>clk1</italic>−/−
 </sup> mice (see Methods) and investigated the requirement for CLK1 in CHIKV 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infection
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Weight-matched 9-day-old C57BL/6
 <sup>
  <italic>clk1</italic>−/−
 </sup> mice developed significantly less paralysis (∼50%) than control isogenic mice (5.8%; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.005, log-rank test; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>), identifying CLK1 as a valid 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> target for antiviral drug development. To analyse the antiviral effect of tivozanib (targeting FLT4) 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, 7-day-old C57BL/6 mice were treated with the drug or vehicle only for 2 days and infected with CHIKV at day 9. Tivozanib administration was continued for 21 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Tivozanib caused a significant reduction in mortality of CHIKV-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.02, log-rank test), protected from the onset of paralysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.03, log-rank test) and had a positive impact on body weight gain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f,g</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0133, two-sided 
 <italic>t</italic>-test). Tivozanib treatment also significantly reduced CHIKV viral load in different vital organs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>). Finally, we tested the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of the calmodulin inhibitor pimozide and the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor TOFA, which have both been used previously for therapeutic purposes in mice

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. These drugs had a detectable impact on mouse growth and were therefore not used further in neonatal mice, but tested in the adult mouse footpad injection model

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Mice were pretreated for at least 3 days, infected and assessed 18 h p.i. CHIKV titres in the footpad revealed that both the drugs significantly reduced replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6i,j</xref>), indicating that fatty acid synthesis and calmodulin also constitute promising targets for antiviral purposes.
