<p id="p0140">The exact mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against the virus has not been clearly depicted; however, laboratory data show that 4-aminoquinoline compounds (Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) have four mechanisms by which they act against diverse RNA viruses including SARS-CoV1 and reduce the cytokine storm that these viruses can generate.

    <bold>Inhibition of viral entry</bold>: Chloroquine interferes with terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which serves as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. In cell culture chloroquine effectively prevents the spread of SARS CoV and works as a prophylactic [

    <bold>Inhibition of viral release into the host cell</bold>: HCQ is a weak base which rapidly diffuses across membranes of cells and organelles to acidic cytoplasmic vesicles such as endosomes, lysosomes, or Golgi vesicles causing an increase in pH of the organelles. Unlike other enveloped viruses, Coronaviruses bud and assemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). 4-aminoquinoline compounds become highly concentrated in organelles causing dysfunction of enzymes including enzymes needed for proteolytic processing and post-translational modification of viral proteins [
    <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Experimental data from the Wuhan Institute of Virology demonstrated that chloroquine inhibits the replication of the SARS-CoV-2, in part because of its ability to alkalinize endosomal organelles [
    <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hu et al. [
    <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] have proposed that CQ suppresses phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) and thereby prevents endocytosis-mediated uptake of SARS-CoV-2. There is also data that chloroquine interferes with organelle acidification, which may lead to hindering fusion of viral particles, when chloroquine treatment was used for different emerging or non-emerging virus over the previous five decades: Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-3) [

    <bold>Immunomodulation</bold>: At the cellular level, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit immune activation by reducing signaling by Pattern Recognition Receptors (Toll-like receptor signaling) and cytokine production [
    <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hydroxychloroquine also inhibits the activity of the nucleic acid sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) by interfering with its binding to cytosolic DNA. By preventing TLR signaling and cGASâ€“stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling, hydroxychloroquine can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferons [
    <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These drugs also reduce the expression of CD154 (CD40L) on helper T-cells which is essential for a successful antibody response and class switching [
    <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These immunomodulatory actions could help prevent the transition from mild or moderate disease to the dreadful acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by reducing the cytokine storm [
