<p id="p0035">Millions of people are currently exposed to a high risk of contamination. Among them, adults taking care of family members who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at home, and medical and paramedical staffs treating hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19, are highly susceptible to infection and may represent a second wave of extreme importance in the next few weeks.
