Review of the recently shared preliminary results reveals that most of the data, while valuable, fail to provide definitive evidence of effective lead compounds. Mainly this is because most of these initial studies are observational and not controlled studies. Thus, documented treatment is still lacking. In spite of the paucity of clinical evidences of an unequivocal beneficial effect of chloroquine on COVID-19, the absence of an effective treatment so far, the untimely publicity given to the potential effect of chloroquine and the consequent social and political pressure raised the demand for urgent clinical trials and even resulted in the simultaneous release of the drug for its compassionate use in the treatment of severe cases.
