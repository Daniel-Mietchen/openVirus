In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, if clinical evidence from prospective controlled clinical trials confirms the positive impact, its implementation will be urgently needed. Supply shortage of hydroxychloroquine, which remains needed for standard indications such as Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis should be prevented by a significant effort of pharmaceutical companies, already ongoing, for increasing the production of hydroxychloroquine specifically for COVID-19. Other initiative such as the “Defense Production Act” in the US may be activated.</p>
