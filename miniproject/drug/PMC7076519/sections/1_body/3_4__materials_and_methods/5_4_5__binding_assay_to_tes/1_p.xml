<p>The binding assay was performed at 4 °C in order to allow the binding of the virus to the cell receptors, but not the entry as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, the viral suspension was incubated with the NPRE (0.8 mg/mL) and the NP MIX (0.1 mg/mL) for 1 h at 4 °C. Vero cells were then infected with the virus inoculum at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, and the infection was performed at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 1 h. The plates were then washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to remove the unbound virus particles, and fresh media was then added. After 24 h post infection (p.i.), the expression of the VP26 GFP protein was detected by (i) detection of the auto-fluorescence of VP26-tagged protein and (ii) Western blot analysis. For fluorescent microscopy analysis, the samples were layered on polylysinated slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA 4%), washed three times with PBS 1X, and stained with Hoechst 33342. Samples were analyzed on a fluorescence microscope (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany). For Western blot analysis, cellular proteins were extracted using SDS sample buffer 1X and analysed as reported below.
