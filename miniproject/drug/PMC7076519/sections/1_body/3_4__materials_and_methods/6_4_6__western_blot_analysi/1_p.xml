<p>Vero cells (2*10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were cultured in 24-well plates and uninfected (mock) or infected with HSV-1 (F) at MOI 1. The virus was adsorbed on cells for 1 h at 37 °C and then removed. The cells were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of NPRE (0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/mL). A control of the solvent (DMSO) was also included. Cellular proteins were extracted using SDS sample buffer 1X (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8; Dithiothreitol (DTT) 1 M; 10% glycerol; 2% SDS; 0.01% Bromophenol Blue). Equal quantities of proteins were resolved by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad Life Science Research, Hercules, CA, USA). After blocking, the membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies for HSV-1 β proteins ICP8 and UL42, and γ protein US11. Specific proteins were detected using secondary anti-mouse antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The chemiluminescence was detected by Western HRP substrate (Merk, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). The housekeeping GAPDH and β-actin proteins were used as loading control. In the experiment using NP MIX, the Vero cells were treated for 24 h with 0.1 mg/mL and processed as described above. The membrane was probed with a specific antibodies for GFP proteins, and chemiluminescence was detected by Western HRP substrate (Merk, Millipore).
