<p>The data analysis and the graphical representations were performed using the GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was used for the statistical analysis of the data presented as means of three independent experiments ± standard deviations (SD). The asterisks (*, **, and ***) indicate the significance of 
 <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) and half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated from concentration-effect curves by using non-linear regression analysis. Quantitative densitometry analysis of immunoblot band intensity was performed with TINA software (version 2.10, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).
