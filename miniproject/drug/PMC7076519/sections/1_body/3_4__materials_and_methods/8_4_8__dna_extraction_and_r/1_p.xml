<p>Cellular DNA was extracted from Vero cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Vero cells (2*10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were cultured in 24-well plates and uninfected (mock) or infected with HSV-1 (F) at MOI 1 for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then treated with NPRE (0.6 and 0.8 mg/mL) for 24 h. The solvent (DMSO) was used in the control samples. The DNA solutions were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated from the interphase and organic phase with 100% ethanol. The DNA pellet was washed twice in a solution containing 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol and then dissolved in 8 mM NaOH. The concentration of DNA was determined by fluorometer analysis with the Qubit double stranded DNA (dsDNA) HS (High Sensitivity) Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a Cepheid SmartCycler II System (Cepheid Europe, Maurens-Scopont, France), using specific TaqMan probe. Total cellular DNA (1 µg) was mixed with 0.5 μM of each forward and reverse primers, 1 µM of TaqMan probe, 1 µM of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) mix, NH
 <sub>4</sub> reaction buffer 1X, 2 mM of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 5 U/µL of thermostable DNA polymerase BIOTAQ (BIO-21040 Bioline) in a total volume of 25 µL. The oligonucleotide primer pairs were as follows: HSV-1 Fw 5’-catcaccgacccggagagggac; HSV-1 Rev 5’gggccaggcgcttgttggtgta, HSV-1 TaqMan probe 5’-6FAM-ccgccgaactgagcagacacccgcgc-TAMRA, (6FAM is 6-carboxyfluorescein and TAMRA is 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). The amplification was performed following specific steps (10 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 95 °C for 40 cycles, 30 s at 55 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, 5 min at 72 °C) and a negative sample was used as amplification control for each run. The relative quantitation of HSV-1 DNA was generated by comparative C
 <sub>t</sub> method using GAPDH as housekeeping gene.
