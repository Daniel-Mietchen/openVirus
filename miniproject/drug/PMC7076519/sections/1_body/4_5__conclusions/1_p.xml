<p>Our current finding indicates that polyphenols from pistachios are effective against HSV-1. In conclusion, we can assume that the antiviral effects of NPRE are the result of a balance of the individual polyphenolic components that in combination exert the anti-viral activity. Therefore, pistachio polyphenols could become great candidates for the development of novel topical or oral drug formulations for the treatment of HSV-1 infections, either alone or in combination with standard antiviral therapies. However, further studies will be helpful in studying the mechanisms of antiviral activity as well as to identify bioactive compounds responsible for the anti-HSV activity. Thus, amongst other natural products, pistachio extracts could provide a novel treatment against HSV-1 infections, as well as a novel strategy to overcome problems related to drug-resistant strains. The results present here agree with a previous study, in which polyphenols were found to possess, beyond anti-inflammatory properties, antiviral activity also, thus suggesting possible further interest for the pistachio product waste as a source of a new pharmaceutical agent.</p>
