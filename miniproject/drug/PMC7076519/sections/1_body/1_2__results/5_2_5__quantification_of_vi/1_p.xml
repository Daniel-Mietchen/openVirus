<p>In order to investigate whether the decrease on the aforementioned protein level resulted in a decrease of viral DNA synthesis, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR analysis by using specific TaqMan probe for HSV-1. Vero cells were uninfected (mock) or infected with HSV-1 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 and treated or untreated with 0.6 and 0.8 mg/mL of the NPRE for 24 h. Then, the cellular DNA was extracted and precipitated from the interphase and organic phase and used for real-time PCR analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the accumulation of viral DNA was significantly reduced in the infected and treated samples compared to the untreated infected samples, suggesting that the NPRE treatment might have interfered with the DNA synthesis process, and this resulted in a final decrease of viral DNA synthesis.
