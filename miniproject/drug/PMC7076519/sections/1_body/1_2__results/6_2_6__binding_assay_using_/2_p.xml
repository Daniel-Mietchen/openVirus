<p>Consequently, we tried to understand if the antiviral activity was mainly exerted by the more representative polyphenol components present in the NPRE. Indeed recent data obtained in our lab demonstrated that a pure fraction containing the main polyphenol compounds identified in almond skin extracts had both antimicrobial and antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the basis of this, we formulated an NP MIX (0.1 mg/mL) that could have a similar impact on antiviral activity when compared to the polyphenol-rich extracts of natural shelled pistachios. The inhibition of viral replication was evaluated by binding assay using VP26-HSV-1 virus. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows that the treatment with NP MIX resulted in a 50% decrease of the auto-fluorescence of viral protein VP26 (

Because NP MIX did not show a good tolerability due to the significant cytotoxicity effect following the treatment, which resulted in 40% cell proliferation index reduction compared to untreated cells (data not shown), further investigations are needed in order to better understand the behaviour and the tolerability of the NP MIX as well as its antiviral activity.
