<p>The results from the plaque reduction assay showed a significant inhibitory activity by adding the NPRE immediately after the attachment step. This suggests that the effect of NPRE might be related to biochemical events that occurred immediately after this time frame, such as gene expression and protein synthesis of the alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) proteins, which are important for HSV-1 replication. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of NPRE on the expression of HSV-1 proteins, Western blot analysis was performed. Vero cells were uninfected (mock) or infected with HSV-1 and then treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of NPRE in the range of the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/mL) for 24 h and DMSO was used in the control samples. The samples were lysed and the total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The optical densitometry analysis of immunoblot band intensity was quantified with TINA imaging analysis software (version 2.10, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) as relative to the band intensity of housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The analysis revealed that NPRE reduced the accumulation of the tested proteins, particularly the infected cell polypeptide 8 (ICP8) and the unique long UL42 DNA polymerase processivity factor (UL42) β proteins, necessary for viral DNA replication, and the unique short US11 (US11) tegument γ protein. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f003">Figure 3</xref>, although all of the three tested proteins were accumulated in HSV-1-infected and untreated Vero cells (lane 2), infected and treated cells accumulated a small amount of viral ICP8, UL42, and US11 proteins (lane 3, lane 4, lane 5, respectively), particularly the samples treated with the maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (0.8 mg/mL; lane 5).
