<p>The polyphenols identified in NPRE were previously reported [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, catechin, eryodictiol-7-O-glucoside, gallic acid, and protocatechuic acid were the most abundant compounds, followed by caffeic acid. The total amount of polyphenols was 8.1 mg/100 g fresh weight of NPRE. The identification and quantification of the polyphenols present in NPRE was useful to prepare NP MIX.
