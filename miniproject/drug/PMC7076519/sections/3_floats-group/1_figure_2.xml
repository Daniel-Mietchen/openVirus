  <p>Effects of NPRE on herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1) replication by plaque reduction assay. Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 (50 plaque forming units (PFU)/100 µL) for 1 h and then treated with NPRE (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/mL). The DMSO was used in the control samples and acyclovir (20 µM) was used as positive control. Data are expressed as a mean (± SD) of at least three experiments, and asterisks (**, and ***) indicate the significance of 
   <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.01 and 0.001, respectively.
