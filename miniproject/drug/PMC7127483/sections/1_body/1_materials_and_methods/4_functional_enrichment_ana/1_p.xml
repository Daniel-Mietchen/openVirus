<p>The Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the ASFV-interacting swine proteins or the ASFV infection-associated swine proteins were conducted with functions of 
 <italic>enrichGO()</italic> and 
 <italic>enrichKEGG()</italic> in the package “clusterProfiler” (version 3.6.0) (
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) in R (version 3.4.2). All the GO terms and KEGG pathways with adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-values smaller than 0.01 were considered as significant enrichment (
