<p>The igraph package (version 1.2.2) (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Csardi &amp; Nepusz, 2006</xref>) in R was used to analyze the topology of the protein–protein interaction network. The degree and betweenness of proteins in the protein–protein interaction network were calculated with the functions of 
 <italic>degree()</italic> and 
 <italic>betweenness()</italic>, respectively. The shortest path length between two proteins in the protein–protein interaction network was calculated with the function of 
 <italic>shortest.paths()</italic>.
