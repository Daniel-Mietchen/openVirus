<p>All the swine protein–protein interactions were downloaded from STRING database (
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Szklarczyk et al., 2016</xref>) on 8 January 2019. Only the protein–protein interactions with a median confidence (score greater than 0.4) were kept. Besides, the redundant protein–protein interactions were removed. Finally, a protein–protein interaction network which consisted of 731,174 non-redundant protein–protein interactions between 18,683 swine proteins was obtained for further analysis.
