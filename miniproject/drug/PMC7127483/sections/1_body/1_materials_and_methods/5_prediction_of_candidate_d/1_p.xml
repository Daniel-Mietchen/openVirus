<p>Candidate drugs were predicted with the help of DrugBank (version 5.1.2) (
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Wishart et al., 2018</xref>). The protein sequence of each ASFV protein encoded by BA71V, and that of each ASFV-Interacting swine Protein was queried against DrugBank for similar targets with the default parameters. The drugs targeting the best hit were considered to be candidate drugs for the query protein. The properties of drugs, such as the type and group of drug and ATC code, were also obtained from DrugBank (
