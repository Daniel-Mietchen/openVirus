<p>In the era of systems biology, a large amount of protein–protein interactions have been accumulated, including the virus-host protein–protein interactions. This study compiled an up-to-date protein–protein interaction network between ASFV and swine. Analysis of the network could help identify possible associations between viral activities and host defense strategies, which may facilitate development of potential therapies by disrupting host-virus interactions (
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2007</xref>). Several ASFV-interacting swine proteins and lots of ASFV infection-associated swine proteins were identified based on the protein–protein interaction network. They were observed to interact with more proteins or have larger influences on the information flow throughout the swine protein–protein interaction network than other proteins, suggesting their central roles in the swine protein–protein interaction network. Some ASFV-interacting swine proteins were observed to interact with multiple viruses. They could be used as antiviral drug targets. Besides, the predicted drugs targeting these ASFV-interacting swine proteins, such as Polaprezinc and Geldanamycin, may have a broad-spectrum effect against viral infections.
