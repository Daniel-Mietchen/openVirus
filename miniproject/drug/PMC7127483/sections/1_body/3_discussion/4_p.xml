<p>Lots of drugs were predicted to target the ASFV-interacting swine proteins or ASFV proteins. Several strategies could be used to select the candidate drugs. For specificity, the drugs with high specificity on the ASFV-interacting swine proteins or ASFV proteins could be selected, such as the Hydroxyurea and Infliximab; for broad-spectrum effect, the drugs which targeted the ASFV-interacting swine proteins with high degrees in the swine protein–protein interaction network, such as Polaprezinc, or those which targeted multiple ASFV-interacting swine proteins, such as Geldanamycin, could have a large influence on the protein–protein interactions between swine and ASFV. Two drugs, that is, Gallium nitrate and Rifabutin, were observed to target both the ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV proteins. They could also be used for broad-spectrum inhibitory effect against ASFV infections.</p>
