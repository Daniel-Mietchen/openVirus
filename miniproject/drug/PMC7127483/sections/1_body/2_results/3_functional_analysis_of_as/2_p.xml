<p>We further conducted the functional enrichment analysis on the ASFV infection-associated swine proteins. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figures 3A</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3D</xref> showed the top ten GO terms in three domains of GO and KEGG pathways enriched in the ASFV infection-associated swine proteins. In the domain of Biological Process, six of top 10 enriched GO terms were related to cell death or apoptotic process; in the domain of Cellular Component, the ASFV infection-associated swine proteins were enriched in the nuclear and cytoskeleton; in the domain of Molecular Function, the ASFV infection-associated swine proteins were enriched in the GO terms of binding and enzyme activity. For the KEGG pathways, “Herpes simplex virus 1 infection” was most enriched. Besides, several signaling pathways were also enriched, such as “PI3K−Akt signaling pathway” and “MAPK signaling pathway”.
