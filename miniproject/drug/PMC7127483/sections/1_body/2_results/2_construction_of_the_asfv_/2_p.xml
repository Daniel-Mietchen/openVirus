<p>To investigate the centrality of ASFV-interacting and ASFV infection-associated swine proteins in the swine protein–protein interaction network, we calculated the degree and betweenness centrality, and the average shortest path length of each protein in the swine protein–protein interaction network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Figs. 2B</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">2D</xref>). The node (protein) degree was defined as the number of connections the node has to other nodes in the network; the node betweenness was defined as the number of shortest paths that pass through the node; the average shortest path length of a node was defined as the average length of all shortest paths from the node to other nodes. All of them measure the importance of a node in the network. The median degree and betweenness centrality, and the median shortest path length of all proteins in the swine protein–protein interaction network were 32, 10
 <sup>3.5</sup> and 59.2, respectively, whereas these values for the ASFV-interacting swine proteins were 144, 10
 <sup>4.6</sup> and 58.7, respectively, and they were 120, 10
 <sup>4.2</sup> and 58.8, respectively, for the ASFV infection-associated swine proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV infection-associated swine proteins were observed to have significant larger degrees and betweenness, and smaller shortest path length than all swine proteins, with 
 <italic>p</italic>-values much smaller than 0.001 in the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. This suggested that the ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV infection-associated swine proteins played a central role in the swine protein–protein interaction network.
