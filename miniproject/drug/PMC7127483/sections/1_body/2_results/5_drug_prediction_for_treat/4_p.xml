<p>Some drugs were observed to target multiple ASFV-interacting swine proteins, such as Geldanamycin (DB02424), Polaprezinc (DB09221) and Andrographolide (DB05767). For example, Geldanamycin could target the HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1, all of which played a central role in the swine protein–protein interaction network and swine-virus protein–protein interaction network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This suggested that Geldanamycin may have a broad-spectrum effect in disrupting the swine-ASFV protein–protein interaction network, and may inhibit the viral infections effectively. Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism of Geldanamycin by modeling the interactions between Geldanamycin and swine HSP90AB1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6</xref>). The 3D structure of the Geldanamycin-binding domain of swine HSP90AB1 was modeled using the template of human HSP90AA1 (PDB code: 1YET). The binding conformation of Geldanamycin was also predicted by referring the same compound in the template structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6A</xref>) (see “Methods”). As the sequence identity between the template and swine HSP90AB1 was as high as 92.8%, particularly in the ligand-binding regions, their binding modes with Geldanamycin in two structures should be highly similar. MD was performed for the complex structure of Geldanamycin and swine HSP90AB1 to investigate their interactions. The result showed that the RMSD (root mean square deviation) of Geldanamycin and swine HSP90AB1 were less than 1.6 Å in the 10 ns simulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6B</xref>), which indicated the binding conformation was highly stable. The key contributions of binding energy were from ASN51, ASP54, LYS58, ASP93, MET98, ASP102, ASN106, PHE138 and THR184, which was almost identical to the template (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>). In addition, the binding free energy for swine HSP90AB1 and Geldanamycin complex structures was −76.8 kcal/mol which was even stronger than −69.1 kcal/mol of the template (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Fig. S2</xref>). Hence, Geldanamycin could bind with swine HSP90AB1, similar to that in
