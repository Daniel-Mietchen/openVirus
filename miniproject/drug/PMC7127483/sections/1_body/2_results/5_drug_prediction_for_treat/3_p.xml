<p>Some drugs were observed to have strong specificity on the ASFV protein or ASFV-interacting swine proteins, such as the Hydroxyurea (DB01005), Infliximab (DB00065), Adalimumab (DB00051) and so on. Hydroxyurea specifically targeted F778R. It is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis through the inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. It may be used to inhibit DNA synthesis of the ASFV virus, thus blocking the proliferation of the virus. Infliximab specifically targeted TNF and is primarily related to inflammation control and neurological indications. It may be used to block the necrosis during the ASFV infection.</p>
