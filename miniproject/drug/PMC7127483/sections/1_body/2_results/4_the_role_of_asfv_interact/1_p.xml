<p>We then investigated the role of ASFV-interacting swine proteins in the protein–protein interactions between swine and other viruses. All the protein–protein interactions between ASFV-interacting swine proteins and other viral proteins which were public available in the Viruses.STRING database were obtained. As was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4A</xref>, 48 protein–protein interactions were obtained and shaped a network, which included 15 proteins from 11 other viruses (nodes in square) and 16 ASFV-interacting swine proteins (nodes in ellipse). A total of 13 ASFV-interacting swine proteins were observed to interact with more than one other virus. Besides, they also interacted with several hundreds of proteins in the swine protein–protein interaction network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4B</xref>). For example, the heat shock protein 90 s, including HSP90AB1, HSP90AA1 and HSP90B1, could interact with proteins from other five viruses, and interact with more than 1,500 swine proteins, suggesting their central roles in both the virus-swine protein–protein interaction network and swine protein–protein interaction network.
