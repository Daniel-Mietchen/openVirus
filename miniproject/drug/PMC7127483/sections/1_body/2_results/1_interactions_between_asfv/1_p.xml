<p>We firstly attempted to collect the interactions between ASFV and swine proteins as more as possible. In total, we obtained 44 protein–protein interactions between them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1A</xref>), including 24 protein–protein interactions from the database of Viruses.STRING, 20 protein–protein interactions from the literature and three protein–protein interactions inferred from protein to protein interactions between other viruses and swine based on sequence homology (details in “Materials and Methods”). A total of 16 ASFV proteins were involved in the protein–protein interactions. Half of ASFV proteins interacted with only one swine protein. For the remaining half of ASFV proteins, the DNA-directed DNA polymerase interacted with 13 swine proteins, while the A179L and A238L both interacted with four swine proteins. Thirty-eight swine proteins were involved in the protein–protein interactions between ASFV and swine, which were defined as ASFV-interacting swine proteins. All of them only interacted with one ASFV protein except the proteins of DNAJA3, FBXO2 and SNAPIN.
