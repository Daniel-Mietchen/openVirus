<p>In conclusion, this study curated an up-to-date set of protein–protein interactions between swine and ASFV as far as we know, and identified the ASFV-interacting swine proteins which were vital for viral infection. The ASFV-interacting swine proteins were observed to play a central role in swine protein–protein interaction network, and also took part in interactions between swine and several other viruses. They could be taken as potential antiviral-drug targets. Several drugs were predicted to target the ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV proteins. They could be helpful for further development of effective drugs against the virus.</p>
