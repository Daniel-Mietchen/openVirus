  <title>ASFV-interacting swine proteins and their interactions with other viruses.</title>
  <p>(A) The protein–protein interaction network between ASFV-interacting swine proteins (AIPs) and other viruses. ASFV-interacting swine proteins were represented as ellipse in gray. Viruses were represented as squares and colored according to the legend in the bottom right. VESE, Vesicular exanthema of swine virus; Swinepox, Swinepox virus; TTSV1a, Torque teno sus virus 1a; TeschoA, Teschovirus A; Nodamura, Nodamura virus; FMDV, Foot-and-mouth disease virus; TTSVk2, Torque teno sus virus k2; FLUCV, Influenza C virus; EMCV, Encephalomyocarditis virus. (B) The number of interacted virus and the degree of ASFV-interacting swine proteins in the swine protein–protein interaction network. HISTH2AC, histone H2A type 2-C; H2A1-H, histone H2A type 1-H; HIST1H2AA, histone H2A type 1-A; HIST1H2AJ, histone H2A type 1-like; H2A2-A-L, histone H2A type 2-A-like; H2AFX, histone H2AX.</p>
