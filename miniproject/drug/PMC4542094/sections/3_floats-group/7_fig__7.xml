  <p>Effect of amantadine on HERV protein expression in HCT8
   <sup>WT/RETO</sup> analyzed by ELISA. The expression of both HERV-W
   <sub>E1</sub> and HERV-FRD
   <sub>1</sub> is downregulated after incubation with amantadine at 2 x IC
   <sub>50</sub> for 24Â hours. Expression is reduced to basal levels in HCT8
   <sup>RETO</sup>. The results are given in percent in relation to the expression of beta-actin as endogenous control
