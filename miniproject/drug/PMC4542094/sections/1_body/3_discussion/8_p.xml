<p>Amantadine is approved for use as antiviral and antiparkinsonian drug. No primary mechanism of action has been described so far, but it its known that its interference with Influenza virus protein M2 plays an important role in repressing both the early and late phase of viral replication cycle. We focused our studies on amantadine because we previously have been investigating several PPAP compounds (polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols) such as nemorosone and plukenetione A, which structurally share the adamantane backbone. We already reported on the antitumoral and antiretroviral activity of these drugs, which we found to inhibit HIV. Moreover, PPAPs were recently described as selective agents in highly resistant neuroblastoma entities [
