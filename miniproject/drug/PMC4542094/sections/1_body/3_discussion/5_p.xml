<p>So far, a possible relationship of HERVs with chemotherapy resistance might be a result of the interaction of these proteins with cell membrane structure. Hypothetically, the ability of HERV-W
 <sub>E1</sub> and HERV-FRD proteins to promote cell-cell fusion and generation of multinucleated giant cancer cells could represent an alternative membrane-mediated defense mechanism [
