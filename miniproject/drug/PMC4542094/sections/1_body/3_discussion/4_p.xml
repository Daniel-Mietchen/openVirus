<p>Colon adenocarcinoma paraffin sections showed significant expression of HERV-W
 <sub>E1</sub> and HERV-FRD
 <sub>1</sub>. These viral transcripts, as well as HERV 3
 <sub>1</sub> and HERV V
 <sub>1</sub>, were also expressed in HCT8
 <sup>WT</sup> and overexpressed up to three times in chemotherapy refractory HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells, suggesting a relationship to chemoresistance. Consequently, additional HERV elements might contribute to carcinogenesis and chemotherapy resistance [
