<p>In addition we analyzed if the antiviral compounds alone or applied as polychemotherapy exerts effects on the regulation of HERVs proteins in HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells, which abundantly expressed different HERVs entities. We found that amantadine, pleconaril and ribavirin alone or in combination applied simultaneously, significantly downregulated the protein expression of HERVs as reflected in Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">b</xref> &amp; 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). These results certainly demonstrated that cytotoxicity of antiviral compounds in chemoresistant HCT8RETO cells is also associated with downregulation of HERV-proteins.
