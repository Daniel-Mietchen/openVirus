<p>We also explored the potential synergistic antiproliferative effects by combining different antiviral compounds by using their specific IC
 <sub>50</sub>. As expected, amantadine, pleconaril and ribavirin as single drugs reduced cell survival by about 50 %. Enhanced cytotoxicity in HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells was only detectable for amantadine and pleconaril. In general, combination of antiviral compounds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, panel 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">b</xref>) resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity, especially for amantadine-containing doublets or even triplets. However, all antiviral combinations did not show enhanced activity in chemo-resistant HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells, compared to chemo-sensitive HCT8
 <sup>WT</sup> cells, indicating unspecific cytotoxic effects of antiviral compounds rather than additional suppression of HERV-protein expression.
