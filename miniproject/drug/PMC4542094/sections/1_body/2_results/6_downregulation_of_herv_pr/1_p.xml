<p>We have already shown enhanced cytotoxicity of antiviral compounds in chemoresistant HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells in vitro (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Furthermore, we shown that amantadine is able to reduce significantly the HERV protein expression at 1-fold its IC
 <sub>50</sub> as observed by Western blotting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, panel 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">b</xref> &amp; 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> depicts the semi-quantification of the effect of amantadine in HCT8
 <sup>WT/RETO</sup> cells as assayed by ELISA. As expected, the protein expression of HERV-W
 <sub>E1</sub> and FRD
 <sub>1</sub> is markedly enhanced in HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells (panel 3) compared to HCT8
 <sup>WT</sup> cells (panel 1). Upon incubation with amantadine, pronounced reduction of HERV-W
 <sub>E1</sub> and -FRD
 <sub>1</sub> protein expression was only detectable in HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells. Comparable data were achieved for HERV-W
 <sub>E1</sub> and FRD
 <sub>1</sub> at the RNA levels (data not shown).
