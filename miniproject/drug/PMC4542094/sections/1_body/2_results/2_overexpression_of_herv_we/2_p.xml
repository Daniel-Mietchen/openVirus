<p>We investigated the differential expression of HERV-W
 <sub>E1</sub> and HERV-FRD
 <sub>1</sub> in colon adenocarcinoma based on the cell line HCT8
 <sup>WT/RETO</sup>. During development of resistance against etoposide, the first observable change was the emergence of a transitory cell hypertrophy as depicted in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, together with the overexpression of several endoretroviral elements as observed by ICC.
