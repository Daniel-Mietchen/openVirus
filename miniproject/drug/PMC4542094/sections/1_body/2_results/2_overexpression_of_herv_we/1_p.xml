<p>The anticancer drug etoposide is commonly not employed in the treatment of colorectal carcinomas (CRC). Nevertheless, this drug is associated with the induction of cancer stem cell characteristics in several tumors as previously described. In HCT8 colorectal carcinoma cells, etoposide induces characteristics for stemness, as judged by their self renewal capacity, colonosphere formation, radioresistance and markedly reduced chemotherapy sensitivity as well as a defined set of CSC-markers like EpCAM, Mucins 1 &amp; 4, c-Myc, Stat3, stem cell factor (SCF), Musashi, Î²-catenin, among others (
