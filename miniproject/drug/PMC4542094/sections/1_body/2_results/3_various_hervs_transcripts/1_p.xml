<p>Human stem cells have been described to express a range of different HERVs. It is also known that these elements, especially HERV-H, are expressed in colon carcinomas, probably due to the presence of cancer stem cells. The expression of different HERVs and a possible relationship to chemosensitivity has not been reported yet. For this purpose, we analyzed HCT8
 <sup>WT/RETO</sup> cells for HERV mRNAs. Mononuclear CD34
 <sup>+</sup> cells from umbilical cord blood served as positive control since these cells were found to co-express a battery of HERV elements. It was striking, that expression of HERV mRNA transcripts WE

 <sub>1</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) and V
 <sub>1</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) was significantly enhanced in HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells, compared to parental HCT8
 <sup>WT</sup> cells (range from 1.06 to 3.87-fold).
