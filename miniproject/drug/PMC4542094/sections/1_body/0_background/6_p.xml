<p>Here, we show that cytostatic stress induces the development of highly resistant, HERV-overexpressing tumor cells. We determine the cytotoxic activity of different antiviral agents and highlight their capacity to shut down HERV expression. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of antiviral compounds and antitumoral drugs reflects synergistic antiproliferative effects in highly resistant, HERV-overexpressing colorectal tumor cells.</p>
