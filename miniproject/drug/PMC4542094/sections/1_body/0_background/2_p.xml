<p>Accounting for 8 % of the human genetic material, human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) represent a footprint of ancestral germ-cell infections in which viruses integrated into the host genome and were transmitted in a Mendelian form to the progeny [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Structurally, HERVs retain all retroviral hallmarks, including the 
 <italic>gal</italic>, 
 <italic>pol &amp; env</italic> genes flanked by non-coding long terminal repeats (LTRs). Although most HERVs have lost the capacity of horizontal transmission due to gene defects, some have retained this ability despite their apparent apathogenicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To ensure proliferation, they sequestrate intact elements from co-expressed exoviruses to form functional entities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
