<p>Experiments were performed at least in triplicate and the data given as means ± standard error of means (SEM), unless stated otherwise. Student’s t-test with four degrees of freedom was used to compare independent groups. The statistical analyses were performed with Sigma Plot 12 (Systat Software Inc., California, USA). A probability (p) value was considered *: significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); **: very significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01); ***: highly significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). ICC and IHC microscopy studies were descriptive and therefore not analyzed statistically; the results shown are representative of at least 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments.
