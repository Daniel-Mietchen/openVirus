<p>ICC and IHC staining was performed according to standard protocols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Briefly, ICC cells were grown in chamber slides to appropriate densities, washed with 1× PBS, fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes, rinsed twice with 1× PBS for 5 minutes, and blocked with 10 % normal goat serum (AbD Serotec, London, UK) at room temperature for 60 minutes. For IHC, tissue samples were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin tissue sections of 4 μm thickness were baked overnight at 60 °C to firmly attach the sections to the slides. After baking, the sections were deparaffinized in 2 changes of xylene-substitute (Thermo Scientific, London, UK) solution for 10-15 min and rehydrated in a series of graded ethanol solutions (100 %, 100 %, 95 %, 70 %, 50 %) for 3 minutes each. HE staining was performed using conventional techniques. For IHC, antigens were retrieved by heating the sections for 30 minutes in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 9.0 at 95 °C in a domestic vegetable steamer. The slides were washed twice in 1 × PBS for 5 minutes and blocked for 60 minutes with 10 % normal goat serum at room temperature. Primary antibodies (Bioss Antibodies, Woburn, USA and Biorbyt, Cambridge, England) were applied overnight according to the manufacturers' recommendations. On the next day, the slides were washed 3 times in PBST (PBS/0.05 % Tween 20) for 5 minutes each and rinsed in 1 × PBS for another 5 minutes. Conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell signaling, Cambridge, UK) diluted in PBS/0.05 % Tween 20/2.5 % goat serum were incubated for 120 minutes at room temperature according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Next, the samples were stained for 15 minutes with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 diluted in PBS in order to visualize the nuclei. The slides were then washed 3 times in PBST (PBS/0.05 % Tween 20) for 5 minutes each and rinsed in 1 × PBS for another 5 minutes. Tissue specimens were mounted in Faramound Mounting medium (Dako) for visualization.
