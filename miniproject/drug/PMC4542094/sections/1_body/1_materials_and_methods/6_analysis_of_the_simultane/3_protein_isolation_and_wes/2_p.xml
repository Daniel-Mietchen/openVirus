 <sup>WT/RETO</sup> cells growing exponentially in 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> TC flasks were incubated in medium containing the respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> of amantadine, pleconaril, and ribavirin alone or with all drugs simultaneously for 24 hours. Medium was then removed and the cells washed twice with cold PBS. Protein extraction was performed using RIPA buffer as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Briefly, pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer [150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % Triton X-100, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4] in the presence of a proteinase inhibitor cocktail according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 minutes on ice and then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 14 000 g, 4 °C. The homogenates were measured for protein content using Bradford and normalized to the same protein concentration. Protein extracts (30 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 4–12 % gradient gel (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) using Tris-glycine (0.025 M Tris-HCl, 0.192 M glycine pH 8.5) buffer, and transferred overnight to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Pierce Protein, Thermo Scientific Inc., MA, USA). Blots were blocked with 5 % BSA or non-fat milk taking into consideration the recommendations of the manufacturers of the primary and secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies were purchased from Bioss Antibodies, Woburn, USA. Conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling and Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd. (Suffolk, UK). Immunoblots were developed by Western Lightning® Plus-ECL (Perkin Elmer, CA, USA) using a ChemiDoc XRS+ system with Image Lab Version 2.0.1 software (Biorad, CA, USA).
