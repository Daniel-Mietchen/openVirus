 <sub>50</sub> values were determined using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] proliferation assay as described previously, and reported as the mean of three independent experiments. Briefly, cells in exponential growth phase were harvested, washed with medium, and seeded in 96-well plates at appropriate densities according to their growth kinetics. After a conditioning period of 24 hours, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of cytostatics for 72 hours. The cultures were then incubated with MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) dissolved in PBS at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for 4 hours. Supernatants were aspirated and the purple formazan crystals dissolved in 100 μl of solubilization solution (10 % SDS in DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). The absorbance was measured in a microtiter plate reader (Infinite F200 Tecan, Berlin, Germany) at 570 nm. Both methods were formerly described [
