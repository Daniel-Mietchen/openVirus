<p id="p0085">Anecdotal evidence seemed to support their possible role in COVID-19; however, a recent analysis failed in showing benefit with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment beyond standard care in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19,

For example, baseline characteristics suggest a higher disease severity in the treatment arm (more patients with respiratory rate &gt;24/min, with days from onset to randomization &gt;12 and requiring oxygen) and, interestingly, an associated higher viral load. Despite that, patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir experienced a higher proportion of clinical improvement on day 14 (45.5% vs. 30.0%), a shorter time to clinical improvement if treated within 12 days from onset (hazard ratio 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.77â€“2.05), and were less likely to die (19.2% vs. 25.0%, not significant). In our opinion, these data support consideration of antiviral therapy in subgroups of patients at high risk.
