The optimal management of patients infected with COVID-19 is still unclear, although the consensus is moving toward the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7&#x02013;10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent, with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anticytokine drugs) may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the hemophagocytic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities. Here we present the therapeutic approach used in Brescia (Italy) for managing patients infected with COVID-19 who underwent kidney transplantation and are receiving hemodialysis. Furthermore, we provide some clinical and physiopathological background, as well as preliminary outcome data of our cohort, to better clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and clinical management.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key Words</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>dialysis</kwd><kwd>kidneys</kwd><kwd>management</kwd><kwd>patients</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>transplant</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">We describe our experience with managing patients with kidney disease during the current COVID-19 pandemic in Brescia City in the Lombardy region of Italy, with particular attention to patients undergoing dialysis and patients with renal transplantation.</p><p id="p0015">The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently published the largest COVID-19 case series, which includes 44,672 cases. This study shows an overall mortality rate of 2.3%. Besides age (1.3% mortality in the 50&#x02013;59 age group, 3.6% in the 60&#x02013;69 age group, 8.0% in the 70&#x02013;79 age group, and 14.8% in the&#x000a0;&#x02265;80 age group), the main risk factors are the presence of cardiovascular diseases (10.5% mortality), diabetes (7.3% mortality), chronic respiratory diseases (6.3% mortality), high blood pressure (6% mortality), and cancer (5.6% mortality).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In the Lombardy region, however, the disease seems to have much higher mortality rates than reported in China, and this led us to investigate factors potentially responsible for this worse outcome.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The comorbidities associated with increased mortality during COVID-19 are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis. There is a paucity of data on the risk factors and outcome of patients with kidney disease who are positive for COVID-19, including those receiving dialysis or who underwent a kidney transplantation. These groups of patients are unique in view of their immunosuppressed status. Reports from China suggest a less severe course of the disease in patients receiving dialysis, compared with patients who underwent a kidney transplantation, but also compared with patients without kidney disease.</p><p id="p0020">Currently, Brescia and its province are the second largest Italian area affected after Bergamo (5317 cases as of March 23, 2020). A working group consisting of infective disease specialists and intensivists from Lombardy has developed a therapeutic protocol in patients with COVID-19 based on disease severity.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> We&#x000a0;have adapted this protocol to our patients receiving dialysis and who underwent a kidney transplantation. We also provide some logistics considerations resulting from our direct experience in the management of patient flows during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as preliminary results of outcome in our population.</p><sec id="sec1"><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Logistic Considerations</title><p id="p0025">Proper logistic planning is crucial in the management of this health emergency. The management of these patients makes it necessary to reconcile infection protocols (e.g., isolation), with needs that are intrinsic to our specialty (e.g., the need to move patients for hemodialysis). Our experience, although still limited, suggests a better outcome in patients who underwent a transplantation directly managed in a dedicated nephrology ward compared with the patients managed in other general COVID areas, and evaluated by the nephrologist only in consultation.</p><p id="p0030">As a referral center, our division provides care to 1200 patients who underwent a transplantation, 400 patients receiving hemodialysis, and 70 patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. Because of the significant&#x000a0;size of our patient population, we reorganized our&#x000a0;wards to accommodate the surge of patients with&#x000a0;COVID-19 with kidney disease. The particular logistics of our institution has allowed us to implement an efficient organizational model that included the creation of a dedicated COVID unit from a female ward.</p><p id="p0035">From February 27&#x02013;28, 2020, we created a dedicated COVID unit that was dialysis capable and subsequently admitted the first COVID-positive patient (who underwent kidney transplantation). On February 28, we adopted surveillance measures for outpatients undergoing hemodialysis, which were applied in a small triage area in the waiting room of the dialysis center: patients&#x02019; body temperature was checked together with a brief anamnestic evaluation, alcohol-based hand sanitizer was dispensed, and surgical masks were provided. If the clinical suspicion of COVID-19 emerged, the patient was sent to perform specific testing. In case of urgency for dialysis treatment, this was performed in a room intended for suspected cases.</p><p id="p0040">Between March 2 and 4, 2020, we admitted the second and third positive patients to the COVID area. As the number of patients infected with COVID-19 increased, we closed the transplant center and rearranged the ward&#x02019;s central spaces to create hemodialysis rooms, intended partially for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and partially for patients who are negative for SARS-CoV-2 (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Number of patients at the peak of the COVID pandemic</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="5">1st Floor</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Inpatients with COVID-19 infection receiving hemodialysis<break/><bold>17 beds</bold></td><td align="center">Hemodialysis room for inpatients with COVID-19 infection</td><td align="center">Hemodialysis rooms for inpatients who are negative for COVID-19</td><td align="center">Dialysis room for inpatients with COVID-19 infection or suspected cases</td><td align="center">Inpatients with COVID-19 who received transplantation<break/><bold>12 beds</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><bold>2nd Floor</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Dialysis</td><td>COVID-negative nephrology ward</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>COVID, coronavirus disease.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Patient Flow</title><p id="p0045">Logistical challenges and the physical structure of the building (e.g., identifying a room dedicated for isolated patients awaiting the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results, locations for donning and doffing personal protective equipment, as well as for performing hemodialysis outside the usual area), we were forced to reduce the number of overall beds from 36 to 29. Because of patient turnover (intensive care unit transfers, discharges, and deaths), these numbers allowed us to cover our needs in terms of admissions for patients who underwent transplantation and who are receiving dialysis.</p><p id="p0050">Up to March 22, in the nephrology unit of the hospital of Brescia, we have managed 46 patients, following the protocol presented in this article: 20 patients who underwent renal transplantation, 21 patients receiving hemodialysis, and 5 patients affected by CKD or acute kidney injury on CKD. The vast majority of patients (19 of 20 patients who underwent transplantation, 17 of 21 patients receiving hemodialysis, and 4 of 5 of the patients with CKD) received antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine as per our protocol. Dexamethasone and tocilizumab have been used, respectively, in 11 and 6 of the 20 patients who underwent transplantation, in 4 and 1 of the 21 patients receiving hemodialysis, and in 1 and none of the patients with CKD. To date, no patients on immunosuppressive treatment due to primary or secondary glomerulonephritis have been admitted or known to have symptoms imputable to SARS-CoV-2 infection; these patients were advised to respect social distancing rules since the early stages of the coronavirus crisis.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Results</title><p id="p0055">We now provide preliminary outcome data on the patients directly followed in our nephrology unit in Brescia on March 22, 2020; more detailed reports will follow. As of March 22, among our 20 patients who underwent transplantation who were admitted, 5 patients died, 4 were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 3 were discharged after an average of 13 days.</p><p id="p0060">We admitted 21 patients with COVID-19 infection receiving hemodialysis, including 5 patients who died and 4 who were discharged between hospital day 7 and 17 (mean length of hospitalization 12 days). Of note, the COVID-19 crisis has imposed, at least at some stages, rationalization of intensive care unit resources.</p><p id="p0065">A total of 5 patients with CKD were admitted, of whom 2 have died and the other 2 have been discharged after 6 and 17 days from admission.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Management Considerations</title><p id="p0070">In general terms, optimal disease management is still being debated, and the therapeutic approach still lacks significant evidence.

The first phase is associated with viral replication and cytopathic effect, and antiviral drugs may be considered (e.g., chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir ritonavir, and darunavir/cobicistat). The second phase of the disease begins after 7 to 10 days from the onset of symptoms, and is associated with the risk of death<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>; this stage is characterized by progressive lung involvement with escalating needs of oxygen supplementation and ventilatory support, which seems to be secondary to hyperinflammatory and cytokine release syndromes.

For example, baseline characteristics suggest a higher disease severity in the treatment arm (more patients with respiratory rate &#x0003e;24/min, with days from onset to randomization &#x0003e;12 and requiring oxygen) and, interestingly, an associated higher viral load. Despite that, patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir experienced a higher proportion of clinical improvement on day 14 (45.5% vs. 30.0%), a shorter time to clinical improvement if treated within 12 days from onset (hazard ratio 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.77&#x02013;2.05), and were less likely to die (19.2% vs. 25.0%, not significant).

Even patients who are afebrile may have an abnormal chest X-ray and other clinical signs of the hemophagocytic syndrome. These patients tend to be hypercoagulable, and prophylactic therapy with heparin and low-dose aspirin should be considered. During this phase, treatment with glucocorticoid and the interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab should be considered, especially in patients with rapid clinical deterioration evidenced by escalating oxygen requirements or the need for ventilatory support. We recommend for this subgroup of patients, close monitoring of arterial oxygen levels with repeat arterial blood sampling, of the blood tests including ferritin&#x02013;coagulation&#x02013;liver enzymes, and of the chest X-ray.</p><p id="p0120">We have formulated a treatment protocol based on patient characteristics, phase of illness, and disease severity using antivirals, immunomodulators, and immunosuppressive agents.
