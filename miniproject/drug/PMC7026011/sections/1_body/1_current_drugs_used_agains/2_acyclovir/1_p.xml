<p>Numerous antivirals approved for the treatment of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections are acyclic nucleoside and nucleotide analogs that interfere with the elongation of viral genome during replication, which is carried out by the viral DNA polymerase (UL30). Acyclovir (ACV) is an acyclic guanosine analog discovered in the sponge 
 <italic>Cryptotethya crypta</italic> and is at present the most frequently used compound to treat HSV-1 and HSV-2, mainly because of its low price, tolerability and safety (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, acyclovir needs to be activated intracellularly by its phosphorylation into acyclovir triphosphate for exerting its antiviral activity. This process is carried out by the viral thymidine kinase (TK, 
 <italic>UL23</italic> gene), which catalyzes acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, thus increasing the concentration of acyclovir within infected cells by reducing its exit from the cell (

 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Kukhanova et al., 2014</xref>). Additional phosphorylations are carried out by cellular kinases and once in its triphosphate form, acyclovir becomes a substrate for the viral DNA polymerase interfering with DNA synthesis (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq, 2013</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of the synthesis of new viral genome copies, which translates lesser formation of novel infectious viral particles, does not affect latent virus within host neurons and hence, does not cure infection (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">Poole and James, 2018</xref>). Other limitations related to the treatment with ACV also exist. For instance, oral intake of ACV has an absorption efficiency of only 15â€“30% (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bean, 1992</xref>), and previous reports indicated that senior patients that had renal problems could experience significant neurotoxicity, because they were not able to properly excrete this drug (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Chau, 2018</xref>). Another important limitation associated to ACV is the ability of HSV-1 and HSV-2 to mutate and generate variants that are resistant to this drug by acquiring point mutations in the gene encoding for the viral thymidine kinase (TK), which decreases enzyme expression or modifies substrate specificity abrogating acyclovir phosphorylation, or by acquiring mutations in the gene encoding for the viral DNA polymerase (
 <italic>UL30</italic>), which may enable HSV-1 and HSV-2 to replicate in the presence of ACV (
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">Reusser, 1996</xref>). Such ACV-resistant variants occur mainly in immunosuppressed individuals, as they are otherwise generally attenuated in immunocompetent individuals (
