<p>Resistance to foscarnet has been observed in immuno- compromised individuals, particularly in patients having undergone bone marrow transplants. On the other hand, there are only few studies reporting cidofovir-resistant HSV isolates. In one case, three patients with bone marrow transplants received cidofovir as a therapy, but nevertheless showed HSV-related diseases symptoms. Cidofovir resistance was confirmed in one of the three cases with the isolate showing mutations that truncated the C-terminal of the viral DNA polymerase (

Notably, cidofovir resistance has also been reported in children, particularly in three patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplants that received, in a prophylactic manner acyclovir and cidofovir together, because ganciclovir produced adverse effects. Unfortunately, these children showed HSV-related stomatitis during cidofovir treatment and the authors suggested that the treatment with cidofovir did not prevent HSV-1 reactivation in the patients (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Blot et al. (2000)</xref> reported a clinical case of a child affected by a variant of HSV-1 resistant to ACV and foscarnet (

Another study reporting an HSV-1 isolate resistant to both, ACV and foscarnet in a girl with lymphatic leukemia indicated that only cidofovir treatment was successful at helping avoid recurrent oral stomatitis (
