<p>Another relatively new drug to treat skin lesions caused by HSV-1 is docosanol 10% formulated as a topical cream (Abreva
 <sup>®</sup>, Avanir), which is the only FDA approved formulation available over the counter (OTC) to treat HSV-1 symptoms. This drug consists of an aliphatic chain (hydrophobic linear chain) with an alcohol group at one of its ends and has emulsifying properties, which is why it has been used in both, the cosmetic and food industries. Currently, docosanol 10% cream is approved for the treatment of HSV-1 lesions. However, the literature available on its effectiveness is somewhat scarce and more studies seem to be required to compare its effectiveness side by side with other compounds such as acyclovir 5% cream and Xerese
 <sup>®</sup> (
