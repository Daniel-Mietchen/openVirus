<p>On the other hand, approximately 3.5â€“10% of immunosuppressed individuals (e.g., transplanted persons, HIV-positive individuals, those undergoing pharmacological treatments to depress the immune system, among others) may develop HSV-1 and HSV-2 variants that are resistant to the most commonly used antivirals (
