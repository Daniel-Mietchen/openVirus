<p>On the other hand, Qing et al., reported that a protein from 
 <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> (GFAHP) had antiviral activity against HSV-1, which was shown to have virucidal effects in cell cultures and suppressed viral entry into Vero cells (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, GFAHP also showed antiviral activity against HSV-1 in animals when applied topically to the cornea of mice. Mice treated with GFAHP had a significant reduction in blepharitis, vascularization and stromal disease, as well as reduced viral replication in the cornea (

 <italic>Rozites caperata</italic> showed antiviral activity against HSV-1 in Vero cells (
