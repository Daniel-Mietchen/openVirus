<p>Interestingly, fungus proteins that inhibit HSV infection have also been identified. Two proteins that bind polysaccharides from the mushroom 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> were found to have antiviral effects against HSV-1 and HSV-2. One was named the neutral protein bound to polysaccharide (NPBP) and the other the acidic protein bound to polysaccharide (APBP). Although APBP had more potent antiviral activity than NPBP, both inhibited plaque formation by both types of HSV. Interestingly, it was found that the mechanism of action of APBP was mediated by the inhibition of the attachment and penetration of the virus into Vero cells (
