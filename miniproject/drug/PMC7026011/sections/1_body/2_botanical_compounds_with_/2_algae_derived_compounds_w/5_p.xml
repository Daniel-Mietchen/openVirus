<p>Interestingly, a recent article showed antiviral activity against HSV-2 for two purified sulfated polysaccharides isolated from the brown alga

In this work, algae extracts were treated to purify the polysaccharides named SHAP-1 and SHAP-2, which were later evaluated in viral plaque formation assay for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 virus. However, following experiments in this research article focused on HSV-2 rather than HSV-1, arguing greater clinical value for the former (
