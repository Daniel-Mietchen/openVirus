<p>On the other hand, Hayashi and colleagues reported that fucoidan from the brown macroalga 
 <italic>Undaria pinnatifida</italic>, which are sulfated polysaccharide, have antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 that is mediated by hampering the binding of the virus to the cell surface (

 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). When the effect of fucoidan was tested in another study against corneal infection with HSV-1, a reduction in herpetic lesions was found in those animals that received pretreatments with fucoidan during 1 week (

 <italic>Nizamuddinia zanardinii</italic> exert strong antiviral activity against HSV-2 infection. They found that an algal extract containing this compound inhibited the attachment of HSV-2 to Vero cells, inhibiting the early phase of HSV-2 infection (
