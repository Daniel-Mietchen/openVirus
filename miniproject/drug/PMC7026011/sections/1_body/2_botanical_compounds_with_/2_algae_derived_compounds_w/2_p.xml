 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Vero cells infected with HSV-1 and treated with extracts from this microalga showed reduced plaque formation. The antiviral effect of these compounds has also been evaluated in a murine model skin infection, which showed decreased skin lesions compared to controls when administrated 4 h before infection and then three times per day for 6â€“10 days. Also, skin obtained from these treated and infected animals showed lesser plaque forming units than the control (
