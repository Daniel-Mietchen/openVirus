<p>Other essential oils, particularly those obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic>, which is better known as lemon balm, have also been shown to have antiviral activity against both, HSV-1 and HSV-2 with the antiviral activity attributed to tannins and non-tannin polyphenolic fractions within the extract (

 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> Lamiaceae had antiviral activity against HSV-2 (

 <italic>Aglaia odorata</italic>, 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ventilago denticulate</italic> have also been shown to have antiviral activity against wild-type and drug-resistant HSV-1 isolates, yet the mechanisms of action seems to not have been identified yet, or reported (
