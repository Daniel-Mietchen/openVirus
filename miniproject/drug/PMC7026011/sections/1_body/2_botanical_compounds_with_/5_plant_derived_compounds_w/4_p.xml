<p>Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine have also been tested and found to have antiviral activity (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Ganjhu et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, a study reported that leaves from Mulberry (
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> L.), a plant that is common in Asia, has antiviral properties against HSV-1 and HSV-2. The active compound within this plant has been reported to be Kuwanon X, a stilbene polyphenol derivative, which has antiviral activity over HSV at multiple steps of the infection process, inhibiting cellular adsorption and penetration, as well as the expression of HSV-1 immediate early and late genes, and the synthesis of HSV-1 DNA (

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Another study showed that aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic>, a Chinese herbal medicine, blocks HSV-2 infection by inhibiting NF-κB activation, a host transcription factor that has been reported to be required for effective HSV infection (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Amici et al., 2006</xref>). In order to identify the compounds with antiviral activity within 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic>, several flavonoid compounds in this plant were evaluated individually to determine their capacity to block the replication cycle of HSV-2. Quercetin, quercitrin, and isoquercitrin, the major flavonoid compounds found within 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> were found to be strong inhibitors of HSV-2 activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). A subsequent study from another group determined that the mechanism of action behind the anti-herpetic activity of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> occurred at multiple levels, such as at the adsorption level, entry, post-infection acting over NF-κB and had virucidal activity (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2015</xref>). Another stilbene compound that inhibits NF-κB activation is resveratrol, which was isolated from 
 <italic>Veratum grandiflorum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), and it is the main bioactive compound found in berries, peanuts, legumes and other plant-derived matrices, as well as red wine. Several studies have reported antiviral properties for this compound over the replication cycles of ACV-resistant and wild-type HSV-1 and HSV-2, both in cell cultures and in animal models (
