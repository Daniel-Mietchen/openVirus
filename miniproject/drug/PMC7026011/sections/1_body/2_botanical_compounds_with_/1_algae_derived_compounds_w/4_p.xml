<p>Interestingly, researchers have isolated and studied a chemically modified polysaccharide from the green alga 
 <italic>Enteromorpha compressa</italic> with anti HSV-1 activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Notably, this study reported total viral inhibition when the evaluated compound was added to human Hep-2 cells infected with a clinical isolate of HSV-1 in a time-of-addition assay. Because the effect was maintained when applied post-treatment, the authors suggested that the antiviral activity might be mediated by the inhibition of virus replication and/or viral protein synthesis (
