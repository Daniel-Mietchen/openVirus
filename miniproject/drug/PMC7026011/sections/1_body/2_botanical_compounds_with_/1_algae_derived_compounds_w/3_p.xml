<p>Extracts derived from the green microalga 
 <italic>Haematococcus pluvialis</italic> have also shown anti-herpetic activity. Extracts obtained from this microalga through pressurized liquid extraction displayed inhibitory action against HSV-1 replication, which was suggested to be mediated by an inhibition in the attachment of the virus to the host cell, the virus-cell fusion process and/or virus entry into the cell (

 <italic>Cystoseira myrica</italic>, which strongly inhibits the replication of this virus (
