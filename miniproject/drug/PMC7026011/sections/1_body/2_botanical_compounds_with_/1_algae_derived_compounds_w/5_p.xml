<p>Another alga which has been studied is 
 <italic>Eucheuma gelatinae</italic>, a red alga that is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. Polysaccharides obtained from this organism were tested for their antiviral activity against HSV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using Vero cells infected with ACV-sensitive or ACV-resistant HSV-1 and HSV-2 isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In this study, strong antiviral activity against HSV was observed in early stages of infection affecting the attachment of HSV. Additionally, it was shown experimentally that viral protein synthesis was affected through the evaluation of the expression of the viral protein VP5, as well as the cellular localization of this protein which is normally found in the nucleus. After the treatment with the alga extract, VP5 was mainly found in the cytoplasm (
