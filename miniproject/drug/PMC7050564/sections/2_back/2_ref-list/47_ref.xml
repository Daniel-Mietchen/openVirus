 <note>
  <p id="P33">This report shows that combinations of two antiviral gRNAs can delay viral escape. Two gRNA combinations targeting highly conserved viral sequences were identified that durably block virus replication. When viral escape is prevented, repeated Cas9 cleavage leads to saturation of major mutations in the target sequences (hypermutation), which coincided with the loss of replication-competent virus, demonstrating complete virus inactivation. This study provides the proof-of-principle that HIV-infected cells can be functionally cured by dual-gRNA CRISPR–Cas9 treatment.</p>
