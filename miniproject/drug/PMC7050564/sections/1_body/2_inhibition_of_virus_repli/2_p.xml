<p id="P9">In our study, the period of virus suppression varied for different gRNAs but did not correlate with the capacity of the gRNAs to induce HIV DNA cleavage and to suppress gene expression [

 </xref>]. Instead, the time to escape strongly correlated with the evolutionary conservation of the target sequence. Rapid viral escape was observed when poorly conserved HIV sequences were targeted, while escape was delayed when strongly conserved viral sequences were targeted. Poorly conserved HIV sequences correspond to non-essential regions, which can relatively easily accommodate the indels that are introduced during DNA repair. In contrast, highly conserved sequences correspond to essential viral regions, which will tolerate only specific mutations that are generated less frequently during DNA repair (e.g. nt substitutions and nt-triplet insertions that do not destroy the open reading frame).
