<p id="P11">To test whether gRNA combinations can similarly prevent viral escape, we and others evaluated HIV replication in T cells harnessed with CRISPR–Cas9 and different combinations of two gRNAs [

Indeed, combinations inhibited viral replication more effectively than the corresponding single gRNAs, but viral escape was eventually apparent for most combinations due to acquisition of mutations with the typical Cas9/DNA repair signature in both targets. However, some gRNA combinations targeting highly conserved HIV sequences were found to completely block virus replication for the duration of our experiment, which lasted over four months [

In these cultures, we observed the gradual disappearance of wild-type and point-mutated HIV sequences and gradual accumulation of indels and multiple-nucleotide substitutions at both target sites, indicating repeated CRISPR–Cas9 attack on point-mutated targets. Attempts to rescue replication-competent virus from the infected dual-gRNA protected cells by co-culturing with susceptible cells failed after some incubation period. These results demonstrated that the infected cells were functionally cured through mutation of both antiviral target sites, leaving the cells with a graveyard of inactivated HIV proviruses. These studies provide the proof of principle that CRISPR–Cas9 can be used to cure HIV-infected cells [
