<p id="P17">A sterilizing cure will require delivery of Cas9 and the gRNAs to all HIV-1 reservoir cells. Several methods are available for transient delivery of these components (e.g. gRNA–Cas9 ribonucleoprotein particles and virus-like particles [
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–
 <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]), but their 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery efficiency is likely suboptimal. Vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) and HIV (lentiviral vector, LV) will facilitate prolonged Cas9 and gRNA activity and a more sustained therapeutic effect, but may also increase the risk of off-target effects. Although animal experiments show that HIV sequences can be targeted 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> through AAV and LV-mediated delivery of the CRISPR reagents [

 </xref>], the efficiency of current viral vectors is likely too low to reach all reservoir cells. A significant constraint is the restricted packaging capacity of the AAV and LV vectors, especially given the large size of the Cas9 gene. This problem may be reduced by the use of smaller Cas9 variants (e.g. 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Cas9 [saCas9]), truncated Cas9 proteins lacking non-essential domains or smaller gRNA/Cas9 cassettes [

 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The Cpf1 (Cas12a) system forms an interesting alternative as it has increased specificity but a small size, which could alleviate both the delivery and off-target problems [
 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The viral vector should preferably only target HIV reservoir cells, but development of such a vector is complicated by the fact that the viral reservoir is still poorly defined. Immune responses against the non-human Cas9 protein and the viral particles may also complicate this 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> inactivation strategy [
