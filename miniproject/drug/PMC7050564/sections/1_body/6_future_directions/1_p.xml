<p id="P16">CRISPR–Cas9 attack of the HIV proviral DNA in infected cells can lead to permanent inactivation of the virus when gRNA combinations are used that target essential, highly conserved viral domains. Besides coping with HIV genetic diversity, several other issues need to be addressed for the development of a safe and effective CRISPR–Cas9 HIV therapy. First, off-target CRISPR–Cas9 effects need to be excluded. Although 
 <italic>in silico</italic> design tools can predict off-target sites and optimized CRISPR–Cas9 systems with increased sequence-specificity have been developed [

 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], experimental validation seems necessary to exclude mutation of non-target sequences in the human genome. Large deletions extending over many kb and complex genomic rearrangements have also been detected in Cas9 studies [
