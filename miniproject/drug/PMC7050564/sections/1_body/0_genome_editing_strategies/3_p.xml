 </xref>] observed excisions and inversions in approximately 27% and 13% of sequences, respectively, when analyzing the Cas9-induced mutations resulting from several dual-gRNA combinations with an intervening region ranging from 2 to 20 kilobases (kb). Such excisions and inversions are frequently accompanied by indels at the cleavage sites. The CRISPR–Cas toolbox expanded in recent years and now includes systems originating from diverse bacterial species with distinct gRNA and PAM characteristics and different target specificities. The high specificity and efficiency of the CRISPR–Cas9 system have led to its widespread application, including in anti-HIV strategies [
