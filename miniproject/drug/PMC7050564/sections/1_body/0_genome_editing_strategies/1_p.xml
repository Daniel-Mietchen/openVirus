<p id="P2">Although much progress has been made in the fight against HIV, the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a definitive cure is still lacking. Multiple potent antiviral drugs have been developed that target different steps in the viral replication cycle (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Combining several drugs in a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce the viral load in patients to undetectable levels and prevent disease progression. However, these drugs do not target the HIV proviral DNA present in viral reservoir cells. The latently infected reservoir cells, predominantly long-living resting T cells but also other cell types [

 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], are not detected by the immune system and the virus will rebound from this reservoir when therapy is interrupted. HIV-infected individuals therefore face lifelong cART, which forms a serious burden because of the strict adherence that is required to prevent development of drug resistance and the potential side effects of the drugs. Ideally, novel antiviral strategies would permanently inactivate or even remove the integrated proviral DNA in all infected cells. Several DNA editing tools have been developed in the past decade that open the way to such curative anti-HIV strategies.
