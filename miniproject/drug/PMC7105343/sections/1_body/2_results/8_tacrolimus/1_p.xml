<p>Tacroliumus, also known as fujimycin, envarsus or FK506, is an immunosuppressive drug which is mainly administered after allogeneic organ transplant to lower risk of organ rejection. Itâ€™s mechanism of action focusses on inhibition of calcineurin which is involved in the production of IL-2. IL-2 is a cytokine which promotes the development and proliferation of T cells which form a vital component of the human adaptive immune response.</p>
