<p>This review focuses on how the JAK-STAT pathway can be manipulated to reduce viral entry and inflammation in patients with coronavirus. The main targets that the review highlighted were baricitinib (JAK inhibitor), IRE1Î± (an endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor, leading to an increased expression of negative regulators of JAK-STAT SOCS1 and SOCS3) and combination therapies using tylophorine-based compounds with JAK2 inhibitors.</p>
