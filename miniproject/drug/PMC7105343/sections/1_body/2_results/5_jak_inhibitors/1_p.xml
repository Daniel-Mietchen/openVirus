<p>JAK inhibitors work by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the JAK family of enzymes, including, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK3. JAKs interact with signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STATs) and the JAK-STAT pathway is central to cellular response to exogenous signals in the immune system. The JAK family of enzymes are responsible for signal transduction and JAK inhibitors play a major role in inhibiting and blocking cytokine release that can contribute to growth of malignant cells in cancer. JAK inhibitors are used in the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [
