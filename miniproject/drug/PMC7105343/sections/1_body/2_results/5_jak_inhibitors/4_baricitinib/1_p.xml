<p>Baricitinib (Olumiant) is a JAK inhibitor that was approved by the European Medicines Agency in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults with an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [

Most viruses enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. ACE2, a cell-surface protein expressed on cells in the kidney, blood vessels, heart, and alveola type 2 (AT2) cells in the pulmonary epithelia, may be the receptor that 2019-nCoV uses to infect lung cells. The authors of Richardson
