  <p>COVID-19 induces a pro-inflammatory generation and secretion of cytokines including IL-1b and IL-6 via the toll like receptors (TLR) that causes the production of active mature IL-1b which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL1-Ra, IL-37 or IL-38 could potentially provide relief in both systemic inflammation and fever occurring after infection [

  <p>Cytokine profiles in patients diagnosed with SARS showed marked elevation of T-helper lymphocyte type 1 (Th1) cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12 for at least two weeks after disease onset. Children however presented a much milder cytokine and chemokine storm [

  <p>The high levels of IL-6 in the acute stage associated with lung lesions found in SARS patients are activated by the viral nucleocapsid SARS-CoV N protein [

  <p>Over induction of inflammatory cytokine and dysregulation of cytokine signalling has been observed in patients with SARS in comparison with other respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (FluAV), and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2). SARS-CoV and RSV induced high levels of IL-6 and RANTES compared with FluAV and hPIV2 [

  <p>The N-protein of SARS-CoV induces pulmonary inflammatory reaction and acute lung injury, which were related to the increase and imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Glucocorticoids could effectively alleviate the pulmonary inflammatory reaction induced by N-protein of SARS-CoV [

  <p>SARS-CoV does not productively infect human macrophages (Mphi) or dentritic cells (DCs), however it modulates a massive release of IL-6 and IL-12 and compromises the endocytic capacity (e.g., antigen capture capture) of Mphi was significantly compromised [

  <p>Changes in plasma T helper (Th) cell cytokines, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in 20 patients diagnosed with SARS were assessed. The elevation of Th1 cytokine IFN-γ, inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12 and chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10 confirmed the activation of Th1 cell-mediated immunity and hyper-innate inflammatory response in SARS through the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [
