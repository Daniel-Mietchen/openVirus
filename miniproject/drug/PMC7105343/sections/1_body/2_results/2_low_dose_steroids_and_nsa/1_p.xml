<p>Since the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 infection, various contradictory information has been circulated regarding the potentially negative effect of treating patients with NSAIDs, non-NSAIDs and corticosteroids. NSAIDs work through inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1/COX-2), which are involved in the synthesis of key biological mediators. These mediators in turn control inflammation. Corticosteroids are involved in a number of key physiological processes including the immune response and inflammation and low-dose steroids are often prescribed to cancer patients with suppressed immune systems to prevent the development of related auto-immune diseases.</p>
