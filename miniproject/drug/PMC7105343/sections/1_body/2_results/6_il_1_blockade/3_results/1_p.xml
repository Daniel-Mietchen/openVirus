 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and repeatedly demonstrated increased IL-1 levels in patients infected with a coronavirus. One study investigated the levels of various inflammatory cytokines in 29, COVID-19 patients in China and compared the levels between general, severe and critically ill groups [
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The authors reported no significant differences in IL-1b levels between the three groups of patients. Another study involving 20 consecutive SARS patients admitted to a Hong Kong hospital identified significantly elevated levels of IL-1β within the first 12, 7 and 5 days following onset of infection [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Those patients with more severe disease were treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and IL-1β levels returned to normal after 7 days. The seven patients with less severe disease did not receive any dosage of corticosteroids and their cytokine levels returned to normal range levels over the same 7-day time period.
