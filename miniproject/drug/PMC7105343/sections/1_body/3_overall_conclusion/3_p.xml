<p>Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus therapy may have beneficial impacts on the course of SARS-CoV-2. This observation requires further validation. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFa biological agents are contraindicated. There is evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications. Ongoing studies of blockade of the IL-6 pathway are rational and will hopefully inform practice as the pandemic progresses.</p>
