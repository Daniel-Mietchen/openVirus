       <p>The authors of this study set out to study the inflammatory cytokine profile in children with SARS. They found that the plasma concentrations key proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 were not substantially increased in any of the patients throughout the course of illness. From this the authors stated that the cytokine results cast doubt on the liberal use of corticosteroids in paediatric SARS patients, as the host immunologic response did not seem to be as severe as initially anticipated.</p>
