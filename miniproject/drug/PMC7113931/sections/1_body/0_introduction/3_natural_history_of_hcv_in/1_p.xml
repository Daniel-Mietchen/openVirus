<p>Infection with HCV can present either as acute or chronic hepatitis. Acute hepatitis is usually asymptomatic and rarely leads to hepatic failure. Symptomatic acute HCV infection has a mild clinical course with less than one fourth (&lt;25%) of patients presenting with jaundice. About 60–80% patients with acute infection develop chronic infection.[

 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] There are several factors which may determine the rapidity of disease progression which include: HCV acquisition at an advanced age (&gt;40–55 years), male sex, HIV co-infection, high body mass index, presence of hepatic steatosis, and alcohol consumption. Patients with cirrhosis can decompensate with complications like portal hypertension, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic coma, and hepatorenal syndrome leading to renal failure. Chronic infection can also be associated with extra-hepatic manifestations such as cryoglobulinemia, porphyria cutanea tarda, arthralgia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[
