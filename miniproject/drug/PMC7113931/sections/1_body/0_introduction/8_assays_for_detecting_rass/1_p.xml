<p>The methods to detect RASs in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B include population sequencing (Sanger sequencing) and deep sequencing (Next generation sequencing), which differ in their sensitivity for detecting RASs. For the purposes of clinical care and decisions regarding the choice of appropriate DAA regimen, both methods can be considered equivalent if a â‰¥15% cutoff point is used for the determination of RASs by NGS. However, the presence of RASs with &lt;15% prevalence should not be considered clinically significant. Phenotypic analysis involves laboratory techniques whereby the degree of drug resistance conferred by an amino acid substitution and the replicative capacity of a particular RAS can be estimated in the presence of a wild-type or consensus strain.[
