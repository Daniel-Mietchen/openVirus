<p>HCV is an enveloped virus harboring a 9.6 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA. The genome carries a long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein precursor of 3010 amino acids. Translation of the HCV ORF is directed via a 340-nucleotide-long 5â€™ nontranslated region (NTR) functioning as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which permits the direct binding of ribosomes in close proximity to the start codon of the ORF. The HCV polyprotein is cleaved co- and posttranslationally by cellular and viral proteases into ten different products which are broadly classified as structural [core (C), E1, and E2)] and nonstructural (NS2-5) replicative proteins.[
