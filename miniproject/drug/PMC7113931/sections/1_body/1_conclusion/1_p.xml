<p>Management of HCV infection is a challenge for both hepatologists and virologists alike. Emergence of resistance to many currently available anti-HCV drugs is alarming and, therefore, it is imperative to performin vitro RAS testing especially in patients on DAA therapy who fail to attain a sustained viral response. Keeping in mind the emerging concept of management of chronic HCV infections at the primary healthcare level, physicians should be made aware of the importance of emerging resistance to directly acting antiviral drugs to avoid their misuse.</p>
