<p id="Par19">In mice treated with tilorone after maEBOV challenge or in unchallenged animals numerous cytokines and chemokines increased significantly (

 <italic>vs</italic> vehicle and naïve groups showed significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-17, Eotaxin, MCP-1, MIP-1B and RANTES. IL-10, IL-12 (p40), MCP-1, MIP-1B and RANTES. In multiple cases the unchallenged tilorone mice had a significantly higher response for many of the cytokines and chemokines as compared with the maEBOV-challenged group administered tilorone. This is the case for IL-2, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), Eotaxin and RANTES. Tilorone has also been shown to increase

While we have found no references referring explicitly to side effects of tilorone, the production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to drug treatment may exacerbate the clinical symptoms of some viral infections which result in cytokine storms such as influenza (
