<p id="Par16">Despite its history of use for viral diseases, its activity against EBOV was discovered using a machine-learning computational model trained on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-Ebola screening data. The training data was generated through a large collaborative drug-repurposing program that identified multiple classes of Ebola inhibitors with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activities (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). This model predicted Ebola inhibitory activity for tilorone, which was then tested using an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-Ebola assay for activity. Tilorone gave a 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) in this assay of 230 nM (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref>), making it one of the most potent small-molecule inhibitors of EBOV reported at the time (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>). After a series of toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies, the compound was tested in a mouse model of EBOV infection where it was associated with 90-100% survival in a mouse EBOV efficacy study at three different doses. For comparison, the vehicle-treated group had only 10% survival (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>). Interestingly, tilorone was either comparable or had significantly reduced survival rates as compared to the vehicle in guinea pigs infected with EBOV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). These results led us to more broadly profile the antiviral spectrum of activity for Tilorone (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref>). Recent data suggests Tilorone can be used for Marburg (MARV) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>) as well Chikungunya virus (CHIK) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref>) making it a potential broad-spectrum class of antiviral therapeutic as it has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical animal disease models against very diverse viral families including, filovirus, hepadnavirus, human herpesvirus, orthomyxovirus, picornavirus, alphavirus, rhabdovirus, and flavivirus.
