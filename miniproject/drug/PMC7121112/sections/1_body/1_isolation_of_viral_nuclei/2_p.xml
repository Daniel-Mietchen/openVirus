<p id="Par7">Buffers have been developed for some sample types, e.g. faecal samples, which preserve the nucleic acids present in the sample. For swabs, extraction tubes are available in which the swab can be placed directly to preserve the nucleic acids. In case of tissue samples or biopsies, the tissue has to be disrupted to release viral DNA or RNA e.g. by sonication, freezing, special DNA isolation kits for tissue, etc.</p>
