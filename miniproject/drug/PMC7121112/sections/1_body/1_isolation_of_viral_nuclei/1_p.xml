<p id="Par6">Viral diagnostics are performed on a wide range of clinical materials, including (EDTA) plasma, whole blood, faeces, respiratory or genital swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (liquor), urine, tissue samples or biopsies, broncho-alveolar lavage fluids, etc. Extraction of the viral DNA or RNA is a critical step in the whole procedure of viral diagnostics. For some materials, pre-treatment of the sample is necessary to disrupt the tissue, release the virus or deactivate inhibitory factors. Inhibitory factors for PCR are for instance bile in faeces or haemoglobin in blood samples. Some viruses are not stable and clinical materials have to be processed within several hours to ensure optimal test results. Especially in case of viral load determination, accurate and timely sample processing is essential. This applies for instance to HIV viral load testing in plasma.</p>
