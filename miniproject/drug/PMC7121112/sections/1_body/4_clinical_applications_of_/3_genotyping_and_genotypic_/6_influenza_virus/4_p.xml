<p id="Par63">For more specific information, the virus has to be sequenced. The whole genome consists of around 2,800,000 nucleotides. Within influenza strains, different isolates can be distinguished, revealing the highly variable genetic structure of this virus. In patient care, the strain type is related to sensitivity for antiviral treatment. Most influenza A and B strains are sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir, two neuraminidase inhibitors. Occasionally, resistant strains are found, sometimes related to long-term treatment of influenza infection in immunocompromised patients. Resistance to oseltamivir has also been reported during the 2007â€“2008-winter season, due to a mutation on position 275 of the neuraminidase gene, resulting in the substitution of a histidine to a tyrosine (H275Y). Strains that have this mutation, however, are still susceptible to zanamivir.</p>
