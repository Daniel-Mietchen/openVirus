<p id="Par60">Influenza is a member of the family of Orthomyxoviridae, of which the virus species influenza A, influenza B and influenza C can cause our classical ‘flu’. The influenza A species consists of different strains, designated according to the structure of their haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. These are the most variable viral proteins and are involved in attachment to the target cell and fusion with the endosomal membrane. Influenza viruses have a segmented RNA-genome (8 segments), the NA and HA-coding sequences are on different segments and can be exchanged. HA is encoded on segment nr 4 and NA on segment nr 6. Within influenza A, there are at least 16 HA-encoding segments known, of which segments numbered H1–H5 are known as human variants, and 9 NA-variants. Recombination of influenza variants may lead to new combinations of H- and N-genes (antigenic shift), whereas mutations in the H- and N-genes lead to new variants with slightly different properties (antigenic drift). This antigenic drift causes that for instance two A(H3N2) strains may have slightly different antigenic properties. Antigenic drift of less pathogenic viral strains, however, may lead to more pathogenic strains. Usually, every winter season there are one or a few dominant influenza strains active, often one or two A-strains and one B-strain. Within these strains, different isolates can be distinguished.</p>
