<p id="Par55">Detection of drug-resistant variants is done with sequence-based assays. Sequence variation between the genotypes of hepatitis C is large and makes it difficult to design primers for amplification and sequencing of the protease-, NS5A or polymerase genes of hepatitis C. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">3.2</xref> it is shown that even within a hepatitis C genotype and subtype, there is considerable sequence variation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">3.2</xref>).
