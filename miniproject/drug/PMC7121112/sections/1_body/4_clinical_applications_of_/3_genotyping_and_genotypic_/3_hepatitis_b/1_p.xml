<p id="Par50">The hepatitis B virus consists of genotypes A through H. The small differences between these genotypes are responsible for the differences in the risk of the development of liver carcinoma and the response to treatment. Treatment of hepatitis B with antiviral medication aims at long-term suppression of the hepatitis B virus and at reducing related morbidity and mortality. Thus far, the differences in genotypes have only been shown to have minor consequences for treatment strategies, but they are of interest for predictions. For instance, hepatitis B genotypes A and B seem to respond relatively well to treatment with Interferon-alpha, compared to, for instance, genotype C and D. A physician tends to preferably treat genotypes A or B with Interferon. Treatment with Interferon aims at improving the antiviral response of the immune system, at reducing viral susceptibility of cells by enhancing Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-antigen expression and at inducing cellular proteins that are important in the natural defense of cells against viruses. This leads to immune control of the chronic hepatitis B infection.</p>
