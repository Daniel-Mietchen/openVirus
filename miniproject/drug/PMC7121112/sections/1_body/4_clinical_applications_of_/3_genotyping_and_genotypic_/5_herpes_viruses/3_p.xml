<p id="Par58">The same genes (thymidine kinase and polymerase) are involved in resistance of VZV to antiviral therapy. The first infection with varicella zoster virus gives chickenpox. Varicella zoster virus remains latently present in neural axons of the central nervous system and can reactivate, causing shingles. Treatment is similar to herpes simplex virus treatment, with acyclovir or foscarnet. Resistance testing is also performed by sequencing (part of) the thymidine kinase and polymerase genes and comparing to reference sequences.</p>
