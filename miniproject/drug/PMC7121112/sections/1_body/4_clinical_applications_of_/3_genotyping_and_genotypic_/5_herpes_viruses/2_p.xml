<p id="Par57">HSV 1 and 2 cause lesions in the mouth that are usually not harmful. However, these lesions can become severe in immune suppressed patients and systemic illness may occur. For HSV 1 and 2, 7â€“14% of patients that receive treatment with acyclovir, or similar medications like valaciclovir and famciclovir, become resistant. Up to 95% of resistance to acyclovir is associated with mutations in the thymidine-kinase gene (UL23). Viral thymidine-kinase phosphorylates acyclovir, which is a necessary step in the antiviral mechanism of acyclovir, before it can act as a nucleotide analogue to disturb viral DNA synthesis. Acyclovir-resistant variants may still be sensitive to foscarnet. Foscarnet blocks DNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting viral DNA synthesis. Mutations in UL30 (polymerase-gene) are associated with resistance to foscarnet. In both genes, many polymorphisms may be present. Resistance to acyclovir is often associated with insertions or deletions in the thymidine-kinase gene. Also, some single mutations are associated with resistance. Thorough analysis of the gene sequences, comparisons to reference strains and to mutations found in literature are necessary for analysis.</p>
