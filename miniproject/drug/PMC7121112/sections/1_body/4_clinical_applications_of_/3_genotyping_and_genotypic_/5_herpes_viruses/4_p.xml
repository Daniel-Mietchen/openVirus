<p id="Par59">First choice of treatment for CMV is ganciclovir. Ganciclovir is a guanosine analogue that exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting CMV DNA polymerase. Ganciclovir is phosphorylated by a viral phosphotransferase coded on UL97. The CMV DNA polymerase is a product of UL54. Mutations in both genes can lead to resistance. However, mutations in UL97 are significantly more common than mutations in UL54. Mutations in UL54 are associated with higher levels of resistance to ganciclovir or cross-resistance to cidofovir or foscarnet.</p>
