<p id="Par49">Some mutations are able to individually induce reduced susceptibility to antiviral drugs, whereas some mutations invoke resistance only in combination with other mutations. For anti-HIV medication, the terms low- or high-genetic barrier are often used to indicate whether resistance can evolve easily or requires more than one mutation. Resistance is usually tested by sequencing part of the genome. Various online tools can assist the laboratory workers with the analysis of genotyping test results. The international AIDS society (USA) maintains a list of resistance-associated mutations (
