<p id="Par33">Since then, quantitative viral load determination is implemented in patient monitoring for other viral infections as well. Most people are infected with cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. These viruses usually do not cause problems, but occasionally cause viremia (virus detectable in blood) without symptoms. However, these viruses can cause major problems in patients after stem cell transplantation. Treatment against these viruses is installed when a certain viral load is reached. For EBV, it was shown that a viral load &gt;10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/ml is predictive for the development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. By starting antiviral therapy when this viral load is reached, but before symptoms appear (pre-emptive therapy), it was shown that the EBV-related mortality significantly reduced in these patients.
