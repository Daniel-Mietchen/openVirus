<p id="Par36">A third reason for the quantification of viral DNA or RNA is monitoring the effect of antiviral treatment. The ultimate goal of antiviral treatment is to prevent damage to the host by the infection. Antiviral treatment is installed to reduce the viral load and to prevent this damage. Applications to monitor the effect of antiviral treatment are being used for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and herpes viruses, like cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The primary goal is to decrease the viral load to an undetectable limit. Monitoring of the decrease in viral load directly after starting therapy can have a predictive value for treatment success. For some viruses, the absence of a certain decline in viral load may be an indication to stop or to switch treatment.</p>
