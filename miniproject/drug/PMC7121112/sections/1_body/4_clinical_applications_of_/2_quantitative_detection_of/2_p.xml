<p id="Par32">There are three major reasons for quantitative detection of viral DNA or RNA. The first reason is that the amount of virus (‘viral load’), which is usually reflected in the amount of viral DNA or RNA present, can be an indication of the seriousness of the infection. This was first demonstrated for HIV by using a quantitative HIV-1 bDNA technique. An increasing amount of HIV-1 RNA genomes in plasma was directly correlated with a decrease in CD4+ T-cells, with disease progression and HIV-1 induced mortality. Since these findings were published, HIV-1 viral load monitoring is a major factor in the decision for antiviral treatment.</p>
