<p id="Par34">A second reason for quantification of the viral DNA or RNA is that the risk of viral transmission is directly related to the amount of virus present. Vertical transmission (from mother to child during pregnancy or at birth) is an example. Vertical transmission of HIV can be prevented either by decreasing the viral load during pregnancy by antiviral therapy, or by performing a caesarian section. For hepatitis B virus, it is also shown that the risk of vertical transmission is directly related to the viral load of the mother. Infection can be prevented by immediate active and passive vaccination of the newborn. However, the risk of vertical transmission is still present if the mother has a high viral load (&gt;2 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> IU/ml). In that case, it is also recommended to start antiviral treatment in the last trimester of the pregnancy.
