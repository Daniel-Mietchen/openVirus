<p id="Par35">Alternatively, in case of needle stick incidents, the viral load is directly related to the chance of transmission of the virus. Needle stick accidents is a collective name for incidents in which health care workers accidently come into contact with patient fluids that may be contaminated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. Accidental blood contact occurs frequently in hospitals. Measures taken after accidental contact comprise monitoring of viral load in both the victim of the needle stick accident and the patient and/or preventive antiviral treatment. Vice versa, health care workers may also infect patients. Several countries have taken measures to prevent transmission of viral infections to patients. For hepatitis B, several cases of transmission from health care workers to patients are known. Physicians with a high hepatitis B viral load are forbidden to perform medical procedures that pose a risk for patients in most countries.</p>
