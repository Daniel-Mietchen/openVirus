<p id="Par9">Several molecular techniques are used for the detection of viruses. Widely used are target-amplification methods based on the (reverse transcriptase) polymerase chain reaction ((RT-) PCR). Other target-amplification methods are nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA). NASBA and TMA are isothermal target-amplification techniques and are described in Chap. 7 of Volume 1.</p>
