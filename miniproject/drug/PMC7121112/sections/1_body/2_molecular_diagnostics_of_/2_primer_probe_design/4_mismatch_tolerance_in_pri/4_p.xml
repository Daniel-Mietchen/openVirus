<p id="Par19">In clinical practice, it is desirable to perform multiple PCR reactions on one sample in one PCR run, either as multiplex or in different wells (singleplex). This means that there is a beforehand established annealing temperature and fixed Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration. Primers are selected that anneal optimally at this temperature, either by adjusting the length of the primer, by adjusting the sequence or by using nucleotide-analogues (see Vol. 1, Chap. 4).
