<p id="Par18">The effect of mutations also depends on the amplification enzyme. When using M-MLV/Taq polymerase for reverse-transcriptase, mutations in the reverse-primer binding site have nearly no effect, probably because of the low optimal temperature (37 ℃) at which M-MLV is active as reverse transcriptase, compared to AMV (optimal temperature 45 ℃). Mutations in the forward-primer binding site seem of less importance when rTth is used as polymerase. Not only the enzymes, but also other factors, like the constituents of the master mix (salt concentration) and hot start, may affect the influence of mutations in the primer binding sites.</p>
