<p id="Par17">Mutations in the target DNA at the 3′-OH end of the primer, the site where the elongation starts, may compromise elongation and PCR efficiency (Vol. 1, Sect. 5.5). This effect of mismatching has been investigated and is directly related to nucleotides involved (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">3.1</xref>). Studies show that mutations at the 3′-part of the primer, where the polymerase starts the elongation, lead to a suboptimal amplification efficiency and an underestimation of the amount of target. Mismatches A·A (A in the primer and A in the target), A·G, G·A, G·G and C·C lead to an underestimation of the amount of the target by a factor of 100. T·C, C·T, or T·T mismatches result in an underestimation by a factor of 10 to 100 of the target and A·C, C·A, T·G and G·T mismatches have nearly no effect. The inhibitory effect on target amplification decreases when the mutation is moved to the 5′-end of the primer and disappears after 5 nucleotides from the 3′-primer end. The effect of mutations in primers and primer binding sites also depends on the G/C content of the primers and the sequence itself (e.g. the G/C content on the 3′-end of the primer) and the annealing temperature.
