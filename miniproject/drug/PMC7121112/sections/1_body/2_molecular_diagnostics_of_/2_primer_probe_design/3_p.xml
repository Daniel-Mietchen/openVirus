<p id="Par15">When multiple targets must be detected in one clinical sample within one PCR run, primers and probes should be used that bind under similar PCR conditions (temperature, concentration, etc.). The design of the primers and probes is important and self- and cross-hybridization has to be avoided. The more PCR reactions are performed in one-tube, the more difficult this will be. When combining different PCR reactions, these factors must be taken into account and comprehensive testing is mandatory when used for patient diagnostics (see Vol. 1, Chap. 5).</p>
