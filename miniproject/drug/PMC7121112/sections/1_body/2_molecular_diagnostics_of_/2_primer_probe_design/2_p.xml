<p id="Par14">For the detection of viruses, primers and probes are preferably designed to anneal to conserved regions of the viral genome. More variable parts of the viral genome usually code for proteins that are targeted by the immune system, such as the envelope proteins or other structural proteins. Obviously, primers and probes designed to target these variable areas will have a greater chance to miss variants.</p>
