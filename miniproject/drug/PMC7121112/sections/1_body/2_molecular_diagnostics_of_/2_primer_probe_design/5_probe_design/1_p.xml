   <p id="Par21">Hydrolysis probes bind to the target sequence during the annealing phase. These probes are designed with a T
    <sub>m</sub> approx. 10 ℃ higher than the T
    <sub>m</sub> of the primers. During DNA synthesis, in the elongation phase, the hybridized probe is reached and hydrolysed by the 5′-3′-exonuclease activity of the polymerase. By breaking down the probe, the reporter-fluorochrome (VIC, FAM, TET, etc.) and quencher (TAMRA) are separated and ‘fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)’ (the signal from the reporter) is released (see Vol. 1, Chap. 3). MGB-or LNA-probes are types of hydrolysis probes that are frequently used in qPCR assays for the diagnosis of viral infections (Vol. 1, Chap. 3). When these probes are designed well, they allow up to three mismatches in the target sequence without much loss of signal. Applications where mismatch-tolerance is needed are for instance qPCR for detection of variable viral targets. However, in virology, there are also applications where it is important that molecular variation is detected, for instance in the detection of viral variants with different pathogenicity or in the detection of mutations that are associated with resistance to antiviral medication. So, depending on the purpose of the assay, more or less mismatches can be tolerated.

   <p id="Par22">Hybridisation probes used in viral diagnostics can be used as molecular ‘beacons’. Molecular ‘beacons’ are long probes with a loop structure, which contains the part of the probe that binds to the target region. Attached to the probe are two G-C rich, complementary regions that create the hairpin structure. One side of the probe is labelled with the fluorescent dye, the other with the quencher. These probes release a fluorescent signal upon hybridization to the target DNA and are not hydrolysed during the elongation phase in the PCR reaction. Molecular ‘beacon’ probes can be designed (T
    <sub>m</sub> of the loop compared to the T
    <sub>m</sub> of the stem) to be very sensitive to detect mutations, for example mutations that are associated with viral resistance. Other hybridization probes are double stranded probes containing a long strand (&gt;40 nt) labelled with the reporter fluorochrome and a short strand homologous to the reporter probe (&lt;16 nt), which is labelled with the quencher molecule. During elongation, the reporter probe will preferably bind to the target DNA and the probe with the quencher will be released, thereby releasing the signal. This method allows detection of the signal at much lower temperatures (until 37 ℃) and is much less sensitive to mutations in the target sequence without affecting the PCR efficiency. However, these probes are more difficult to design compared to hydrolysis probes.
