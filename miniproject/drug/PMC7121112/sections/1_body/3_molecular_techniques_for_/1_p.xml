<p id="Par23">It is not only important to detect a virus, but often the analysis of genotypic characteristics of the virus is also important. Within one species, there are often strains with different characteristics and different pathogenicity, in need of other treatment strategies. An example is the group of enteroviruses. The genus enterovirus consists of the species echovirus, rhinovirus, poliovirus, enterovirus and coxsackievirus. Furthermore, these species consist of several subspecies and strains. In viral diagnostics, it is important to distinguish, for instance, the pathogenic poliovirus from other species within the genus of enteroviruses, but it may also be relevant to type viruses within the species. This can be done to obtain information on the relationship between different isolates in case of outbreaks, to identify strains with increased virulence or for epidemiological purposes. Another example is human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is associated with cervical cancer. Within this genus there are high-risk HPV (hrHPV) strains, (e.g. HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 53, 66 and 68), probably hrHPV strains (e.g. HPV 26) and low-risk HPV strains (e.g. 40, 42, 72, 81 etc.). Distinguishing these (probably) hrHPV strains from the low-risk strains is essential for clinical diagnostics.</p>
