<p id="Par27">In some cases, information of only a selected part of the genome or of only a few mutations is necessary for subtyping or detection of antiviral resistance. For some applications, for instance genotyping of human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C, or for the detection of drug-resistant variants for hepatitis B, hybridization assays have been developed (LiPA). These assays consist of a qPCR combined with a hybridization assay (Vol. 1, Chaps. 4 and 5). The hybridization assay is performed on nitrocellulose strips that contain lines loaded with genotype-specific oligonucleotides. To detect drug-resistant variants, the strips contain wild type and mutant-specific oligonucleotide probes. The advantage of this method, compared to sequencing, is that more samples can be processed in the same time and that the evaluation of test results is less time-consuming. However, an obvious disadvantage is that mutations appearing outside the oligonucleotides used in the assay are not detected and newly emerged variants are not distinguished. Furthermore, natural variation of the virus is not visible.</p>
