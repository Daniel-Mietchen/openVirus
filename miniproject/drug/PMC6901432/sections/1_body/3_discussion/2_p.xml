<p>The mechanism by which omeprazole enhances the activity of acyclovir seems to differ from the mechanism by which omeprazole increases 5-fluorouracil efficacy, which was shown to be the consequence of an increase of the lysosomal pH (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Luciani et al., 2004</xref>). Lysosomotropic drugs such as chloroquine and ammonium chloride are known to interfere with the infection of viruses including HSV. These drugs increase intracellular pH presumably resulting in inhibition of viral packing and maturation through

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Salata et al., 2017</xref>). In agreement, omeprazole concentrations ≥40 μg/mL reduced HSV-1 and HSV-2 titers. However, the effects of omeprazole on the anti-HSV activity of acyclovir were more pronounced than the direct antiviral effects and lower omeprazole concentrations, which did not affect HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication, still substantially enhanced the efficacy of acyclovir. This indicates that the induction of increased acyclovir activity is not a direct consequence of antiviral activity exerted by omeprazole and may be caused by a different mechanism. Moreover, omeprazole pre-treatment was necessary to increase 5-fluorouracil activity (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Luciani et al., 2004</xref>), but omeprazole and acyclovir exerted their combined activity when added at the same time 1 h post infection. This indicates that the mechanisms by which omeprazole increases 5-fluorouracil and acyclovir activity differ and that omeprazole increases the antiviral activity of acyclovir during the viral replication cycle after infection and virus internalization. The proton pump inhibitors pantoprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole, and dexlansoprazole increased acyclovir activity in a similar manner as omeprazole. Hence, the capacity to increase the antiviral activity of acyclovir seems to be a drug class effect, which is common to proton pump inhibitors in general. Notably, proton pump inhibitors have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects independently of their effects on H

 <sup>+</sup> ATPase activity, which may contribute to the increased acyclovir activity mediated by proton pump inhibitors (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Ghebre, 2018</xref>). In addition, omeprazole may inhibit DNA damage repair (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martelli et al., 1998</xref>), which may increase the efficacy of acyclovir. Therefore, proton pump inhibitors may increase acyclovir activity by mechanisms that do not involve the modulation of the lysosomal pH.
