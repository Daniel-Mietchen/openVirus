<p>Since omeprazole is a clinically well-established drug with a preferable safety profile, it is an excellent candidate for drug repositioning strategies (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ikemura et al., 2017</xref>), and there is a need for improved therapies for HSV-1- and HSV-2-associated disease. After primary infection, HSV-1 and HSV-2 establish life-long persistence which may result in recurrent disease which typically manifests as herpes labialis or herpes genitalis and which may be associated with significant morbidity (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gnann and Whitley, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Heslop et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Klysik et al., 2018</xref>). Even in the case of herpes labialis, which is not commonly associated with severe complications, treatment success is not always satisfactory as highlighted by the introduction of topical acyclovir/hydrocortisone combinations (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). Omeprazole may not exert general immunosuppressive effects in the same way as hydrocortisone but to more specifically increase acyclovir activity. In immunodeficiency individuals, HSV-1 and -2 infections are often associated with more severe disease, and resistance formation to acyclovir is a severe problem (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Karrasch et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, ocular HSV infection is a major cause of blindness in industrialized countries (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Klysik et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, more effective treatment options for HSV-1- and HSV-2-caused disease are highly desirable. In this context, proton pump inhibitors are promising candidates for combination with acyclovir or valacyclovir in topical preparations. Further research will have to show to which extent effective proton pump inhibitor concentrations can also be achieved systemically. For omeprazole, maximum plasma levels have been described to reach about 8 Î¼g/mL, when it is used for inhibition of acid secretion in the stomach (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Kim, 2013</xref>). Hence, the achievement of therapeutically effective plasma concentrations seems possible, given that a dose increase may be feasible in a severe acute disease setting.
