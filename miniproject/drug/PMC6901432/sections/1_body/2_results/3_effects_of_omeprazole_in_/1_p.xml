<p>HSV-1- and HSV-2-induced CPE formation were investigated in Vero and HaCaT cells. Vero is a continuous cell line derived from kidney epithelial cells of an African green monkey (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Yasumura and Kawakita, 1963</xref>). Vero cells are interferon-deficient and used to cultivate many different viruses (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Montagnon and Vincent-Falquet, 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barrett et al., 2009</xref>). HaCaT is a spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (

 <sub>50</sub>) were reduced by 11-fold in HSV-1-infected Vero cells and by 7-fold in HSV-2-infected Vero cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Further, omeprazole 80 μg/mL reduced the acyclovir IC
 <sub>50</sub>s by 48-fold in HSV-1-infected HaCaT cells and by 13-fold in HSV-2-infected HaCaT cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Immune staining also indicated reduced numbers of virus-infected cells after treatment with a combination of omeprazole and acyclovir compared to either single treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In agreement, Western blot analysis demonstrated strongly reduced HSV gB protein levels in cells treated with this combination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Further experiments indicated that omeprazole reduced acyclovir IC
 <sub>50</sub>s in HSV-1- and HSV-2-infected HaCaT cells in a dose-dependent fashion (
