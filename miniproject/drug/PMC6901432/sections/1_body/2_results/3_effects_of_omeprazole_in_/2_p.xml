<p>Although omeprazole did not affect the HSV-1 and HSV-2 CPEs in concentrations of up to 80 μg/mL, the determination of virus titers in Vero cells showed that 80 μg/mL omeprazole inhibited the production of infectious HSV-1 particles and that 40 and 80 μg/mL omeprazole inhibited the production of infectious HSV-2 particles. In agreement with the findings from the CPE assays, omeprazole also strongly increased the anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 effects of acyclovir. Notably, this omeprazole-induced increase of acyclovir activity was also seen at lower omeprazole concentrations, which did not directly reduce virus titers (
