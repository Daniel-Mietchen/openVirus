<p>Rates of acquisition of resistance could have important implications in regard to durability of therapy.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-viruses-02-02493">30</xref>]. This is doubtless a reflection of the use of well-tolerated effective drugs that have long mutually reinforcing intracellular half-lives that act in combination to suppress viral replication and prevent the emergence of resistance mutations. However, higher numbers of patients and longer follow-up will be required to assess if there is a consistent impact of subtype C in the emergence of K65R in clinical settings.
