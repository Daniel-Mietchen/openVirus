<p>HIV phenotypic assays have failed to find differences of large magnitude in the susceptibilities of B 
 <italic>versus</italic> non-B subtypes. This is consistent with what has been observed at a molecular level. However, there are few data on relative susceptibility levels among subtypes carrying specific major resistance mutations. More information is required, because many polymorphisms in non-B viruses are considered to be secondary resistance mutations based on the fact that they emerge in B subtype viruses after drug exposure. However, the effect of such polymorphisms within different genetic backgrounds cannot always be extrapolated to non-B subtypes. They might sometimes contribute to higher levels of resistance in certain genetic backgrounds but could also have either a neutral effect or hypersensitize HIV to ARVs, e.g., I93L is a secondary resistance mutation in subtype B but causes hypersusceptibility to PIs in subtype C [
