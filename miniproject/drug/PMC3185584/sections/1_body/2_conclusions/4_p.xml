<p>Novel NNRTI resistance mutations have been found in subtype C that had not been recognized in subtype B. In tissue culture, subtype C can acquire a different mutation (the V106M substitution) under NNRTI drug pressure compared to what is seen in subtype B, and this mutation confers broad cross-resistance to an extent that supersedes the equivalent V106A mutation subtype B.</p>
