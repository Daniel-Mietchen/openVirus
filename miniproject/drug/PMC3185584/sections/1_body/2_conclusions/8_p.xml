<p>The potential of cross-resistance acquires importance in settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Few 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> comparative data are available for protease inhibitors in non-B subtypes, yet such data may be crucial to understanding cross resistance to specific drugs [

Importantly, PIs may be the only potentially widely accessible option for drug sequencing in salvage therapy in most resource-limited settings. Moreover, the fact that resistance to PIs commonly requires that large numbers of resistance mutations be present may result in a situation in which the individual contribution of any single mutation to drug resistance, with some exceptions will be slight. This is a definite advantage of using drugs with a high genetic barrier for the development of drug resistance. It also follows that differences among subtypes with regard to development of drug resistance are more likely to be important for NRTIs and NNRTIs than for PIs.
