<p>One study reported a lower risk for accumulation of major (primary) resistance mutations in subtype C than B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-viruses-02-02493">64</xref>]. Qualitatively, the major mutations that emerged in both subtypes were the same. The fact that both subtypes B and C patients had similar profiles of virological failure after use of the same ART regimens rules out ancillary factors responsible for the difference. Several minor mutations in subtype B PR may appear as frequent natural polymorphisms in several non-B subtypes (e.g., M36I, L89M) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-viruses-02-02493">58</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-viruses-02-02493">59</xref>]. The L89M polymorphism can lead to the M89I mutation that confers resistance to PIs. Thus, it makes sense that there might be a lower accumulation of major mutations in C subtypes, if we assume that these natural polymorphisms act similarly in subtype C as they do when present as secondary resistance mutations in subtype B.
