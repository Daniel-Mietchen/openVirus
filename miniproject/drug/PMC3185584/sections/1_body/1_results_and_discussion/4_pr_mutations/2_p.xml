<p>With respect to PR, the D30N mutation was not observed in CRF02_AG and CRF02_AE isolates from patients failing NFV therapy; rather, the N88S mutation emerged after NFV use in CRF01_AE and after IDV use in subtype B [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-viruses-02-02493">53</xref>]. A third study reported an absence of the D30N mutation in CRF01_AE, but no information on the specific type of PIs received by the patients was provided [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-viruses-02-02493">56</xref>], suggesting that subtype C viruses from Ethiopia (the origin of the samples identified in Israel) and southern Africa might behave differently. The M89I/V mutations have been observed in F, G and C subtypes but not in other subtypes [
