<p>Two comprehensive surveys have reported differences in natural protease polymorphisms among non-B subtypes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-viruses-02-02493">63</xref>]. In these studies, positions less frequently mutated in non-B subtypes than in subtype B after exposure to ARVs included changes at PR residues 10, 20, and 63 in subtype A; residues 20, 53, 63, 74, and 82 in subtype C; residues 13 and 20 in subtype D; residues 10, 14, 20, and 77 in subtype F; residues 20, 67, 73, 82, and 88 in subtype G; residues 20, 63, 82, and 89 in CRF01_AE; and residue 20 in CRF02_AG [
