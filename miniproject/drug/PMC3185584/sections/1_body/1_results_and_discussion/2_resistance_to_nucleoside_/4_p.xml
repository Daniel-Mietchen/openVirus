<p>Advanced ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) techniques have been used to detect the spread of K65R as transmitted and/or minority species in treatment-naïve populations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-viruses-02-02493">41</xref>]. Patients harboring subtype C infections showed a higher frequency of K65R than subtype B variants (1.04% 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 0.25%) by UDPS but these differences were not replicated using limiting dilution clonal sequencing approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-viruses-02-02493">40</xref>]. The discrepant UDPS findings are consistent with PCR-induced pausing, leading to low-level spontaneous generation of K65R in subtype C. This does not, however, negate the higher risk of development of K65R in subtype C populations failing regimens containing d4T, ddI, or tenofovir (TFV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-viruses-02-02493">32</xref>]. In addition, development of K65R in subtype C and CRF01_AE has been associated with the Y181C nevirapine mutation within the viral backbone [
