<p>Resistance in non- B subtypes has rarely been reported on the basis of single drugs or NRTI backbones but, rather, mutations have been reported for specific drug classes. Hence, cross-resistance can be estimated only for some NRTIs and NNRTIs but not for most PIs that are the only drugs eligible as part of second-line regimens in most regions of the world. For NFV, the potential for cross-resistance in viruses of CRF01_AE and CRF02_AG origin could be higher than has been observed in subtype B, due to the preferential selection of the N88S and L90M mutations. Data of this sort are not yet available for most PIs in the context of non-subtype B viruses. Also, NRTI backbones may also vary in the mutation profile they select for according to the drugs that are combined. Newer drugs (e.g., TDF and ATV/r) are now preferred both in resource-rich countries and non-B subtype prevalent populations. HIV resistance databases continue to enter HIV genotype data from non-B subtype variants, but so far few data sets are available (Stanford HIV resistance database, ANRS, 
 <italic>etc.</italic>) for drugs that have become first line therapy in developed countries, e.g., tenofovir, atazanavir, darunavir, etravirine and raltegravir.
