<p>One of the first examples of this was data from studies of single dose nevirapine (sdNVP) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Clinical trials demonstrated a disparity in the overall resistance among subtypes, with frequencies of 69, 36, 19 and 21% against nevirapine in women with subtype C, D, A, and CRF02_AG infections, respectively, despite the absence of pre-treatment resistance [

Ultrasensitive PCR detection procedures, which reveal minority species resistance, have revealed a higher incidence of nevirapine resistance (K103N, Y181C) in 70–87% of individuals with subtype C, compared with 42% of individuals with subtype A [
