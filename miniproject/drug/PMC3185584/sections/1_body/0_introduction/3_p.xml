<p>Diminished sensitivity to ARVs in non-B subtypes has been less well studied than in subtype B, mainly because of the predominance of subtype B in those countries in which ARVs first became available, coupled with the availability of genotypic and phenotypic antiretroviral drug resistance testing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-viruses-02-02493">8</xref>]. Yet, there is a potential for genetic differences among subtypes to yield differential patterns of resistance-conferring mutations in response to ARV pressure. This possibility is supported by the fact that HIV-1 naturally varies in genetic content by as much as 35% among subtypes. Such variation is higher in some areas of the genome (40% in the env gene) and lower in others (8–10% in the pol, gag and IN genes) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-viruses-02-02493">8</xref>]. Because differences in codon sequences at positions associated with drug resistance mutations might predispose viral isolates from different subtypes to encode different amino acid substitutions, it is possible that HIV-1 genetic diversity may influence the type of resistance mutations that might eventually emerge upon drug exposure as well as the rate of emergence of resistance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-viruses-02-02493">9</xref>]. This diversity may also affect the degree of cross-resistance to ARVs of the same class, with the potential to impact on clinical outcomes, preservation of immunological responsiveness, and virologic failure [
