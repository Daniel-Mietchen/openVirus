  <p>Principle of influenza virus inhibition by lethal mutagenesis induced by ribonucleoside analogs EIDD-2801 and T-705. In the absence of drug, random mutation frequency in the virus population is low (green). Sublethal concentrations of the inhibitor increase the frequency of random transition mutations, reducing overall fitness of the virus population (salmon). At sterilizing concentrations, the drug increases the random mutation frequency beyond a tolerable threshold, resulting in collapse of the virus population (red); MOA, mechanism of action. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)</p>
