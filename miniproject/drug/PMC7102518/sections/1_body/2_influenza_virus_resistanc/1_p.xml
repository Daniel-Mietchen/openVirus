<p id="para0004">All currently approved influenza drugs interfere with viral protein function and therefore belong to the group of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). In comparison with indirectly acting host-directed experimental antivirals, drugs of the DAA group have a lower tendency for undesirable side effects. However, rapid development of viral resistance has emerged as the predominant liability of DAAs, especially when directed against RNA viruses with error prone polymerases such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
