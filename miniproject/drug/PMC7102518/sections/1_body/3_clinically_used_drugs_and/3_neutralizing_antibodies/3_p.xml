<p id="para0013">Major concerns for the use of broadly reactive Abs against uncomplicated seasonal influenza are the target restriction to IAVs, the lack of oral bioavailability, a necessity for high-dose injections as a consequence of poor distribution from blood to the upper airways, and the high manufacturing costs of biologics. Since both IAVs and IBVs are human pathogens and clinically relevant,

 </xref> efficacy against pathogens of both genera should constitute a developmental objective of next-generation drugs. This target breadths cannot be achieved with traditional bnAbs. However, engineering of multidomain antibodies has been explored experimentally and proof-of-concept efficacy against both IAVs and IBVs has been demonstrated in mice,

Furthermore, better compliance from the large patient group of nonhospitalized adults suffering from uncomplicated disease is expected when the drug is orally bioavailable and amenable to cost-effective manufacture. bnAbs appear therefore best suited for use in high risk groups or hospitalized patients with complicated disease.
