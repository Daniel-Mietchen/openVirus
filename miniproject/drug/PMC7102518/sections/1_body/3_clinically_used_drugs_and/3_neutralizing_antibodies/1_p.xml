 </xref> antibody-based therapeutics are typically well-tolerated and show favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. The influenza virus HA head domain containing the receptor binding sites (RBCs) is highly immunogenic and thus a primary target for nAbs. However, these head-directed anti-influenza nAbs typically show a very narrow indication spectrum, hampering their clinical development. Although some nAbs directed against the more conserved RBC have been identified,
