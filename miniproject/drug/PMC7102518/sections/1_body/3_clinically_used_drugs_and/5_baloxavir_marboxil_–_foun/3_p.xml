<p id="para0017">Despite the exciting safety and efficacy performance of baloxavir marboxil, resistant viruses emerged in up to 9.7% of adult clinical trial participants and 23.4% of children.

 </xref> the signature hotspot for escape from baloxavir marboxil is PA residue 38, for which several substitutions (PA I38T/M/F) have been described. The initial characterization of PA I38 mutant viruses in cell culture suggested that resistance may carry a severe fitness penalty.

 </xref> However, subsequent follow-up analyses of the fitness of H1N1 and H3N2 strains containing PA I38 mutants in the ferret model revealed that pathogenesis and transmission success of resistant and the corresponding sensitive viruses were equivalent.

 </xref> Even though baloxavir marboxil has not yet been used extensively in the clinic and long-term field data are scarce, the available evidence indicates that the genetic barrier against resistance to the drug is low and that escape comes with little penalty to viral fitness, pathogenesis, or transmission success. Accordingly, there is considerable risk that pre-exiting resistance to baloxavir marboxil could become widespread with increasing duration of clinical use.
