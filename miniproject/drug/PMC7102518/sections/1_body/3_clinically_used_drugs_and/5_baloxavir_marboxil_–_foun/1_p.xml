 </xref> Taken orally, baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that prevents cap-snatching by blocking PA endonuclease activity when hydrolyzed to free baloxavir acid. A single dose is typically sufficient for clinical benefit, and efficacy is similar to, or better than, current standard-of-care.

 </xref> In clinical trials, participants showed significantly lower viral burden 1 day after initiation of treatment compared to placebo groups, and the time to alleviation of clinical signs was decreased on average by approximately 26 hours, which resembled the improvements that can be achieved with NAIs.

 </xref> Quite remarkably, twice daily experimental treatment of mice infected with a lethal dose of a highly pathogenic avian IAV resulted in complete survival of the animals and reduction of viral load in the respiratory tract. Similarly profound efficacy was observed in immunocompromized mice.
