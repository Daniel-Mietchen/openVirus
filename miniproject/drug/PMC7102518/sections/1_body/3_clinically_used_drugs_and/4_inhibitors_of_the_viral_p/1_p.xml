<p id="para0014">In the last decade, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex has emerged as an important target for novel small-molecule therapeutics that have progressed to advanced development and/or clinical testing. Influenza virus RdRP is comprised of 3 subunits, the PB1, PB2, and PA proteins, that are responsible for both replication and transcription of the 8 genome segments. The segments do not exist as naked RNA but are encapsidated by viral NP proteins, forming RNP complexes. Whereas replication requires the generation of complementary positive polarity RNA intermediates (cRNA) that are then copied into progeny negative polarity segments (vRNPs), viral message is directly synthesized from vRNPs. Since the influenza virus RdRP lacks enzymatic activity to form 5′ mRNA cap structures, endonuclease activity of the PA subunit is instrumental for the generation of bioactive viral mRNAs through transfer of 5′-capped RNA primers derived from host mRNAs in a cap-snatching mechanism. PB2 is involved in binding of the capped primers, whereas the PB1 subunit harbors enzymatic activity for phosphodiester bond formation.
