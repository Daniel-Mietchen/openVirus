<p id="para0002">Whereas influenza virus infection causes direct cell damage in the airway epithelium, severe tissue damage during complicated disease is largely a consequence of immunopathogenesis and peaks after the acute infection has been cleared. Influenza virus load in the upper respiratory tract is highest approximately 2–3 days after infection, which coincides with peak fever and most pronounced respiratory clinical signs. After the third day of infection, virus replication is increasingly immune controlled and virus load drops rapidly.

 </xref> Rapid disease progression and, in the case of uncomplicated disease, immune control of virus replication outline a narrow therapeutic window for influenza drugs. Ideally, treatment should be initiated within 24–36 hours of infection. In fact, clinical studies assessing the impact of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) have revealed a benefit for the patient when treatment was initiated within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms,

Several diagnostic methods are currently used in the clinic that shorten the time to treatment, recently comparatively reviewed in.
