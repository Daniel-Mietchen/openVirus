 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). To further explore the detailed mechanism of action of CQ and HCQ in inhibiting virus entry, co-localization of virions with early endosomes (EEs) or endolysosomes (ELs) was analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) and confocal microscopy. Quantification analysis showed that, at 90 min p.i. in untreated cells, 16.2% of internalized virions (anti-NP, red) were observed in early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1)-positive EEs (green), while more virions (34.3%) were transported into the late endosomal–lysosomal protein LAMP1
 <sup>+</sup> ELs (green) (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) were detected in the EEs, while only very few virions (2.4% for CQ and 0.03% for HCQ; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) were found to be co-localized with LAMP1
 <sup>+</sup> ELs (
 <italic>n</italic> &gt; 30 cells) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). This suggested that both CQ and HCQ blocked the transport of SARS-CoV-2 from EEs to ELs, which appears to be a requirement to release the viral genome as in the case of SARS-CoV
