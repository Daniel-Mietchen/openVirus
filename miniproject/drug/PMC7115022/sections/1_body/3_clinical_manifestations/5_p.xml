<p>RSV-related pneumonia is now believed to complicate about 30â€“40% of RSV infections in patients with HM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32_21">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34_21">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47_21">47</xref>]. Again, mortality remains high, ranging from 15% to 30%. URTI is a common clinical manifestation. No clear data on the incidence of concomitant bacterial or fungal infections are available in the literature, and RSV-related pneumonia in patients with HM are often ascribed to viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53_21">53</xref>]. However, bacterial co-infections were present in as many as 30% of patients in a large study of RSV infections in immunocompetent individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55_21">55</xref>]. Bacterial or fungal co-infection may be more common in patients with HM and must be carefully sought. Non-sustained viraemia may accompany RSV infection, and RSV was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and neurological disorders in two case reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8_21">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56_21">56</xref>]. However, no extra-respiratory manifestations of RSV infection have been described in immunocompromised patients.
