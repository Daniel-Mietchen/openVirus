<p>More recently, studies of large patient cohorts led to better characterization of influenza-related pneumonia in patients with HM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29_21">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32_21">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34_21">34</xref>]. About one-third of patients develop lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Although less common than in previous reports, influenza-related pneumonia remains a severe condition with a 15–30% mortality rate. As in immunocompetent hosts, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is almost always present and often precedes LRTI [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49_21">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51_21">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52_21">52</xref>]. URTI can be considered a useful argument supporting the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection in patients with HM investigated for pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53_21">53</xref>]. However, the identification of a common respiratory virus does not exclude an associated bacterial or fungal infection. These co-infections are very frequent, occurring in 12–25% of cases of influenza-related pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32_21">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34_21">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50_21">50</xref>]. There are no reports of extra-respiratory manifestations in patients with HM, although myocarditis, pericarditis, myositis, meningo-encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Reye syndrome have been described in immunocompetent patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6_21">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54_21">54</xref>].
