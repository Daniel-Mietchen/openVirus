<p>A distinctive feature of adenoviruses in HM patients is that they may either be acquired via exogenous respiratory or oro-faecal contamination, or arise via reactivation of latent viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39_21">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86_21">86</xref>]. Adenoviruses cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from benign conjunctivitis to rapidly fatal disseminated disease. In patients with HM, the risk of severe adenoviral disease seems related to the level of immunosuppression. Adenoviral disease has been reported in 3–27% of HSCT recipients within the first 100 days after transplantation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87_21">87</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89_21">89</xref>]. Higher rates may occur in paediatric patients compared with adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88_21">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90_21">90</xref>]. In vivo and ex vivo graft T-cell depletion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87_21">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91_21">91</xref>], lymphocytopenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86_21">86</xref>], GVHD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87_21">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89_21">89</xref>], viral shedding from more than one site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86_21">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88_21">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90_21">90</xref>], and adenovirus viraemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86_21">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92_21">92</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94_21">94</xref>] have been reported as risk factors for severe adenoviral disease. Adenovirus viraemia consistently preceded viral shedding from more than one site in the study by Chakrabarti et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86_21">86</xref>]. This risk factor is of critical importance since it guides pre-emptive antiviral therapy. Adenoviral disease has been chiefly reported in myeloablative HSCT recipients, but has also been described in non-myeloablative HSCT recipients, autologous transplant recipients, and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with fludarabine combined with CD52 monoclonal antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88_21">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89_21">89</xref>]. In allogeneic transplant recipients, the most frequent manifestations of adenoviral infection are gastrointestinal disease and haemorrhagic cystitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95_21">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96_21">96</xref>]. Although haemorrhagic cystitis is a benign localised event, it is associated with high morbidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90_21">90</xref>]. It must be pointed out that in a patient with febrile haematuria and adenovirus urinary excretion, the onset of acute renal failure with flank pain may reveal adenovirus nephritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97_21">97</xref>]. Gastrointestinal manifestations include gastroenteritis and colitis, which often manifest as febrile haemorrhagic diarrhoea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95_21">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98_21">98</xref>]. The most severe manifestations of adenoviral infection are hepatitis, encephalitis, and pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86_21">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89_21">89</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90_21">90</xref>]. Adenovirus-related pneumonia occurred in 15 of the 85 patients with adenovirus infection in the study by La Rosa et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89_21">89</xref>]. The pneumonia was isolated in 11 patients and a manifestation of disseminated disease in 4 patients. Bacterial and fungal co-infections were found in 50% of patients, in keeping with other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90_21">90</xref>]. The mortality rate was 73% overall, 50% in patients with isolated pneumonia, and 80% in patients with disseminated disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89_21">89</xref>].
