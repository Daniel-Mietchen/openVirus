<p>Common respiratory viral infections in patients with HM are characterized by prolonged viral shedding. A median duration of 2 weeks was found in most studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30_21">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32_21">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33_21">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36_21">36</xref>]. However, viral shedding may last for months in some cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41_21">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42_21">42</xref>]. In addition, the amount of virus shed per day may be greater in HM patients than in immunocompetent individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43_21">43</xref>]. Similarly to findings in immunocompromised patients, children shed more viruses over a longer period than do adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31_21">31</xref>]. This prolonged high-load viral shedding is of critical importance, since it may enhance both viral dissemination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43_21">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44_21">44</xref>] and the emergence of resistant strains via prolonged exposure to antiviral drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41_21">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42_21">42</xref>].
