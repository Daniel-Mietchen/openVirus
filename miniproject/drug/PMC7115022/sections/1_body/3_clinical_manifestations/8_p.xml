<p>Since the identification of Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae relies chiefly on molecular biology tools, only limited data are available about their contribution to respiratory viral infections in patients with HM. Epidemiological evidence supports an association of human rhinovirus with LRTI in immunocompetent children and elderly people [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68_21">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69_21">69</xref>]. Despite growing evidence that human rhinovirus is able to replicate in lower respiratory tract cells in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70_21">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71_21">71</xref>], whether this virus can cause pneumonia remains debated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72_21">72</xref>]. Several reports in patients with HM link human rhinovirus to LRTI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73_21">73</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77_21">77</xref>]. However, these retrospective studies in small patient populations with high rates of pulmonary co-pathogen identification fail to demonstrate a clear role for human rhinovirus in the development of pneumonia. Non-poliomyelitic enteroviruses are chiefly responsible for URTI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16_21">16</xref>]. Only a few studies with small numbers of patients have focused on these viruses in patients with HM, and no conclusions can be drawn from their results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77_21">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80_21">80</xref>]. Coronaviridae are also principally responsible for URTI but may occasionally cause pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81_21">81</xref>]. No studies have evaluated the role of Coronaviridae in patients with HM, and only two case reports have been published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82_21">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83_21">83</xref>].
