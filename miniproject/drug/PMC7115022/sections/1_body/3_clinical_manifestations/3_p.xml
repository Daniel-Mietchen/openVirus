<p>As stated above, common respiratory viruses have long been underrecognised in patients with HM. In the 1990s, the first reports of common respiratory virus infections focused on influenza and RSV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50_21">50</xref>]. In these studies, progression to pneumonia occurred in about 75% of patients infected with influenza viruses and 50% of those infected with RSV, and was associated with mortality rates of 25% for influenza and about 80% for RSV. One possible explanation for these striking observations may be a surge of interest in respiratory viral infections in HM patients that led to the publication of the most severe cases. Not surprisingly, these studies had small numbers of patients and high rates of nosocomial infections.
