<p>Common respiratory viruses increase mortality in patients with HM mainly by causing severe pneumonia, but they may also contribute to a long-term decline in pulmonary function. RSV, PIV, and influenza infections have been linked to late airflow obstruction in HSCT recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40_21">40</xref>]. In a study focusing specifically on the role of respiratory viruses in late airflow obstruction, PIV LRTI was the strongest risk factor, followed by PIV URTI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84_21">84</xref>]. Pneumonia caused by RSV was a borderline-significant risk factor. The exact causative mechanisms remain unknown, but inflammation resulting from prolonged viral persistence and pneumonia-induced post-acute-phase inflammation have been suggested as possible factors [
