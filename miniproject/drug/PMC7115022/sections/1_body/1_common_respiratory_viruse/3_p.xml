<p>RSV and PIV types 1–4 are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. RSV belongs to the 
 <italic>Paramyxovirus</italic> genus, and PIV 1–4 to the 
 <italic>Pneumovirus</italic> genus, of the Paramyxoviridae family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7_21">7</xref>]. Their envelopes support two major antigenic surface proteins, one for binding and one for fusion to the cell membrane. Attachment to host cell receptors is mediated by the G protein of RSV and by a haemagglutinin neuraminidase for PIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7_21">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8_21">8</xref>]. The fusion protein F is common to both genera and allows the virus to penetrate within the host cells after binding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8_21">8</xref>]. Antigenic variations in the G protein determine two major RSV groups, A and B. Antigenic variations also occur in PIV but have less immunological impact [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7_21">7</xref>]. The natural hosts of RSV are humans and chimpanzees, whereas PIV infects only humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9_21">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10_21">10</xref>]. Human MPV is a recently discovered virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11_21">11</xref>]. The human MPV genome and structure are very similar to those of RSV, and both viruses display the same surface proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12_21">12</xref>]. Available data indicate that human MPV infects only humans, although this virus is believed to originate from birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13_21">13</xref>].
