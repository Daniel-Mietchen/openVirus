<p>Common respiratory viruses are ubiquitous pathogens that share a number of epidemiological features. Most of them are responsible for outbreaks that occur with a remarkable seasonal pattern. These seasonal variations in viral activity occur only in temperate climates and tend to disappear in equatorial zones. This phenomenon is incompletely understood and may involve not only specific viral characteristics, but also seasonal changes in living conditions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14_21">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16_21">16</xref>]. Little is known about the epidemiology of PIV4, since this virus is responsible for mild infections and is therefore rarely identified [
