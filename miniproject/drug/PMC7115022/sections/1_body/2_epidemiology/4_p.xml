<p>Adenovirus epidemiology in patients with HM deserves special attention. Similar to other common respiratory viruses, adenoviruses cause primary infections in childhood, usually during the first few years of life. Adenoviruses may account for 5% to 10% of viral respiratory infections in children [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37_21">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38_21">38</xref>]. A distinctive feature of adenoviruses is the ability to cause chronic latent infection by persisting in lymphoepithelial tissues, most notably in the nasopharynx [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23_21">23</xref>]. The epidemiology of adenoviruses in patients with HM has not been the focus of specific studies. Nevertheless, exogenous contamination, by the respiratory or oro-faecal route, may be less important than reactivation of the latent virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39_21">39</xref>]. Thus, adenoviral infections in patients with HM may be related chiefly to the level of immunosuppression and, perhaps, to unknown viral factors driving reactivation, rather than to the level of viral activity in the community.
