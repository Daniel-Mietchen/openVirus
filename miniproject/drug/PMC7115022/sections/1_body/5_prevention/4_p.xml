<p>Another way to prevent morbidity and mortality related to common respiratory viruses in patients with HM is to limit the risk of progression to pneumonia. The pre-emptive treatment of viral URTI has been discussed above. Given the severity of common respiratory virus pneumonia in patients with HM, it appears logical and prudent to postpone HSCT in patients with documented viral infections. A retrospective cohort study suggested that this measure might prevent RSV-related pneumonia in patients undergoing HSCT [
