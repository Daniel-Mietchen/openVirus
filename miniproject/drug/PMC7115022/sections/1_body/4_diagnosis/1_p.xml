<p>Respiratory viral infections are the second most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99_21">99</xref>]. They were long considered a simple differential diagnosis, without practical consequences for the patient. Recently, however, the diagnosis of viral respiratory infection has become increasingly relevant for medical care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100_21">100</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101_21">101</xref>]. First, RSV, influenza, PIV, and adenoviruses have been identified as significant causes of community-acquired and nosocomial respiratory infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29_21">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102_21">102</xref>]. Second, new nucleic acid-based assays have been shown to be more sensitive than conventional techniques. Third, specific antiviral drugs are now available for some respiratory viruses, including influenza and adenovirus. Several diagnostic tests have been introduced for the detection of respiratory viruses. The main characteristics of the most widely used assays are shown in Table
