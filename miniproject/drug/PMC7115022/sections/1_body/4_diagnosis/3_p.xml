<p>Over the past 2 decades, virus isolation and antigen detection have been the mainstay of clinical laboratory testing for respiratory virus infections. Virus isolation required several cell lines and was mainly performed on shell vial cultures. The diagnosis was based on the presence of the cytopathic effect, which requires several days or weeks to develop. To shorten the time to diagnosis, specific monoclonal antibodies were introduced to enable the detection of specific viral antigens within 1â€“2 days. Direct or indirect fluorescent antibody staining of cells from respiratory specimens (mainly nasopharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates [NPA] and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) is commonly used to detect viral antigens. In many laboratories, the first-line test is immunofluorescence staining, which requires very little material and provides a result within about 3 h. However commercial monoclonal antibodies are available for a limited number of targets, including influenza A and B; RSV; adenovirus; PIV 1, 2 and 3; and human MPV. Thus, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, the most frequent causes of URTI and the most recently discovered agents, cannot be detected using monoclonal antibodies.</p>
