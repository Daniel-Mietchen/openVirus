<p>Common respiratory viruses are now recognised as true opportunistic respiratory pathogens in patients with HM. In these patients, they constitute a common cause of potentially severe pneumonia. However, areas of uncertainty remain, indicating a need for further investigations. The epidemiology of common respiratory virus infections in patients with HM has not been extensively studied. Large epidemiological studies of common respiratory virus infections in patients with HM based on molecular biology tools may lead to radical changes in knowledge. Although it is now clear that common respiratory viruses are responsible for increased pneumonia rates in patients with HM, the exact nature and causative mechanisms of these pneumonia cases remain unknown. Studies are warranted to investigate the role of viruses in the development of these LRTIs. The virus might directly injure alveolar epithelium or promote lung super-infection by causing bronchial epithelium damage. These studies would also help to determine the potential benefit of pre-emptive or curative antiviral therapy. Finally, randomised controlled studies of antiviral therapy in patients with HM are urgently needed.</p>
