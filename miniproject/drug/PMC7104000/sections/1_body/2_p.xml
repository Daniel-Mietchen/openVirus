<p id="para30">The current COVID-19 emergency warrants the urgent development of potential strategies to protect people at high risk of infection—particularly close contacts and health-care workers, among others—even if more robust data on antiviral therapies is yet to come. A key reason for such an approach is the high estimates for the secondary attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 in households (∼15%) and among close contacts (∼10%).

 </xref> Pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with antimicrobial drugs are effective in preventing illness before potential exposure or after documented exposure to a variety of microbial pathogens, and in reducing the risk of secondary spread of infection. Based on experiences with PEP for other infections, we recommend starting PEP as soon as possible after a recent possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For example, PEP with rifampicin is given to people exposed to index cases of invasive meningococcal infection, and oseltamivir has been recommended by WHO for people at high risk of infection before or after exposure to pandemic influenza.
