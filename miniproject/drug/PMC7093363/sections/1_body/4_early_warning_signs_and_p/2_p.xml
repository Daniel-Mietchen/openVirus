<p id="Par9">At present, complete genomes of different 2019-nCoV have been released, and the latest published information on these genomes provides peer-reviewed information that is urgently needed to improve the risk assessment and response, which occurs in real time (Chen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020b</xref>; Riou and Althaus, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). The possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus is still under investigation. Understanding the transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and for determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. The situation is severe and it is urgent for us to need a better understanding towards this virus for further prevention and control. In order to better understand the early transmission pattern of 2019-nCoV, Julien et al. conducted a randomized simulation study of the early outbreak trajectories consistent with the epidemiological findings to date (Riou and Althaus, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). They suggested that a rapid establishment of sustained transmission chains from single cases cannot be ruled out, and at this stage, particularly attention should be given to the prevention of superspreading events. Chen et al. reported a mathematical model for simulating the transmission of the novel Wuhan Coronavirus, which is a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source to the humans (Chen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020a</xref>). In another study, a data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak was conducted by Zhao et al. and a preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV was made. They estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV via the basic reproduction number based on only the data from the early stages of the outbreak (Zhao et al.,
