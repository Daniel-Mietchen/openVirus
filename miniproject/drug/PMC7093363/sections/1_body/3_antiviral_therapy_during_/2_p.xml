<p id="Par7">Based on previous anti-SARS studies and computer simulations, older drugs, like cinnamon thiamine and cyclosporin A (CsA), could be effective against 2019-nCoV. The immunosuppressive drug CsA prevents the nucleocapsid protein of the virus from binding to cyclophilin A (CypA) of the host cell, which has a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, and a combination of interferon and CsA has been shown previously to significantly inhibit the replication and tissue damage caused by coronavirus infection in bronchi and lungs of humans. Pfefferle et al. detected specific interactions between CypA and SARS-nCoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) by yeast-two-hybrid and other protein-protein interaction techniques. They also tested the drug CsA against a variety of coronaviruses and identified it to be a “pan-coronavirus inhibitor” (Haagmans et al.,

Since then, many inhibitors have been designed and synthesized to act against coronavirus, but few have experienced systematic toxicity in pre-clinical studies, and these compounds have not yet been used in clinical trials to prevent the recurrence of SARS-CoV or 2019-nCoV. This is one of the main difficulties in drug development.
