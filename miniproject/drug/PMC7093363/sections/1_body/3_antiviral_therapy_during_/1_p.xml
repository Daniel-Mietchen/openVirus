<p id="Par6">In the early stages of an outbreak, most people do not have a reliable understanding of the susceptibility of the virus to antiviral drugs. Looking back on the medications used to fight SARS-CoV, initially ribavirin was recognized as a widely active antiviral drug that was effective against a range of RNA viruses but was of little use to SARS patients. The in vitro activities of ribavirin on the replication of SARS-CoV are highly variable, depending on the type of cells used for assays. Many SARS patients were treated with a combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids, given such poor prognosis linked to drug side effects (Cinatl et al.,

In addition, there are reports that interferon beta (IFN-β) is significantly better than IFN-α and also that polyethylene glycol-modified IFN-α prevented SARS-CoV infection, reduced viral replication, and reduced histopathology during treatment (Cinatl et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>). To identify potential drugs for 2019-nCoV, the viral protease (Mpro) was modeled by Prof. Zihe Rao’s group at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. They selected a series of potential drugs which exist in the market or the self-built database’s high-cost medicinal compounds and medicinal plant sources database compounds. Thirty drug candidates, consisting of biologically active natural products and traditional Chinese medicine drugs, that have the potential to show therapeutic effects against 2019-nCoV, were chosen for testing for the clinical treatment of pneumonia in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.
