<p>The IBD Research Group of the KASID decided to produce a evidence-based guideline on the prevention and management of viral hepatitis in patients with IBD in April 2018. To establish the guidelines, a committee consisting of 10 gastroenterologists who were members of the KASID, 2 hepatologists and 1 professor of preventive medicine who acted as a methodologist was formed to develop the guidelines. The committee held 10 meetings, with all members in attendance, until the guidelines were completed, with the first meeting taking place on April 2, 2018. The guidelines addressed prevention and management of viral hepatitis in patients with IBD. We focused on prevention and monitoring, and treatment of viral hepatitis are not included in this guideline. The guidelines were generally made by adapting foreign and Korean guidelines on the prevention and management of viral hepatitis in IBD. However, in the case of 3 key questions, no precise recommendations were included in the guidelines, thus new statements were produced by consensus of the professional group.</p>
