<p>In patients with IBD, we recommend HAV testing (IgG antiHAV antibody) in patients with no history of HAV vaccination or HAV-related hepatitis, as well as in those whose history of HAV vaccination is uncertain. In patients with IBD who are negative for IgG anti-HAV antibody, vaccination is recommended.</p>
