<p>Anti-TNF treatments, such as infliximab and adalimumab, confer a high risk of HBV reactivation—up to 40% in patients who are HBsAg-positive [

 <xref rid="b101-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Furthermore, this risk is higher when using infliximab than when using etanercept, which is correlated with potency. TNF-α may regulate the adaptive immune response to HBV infection, and recent evidence has demonstrated that TNF-α and related cytokines may play a crucial role in regulating covalently closed circular DNA and HBV replication [

Anti-integrins, such as natalizumab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, have been associated with a moderate risk of HBV reactivation in patients who are HBsAg-positive [

 <xref rid="b104-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], perhaps because the liver is an immune organ with an active influx and efflux of immune cells [
 <xref rid="b105-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], so these agents may reduce local immune control of HBV replication in the liver.
