<p>HBV reactivation is defined as active inflammation occurring after inactivity in chronic hepatitis B or after resolution of a past HBV infection. HBV reactivation is classified as follows: (1) exacerbation of chronic HBV infection in patients who are HBsAg-positive, or (2) relapse of past HBV infection in patients who are HBsAg-negative plus anti-HBc-positive [
