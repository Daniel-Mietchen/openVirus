<p>In patients who are HBsAg-negative plus anti-HBc-positive, antiviral prophylaxis should be considered on a case-by-case basis, considering comorbidities, prevalence of anti-HBc positivity, and health care resources [

 <xref rid="b6-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The crucial virological event in patients who are antiHBc-positive is HBsAg reappearance (seroreversion), which is closely associated with hepatitis flare [

Therefore, pre-emptive therapy is based upon monitoring of HBsAg, HBV DNA, and ALT during and after immunosuppression in patients who are HBsAg-negative plus anti-HBc-positive, and antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in cases of HBsAg seroreversion and/or detectable HBV DNA, regardless of serum ALT [
