<p>Patients who are HBsAg-negative plus anti-HBc-positive are at lower risk of HBV reactivation than those who are HBsAgpositive. However, HBV reactivation can also occur in these patients [
 <xref rid="b118-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], and HBsAg seroreversion is constantly associated with hepatitis flare-ups, even though HBV DNA detection leads to seroreversion and hepatitis in only 50% of cases [
 <xref rid="b106-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. These patients should be monitored every 2 to 3 months for increased ALT, HBsAg and changes in HBV DNA, both during and after immunosuppressive therapy. Antiviral treatment should be started in cases of detectable HBV DNA or HBsAg seroreversion [
