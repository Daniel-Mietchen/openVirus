<p>Although primary hepatitis B vaccination series is completed and HBV seroprotection is achieved, it is highly likely that patients with IBD, especially those on immunosuppressive therapy, experience loss of seroprotection (anti-HBs level below 10 IU/L) during follow-up. In fact, seroprotection falls by 18% per patient-year in this regard [

Therefore, serum antiHBs titers should be monitored in patients with IBD who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, even if HBV seroprotection is achieved after complete vaccination. Based on expert opinion, anti-HBs should be monitored every 12â€“24 months, especially in the intermediate- and high-prevalence countries [
