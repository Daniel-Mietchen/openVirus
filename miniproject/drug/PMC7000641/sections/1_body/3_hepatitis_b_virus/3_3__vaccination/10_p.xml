<p>An additional cycle (0, 1, and 6 months) of revaccination is recommended if seroprotection is not achieved. There is some debate about what titer level represents adequate protection against hepatitis B, with some groups recommending titers of anti-HBs above 10 IU/L, and others recommending titers above 100 IU/L [

According to recently published clinical practice guidelines for hepatitis B in Korea, the level of protective titer of anti-HBs is defined as above 10 IU/L, and if the anti-HBs level is below 10 IU/L in immunosuppressed patients, additional vaccinations are recommended [

Considering the costeffectiveness in nonresponders to HBV vaccination, vaccination can be discontinued if anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL after one month of additional first dose (4th) of administration, however, additional second and third doses (5th and 6th) are administered if anti-HBs &lt; 10 mIU/mL. Then HBV serology testing should be performed 1 to 2 months after completion of vaccinations [
