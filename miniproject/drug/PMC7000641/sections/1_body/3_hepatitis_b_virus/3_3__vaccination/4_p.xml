<p>HBV vaccines should be administered before starting immunosuppression if feasible, and the inactive vaccine is recommended at least 2 weeks before. As the immune response to vaccination is generally decreased by immunosuppression, patients with IBD should be administered HBV vaccine soon after diagnosis, immunosuppressive therapy is commenced, where possible, especially because the disease follows an unpredictable course and necessitates immunosuppressive therapy [

According to a meta-analysis based on a random-effects model, the pooled rate of a response to HBV vaccination among patients with IBD was 61% (95% CI, 53%–69%) and no immunosuppressive therapy was predictive of an immune response compared to immunomodulatory (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.08–1.63) or anti-TNF-α (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.19–2.08) therapy [
