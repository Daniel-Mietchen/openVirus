<p>Host factors involve modulation of antioxidant and free radical activity, inhibition of inflammatory effector cells and mediators (such as TNF-α and ß-galactosidase), inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase production, and enhancing healing signals via activation of T cells and macrophages.
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Globally, PVI characteristics that make it ideal for clinical use include broad antimicrobial spectrum, lack of resistance, ability to penetrate biofilms, low cytotoxicity, suitable tolerability, and overall favorable risk/benefit profile.
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Such versatility, ease of access, and ubiquitous use in antisepsis have been further promoted by biochemical characteristics of the compound. The combination of a synthetic carrier homopolymer (2-pyrrolidnone, 1-ethenyl-), which has no innate germicidal ability, and iodine forms PVI.
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In aqueous form, free iodine is released into solution from the PVI complex, which is what provides the microbicidal activity.
