<p>In animal models, CDV was administered utilizing topical and intrastromal inoculation three times per day for 20 consecutive days; the results displayed significant effectivity against HAdV type 5 when compared to the placebo group, reducing both viral shedding and the severity of sub-epithelial infiltrates. This study showed great promise in the future of cidofovir for the treatment of ocular HAdV infections in the future.

 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Due to the positive results in the aforementioned studies, CDV was tested as a prophylactic measure due to the epidemic nature of HAdV. Romanowski et al determined that antiviral prophylaxis with 1% and 0.5% concentrations of CDV significantly reduced viral replication of HAdV type 5 in animal models, giving promise to the use of CDV in prophylaxis.
