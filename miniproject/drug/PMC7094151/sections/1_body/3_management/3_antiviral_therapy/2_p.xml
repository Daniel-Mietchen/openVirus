<p>Ganciclovir (GCV), a synthetic nucleoside analog of 2ʹ-deoxyguanosine, has been proven effective in the inhibition of the herpes family of viruses, specifically herpes simplex types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr. In a series of experiments utilizing Syrian, immunocompromised hamsters infected with HAdV 5, GCV was able to suppress viral replication in the liver, a method that may involve the direct inhibition of DNA polymerase. It was proposed that GCV inhibited the advancement of viral infection into the late phase. Systemically, GCV was able to mitigate the effects of HAdV infection in these hamsters, decreasing the rate of mortality. This led to the investigation of GCV in the treatment of ocular infections of HAdV.

 <sup>®</sup>; Farmila-Thea, Milan, Italy) has been the standard of care for the treatment of acute ocular herpetic keratitis, yet it has not been standardized in the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, particularly since studies in human subjects are lacking.
