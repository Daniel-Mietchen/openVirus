<p>Antiviral activity against systemic HAdV infections has been thoroughly studied and paved the way for its more focused evaluation for the treatment of the ocular manifestations of this virus. Besides the aforementioned forms of keratoconjunctivitis, HAdV may also cause upper and lower respiratory tract disease, hemorrhagic cystitis, and gastroenteritis due to its propensity to infect mucosal epithelium.

Additionally, in immunocompromised patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation, disseminated infections can be life-threatening, particularly in the pediatric population.

Possible therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated through the use of antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir, ribavirin, and cidofovir.
