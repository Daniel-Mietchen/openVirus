<p>Dissemination of HAdV is also a significant health burden particularly in individuals with factors that put them at great risk of morbidity and mortality from adenoviral infection. These individuals include children, elderly, immunocompromised individual, patients with acute Graft versus Host disease, those on immunosuppressants, and so on. Because there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat HAdV infection, eye care providers use multiple pharmaceuticals off-label to manage HAdV ocular infection. Finally, the propensity for latent HAdV to become reactivated and easily transmissible warrants the need for additional research in developing an effective, prophylactic antiviral drug. New treatments under consideration include sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), N-chlorotaurine, and even benzalkonium chloride (BAK). Sialic acid plays a role in initial attachment of fiber knobs in adenoviral virions while facilitating accumulation.
