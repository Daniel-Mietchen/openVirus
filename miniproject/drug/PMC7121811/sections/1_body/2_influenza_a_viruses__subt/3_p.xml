<p id="Par30">As the primary mechanism of influenza virus inhibition by AuNPs with different anionic groups blocking of viral attachment to cell surface was suggested, although viral fusion inhibition could not be excluded (Sametband et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2011</xref>). Li et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2016</xref>) proposed a new modality to inhibit viral infection by fabricating DNA-conjugated AuNPs networks on cell membranes as a protective barrier, antiviral activity of which may be attributed to steric effects, the disruption of membrane glycoproteins, and limited fusion of cell membrane bilayers. In addition, these DNA-AuNPs beside inhibition of virus attachment and entry could also inhibit viral budding and cell-to-cell spread. Multivalent sialic acid-functionalized AuNPs of 14 nm inhibited influenza virus infection. As the binding of the viral fusion protein HA to the host cell surface is mediated by sialic acid receptors, a multivalent interaction with sialic acid-functionalized AuNPs is expected to competitively inhibit viral infection (Papp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2010</xref>). Intranasal immunizations with a mixture of conjugated recombinant trimetric influenza A/Aichi/2/68(H3N2) HA onto functionalized AuNPs surfaces in a repetitive, oriented configuration and AuNPs coupled with Toll-like receptor 5 agonist flagellin as particulate adjuvants resulted in improved mucosal B cell responses (increasing influenza-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG l in nasal, tracheal, and lung washes), stimulation of antigen-specific interferon-Î³-secreting CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell proliferation and induced strong effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell activation suggesting powerful mucosal and systemic immune responses protecting hosts against lethal influenza challenges (Wang et al.
