<p id="Par35">Hybrid inorganic-organic microcapsules obtained by encapsulating siRNA via the combination of layer-by-layer technique and in situ modification by sol-gel chemistry were characterized with high cell uptake efficiency, low toxicity, efficient intracellular delivery of siRNAs and the protection of siRNAs from premature degradation before reaching the target cells, reduced viral nucleoprotein level, and inhibited influenza A virus (H1N1) production in infected MDCK and A549 cells (Timin et al.

CS NPs loaded by siRNA that were efficiently up-taken by Vero cells resulting in the inhibition of influenza virus (strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1)) replication in vitro showed antiviral effects at nasal administration and considerably protected BALB/c mice from a lethal influenza challenge, suggesting that this nanoformulation is a promising system for controlling influenza virus infection (Jamali et al.
