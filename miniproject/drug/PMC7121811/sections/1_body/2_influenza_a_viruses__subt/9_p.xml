<p id="Par36">Figueira et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2018</xref>) modified the influenza fusion inhibitors by adding a cell-penetrating peptide self-assembling into 15â€“30 nm NPs and targeting relevant tissues infected with influenza virus A in vivo, causing reduction of viral infectivity upon interaction with the cell membrane, and it was shown that for efficacious biodistribution, fusion inhibition, and efficacy in vivo both the cell-penetrating peptide and the lipid moiety are necessary.
