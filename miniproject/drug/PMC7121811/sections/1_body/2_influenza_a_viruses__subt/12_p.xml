<p id="Par39">Lauster et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2017</xref>) designed multivalent peptide-polymer NPs consisting of covalent conjugates of peptidic ligands and a biocompatible polyglycerol-based hydrophilic dendritic scaffold showing binding with nanomolar affinity to the influenza A virus via its spike protein hemagglutinin. A novel seasonal recombinant HA NP influenza vaccine (NIV) formulated with a saponin-based adjuvant, Matrix-Mâ„¢, induced HA inhibition (HAI) and microneutralizing antibodies against a broad range of influenza A (H3N2) subtypes. HAI-positive and HAI-negative neutralizing monoclonal antibodies derived from mice immunized with NIV were active against homologous and drifted influenza A (H3N2) strains (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2017</xref>). Layered protein NPs composed of structure-stabilized HA stalk domains from both HA groups, and constructed M2e, were reported to have potential to be developed into a universal influenza vaccine that could induce broad cross protection against divergent viruses (Deng et al.
