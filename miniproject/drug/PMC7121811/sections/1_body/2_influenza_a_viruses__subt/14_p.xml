<p id="Par41">Double-layered peptide NPs prepared by desolvating a composite peptide of tandem copies of nucleoprotein epitopes into NPs as cores and cross-linking another composite peptide of four tandem copies of influenza matrix protein 2 ectodomain epitopes to the core surfaces as a coating that were delivered via dissolvable microneedle patch-based skin vaccination, induced robust specific immunity and protected mice against heterosubtypic influenza A virus challenges and demonstrated a strong antigen depot effect resulting in the stronger immune responses, whereby CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were involved in the protection (Deng et al.
