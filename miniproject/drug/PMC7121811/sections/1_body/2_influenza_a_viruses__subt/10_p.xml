<p id="Par37">The amino acid sequence of influenza matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) is highly conserved among human seasonal influenza A viruses (Deng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2018a</xref>). Multivalent oleanolic acid protein conjugates as nonglycosylated neomucin mimics for the capture and entry inhibition of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2) designed by Yang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">2018</xref>) were found to be comparable to natural glycosylated mucin, suggesting that this material could potentially be used as anti-infective barriers to prevent virus from invading host cells. Bernasconi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>) developed a fusion protein with three copies of the ectodomain of matrix protein 2, which is one of the most explored conserved influenza A virus antigens for a broadly protective vaccine and incorporated it into porous maltodextrin NPs to enhance its protective ability and the formulation resulted in broadly protective immunity against a lethal infection with heterosubtypic influenza virus, immune protection being mediated by enhanced levels of lung-resident CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells as well as anti-HA and anti-M2e serum IgG and local IgA antibodies.
