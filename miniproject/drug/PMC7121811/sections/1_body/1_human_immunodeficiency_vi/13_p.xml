<p id="Par22">A cell surface chemokine receptor CXCR4 targeting peptide 4DV3 acting as an HIV entry inhibitor and a ligand for targeted drug delivery was described by Lee et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2019</xref>). The use of 4DV3 as the targeting ligand resulted in enhanced endocytosis due to the uptake of 4DV3 functionalized nanocarriers combined with the allosteric interaction with CXCR4, suggesting that 4DV3 peptide could be considered as a dual function ligand.
