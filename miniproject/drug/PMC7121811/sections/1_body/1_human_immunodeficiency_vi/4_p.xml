<p id="Par13">Nowacek et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2011</xref>) performed analyses of nanoformulated ARV drugs and found that physical characteristics such as particle size, surfactant coating, surface charge, and most importantly shape are predictors of cell uptake and ARV efficacy. The progress in the development of NP-based drug delivery systems for HIV therapy which focused mainly on injectable nanocarriers enabling delivery of drug combinations that are long-lasting and target-selective in physiological contexts (in vivo) to provide safe and effective use was summarized by Gao et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2018</xref>). For example, tenofovir (TFV) alafenamide and elvitegravir (EVG) loaded NPs subcutaneously administered to female humanized CD34
 <sup>+</sup>-NSG mice showed long residence time and exposure for both drugs. The AUC
 <sub>(0–14 day)</sub> estimated for TFV and EVG using NPs was 23.1 ± 4.4 and 39.7 ± 6.7 μg h/mL, while with application of drug solutions the observed AUC
 <sub>(0–72 h)</sub> reached 14.1 ± 2.0 and 7.2 ± 1.8 μg h/mL, respectively. Similarly, application of NPs resulted in strong increase of elimination half-life (t
 <sub>1/2</sub>) that was 5.1 and 3.3 days for TFV and EVG, respectively, while the corresponding t
 <sub>1/2</sub> values for free drugs were 14.2 and 10.8 h (Prathipati et al.
