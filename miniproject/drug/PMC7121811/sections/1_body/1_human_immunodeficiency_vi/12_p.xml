<p id="Par21">EFV-loaded solid lipid NPs (SLNPs) with mean particle size of 108.5Â nm, polydispersity index of 0.172, and 64.9% EE administered intranasally in vivo revealed increased concentration of the drug in brain as desired suggesting their potential to be used for eradication of HIV and cure of HIV-infected patients (Gupta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2017</xref>). Endsley and Ho (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2012</xref>) constructed CD4-targeted SLNPs providing selective binding and efficient delivery of indinavir to CD4
 <sup>+</sup>-HIV host cells (whereby inclusion of PEG in SLNPs minimized immune recognition of peptides) that showed enhancement of anti-HIV effects even under limited time exposure. Nanoscaled NRTIs decorated with the peptide-binding brain-specific apolipoprotein E receptor demonstrated low neurotoxicity and high antiviral activity against HIV infection in the brain (Gerson et al.
