<p id="Par14">Jiang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>) incorporated ARV drugs maraviroc, etravirine, and raltegravir into poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) NPs and found that ARV NPs maintained potent HIV inhibition and were more effective, when used in combinations. Significantly higher antiviral potency and dose-dependent reduction against both cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 BaL infection in vitro was estimated mainly for ARV NPs combinations involving etravirine NPs, whereby the combinations that showed large dose-reduction were identified to be synergistic. Moreover, ARV NPs combinations inhibited propagation of reverse transcriptase in simian-human immunodeficiency viruses in macaque cervicovaginal tissue and blocked virus transmission by migratory cells emigrating from the tissue. PGLA NPs were also used as a biodegradable carrier for loading with TFV in combination with efavirenz or saquinavir, which resulted in pronounced combination drug effects, and emphasized the potential of NPs for the realization of unique drug-drug activities (Chaowanachan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>). TFV and EVG-loaded PLGA NPs tested using humanized BLT mouse model were reported to be suitable for long-acting prevention of HIV-1 vaginal transmission (Mandal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2017a</xref>). In an in vitro HIV-1 inhibition study, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value observed with emtricitabine-loaded PLGA NPs (size of &lt;200 nm and surface charge −23 mV) was found to be 43-fold lower in TZM-bl cells (0.00043 μg/mL) and approx. fourfold lower (0.009 μg/mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with drug solution (0.01861 and 0.033 μg/mL, respectively) and showed comparable activity with emtricitabine solution. Based on prolonged intracellular drug concentration and inhibition of HIV infection, the researchers noted that this long-acting, stable formulation could ensure once-biweekly dosing to prevent or treat HIV infection (Mandal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2017b</xref>). PLGA-EVG NPs (~47 nm; zeta potential of approx. 6.74 mV) showed time- and concentration-dependent uptakes in monocytes with an approx. twofold higher drug intracellular internalization of EVG compared to free drug and also exhibited superior viral suppression over control for a prolonged period of time (Gong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252">2017</xref>). Due to the presence of mannose receptors on the surface of macrophages, the mannosylated NPs of anti-HIV drug can target the macrophages, resulting in improvement of the therapeutic outcome and reduced toxicity of ARV bioactives. Surface-functionalized mannosylated-PLGA NPs of lamivudine (LVD) administered by intravenous route in a dose of 10 mg/kg to rats showed pronouncedly higher calculated brain/plasma ratio than PLGA NPs and continuously increased drug concentration up to 12 h (Patel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2018</xref>). EFV-loaded PLGA NPs prepared using microfluidic method with particle size 73 nm, zeta potential −14.1 mV, and 10.8% drug loading showed a sustained in vitro EFV release (50% released within the first 24 h), and NPs functionalization with a transferrin receptor-binding peptide was found to be safe to blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelial and neuron cells (metabolic activity above 70%) and nonhemolytic, whereby functionalized nanosystems exhibited 1.3-fold higher drug permeability through a BBB in vitro model compared to free drug (Martins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2019</xref>). EFV-loaded PLGA NPs and PLGA NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating with particle sizes 200–225 nm also retained native ARV activity of drug in vitro, while showed lower cytotoxicity against different epithelial cell lines and HIV target cells. Both types of NPs were readily taken up by colorectal cell lines and mildly reduced EFV permeation and increased membrane retention in Caco-2 and Caco-2/HT29-MTX cell models monolayer in vitro. At intrarectal administration to CD-1 mice in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), the coated PLGA NPs encapsulating EFV reached higher drug levels in colorectal tissues and lavages compared to free EFV or EFV-loaded PLGA NPs and they provided enhanced local pharmacokinetics that could be beneficial in preventing rectal HIV transmission (Nunes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2018</xref>). TFV and EFV-loaded PLGA NPs incorporated alongside free TFV into fast dissolving films during film manufacturing showed higher retention in vivo in vaginal lavages and tissue when associated to film, and NPs-in-film were still able to enhance drug concentrations of EFV. Film alone also contributed to higher and more prolonged local drug levels as compared to the administration of TFV and EFV in aqueous vehicle, and once daily vaginal administration to mice of this formulation did not cause notable histological changes and major alterations in cytokine/chemokine profiles (Cunha-Reis et al.
