 <sup>®</sup>-PEG (shell) for ARV drug delivery with mean size of 161 ± 44.06 nm and 82% drug EE showed controlled drug release and were able effectively enter the brain cells (Joshy et al.

 <sc>l</sc>-glutamic acid encapsulating ZDV with mean size of 432 ± 11.9 nm and a loading efficacy of 29.5 ± 3.2% showed slow and sustained release of drug in phosphate
 <italic>-</italic>buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and exhibited significantly higher cellular internalization efficiency in vitro (Joshy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2018a</xref>). Considerable improvement in cellular internalization (murine neuro-2a and HeLa cells) in vitro was observed also with ZDV-loaded PVP/stearic acid (SA)-PEG NPs due to the core-shell NPs prepared from lipid and polymer, suggesting that such NPs have potential to be used for antiviral drug delivery for use in HIV/AIDS therapy (Joshy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2018b</xref>). ZDV-loaded core-shell dextran hybrid nanosystem expressed enhanced cellular internalization of drug-loaded hybrid NPs in comparison with free drug (Joshy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2018c</xref>).
