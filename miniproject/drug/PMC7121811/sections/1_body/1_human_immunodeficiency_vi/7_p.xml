<p id="Par16">Atripla-trimethyl chitosan (CS) NPs nanoconjugated with particle sizes of 177.2 ± 7.8 nm and zeta potential of −1.35 ± 0.04 mV showed a higher inhibitory effect on HIV replication than atripla alone, and at low doses it could be used for antiviral treatment resulting in reduction of drug resistance and other side effects (Shohani et al.

Spherical intranasal EFV NPs prepared using CS-g-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (198 ± 4.4 nm) with 23.28 ± 1.5% drug loading and 38 ± 1.43% entrapment efficiency (EE) exhibited sustained drug release (99.03 ± 0.30% in 8 h), 4.76-fold greater permeability through porcine nasal mucosa than plain drug solution, and 12.40-fold higher central nervous system bioavailability than drug solution administered by i.v. route (Belgamwar et al.

Experiments with NPs coated with glycol chitosan and loaded with a HIV-1 inhibitor peptide tested in vitro and ex vivo using the porcine vaginal mucosa showed that such formulation reached the vaginal tissue and released the peptide within intercellular space without any side effects (Ariza-Saenz et al.
