<p id="Par53">Au nanorods (AuNRs) were found to inhibit RSV in human epithelial type 2 (HEp
 <italic>-</italic>2) cells and in BALB/c mice by 82% and 56%, respectively, whereby the RSV inhibition correlated with marked upregulated antiviral genes due to AuNR-mediated Toll-like receptor, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor, and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor signaling pathways, whereby recruitment of immune cells to counter RSV replication was demonstrated by production of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs (Bawage et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>). Treatment of human dendritic cells with AuNRs conjugated to RSV F formulated as a candidate vaccine preparation for RSV by covalent attachment of viral protein using a layer-by-layer approach induced immune responses in primary human T cells (Stone et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2013</xref>). Curcumin-modified AgNPs showed strong inhibitory activity against RSV infection resulting in a reduction of viral titers about two orders of magnitude at AgNPs concentration showing no toxicity to the host cells, whereby AgNPs inactivated the virus directly, which resulted in the prevention of RSV to infect the host cells (Yang et al.
