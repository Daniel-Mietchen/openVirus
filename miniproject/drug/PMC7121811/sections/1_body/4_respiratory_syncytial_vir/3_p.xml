 <sub>2</sub> NPs (0.5 mg/kg) that were 5 days later infected intranasally with RSV notably increased levels of interferon-γ and chemokine CCL5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were estimated compared with the control on day 5 postinfection, but not in uninfected mice. TiO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure resulted also in an increase in the infiltration of lymphocytes into the alveolar septa in lung tissues, while pulmonary viral titers were not affected. Consequently, it can be stated that the immune system was affected by a single exposure to TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NPs that exacerbated pneumonia in RSV-infected mice (Hashiguchi et al.
