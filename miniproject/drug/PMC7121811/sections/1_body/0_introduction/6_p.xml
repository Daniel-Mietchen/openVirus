<p id="Par7">Surfactant proteins A and D form an important part of the innate immune response in the lung, which can interact with NPs to modulate the cellular uptake of these particles. Unmodified polystyrene NPs of 100 nm were found to modulate surfactant proteins A and D mediated protection against influenza A infection in vitro (McKenzie et al.

Substitution of sulfate groups in cellulose nanocrystals by tyrosine sulfate mimetic groups (i.e., phenyl sulfonates) led to improved viral inhibition indicating that the conjugation of target-specific functionalities to cellulose nanocrystal surfaces provides a mean to control their antiviral activity (Zoppe et al.
