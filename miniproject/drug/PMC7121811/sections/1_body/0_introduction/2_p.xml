<p id="Par3">Strategy based on the reformulation of existing anti-infectives into nanoformulations as well as investigation of various metal and metalloid nanoparticles with respect to their anti-infectious activity and potency is applied more and more frequently (Jampílek and Kráľová

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2017</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2018</xref>). In fact, this strategy is not only used for anti-infectious drugs but nanoformulations are also widely used for different classes of drugs, such as antineoplastics (Pentak et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2019a</xref>), antipsychotics, antidepressants (Jampílek and Kráľová

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2018</xref>; Patra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2018</xref>). Thus in the light of the above mentioned facts, nanomaterials can constitute a useful tool in combat with viruses as well (Szunerits et al.
