<p id="Par9">This contribution is focused on nanoscale materials/formulations with potential to be used to treat or inhibit the spread of viral diseases caused by human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A viruses (subtypes H3N2 and H1N1), avian influenza and swine influenza viruses , respiratory syncytial virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, Newcastle disease virus, dengue and Zika viruses , and pseudorabies virus (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">7.1</xref>). Effective antiviral long-lasting and target-selective nanoformulations developed for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal, and intradermal applications are discussed. Benefits of nanoparticle -based vaccination and nanoformulations with potential to secure cross protection against divergent viruses are outlined as well.
