<p id="Par5">In the nonviral gene therapy, the use of multifunctional NPs (e.g., lipid-based NPs, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, magnetic NPs, silica NPs, and polymer-based NPs) is advantageous because these nonviral vectors ensure enhanced gene stability at gene delivery, shielding of cargo from nuclease degradation, and improve passive/active targeting (Lin et al.
