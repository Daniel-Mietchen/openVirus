<p id="Par8">A well-defined structure of virus due to its multifunctional proteinaceous shell (capsid) surrounding genomic material is a promising approach to obtain nanostructured materials, and viruses exhibit an ideal template for the formation of nanoconjugates with noble metal NPs. The interaction of the multifunctional viruses with NPs and other functional additives results in generation of bioconjugates with different properties, including possible antiviral and antibacterial activities (Parboosing et al.
