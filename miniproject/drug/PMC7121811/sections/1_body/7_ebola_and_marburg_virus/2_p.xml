<p id="Par76">It was found that graphene sheets associate strongly with the EBOV matrix protein VP40 that is a potential pharmacological target for disrupting the virus life cycle, at various interfaces. Graphene can disrupt the C-terminal domain interface of VP40 hexamers being crucial in forming the Ebola viral matrix, suggesting that graphene or similar NPs-based solutions used as a disinfectant could notably reduce the spread of the disease and prevent an Ebola epidemic (Gc et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">2018</xref>) found that MWCNTs functionalized with glycofullerenes can be considered as potent inhibitors of Ebola infection. In two mRNA vaccines based on the EBOV envelope glycoprotein, differing by the nature of signal peptide for improved glycoprotein posttranslational translocation, the mRNAs were formulated with LNPs to facilitate delivery. Vaccination of guinea pigs induced EBOV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody responses and 100% survival after EBOV infection (Meyer et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2016</xref>). Similar results were received with treatment of Ebola-virus-Makona-infected nonhuman primates following administration of siRNA encapsulated in LNPs suggesting the therapeutic potential of such nanoformulation in combating this lethal disease (Thi et al.
