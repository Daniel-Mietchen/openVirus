<p id="Par75">Ebola virus disease is caused by Ebola viruses (EBOVs; family 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic>), members of the group of hemorrhagic fever and it is one of the most dangerous infection diseases with mortality rates up to 90%. The EBOVs do not replicate through cell division, but instead insert their own genetic sequencing into the DNA of the host cell and subsequently hijack all cellular processes, including transcription and translation; thus, the host cell becomes a factory of viral proteins (Gebretadik et al.
