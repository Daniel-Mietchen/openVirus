<p id="Par86">Au nanoclusters surface-stabilized with histidine that strongly inhibited the proliferation of PRV were found to function via blockage of the viral replication process rather than the processes of attachment, penetration, or release and they were observed to be mainly localized to nucleus (Feng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2018</xref>). Both GO and reduced GO showing the nanosheet structure tested against a DNA virus, PRV, and a RNA virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), suppressed the infection of these viruses for a 2Â log reduction, and their potent antiviral activity can be attributed to the unique single-layer structure and negative charge of GO and reduced GO, whereby GO inactivated both viruses by structural destruction prior to viral entry (Ye et al.
