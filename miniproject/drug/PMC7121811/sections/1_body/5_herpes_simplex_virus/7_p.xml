<p id="Par63">C-Glycosylflavonoid-enriched fraction of 
 <italic>Cecropia glaziovii</italic> encapsulated in PLGA NPs showed antiherpes properties and could be considered as a promising system for the effective drug delivery in the treatment of herpes infections (dos Santos et al.

 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> volatile oil encapsulated in PLGA NPs incorporated in carbomer hydrogels and tested against HSV using Vero cells inhibited virus at 42.2-fold lower concentration than free oil and it was 8.8- and 2.2-fold more efficient than oil-loaded NPs and hydrogel containing free oil, respectively (Almeida et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>). Genistein-loaded cationic nanoemulsions with an average droplet size approx. 200â€“300 nm containing hydroxyethyl cellulose as a thickening agent showed considerably reduced genistein flux through excised porcine mucosa specimens compared to nanoemulsions before thickening, exhibited notable increase of genistein retention in mucosa compared to the genistein propylene glycol solution, and showed antiherpetic activity in vitro against HSV-1 (strain 29R) (Argenta et al.
