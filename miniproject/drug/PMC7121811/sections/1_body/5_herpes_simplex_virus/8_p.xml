<p id="Par64">Suspensions of glycyrrhizic acid NPs with particle size approx. 180 nm exhibited better anti-HSV activities compared to glycyrrhizic acid ammonium salt, especially during replication period. Morphology of HSV-1 observed by transmission electron microscopy was found to damage and shed the envelope of HSV-1 (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">2015</xref>). The antiviral activities against HSV-2 estimated using the cytopathic effect assay showed also microemulsions with mean nanodroplet diameter of 4.7 ± 1.22 nm consisting of oil, water, surfactants, and cosurfactants that were able to destroy the HSV-2 virus at a 200-fold dilution in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (Alkhatib et al.

Pentyl gallate nanoemulsions (particle sizes of 124.8–143.7 nm; zeta potential ranging from −50.1 to −66.1 mV) demonstrated anti-HSV-1 activity and the drug reached deeper into the dermis more efficiently from the nanoemulsion as free drug, suggesting that nanoemulsions have potential to be used in topically delivering pentyl gallate in the treatment of human herpes labialis infection affecting primarily the lip (Kelmann et al.
