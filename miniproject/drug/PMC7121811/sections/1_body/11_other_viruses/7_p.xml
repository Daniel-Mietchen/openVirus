<p id="Par94">Khandelwal et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2014</xref>) evaluated antiviral efficacy of AgNPs (5–30 nm) against 
 <italic>Ovine rinderpest</italic> (
 <italic>Peste des petits ruminants virus</italic>, PPRV), a prototype 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic>, causing disease in small ruminants, such as goats and sheep, and estimated significant inhibition of PPRV replication by AgNPs in an experiment using Vero cells already at noncytotoxic concentration, whereby AgNPs blocked the viral entry into the target cells due to interaction of AgNPs with the virion surface as well as with the virion core.
