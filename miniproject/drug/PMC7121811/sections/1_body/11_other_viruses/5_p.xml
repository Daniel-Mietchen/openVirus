<p id="Par92">McGill et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2018</xref>) developed a mucosal nanovaccine with the post-fusion F and G glycoproteins from bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) encapsulated in polyanhydride NPs and tested it against BRSV infection using a neonatal calf model. They observed reduced pathology in the lungs, reduced viral burden, and decreased virus shedding compared to unvaccinated control calves showing correlation with BRSV-specific immune responses in the respiratory tract and peripheral blood.
