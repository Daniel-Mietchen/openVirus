<p id="Par49">As a virus for challenge test Moon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2012</xref>) used the HPAI H5N1 virus (A/EM/Korea/W149/06) isolated from fecal specimens collected from wild bird habitats and constructed recombinant HA antigen based on the HA1 head domain of this virus. Intranasal immunization with a mixture of recombinant influenza HA antigen or inactivated virus and poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA)/CS NPs induced a high anti-HA IgA response in lung and IgG response in serum, including anti-HA neutralizing antibodies as well as an influenza virus-specific cell-mediated immune response in female BALB/c mice against challenge with a lethal dose of the highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 virus (Moon et al.

 <italic>.</italic> Pigs that were intranasally vaccinated with killed swine influenza A virus H1N2 (δ-lineage) antigens encapsulated in CS polymer-based NPs exhibited an enhanced IgG serum antibody and mucosal secretory IgA antibody responses in nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and lung lysates that were reactive against homologous (H1N2), heterologous (H1N1), and heterosubtypic (H3N2) influenza A virus strains (Dhakal et al.
