<p id="Par71">Alum-adjuvanted HBV vaccine is considered as the most effective measure to prevent HBV infection; however, it is a frost-sensitive suspension and therefore it would be desirable to use alternative natural adjuvant system strongly immunogenic allowing for a reduction in dose and cost. Therefore, AbdelAllah et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) subcutaneously immunized mice with HBV surface antigen, HBsAg, adjuvanted with CS and sodium alginate, either alone or combined with alum, estimated rate of seroconversion, serum HBsAg antibody, interleukin-4, and interferon-Î³ levels, and compared them with control mice immunized with current vaccine formula or unadjuvanted HBsAg. It was found that the solution formula with CS or sodium alginate exhibited comparable immunogenic responses to alum-adjuvanted suspension and the triple adjuvant application (alum, CS, sodium alginate) resulted in considerably higher immunogenic response than controls. Compared to traditional methods, vaccines prepared from nanoscale materials show appropriate biocompatibility and can secure effective targeting to certain tissue or cells as well as precise stimulation of immune responses (Yang et al.
