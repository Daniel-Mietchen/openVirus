<p id="Par74">Lipid nanocapsules, surface-functionalized with amphiphilic boronic acid through their postinsertion into the semirigid shell of the nanocapsules, were found to be excellent HCV entry inhibitors preventing HCV infection in the micromolar range (Khanal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2015</xref>). Phenylboronic-acid-modified NPs as potential antiviral therapeutics were reported previously also by Khanal et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2013</xref>). siRNA-loaded lipid NPs (LNPs) modified with a hepatocyte-specific ligand, 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-galactosamine, showed pronounced improvement of hepatocyte-specificity and strong reduction in toxicity and further modification of NPs with PEG practically eliminated the LNP-associated toxicity without any detectable loss of gene silencing activity in hepatocytes, whereby a single injection of the LNPs considerably reduced HBV genomic DNA and their antigens without any sign of toxicity in chimeric mice with humanized livers that had been persistently infected with HBV (Sato et al.
