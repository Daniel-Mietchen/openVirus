 <sc>l</sc>-lactic acid) homopolymer and arabinogalactan-poly(
 <sc>l</sc>-lysine) conjugate were efficiently internalized in cultured HepG2 cells; they ensured sustained release of drug and could be considered as a formulation suitable for the clinical application of RBV as a therapeutic agent for chronic HCV (Ishihara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2014</xref>). Liver-specific, sustained drug delivery system prepared by conjugating the liver-targeting peptide to PEGylated cyclosporine A-encapsulated PLGA NPs effectively inhibited viral replication in vitro as well as in a HCV mouse model (Jyothi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2015</xref>). Adefovir encapsulated in PLGA microspheres showed sustained release and after intramuscular injection to rats considerable increase in the
