<p id="Par69">Lu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2008</xref>) estimated that AgNPs of the size 10 and 50 nm inhibited the in vitro production of HBV RNA and extracellular virions and assumed that the direct interaction between these NPs and HBV double-stranded DNA or viral particles is responsible for their antiviral mechanism. Lee et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2012</xref>) proposed hyaluronic acid-AuNPs/interferon-α complex for targeted treatment of HCV infection. Antiviral effect of AuNPs showing small particle size (approx. 3.5 nm) organized on the surface of larger layered double hydroxide (LDH) NPs such as MgLDH, ZnLDH, and MgFeLDH (approx. 150 nm) using HBV as a model virus and hepatoma-derived HepG2.2.215 cells for viral replication reduced the amount of viral and subviral particles released from treated cells by up to 80%; in the presence of AuNPs/LDHs the HBV particles were sequestered within the treated cells and the highest antiviral HBV response (&gt;90% inhibition of HBV secretion) was estimated with AuNPs/MgFeLDH (Carja et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>). Cu
 <sub>2</sub>O NPs that were tested on antiviral activity against HCV pronouncedly inhibited the infectivity of HCVcc/Huh7.5.1 at a noncytotoxic concentration, they inhibited the entry of HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), including genotypes 1a, 1b, and 2a, while no effect on HCV replication was observed and they were found to stop HCV infection both at the attachment and entry stages suggesting that Cu
 <sub>2</sub>O NPs could be used in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C (Hang et al.
