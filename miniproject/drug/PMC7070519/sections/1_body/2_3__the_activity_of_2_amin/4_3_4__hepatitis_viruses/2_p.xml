<p>1,2-Dihydro-4,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1-[(5-(phenylamino)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)methyl]pyridine-3-carbonitrile 
 <bold>49</bold> was prepared from the corresponding phehylthiosemicarbazide by cyclization in sulfuric acid [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The derivative 
 <bold>49</bold> was tested for antiviral activity against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HepG2.2.2.15 cell line, a human hepatoblastoma cell line that produces HBV viral particles. Cytotoxicity was also tested by the cell viability method (MTT assay). Preliminary screening indicated high inhibitory activity against HBV with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.3 μM, low cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 333.3 μM) and a selectivity index SI of 1111 compared to the standard drug lamivudine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.1μM). From these results, it can be concluded that pyridine-2-one may be a good substituent on the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, and these two moieties together make a promising scaffold in promoting anti-HBV activity [
