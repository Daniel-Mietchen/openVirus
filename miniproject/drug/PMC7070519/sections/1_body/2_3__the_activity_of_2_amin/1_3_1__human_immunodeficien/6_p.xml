<p>In vitro HIV inhibitory activity using human T-lymphocyte (MT-4) cells gave moderate or low half-maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values in comparison to efavirenz (EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.003 μg/mL). The best results were obtained for derivatives 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00942-f001">Figure 1</xref>) with moderate EC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Thus, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> showed EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 14 μg/mL against HIV-1 (strain IIIB) and EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 12.4 μg/mL against HIV-2 (strain ROD), while the compound 
 <bold>5</bold> showed EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 12.6 μg/mL against HIV-1 and EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 12.5 μg/mL against HIV-2. Low values for cytotoxicity concentration 50% (compound concentration that reduces the viability of mock-infected MT-4 cells by 50%), namely the CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 14.0 ± 1.2 μg/mL for compound 
 <bold>1</bold> and 13.3 ± 0.8 μg/mL for compound 
 <bold>5</bold>, respectively, resulted in low selectivity index SI ≤ 1 (SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>). Other derivatives showed lower activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> within the range of 47.4–125 μg/mL. However, chemical modifications on this scaffold might lead to compounds with enhanced activity as NNRTIs [
