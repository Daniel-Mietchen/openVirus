<p>Although they exhibited less anti-HIV-1 activity compared to standard drug zidovudine (half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.016 μM), these compounds showed significant anti-HIV-1 activity at micromolar concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub> within the range of 7.50–20.83 μM) (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00942-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It has been observed that the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety may be a good group for anti-HIV-1 activity by providing promising antiviral agents. Moreover, the electronic properties of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-aryl group influenced antiviral potency. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups, such as fluorine or trifluoromethyl on phenyl ring (derivatives 
 <bold>8</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold>), enhanced antiviral activity compared to the unsubstituted phenyl derivative 
 <bold>7</bold>. SAR studies suggested that the steric/electronic properties of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-phenyl substituents influenced the antiretroviral activity more than their positions. In addition, the nature of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-aryl ring influenced the antiviral potency as can be observed for derivative 
 <bold>10</bold> with a pyrimidyl ring which was the most active compound (
