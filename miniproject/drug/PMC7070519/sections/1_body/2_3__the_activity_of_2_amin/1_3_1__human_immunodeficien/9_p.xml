<p>A new class of HIV-1 NNRTIs, 
 <italic>N</italic>-aryl-2-arylthioacetamides, has been identified in the last years [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,

 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Studies on the crystalline structure of the RT-NNRTI complex suggested that NNRTIs have a common mode of action and interact with a hydrophobic pocket. 
 <italic>N</italic>-aryl-2-arylthioacetamides adopted a butterfly-like conformation in which the arylthio moiety and the phenyl ring mimic the butterfly wings. SAR studies showed that the arylthio moiety strongly influenced the antiviral activity, leading to different results depending on the steric/electronic properties of the groups [

 <italic>N</italic>-(aryl) acetamide derivatives
