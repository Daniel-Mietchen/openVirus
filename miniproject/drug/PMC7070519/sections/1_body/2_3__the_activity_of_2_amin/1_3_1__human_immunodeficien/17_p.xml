<p>Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the human body and is involved in more metabolic processes than any other amino acid. Glutamine is produced from glutamate and ammonia by the enzyme glutamine synthetase [

 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The conversion of glutamine to glutamate is catalyzed by the mitochondrial enzyme, glutaminase [

 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The glutamine/glutamate cycle in the human body plays several important metabolic functions. Thus, glutamine and glutamate are precursors to the biosynthesis of proteins, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, nucleic acids and other important biological molecules. The glutamine/glutamate cycle is the substrate for the synthesis of urea in the liver, genesis of ammonia in the kidneys and for hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis. The glutamine/glutamate exchange regulates the acid-base balance in kidneys, acts as an oxidative fuel for the intestines and cells of the immune system and provides the transport of nitrogen between organs [

 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The existence of a glutamine/glutamate cycle in CNS was confirmed in the last years [

Glutamine is present in the extracellular fluid of the brain at high concentrations and provides an abundant substrate for glutaminase [
