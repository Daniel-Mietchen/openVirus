<p>Multiple experiments were performed in order to study the biological profile of the compounds. Some of the synthesized derivatives are prodrugs, which under physiologic conditions (in vivo), are converted into the therapeutically active parent compound. Studies have also been conducted to obtain pharmaceutical preparations suitable for use in human patients comprising any of the synthesized derivatives and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In addition, the authors assume that the derivatives may be used alone or in combination with known antiviral drugs. Studies on kidney-type glutaminase inhibition showed good results for many derivatives such as compound
