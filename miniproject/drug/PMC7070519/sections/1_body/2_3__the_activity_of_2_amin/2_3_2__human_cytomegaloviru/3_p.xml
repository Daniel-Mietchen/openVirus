<p>Novel 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives with antiviral activity against HCMV have been patented [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. A large number of 472 synthesized compounds were tested in an HCMV polymerase assay at a concentration of 25 μM. The degree of enzyme inhibition ranged from 20% to 100%. Among the most active compounds, four derivatives exhibited a 100% inhibition rate, 29 derivatives showed an inhibition rate of 90.1%–99.9% and 16 derivatives showed an inhibition rate of 80.3%–89.9%. Three structural series stand out among the most active 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives: 1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-carboxamide derivatives such as 
 <bold>21</bold>–
 <bold>30</bold>, 9-octadecenamide derivatives such as 
 <bold>31</bold>–
 <bold>38</bold> and 2-ethoxy-1-naphthamide derivatives such as 
 <bold>39</bold>–
 <bold>42</bold> (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-00942-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Most of the derivatives belong to the 1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-carboxamide series. At the same time, the most active compounds belong to this series, so it can be concluded that the 1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-carboxamide moiety is a good scaffold for anti-HCMV activity [
