<p>The derivatives 
 <bold>50</bold> (methyl) and 
 <bold>51</bold> (allyl) showed antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus-1 TK-KOS and herpes simplex virus-1 TK-KOS ACV, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4 and Punto Toro virus at a concentration of 16 μg/mL. The highest antiviral activity was exhibited against Sindbis virus by derivative 
 <bold>50</bold> at a concentration of 9.6 μg/mL. It seems that the size of the amino group substituent influenced the antiviral activity. While derivatives 
 <bold>50</bold> and 
 <bold>51</bold> with small alkyl groups showed antiviral activity, compounds with bulky aromatic (
 <bold>52</bold>, 
 <bold>53</bold> and 
 <bold>54</bold>) or cycloalkyl (
 <bold>55</bold>) groups were not capable of viral inhibition (
