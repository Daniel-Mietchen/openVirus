<p>The use of non-nucleoside derivatives as antiviral chemotherapeutic agents has stimulated extensive research into the synthesis of compounds of this class. However, many antiviral drugs are nucleoside analogs that act by suppressing the synthesis of viral DNA or RNA which leads to inhibition of virus replication or cell division. Research has been carried out to find new nucleoside antiviral agents in which the natural nucleobases have been replaced by heterocyclic rings, as can be seen in derivatives
