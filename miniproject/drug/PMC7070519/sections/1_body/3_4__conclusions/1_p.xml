<p>The research focused on 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives indicates a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities associated with good physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. This article presents a literature review of 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives that have been evaluated for antiviral activity against several viral strains. In addition to the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety, antiviral activity is also dependent on the nature of the substituents, and structureâ€“activity studies have shown the most efficient substituents for antiviral activity in each class. Based on the literature data, the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole scaffold may be considered a possible pharmacophore group that can be incorporated into the structure of known compounds to enhance antiviral activity and contributes to the search and development of new medicines as an alternative to the treatment of viral infections.</p>
