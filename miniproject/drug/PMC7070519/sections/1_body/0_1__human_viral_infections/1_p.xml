There are broad types of human infections caused by viruses, such as respiratory infections (common cold, Influenza), digestive infections (viral gastroenteritis), central nervous system infections (viral meningitis, viral encephalitis), skin or mucosal infections (herpes, measles, mumps, smallpox and rubella), hepatic infections (hepatitis A, B, C, E), blood infections (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and hemorrhagic fever (yellow fever, Ebola hemorrhagic fever). Viruses are the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth and this is the reason for the high incidence of viral infections [
