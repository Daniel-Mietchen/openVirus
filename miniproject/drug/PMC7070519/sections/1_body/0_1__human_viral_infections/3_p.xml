<p>For many viral infections, only symptomatic treatment is indicated, while it is expected the immune system to fight off the virus. However, there are high-virulence viruses that cause serious viral infections where antiviral treatment is essential for patient survival. Although great efforts have been made to find effective medication, there are still no drugs that truly cure viral infections. Moreover, due to the ability of viruses to undergo rapid mutations, the mechanisms involved in developing resistance to antiviral drugs are activated in most cases [
