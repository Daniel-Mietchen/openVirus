<p>Five-membered aromatic systems with three heteroatoms at symmetrical positions, such as the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, have been extensively studied due to their pharmacological profile and physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. 1,3,4-Thiadiazole derivatives are known as compounds having significant and diverse biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, antitubercular [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], kinesin inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], etc. The 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring is also found in several medicines such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, cefazolin, cefazedone, sulfamethizole or megazol [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The 1,3,4-thiadiazole nucleus provides the compounds with high lipophilicity and the ability to form mesoionic systems associated with discrete regions of positive and negative charges. These distinct features allow mesoionic compounds to efficiently cross cellular membranes, leading to good oral absorption, bioavailability and strong unique interactions with biological molecules (e.g., DNA, proteins, etc.) thus increasing the potential of 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives to exhibit biological activities [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The thiadiazole ring is a bioisostere of the pyrimidine and pyridazine rings. The pyrimidine nucleus is commonly found in naturally occurring compounds of biochemical importance, as well as in drugs (e.g., pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides, nucleic acids, antiviral drugs), while the pyridazine nucleus is a component of some pharmacologically active compounds [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The thiadiazole ring also acts as a bioisostere of the thiazole ring, and therefore thiadiazole derivatives can act in the same way as third- and fourth-generation antibacterial cephalosporins. This is an additional feature that highlights the high potential of this ring system in medicinal chemistry [

Many researchers suppose there is a connection between the biological potential of 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and the strongly aromatic character of the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, as well as the presence of the toxophoric =N-C-S- linkage group. Furthermore, the high in vivo stability and low toxicity for higher organisms are also attributed to the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring [
