<p id="Par14">Oleanolic acid has low aqueous solubility and systemic bioavailability (0.7% in rats). SMEDDS was developed in an attempt to overcome these limitations. This delivery system consisted of 50% ethyl oleate (oil), 35% Cremophor EL (surfactant), and 15% alcohol (co-surfactant), allowing a great increase in oleanolic acid solubility [

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The improved drugâ€™s oral bioavailability was explained by enhanced solubility and permeability through emulsification and small particle sizes, respectively.
