 <italic>Flos Lonicerae Japonicae</italic> and 
 <italic>Fructus forsythia</italic> are used together in Chinese herbal remedies, and both have antiviral, antibacterial, and antiinflammatory properties. An attempt was made to enhance the bioavailability and antiinfluenza properties of the herb combination by chito-oligosaccharide, a chitosan derivative [

 <italic>Flos Lonicerae Japonicae</italic> and 
 <italic>Fructus forsythia</italic>, compared to extracts that do not contain the chito-oligosaccharide. The absorption was studied 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using Caco-2 model, and higher experimentally derived apparent permeability values were obtained with increasing concentrations of chito-oligosaccharide. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> pharmacokinetics showed a significant increase in 
 <italic>Flos Lonicerae Japonicae</italic> and 
 <italic>Fructus forsythia</italic> concentrations when co-delivered with chito-oligosaccharide, relative to herb administration alone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In addition, enhanced antiviral effect was achieved in four preparations containing chito-oligosaccharide, which was explained by the higher absorption of caffeic acid derivatives (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). This work was unique because it studied the effects of the delivery system on both the pharmacokinetic properties and the antiviral activity of the herbal drug, directly.
