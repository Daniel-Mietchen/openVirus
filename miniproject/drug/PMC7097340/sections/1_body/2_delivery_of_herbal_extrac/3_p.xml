<p id="Par13">Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] aimed to improve the oral absorption of baicalin, which has low solubility and poor permeability, by using a micellar formulation comprised of the carriers Pluronic P123 copolymer and sodium taurocholate. Sustained release profile of baicalin-loaded mixed micelles, in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release experiment, held in several pH conditions, showed 14% drug released after 2 h in gastric conditions and 54% release within 48 h in intestinal conditions, compared to 34% and 79% release from a baicalin suspension, respectively. This observation suggests improved stability afforded by the designed formulation. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> uptake studies, carried out with a caco-2 cell line, determined the absorption of baicalin within the mixed micelles and verified their internalization ability. Baicalin-loaded ST-P123-MMs formulation achieved high oral bioavailability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results are believed to derive from the micellar small size and to Pluronic component, which is a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. In addition, the mixed micelle formulation showed a bimodal presentation, presumably attributed to enterohepatic recirculation, further enhancing the drugâ€™s oral bioavailability [
