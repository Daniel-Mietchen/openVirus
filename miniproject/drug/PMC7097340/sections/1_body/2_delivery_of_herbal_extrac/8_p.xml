<p id="Par18">Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound with various medical applications including known antivirus activity, is poorly water-soluble and has low oral bioavailability. With N-acetyl L-cysteine and different levels (20, 50, and 100 mg) of polyethylene glycol (PEG), nanostructured solid lipid carriers were synthesized to obtain curcumin mucoadhesion and mucus penetration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. Drug release was characterized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for curcumin solution, curcumin-loaded nanolipid carrier, and curcumin-loaded nanolipid carrier with N-acetyl L-cysteine PEG. From the curcumin solution, 80% of drug was released after 4 h, whereas all the nanolipid formulations allowed sustained curcumin release; the sustained release effect from the modified nanolipid carriers was more pronounced than that of unmodified nanolipids. An SPIP study in rats was then conducted, and results were similar for all three parts of the small intestine: nanolipids allowed enhanced curcumin permeation relative to solution, and so did higher N-acetyl L-cysteine content. Pharmacokinetic study of curcumin solutions (P.O and I.V) and curcumin nanolipid carriers (with N-acetyl L-cysteine PEG content of 0, 20, 50, and 100 mg) was conducted. Similar to the results of the permeability experiment, plasma curcumin concentrations were higher with nanolipid carriers relative to solution (either P.O or I.V) and increased further with higher N-acetyl L-cysteine PEG levels. The area under the curve was substantially larger with the modified nanolipid carriers compared to either curcumin solution or to the unmodified delivery system.
