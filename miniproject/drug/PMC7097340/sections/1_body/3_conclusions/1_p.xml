<p id="Par20">Altogether, the evidence presented in this work supports the notion that medicinal plants have promising therapeutic potential, especially in the case of herb products against viral infections. Further research on the mechanisms by which phytochemicals exhibit their antiviral effect will allow the developing of successful target-specific drug delivery systems. At the moment, we cannot ensure the plant phytochemicals directly reach viruses or the correct structures inside cells. Ideally, we would have smart pharmaceutical nanotechnologies and targeting strategies that can avoid cellular defenses, transport drugs to targeted intracellular sites, and release the drugs in response to specific molecular signals. Literature also lacks randomized clinical trials to discern the strength of new herbal antiviral drug delivery systems. It is our hope that in the future more high quality clinically relevant studies will accumulate in the literature, which will shed light on the full potential of phytochemicals as novel antiviral agents in adequate delivery systems.</p>
