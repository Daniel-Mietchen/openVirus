<p id="Par9">Apigenin (4â€²,5,7-trihydroxyflavone), an aglycone of the flavone class, is found in many plants and has broad antiviral activities against enterovirus-71 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], foot and mouth disease virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], HCV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], African swine fever virus (ASFV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], and influenza A virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Of note, many flavonoids of plant origin have known antiviral properties. For example, out of 22 different flavonoids, six phytochemicals (apigenin, baicalein, biochanin A, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin) were active against the avian influenza H5N1 virus in human lung epithelial (A549) cells through inhibiting nucleoprotein production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Baicalin (the glucuronide of baicalein) was also active against a wide range of viruses, including enterovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], dengue virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], respiratory syncytial virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], Newcastle disease virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], human immunodeficiency virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], and hepatitis B virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and different mechanisms were suggested for its antiviral actions. For example, baicalin inhibits the production of HBV, the templates for viral proteins and HBV-DNA synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and decreases IL-6 and IL-8 production without affecting IP-10 levels, as shown in a study on avian influenza H5N1 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].
