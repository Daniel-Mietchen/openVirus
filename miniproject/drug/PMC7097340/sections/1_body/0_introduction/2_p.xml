<p id="Par4">Classic antiviral drugs such as interferon and ribavirin are effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against most viruses, but often are ineffective in patients. Ninety different antiviral agents available today [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] only treat a selection of viruses; these viruses include HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), herpes viruses, including HSV (herpes simplex virus), hCMV (human cytomegalovirus), VZV (varicella zoster virus), influenza viruses, and the hepatitis viruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Currently, there is no approved remedy for many types or viruses, and vaccination is limited to hepatitis A virus, mumps, and varicella [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, these agents are often costly and ineffective due to viral resistance and cause side effects. With that in mind, naturally based pharmacotherapy may be a proper alternative for treating viral diseases. Thus, it is necessary to further examine the topic of antiviral phytochemicals, highlighting drug delivery applications in overcoming the multiple biological barriers existing for antiviral agents to successfully reach their intended site(s) of action. The present review focuses on the antiviral properties of herb extracts and bioactive constituent isolates from medicinal plants, and the efforts to obtain their efficient delivery.
