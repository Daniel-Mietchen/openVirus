  <italic>In vivo</italic> validation of drugs against H5N1 infection. (A) Flow chart of the 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> validation of drug efficacy. (B) Lung injury scores of tissue from H5N1-infected C57BL/6 mice (
  <italic>n</italic> = 3 to 5) treated with drug candidates by intragastric administration. Lung tissues were obtained at 3 days after infection. Lung injury scores per microscopic field are shown in the bar graph. 
  <italic>n</italic> = 100 fields were analyzed for each group. (C and D) Wet-to-dry-weight ratios of lung tissue from H5N1-infected C57BL/6 mice treated with drugs by intraperitoneal injection (C) or intragastric administration (D). Lung tissues were obtained at 3 days after infection. Compound identities: no. 15, glyburide; no. 31, bupivacaine; no. 47, AEBSF; no. 97, diazoxide; no. 101, diflunisal; no. 104, vemurafenib. The data shown represent means ± standard errors of the means (SEMs). 
  <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments were repeated three times. *, 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **, 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 (two-tailed test). (E) Body weight changes in H5N1-infected C57BL/6 mice treated with ifenprodil (no. 42), flavopiridol (no. 67), or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection. Download
