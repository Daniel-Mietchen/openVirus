  <italic>In vitro</italic> validation of drugs against H5N1 virus infection. (A) Flow chart of drug screening based on 1,137 genes and 104 drug candidates. (B) Flow chart of the 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> validation of drug efficacy against H5N1 infection. (C) Viability of A549 cells infected with H5N1 at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0 and treated with drugs prophylactically (3 h before infection) or therapeutically (3 h after infection). Viability was assessed at 48 h after infection and is expressed relative to that of vehicle-treated control cells.
