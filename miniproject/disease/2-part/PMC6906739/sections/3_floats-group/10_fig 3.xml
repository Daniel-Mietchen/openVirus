  <p>Ifenprodil and flavopiridol alleviated H5N1-induced cytokine storm in mouse lungs. (A and B) Heat maps of relative cytokine mRNA levels in lung tissues of H5N1-infected C57BL/6 mice treated with ifenprodil (no. 42) (A), flavopiridol (no. 67) (B), or vehicle. Lung tissues were obtained at 3 days after infection, and total RNA was isolated for RNA sequencing. The columns of the heat maps represent each experimental mouse. The relative expression levels of cytokine mRNAs were normalized by Z-score transformation. (C) The levels of cytokines and chemokines in plasma from H5N1-infected C57BL/6 mice treated with ifenprodil (no. 42), flavopiridol (no. 67), or vehicle. Blood samples were obtained at 3 days after infection.
