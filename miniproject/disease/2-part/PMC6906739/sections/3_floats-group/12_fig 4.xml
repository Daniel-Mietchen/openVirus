  <p>Functional processes and pathways influenced by ifenprodil and flavopiridol in H5N1-infected mice. (A and B) GO term (biological process) enrichment of DEGs associated with ifenprodil (no. 42) treatment (A) or flavopiridol (no. 67) treatment (B) in H5N1-infected mice, as analyzed by Metacore. Enrichment was visualized using the Enrichment Map application in Cytoscape. Biological processes are presented as nodes, while the node color indicates the significance of the biological processes, and the node size reflects the object count enriched in the biological processes. The connection between biological processes is based on shared objects. (C and D) Heat maps of the percentage of objects related to the traditional indication or to lung diseases in the top 10 enriched pathways associated with ifenprodil (no. 42) treatment (C) or flavopiridol (no. 67) treatment (D). LN, lung neoplasms; LI, lung diseases (interstitial); LO, lung diseases (obstructive); PF, pulmonary fibrosis; T, traditional indication; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; NETosis, neutrophil extracellular trap-associated cell death; PR, progesterone receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Detailed information about the enriched pathways and objects is provided in
