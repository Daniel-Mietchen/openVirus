  <p>Genomewide RNAi screening to identify essential host factors for H5N1 infection. (A) Rank-ordered distribution of cell viability based on 6,540 human genes in the second round of genomewide RNAi screening. (B) Counts of genes associated with changes in cell viability of more than 10%, 20%, or 30% in two genomewide RNAi screens. (C) GO term (biological process) enrichment of 337 genes based on Metacore analysis. Enrichment was visualized using the Enrichment Map application in Cytoscape. Biological process terms are presented as nodes, while the node color indicates the significance of terms and node size reflects the object count enriched in the terms. The connection between terms is based on shared objects. (D) Functional enrichment of the top 10 significant pathways for 337 genes (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05). IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; SCF, Skp, Cullin, F-box-containing complex; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; NALP3, NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3; BAD, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death; TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL-17, interleukin-17.</p>
