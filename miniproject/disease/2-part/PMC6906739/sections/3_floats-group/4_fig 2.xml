  <p>Drugs effective against influenza A H5N1 virus infection 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo.</italic> (A) Viability of A549 cells infected with H5N1 at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0 and treated with drugs prophylactically (3 h before infection) or therapeutically (3 h after infection). Viability was determined at 48 h after infection and is expressed relative to vehicle-treated control cells. (B) Representative images of lung pathology in hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections from H5N1-infected C57BL/6 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 to 5) treated with drugs or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection. Scale bar = 100 μm. Lung tissues were removed at 3 days after infection. i.p, intraperitoneal. (C and D) Numbers of infiltrating cells (C) and lung injury scores (D) per microscopic field (means ± standard errors of the means [SEM]) are shown in the bar graph (
   <italic>n</italic> = 100 fields per treatment). (E) Representative images of lung pathology in hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections from H5N1-infected C57BL/6 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 to 5) treated with drugs or vehicle by intragastric administration. Lung tissues were removed at 3 days after infection. The numbers of infiltrating cells per microscopic field (means ± SEM) are shown in the bar graph (
   <italic>n</italic> = 100 fields per treatment). Scale bar = 100 μm. i.g, intragastric. (F) Wet-to-dry-weight ratios of lung tissue from H5N1-infected C57BL/6 mice treated by intraperitoneal injection with ifenprodil (no. 42), flavopiridol (no. 67), or vehicle. 
   <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were repeated three times.
