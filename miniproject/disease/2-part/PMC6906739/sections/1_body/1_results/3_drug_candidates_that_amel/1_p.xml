<p>Among the 28 drugs with which we observed a significant recovery of cell viability following H5N1 infection, 8 were glucocorticoids, which, at low doses, are used in conventional treatments against influenza virus-induced ALI (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, we focused on the other 20 nonhormonal drug candidates and tested the top 10 nonhormonal drug candidates that enhanced the viability of H5N1-infected A549 cells against ALI in C57BL/6 mice infected with H5N1 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref>). The following 8 of those 10 drugs significantly decreased the number of infiltrating cells in mouse lung tissues: glyburide (no. 15), bupivacaine (no. 31), ifenprodil (no. 42), 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) (no. 47), flavopiridol (no. 67), diazoxide (no. 97), diflunisal (no. 101), and vemurafenib (no. 104) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">E</xref>). The following 4 of those 8 drugs significantly reduced lung injury scores in animals: ifenprodil, AEBSF, flavopiridol, and diazoxide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4B</xref>). Both ifenprodil treatment and flavopiridol treatment ameliorated lung edema by decreasing the wet-to-dry-weight ratio in H5N1-infected mice with induced ALI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">D</xref>). We measured the impact of these 2 drugs on major subsets of leukocytes during the response to H5N1 virus infection and found that ifenprodil or flavopiridol significantly decreased the levels of neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, and T cells in H5N1 virus-infected mouse lung tissues (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5</xref>). Notably, both ifenprodil treatment and flavopiridol treatment significantly increased the survival rate of H5N1 virus-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). The weight loss of mice administered ifenprodil or flavopiridol was recovered at the second week after H5N1 virus infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4E</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that 8 of the top 10 nonhormonal drugs can ameliorate ALI in H5N1-infected mice, with ifenprodil and flavopiridol being the most effective.
