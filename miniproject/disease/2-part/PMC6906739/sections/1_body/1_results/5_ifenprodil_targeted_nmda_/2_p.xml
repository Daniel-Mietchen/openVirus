<p>Flavopiridol is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (including CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9) and has been investigated for the treatment of several types of cancers, including leukemia, liver cancer, and renal cancer, in clinical phase 2 trials (

Using RNA sequencing data for biological process and pathway analysis, we found that flavopiridol treatment could alter the immune response as well as cell development and differentiation in H5N1 virus-infected mouse lung tissues (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). We found that dozens of genes in most of the top 10 pathways were linked to lung diseases as well as to the known antineoplastic function of flavopiridol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS4">Table S4</xref>). Our study revealed for the first time that flavopiridol is effective in lung injury.
