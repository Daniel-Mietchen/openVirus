<p>In our study, we evaluated the efficiency in H5N1-infected A549 cells of only 104 commercially available drugs from 372 drug candidates identified using our genomewide RNAi screening method; the efficiencies of the rest of the 268 drugs need to be further tested. Furthermore, we examined the efficiencies of only 10 of the 28 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>-effective drugs in an animal model; the rest of the drug candidates also need to be tested
