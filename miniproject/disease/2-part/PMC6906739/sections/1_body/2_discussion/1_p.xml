<p>In this study, we established an efficient whole-genome RNAi-based platform for repurposing drugs for H5N1 infection in A549 cells. Compared to primary epithelial cells, A549 cells are widely used in large-scale experiments for the study of influenza A virus based on convenience and economic considerations (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We identified potential gene targets via a genomewide RNAi screen, in which we searched for drugs that would maximize the viability of H5N1-infected cells. Most genomewide RNAi screens use replication of the moderately pathogenic influenza H1N1 virus as the readout of interference (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and since cell viability is highly correlated to virus lethality, we designed our genomewide RNAi screening platform to use cell death as the readout in order to identify repurposable drugs for treatment of H5N1 virus infection. Of the 28 effective drugs identified

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We showed that 8 of the top 10 nonhormone drugs effectively ameliorated ALI in H5N1-infected mice. We identified the neurological drug ifenprodil and the anticancer drug flavopiridol as potential novel effective remedies for avian influenza A H5N1 virus-infected lung injury.
