<p>Drugs were added at 1, 10, and 100 μM prophylactically (3 h before infection) or therapeutically (3 h after infection) to A549 cells infected with H5N1 influenza virus, and cell viabilities were measured by MTS assay at 48 h after infection. We performed two rounds of screens to confirm drug efficacy. Drug cytotoxicity was measured by assessing the viability of drug-treated A549 cells that were not infected with H5N1. Negative-control cultures were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Drugs that significantly improved the viability of H5N1-infected A549 cells and that showed low cytotoxicity in the two screens were considered effective for treating H5N1 infection
