<p>Three groups of five C57BL/6 mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were used in this study. Mice were infected with live H5N1 virus (10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) and administered vehicle, ifenprodil (20 mg/kg/body weight, intraperitoneally), or flavopiridol (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at 4 time points: 24 h and 3 h before and 24 h and 48 h after infection. Mouse plasma samples were collected 72 h after infection. The levels of cytokines and chemokines in the plasma were measured with a Bio-Plex mouse cytokine 23-plex panel in a Bio-Plex protein array system (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
