<p>The top hits in the siRNA screen were functionally grouped according to Gene Ontology (GO) terms and functional pathways as clustered by Metacore (Clarivate Analytics) software. The criteria used to identify “disease-related genes” followed the standards of Metacore (Clarivate Analytics) software. Cytoscape (version 3.6.1) with the Enrichment Map application (version 3.1.0) was used for visualization. Interactions among the genes were assessed using the STRING database (
