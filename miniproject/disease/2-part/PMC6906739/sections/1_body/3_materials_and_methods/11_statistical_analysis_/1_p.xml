<p>Differences between two groups were assessed for significance using unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic> tests or the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences among three or more groups were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The log rank test was used for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. Differences associated with a two-tailed 
 <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 and a false-discovery-rate value (
 <italic>q</italic> value) of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.
