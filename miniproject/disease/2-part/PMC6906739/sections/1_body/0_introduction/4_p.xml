<p>In the current study, we used genomewide RNAi screening to identify host genes that influence host cell viability following H5N1 virus infection. The results showed &lt;10% overlap in the candidate host gene targets between H5N1 and the less lethal H1N1 strain. Next, we screened 1,137 critical host genes in RNAi screens using the DrugBank database and identified 372 approved or clinically investigated drugs (with 146 target genes). Validation experiments performed with 104 commercially available drugs (and 65 target genes) identified 28 candidate drugs that significantly increased the viability of H5N1-infected A549 cells. The two most effective drugs among these candidates in a mouse model of H5N1-induced ALI were ifenprodil, an agent with neurological indications, and flavopiridol, an antineoplastic agent.</p>
