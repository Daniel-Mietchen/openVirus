<p>Protein digestion was conducted using the FASP procedure (
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Wisniewski et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, 300 mg of proteins were loaded onto an ultrafiltration filter (30 kDa cutoff; Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) containing 200 µL of UA buffer (8 M urea, 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), centrifuged at 14,000× g for 30 min, and then washed with 200 µL of UA buffer. Then, 100 µL of 50 mM iodoacetamide in UA buffer was subsequently added to the filter to block reduced cysteine residues. The samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and then centrifuged at 14,000× g for 30 min. The filters were washed three times with 100 µL of UA buffer and then centrifuged at 14,000× g for 30 min after each washing step. Next, 100 µL of dissolution buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was added to each filter and then centrifuged at 14,000× g for 30 min, which was repeated three times. The protein suspensions were then digested with 40 µL of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) buffer (6 µg trypsin in 40 µL of dissolution buffer) at 37 °C for 18 h. Finally, the filter unit was transferred to a new tube, and 40 µL of dissolution buffer was added followed by centrifugation at 14,000× g for 30 min. The resulting peptides were collected as a filtrate, and the peptide concentration was analyzed at OD280.
