<p>Three groups were designed: (1) M, mock group (control); (2) V, virus-infected group. They were then inoculated at 3 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 1 h (V), removed, and inoculated with DMEM containing 10% FBS until 12 h post-infection (h.p.i.); and (3) L, lycorine-treated post-viral infected group. After 1 h adsorption of 3 MOI GD178, lycorine was added at 0.52 µM for 12 h.p.i. For each sample, the proteins were diluted in 300 µL of SDT buffer (containing 4% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, and 100 mM DTT, pH 8.0) following a standardized protocol (

Each sample (one µL) was taken and quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method. The remaining lysate was frozen at −80 °C until use.
