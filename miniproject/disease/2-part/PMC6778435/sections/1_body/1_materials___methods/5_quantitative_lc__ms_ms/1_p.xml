<p>The labeled samples were analyzed using the Easy-nLC nanoflow HPLC system connected to the Thermo Scientific™ Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). A total of 1 µg of each sample was loaded onto the Thermo Scientific EASY column (two columns) using an autosampler at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. Sequential separation of peptides on the Thermo Scientific EASY trap column (100 µm × 2 cm, 5 µm, 100 Å, C18) and analytical column (75 µm × 25 cm, 5 µm, 100 Å, C18) was accomplished using a segmented 60 min gradient from 5% to 28% Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 100% ACN) for 40 min followed by 28%–90% Solvent B for 2 min and then 90% Solvent B for 18 min. The column was re-equilibrated to its initial highly aqueous solvent composition before each analysis. The mass spectrometer was operated in a positive ion mode, and MS spectra were acquired over a range of 375–1,500 m/z. The resolving powers of the MS and MS/MS scans at 200 m/z for the fusion were set as 120,000 and 50,000, respectively. The data-dependent mode was top speed, cycle time was 3 s, and ions were fragmented through high energy collisional dissociation. The maximum ion injection times were set at 50 ms for the survey scan and 105 ms for the MS/MS scans, and the automatic gain control target value was set to 4e5 for MS and to 1e5 for MS/MS. The dynamic exclusion duration was 40s.</p>
