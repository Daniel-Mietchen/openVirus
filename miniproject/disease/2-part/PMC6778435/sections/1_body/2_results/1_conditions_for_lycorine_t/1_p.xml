<p>The concentration and exposure time of lycorine were determined to avoid any cytotoxic effects on the host cells and to ensure that the proteome of the host cells reflected the true response to the presence of lycorine. A prior study found through CCK-8 assay that 0.52 µM lycorine is not toxic to cells at 12 h post-infection (h.p.i.) (

Results showed that the earlier lycorine was added, the better effect on viral titers. Therefore, a single replication cycle of influenza virus (12 h.p.i.) within lycorine treatment at 0.52 µM was chosen because it reflects a single viral replication and is a non-toxic concentration of lycorine at the time addition assay. Dose–effect relationship experiments showed that inhibition of lycorine of AIV becomes invalid within high-dose virus (

 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, we ensured that the response of the whole cell proteome is caused by early infection and that the activity of lycorine is effective. Thus, 3 MOI was selected as the minimum infectious dose for a single cycle of viral infection for studying the single viral replication cycle (
