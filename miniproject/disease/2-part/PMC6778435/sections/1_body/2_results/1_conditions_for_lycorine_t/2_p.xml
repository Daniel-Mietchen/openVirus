<p>In this study, we applied a TMT method, which has been widely applied for quantitative proteomic cell biology studies and many model organisms, to explore potent anti-viral agents and different signaling pathways (

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 were discarded. The proteome profiles of mock control and infected cells were compared (V/M) to determine the effects of AIV infection on MDCK cells. Among those protein groups, 1101 proteins were identified, of which 340 DEPs were determined in the V/M group. The proteome profiles of the infected cells and lycorine-treated infected cells were compared to determine the effects of lycorine treatment on the infected cells. A total of 1059 proteins were identified in the V/L group, of which 258 were DEPs. These results indicated wide differences of protein expression in the HPAIV infection and lycorine treatment. Inoculating with HPAIV and lycorine resulted in 691 identified DEPs (76 + 86 + 42 + 54 + 189 + 159 + 85) among the three groups of MDCK cells in response to HPAIV infection and lycorine treatment, as shown in the Venn diagram (
