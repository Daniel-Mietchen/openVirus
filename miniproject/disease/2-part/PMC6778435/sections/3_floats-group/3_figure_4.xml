  <title>Effect of lycorine on viral infection cells. Expression levels of the 71 proteins in the V/M and V/L groups are shown.</title>
  <p>(A) Heat map of co-upregulated proteins in the two groups. Each quantile was separately analyzed for gene ontological pathways and clustered for z transformed p values. (B) Gene Ontology classification of DEPs in co-upregulated proteins of the two groups. (C) Heat map of co-downregulated proteins in the two groups. (D) Gene Ontology classification of DEPs in co-downregulated proteins of the two groups.</p>
