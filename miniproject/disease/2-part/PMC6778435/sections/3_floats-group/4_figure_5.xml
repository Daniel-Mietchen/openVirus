  <title>Western blot analysis demonstrating Nup93 inhibition by lycorine treatment in MDCK cells.</title>
  <p>(A) Lycorine was added at two concentrations (0.26 and 0.52 µM) to uninfected and infected cells until 12 h.p.i.. (B) Semi-quantification of proteins detected by western blot using ImageJ software. Values represent mean ± SD of two representative experiments. (C) Nup93-related pathway maps of differentially abundant proteins involved in RNA transport in KEGG. Green proteins were identified using the TMT approach.</p>
