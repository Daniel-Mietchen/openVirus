<p id="JVEv5-para-0119">The first clinical trial using ZFNs to mutate 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> was reported in 2014 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Results showed that, after analytical treatment interruption (ATI), the viral rebound and set-point correlated with the frequency of 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> mutation in CD4 T cells. Modest improvement of engraftment of modified cells could be achieved by including cyclophosphamide treatment. Despite low numbers of engineered cells in treated patients, improved HIV-1 specific immunity of CCR5-modified cells is likely to provide a survival advantage. However, an important limitation of this approach was that the treatment did not affect viral reservoirs.
