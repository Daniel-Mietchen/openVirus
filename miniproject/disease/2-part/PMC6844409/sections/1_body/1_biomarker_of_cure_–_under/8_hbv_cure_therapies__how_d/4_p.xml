Crucially, there is presently no reliable method to detect cccDNA, the most important indicator of persistent HBV infection. There is, however, consensus that ideal biomarker characteristics for HBV cure should: 1. report on the presence of cccDNA; 2. be non-invasive, e.g. serum derived; 3. be amenable to point of care testing; and 4. be affordable
