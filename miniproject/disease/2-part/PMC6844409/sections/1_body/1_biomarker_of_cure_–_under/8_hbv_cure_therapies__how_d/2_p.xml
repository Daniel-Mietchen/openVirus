<p id="JVEv5-para-0072">John Tavis (Saint Louis University School of Medicine, USA) provided an overview of the issues of assessing the success of HBV cure therapies. A functional HBV cure is a stable state after therapy with sustained loss of HBsAg from blood, with or without seroconversion with the presence of HBs antibodies, and the likely persistence of intrahepatic cccDNA but not in blood. This is thought to indicate sufficient viral immune control to prevent disease progression in the liver, although the virus may re-emerge in the presence of deficient immune control 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A clinical definition of this state is, however, still lacking because of the lack of reliable HBV biomarkers.
