<p id="JVEv5-para-0067">Work presented by Una Oâ€™Doherty (University of Pennsylvania, USA) examined selection pressures driving the HIV-1 provirus decay dynamics in participants on long-term suppressive ART. Current estimates do not distinguish the relative contribution of cell death and clonal expansion to those dynamics. To clarify this question the approach used involved counting clonal proviruses as a single provirus when first detected in longitudinal sampling.</p>
