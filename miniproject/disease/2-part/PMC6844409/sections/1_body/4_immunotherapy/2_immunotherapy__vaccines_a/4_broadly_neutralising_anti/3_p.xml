<p id="JVEv5-para-0133">Katherine Bar (University of Pennsylvania, USA) presented a convincing case for the use of bNAbs in HIV-1 cure-based on pre-clinical and clinical data generated in the short period since the availability of the ‘next-generation’ bNAbs. Their ability to suppress viral replication by neutralisation of cell-free virions, potential for Fc-mediated clearance of virus-infected cells and eliciting of a vaccinal effect through immune complex formation, together with their long half-life and relative safety make them highly attractive compounds for advancing cure strategies
