<p id="JVEv5-para-0157">Maria Pino (Yerkes Primate Center, Emory University, Atlanta, USA) presented a study on the use of fingolimod at the time of ART initiation. This compound is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator used in multiple sclerosis 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0073" ref-type="bibr">[73,74]</xref> that promotes the retention of several types of lymphocytes within lymphoid tissue. Authors used this agent to address whether retaining lymphocytes in LN would enhance contact between infected cells of the reservoirs and cytolytic effectors, and whether they could provide insights into the relative contribution of different sites (peripheral blood versus LN) to the reservoir. Twenty-two rhesus macaques were infected with SIV and started ART 6 weeks later to allow reservoir seeding. Fingolimod was then administered along with ART for more than 8 weeks. In eight of the animals, ART was continued for an additional 10 months when it was interrupted and animals followed to determine time to viral rebound. As expected, fingolimod induced peripheral lymphopenia. Interestingly, this did not influence plasma viremia decay kinetics, suggesting that it is not dependent on CD4 T cell recirculation. A SIV DNA and SIV RNA decline was noted using DNAscope and RNAscope in LN of both fingolimod-treated and ART alone groups. A subset of animals treated with Fingolimod had a slight delay in viral load rebound and lower viral set-point. These findings were associated with lower amounts of SIV DNA in follicular T helper cells. Work to define why there are differences in cell phenotypes is ongoing. These studies may help to identify which features associated with sanctuaries such as tissue localisation, cell type preference and(or) cell subset programming are the most critical barriers to HIV-1 eradication.
