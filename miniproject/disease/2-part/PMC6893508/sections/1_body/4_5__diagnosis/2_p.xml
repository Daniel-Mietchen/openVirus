<p>SBV can be isolated in multiple insect and mammalian cell types such as: BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney), Vero (African green monkey) and KC (
 <italic>Culicoides sonorensis</italic>) cells [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Only mammalian cells are permissive to SBV infection with cytopathic effects. However, virus isolation is not always possible from clinical specimens including blood samples, due to the low viral load in most samples. Real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting the L and S segments of the SBV genome allows sensitive and specific detection of SBV RNA, which is indicative of SBV infection [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The presence of SBV RNA in various organs has been tested by RT-qPCR, but only some of them were determined as positive [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. SBV genomic sequences are readily detected in the cerebrum, spinal cord, placental fluid and umbilical cord of malformed lambs or calves [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The brain stem is also an appropriate sample for the detection of SBV RNA [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].
