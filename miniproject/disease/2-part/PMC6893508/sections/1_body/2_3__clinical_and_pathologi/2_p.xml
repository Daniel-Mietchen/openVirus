<p>At necropsy, hydranencephaly, porencephaly, lissencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebellar and cerebral hypoplasia and micromyelia are commonly observed in the central nervous system (CNS) of SBV-infected young ruminants. Among the microscopic lesions, glial nodules mainly in the mesencephalon and hippocampus of lambs and goats, lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis, as well as neuronal degeneration and necrosis mainly in the brain stem of calves are observed [
