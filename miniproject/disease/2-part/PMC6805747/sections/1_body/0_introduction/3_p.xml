<p>Due to the regional specialty of Yunnan province (neighbour to ‘Golden Triangle’), many injecting drug users (IDUs) existed in Yunnan. One of the most frequent infectious diseases in IDUs was HIV infection; the ratio of HCV is much higher in HIV-infected persons because of their common transmission routes. To investigate the features of HCV genotypes in the HIV-infected population in Yunnan, 202 persons co-infected with HCV and HIV were enrolled for further analysis.</p>
