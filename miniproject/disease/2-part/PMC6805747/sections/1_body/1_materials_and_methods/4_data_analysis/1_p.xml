<p>HCV phylotree was constructed by using MEGA software. The 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> test was used to compare the difference between HIV-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The relationship between HCV genotypes and biochemical features of HCV/HIV co-infected patients was analysed by using the one way analysis of variance test. HIV-viral load was compared between HIV-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected samples by using Student's 
 <italic>t</italic> test (unpaired, two tailed). Correlation matrix was used to analyse the relationship between biochemical features and HIV-viral load in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test was used to calculate the difference of viral load or biochemical features between different age groups (two tailed). The 
 <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered as statistical difference. GraphPad Prism 5 software was used for statistical analysis.
