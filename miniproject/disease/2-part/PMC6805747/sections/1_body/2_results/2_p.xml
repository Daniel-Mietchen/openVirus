<p>A total of 202 HIV patients were identified to be anti-HCV positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, including 161 males and 41 females. All HCV patients were diagnosed as chronic HCV infection by the doctors according to clinical symptoms, biochemical features and the anti-HCV detection results. Approximately 81.19% of HCV patients were infected by IDUs, and it seemed that drug abuse is the main way for HIV/HCV co-infection. The infectious ratio of HCV had a significant difference between HIV patients with IDUs (45.68%, 164/359) and with ST (7.10%, 38/535) (
