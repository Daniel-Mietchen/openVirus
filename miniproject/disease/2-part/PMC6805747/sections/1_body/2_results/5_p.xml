<p>The HIV-viral load did not correlate with biochemical features in total HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Particularly, the HGB level and the numbers of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells were associated with HIV-viral load when we divided all patients into male and female groups (
 <xref rid="tab03" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Positive correlations were identified between the HIV-viral load and the HGB level (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003 in males, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005 in females) or the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 in both males and females). To investigate the effect of age on the correlation between the HIV-viral load and the biochemical features in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, the correlations in different age and gender groups were analysed. The positive correlation (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.045) was identified between the HIV-viral load and the AST level in females with age 21–30. However, a negative correlation was found between the HIV-viral load and the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts in males with age 21–30 (
