  <p>Phylogenetic tree constructed by using 202 HCV strains and 44 reference sequences of HCV. The samples were named by using the cities initials together with numbers: KM for Kunming; XSBN for Xishuangbanna; BS for Baoshan; CX for Chuxiong; DL for Dali; DH for Dehong; HH for Honghe; LC for Linchang; NJ for Nujiang; PE for Puer; QJ for Qujing; WS for Wenshan; YX for Yuxi; ZT for Zhaotong. In total, 44 reference sequences were downloaded from the HCV sequence database (
