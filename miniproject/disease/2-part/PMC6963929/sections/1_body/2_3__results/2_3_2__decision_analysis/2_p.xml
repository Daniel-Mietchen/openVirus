<p>Practically, FMD vaccines need to prevent FMD with a sufficiently high probability. Altering this property then allows the FMD game to resemble that of 
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00181-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. This requires enhancing the payoff of vaccinating by improving vaccine efficacy or reducing infection risk. Subsidizing vaccines to address price constraints may increase uptake, but for FMD, this does not necessarily prevent or stop disease spread. Instead, the assumption of vaccine efficacy may increase vaccination costs if significant barriers to improving vaccine quality exist. Reducing inter-herd contact through restricted animal movements addresses infection risk but the lack of access to markets and constraints on traditional open grazing practices limits implementation in East Africa [
