<p>We use game theory to depict the optimal decisions for vaccination strategies with contrasting assumptions about information pertaining to vaccine quality. Game theory has been applied to model various vaccination decisions for the advantage of demonstrating the complex social dynamics that influence vaccination in a theoretical framework [

 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast to these games that examine differential individual behavior with respect to the evolution of the disease over time, we use a one-shot game to emphasize the role vaccine efficacy and matching play in the decision process. This framework further describes how current circumstances of FMD in East Africa help explain existing findings of low-vaccine uptake [
