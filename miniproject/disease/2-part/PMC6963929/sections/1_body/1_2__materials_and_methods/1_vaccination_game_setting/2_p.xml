<p>Three stylized games outline separate landscapes for the vaccination decision-making process. The first game depicts decisions for an unspecified vaccine with a moderate protection efficacy and cost that closely resembles the vaccination game for seasonal influenza with self-interested individuals [
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The second game adapts the first to apply to commercial livestock vaccination in a developed country context. The third game then depicts the theoretical decision for uptake of an FMD vaccine in East Africa. Minimal reductions in infection risk characterize the FMD vaccine. For each model we assume a simultaneous-move, one-shot game with homogenous information on the economic costs and losses of disease. The players consist of the individual and others in the community. Each player has two strategies, vaccinate or do not vaccinate, with the payoffs corresponding to the economic costs of each decision given the actions of the other player. While we focus on these three games, other games could be used to motivate the subsequent discussion.
