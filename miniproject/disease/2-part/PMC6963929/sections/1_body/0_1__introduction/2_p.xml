<p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) presents a case whereby the decision to vaccinate involves more than individual deterministic preferences, as uncertainty of vaccine efficacy and vaccine matching also play important roles. FMD is a highly contagious, non-zoonotic viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, sheep, and goats [
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Africa, FMD-associated production losses amount to around US$2.3 billion annually [
 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] with the livestock-keeping households directly affected through reduced milk production, lost animal draught power, mortality of young stock, and lost market access [
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar to vaccination for other endemic livestock diseases, vaccination for FMD may help reduce these impacts to improve household income, wealth, and food security [

 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This is particularly relevant given livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately characterized by extreme poverty [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Vaccination for foot-and-mouth disease, along with transnational coordination of policies, contribute to control in South America [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of multiple viral serotypes with evolving sub-types [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], along with limited infrastructural support to monitor and detect outbreaks within an extensive, pastoral and agro-pastoral system [
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] complicates the provision of vaccines in East Africa. The presence of multiple FMD virus types requires either vaccines matched to the circulating virus or sufficiently high potency vaccines to prevent infection [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Besides monovalent vaccines, bivalent vaccines (SAT1 and SAT2) and trivalent vaccines (SATs, O, and A) are used in Africa [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, unlike in South Africa, where vaccination accompanies movement restrictions at the wildlife-livestock interface where FMD has been shown to spread [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in East Africa, inter-herd contacts primarily contribute to transmission [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-08-00181" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From a household perspective, separating livestock to impose vaccination or other control measures, such as that used in southern Africa, unduly burdens the livelihoods of small-scale livestock owners who rely upon moving animals for market access and grazing [
