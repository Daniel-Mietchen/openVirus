<p>Individuals may decide not to employ disease control measures despite availability and public health recommendations due to individual beliefs and perspectives [

The decision to vaccinate affects the vaccinated human/animal and contributes to population immunity by reducing the number of susceptible individuals within the community. In contrast, non-vaccinators can ignite and prolong an outbreak depending on who vaccinates, how many remain unvaccinated, and the transmission dynamics of the disease [

The decision not to vaccinate may be driven by self-interest, information barriers, and the intention to free ride on the protective immunity of others. For human vaccination, concerns for adverse personal side effects can affect adoption [

While the dissonance between public health objectives and individual actions is often attributed to these heterogenous individual factors, the disease characteristics, including the severity and timing of infection, likewise affect the decision by influencing the amount of uncertainty involved in the decision process.
