<p>The potential for human infection by CDV was raised following the reports that CDV can infect monkeys with fatal consequences [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The CDV monkey-BJ01-DV strain was shown to efficiently use both monkey and dog-origin SLAM to infect and replicate in host cells [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Sequence analyses carried out by Bieringer et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] indicated that only one adaptive mutation in the H-protein at position 540 (D540G) was required for adaptation to human SLAM. Sakai et al. have reported that P541S and R519S are also important for adaption to human cells [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Structural modeling indicated that this adaptive mutation in H reflects the sequence alteration from canine to human SLAM at position 70 and 71 from Pro to Leu (P70L) and Gly to Glu (G71E), and compensates for the gain of a negative charge in the human SLAM molecule. This analysis indicates that only a minimal alteration is required for human adaptation [
