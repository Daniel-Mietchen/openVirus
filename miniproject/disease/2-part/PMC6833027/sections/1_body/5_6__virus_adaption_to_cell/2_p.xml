<p>Specific sites in the H protein of all morbilliviruses are conserved to facilitate efficient SLAM binding [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A study by Nikolin et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] showed changes in the SLAM receptor binding site on H with adaption to non-canine species and correlated with functional receptor binding assays. Comparison in the current analysis of the H SLAM binding site of all available strains, including monkey and PDV isolates, shows that at this site all the Serengeti isolates have a valine rather than isoleucine found in the other CDV stains. At residue 530, hyena 1 has a glycine (in common with some other dog strains and monkey-adapted CDV) rather than aspartic acid in the other Serengeti isolates. At amino acid 327 the Serengeti isolates all have leucine rather than aspartic acid. At residue 375 all Serengeti isolates have a glutamine rather than lysine (
