<p>Cases of distemper due to vaccine administration have been documented in dogs globally, but evidence is often inconclusive due to lack of molecular testing in older studies. The propensity of the Rockborn vaccine strain, (which was attenuated from a virus isolated in 1950s Sweden), to revert to virulence, was initially established by Appel in 1978 [

 <sup>.</sup> In 1982â€“83, cases of post-vaccinal encephalitis were recorded in dogs in various parts of Britain after the administration of a particular batch of combined distemper/hepatitis vaccine. Detailed investigations of one of these cases revealed that the Rockborn CDV component was responsible, and the vaccine virus was recovered from the brain of the affected dog [
