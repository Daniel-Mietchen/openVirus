<p>There was a mass mortality event in crab eater seals in 1955 in the Prince Gustav Channel, which is bounded on the west by the Antarctic Peninsula, and on the east by James Ross Island. Animals had lesions similar to CDV, but no serology is available for confirmation [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As Antarctica has no terrestrial carnivores, it was suggested that Greenland sledge dogs, used in Antarctica before effective CDV vaccines were available, may have transmitted the disease to seals. However, Antarctic seals are known to travel further afield to South America, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, and so they could have become infected in one or more of these locations [
