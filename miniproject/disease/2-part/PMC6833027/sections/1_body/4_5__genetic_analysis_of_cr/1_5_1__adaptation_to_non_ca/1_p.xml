<p>Analysis of genetic data of isolates provides a means to help inform our understanding of cross species transmission, as well as the role of specific mutations in virus pathogenicity. Molecular analysis of the H and P genes of isolates from the 1993 Serengeti outbreak were previously made by Carpenter et al. [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These studies indicated genetic clustering within the geographical area rather than within a host species. We have also carried out a sequencing analysis of the H and P genes from five CDV isolates out of four animal species from the Serengeti outbreak in 1993/1994 (
