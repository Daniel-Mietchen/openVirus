<p>The data suggest that on some occasions the virus may have acquired mutations in the P/V/C sequences related to increased virulence on passage through various host species, but experimental evidence will be required to substantiate this. The presence of residues in all the Serengeti isolates, which the analysis indicates may be important markers of virus virulence in wildlife, are also present in Vaccine X. These sites as a prediction of pathogenicity are not the same as those suggested in experimental studies in ferrets [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], as the potential virulence-associated changes in the latter are not reflected in wildlife CDV strains. Although a lion CDV strain was previously shown to be virulent in ferrets [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00944" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], this species is highly sensitive to CDV, and therefore unlikely to reflect pathogenicity in lions and other wildlife. Unfortunately, confirmation of new virulence-related mutations by comparing the P/V/C sequences of the Serengeti isolates with those of viruses giving rise to the ‘silent’ infections in lions, cannot be made.
