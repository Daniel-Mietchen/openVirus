<p>The predictability of relative epidemic sizes for each virus type using epidemic data from early phases of the influenza season has been explored using state-specific datasets from the United States [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, this has not been investigated in other settings. Data from a single country reflect climatologically-diverse dynamics [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and surveillance data are collected from various geographic units [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In line with this, Japan has continuously implemented so called virus surveillance as well as sentinel influenza surveillance [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Virus surveillance can detect virus types and subtypes over time whereas sentinel surveillance collects notifications of influenza diagnoses from physicians at designated health care facilities. In Japan, most notified cases (but not cases of influenza-like illness) undergo rapid diagnostic testing (RDT). This detects influenza virus (with virus typing information) from nasopharyngeal swabs on bedside, including at outpatient settings, and those with positive results are notified. Even excluding the latest pandemic year (2009), the continual surveillance system provides an opportunity to examine the interaction among influenza virus types and subtypes.
