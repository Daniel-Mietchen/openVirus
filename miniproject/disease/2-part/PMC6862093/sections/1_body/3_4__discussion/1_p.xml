<p>In the present study, we explored seasonal influenza epidemic data in Japan from 2010 to 2019, combining sentinel and virus surveillance data for a total of nine epidemic seasons. We investigated statistical interactions between different influenza virus types during the course of and at the end of epidemics. We revealed that the cumulative incidence of the index virus was negatively correlated with both the dynamic cumulative incidence of the complementary viruses around the peak week and the entire epidemic size of the complementary viruses. Specifying the index virus type in a single influenza season, this index virus was found to be predictable using a simple linear regression model, mostly before observing the epidemic peak. The timing of the epidemic peak was also examined across different types of influenza virus. We did not identify interacting timing between influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, and the peak timing was likely different when comparing influenza type A and B viruses (type A virus tended to precede type B).</p>
