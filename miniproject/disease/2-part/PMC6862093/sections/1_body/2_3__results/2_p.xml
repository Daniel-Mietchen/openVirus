The index virus first reached its own threshold value in four seasons (2010–2011, 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2018–2019) for influenza A/H1N, in five seasons (2011–2012, 2012–2013, 2014–2015, 2016–2017, and 2018–2019) for influenza A/H3N2, and in two seasons (2015–2016 and 2017–2018) for influenza B. In these seasons, we observed large epidemics of the index virus type. Prediction of the epidemic size of the season was mostly attained in or before the same week as the epidemic peak except in the 2012–2013 season for influenza A/H1N1 and the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 seasons for influenza A/H3N2 and B. Details of the prediction timing and the peak timing of the epidemic are shown in
