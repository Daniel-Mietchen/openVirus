<p>We used existing methods introduced by Goldstein et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in a study conducted in the United States. To assess the interaction of epidemic sizes among the three influenza viruses, we used the Spearman rank-order method to explore the correlation between the epidemic size and cumulative complementary incidence, up to a specific week. We investigated not only the dynamic interactions but also the correlation of epidemic sizes among the different virus types. We examined the Spearman rank correlation between the cumulative incidence of the index virus and that of the complementary viruses.
