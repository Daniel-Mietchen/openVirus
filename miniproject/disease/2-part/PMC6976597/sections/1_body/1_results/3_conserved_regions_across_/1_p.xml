<p id="Par9">To deduce the possibility of autoimmune reactions involved in mediating post alphaviral polyarthralgia through the presence of molecular mimics, we performed a sequence similarity search between the conserved regions among arthritogenic alpha viruses and the human proteome using the standard BLASTp program. Each of the 41 conserved regions was scanned against the human proteome. Very interestingly, 24 regions showed varying degrees of homology (52.7% to 100%) with human proteins that have been implicated in arthritis like conditions in humans (TableÂ
