<p id="Par13">The docked p-MHC complexes were analyzed for the hydrogen bonding interactions between the peptides and HLA-DRB1. The binding interactions between the viral and human peptide with HLA-DRB1 were visualized using LigPlot+. Post docking analysis of the peptides revealed significant interactions with HLA-DRB1. In viral peptide-HLA-DRB1 complex, ten hydrogen bonds within a distance of 3.5 Å suggested the stability of the peptide in the binding groove of the pocket. Similarly, a set of eleven hydrogen bonds were formed between human peptide and HLA-DRB1 within a distance of 3.5 Å. Furthermore, it can be seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> that the amino acids in the conserved regions of both the peptides form identical hydrogen bonds with the amino acids (Ser51, Asn260, Lys249, Trp235, Asn67, Tyr 208) present in the binding pocket of HLA-DRB1.
