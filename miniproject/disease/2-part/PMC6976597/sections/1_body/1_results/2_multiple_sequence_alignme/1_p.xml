<p id="Par7">Alphaviral infections share a common feature of inducing RA like conditions, but the commonality in the alphaviruses leading to such a rheumatic outcome is not known. We hypothesized that the commonality could lie in the structural polyprotein of these viruses. Therefore, we have analyzed the structural polyproteins of six arthritogenic alpha viruses for the presence of conserved regions amongst them. As described in the methods section, amino acid sequences of the structural polyproteins of CHIKV, RRV, SFV, ONV, BFV and Mayaro virus were retrieved from UniProt database and subsequently multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE. Conserved regions identified are shown in Supplementary Fig.
