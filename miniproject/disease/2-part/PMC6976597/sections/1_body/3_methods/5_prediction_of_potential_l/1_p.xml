<p id="Par28">Shortlisted conserved regions from the structural polyprotein were explored for their ability to act as B cell epitopes. Full length amino acid sequence of structural polyprotein of Chikungunya virus (strain S27-African prototype) (UniProt ID: Q8JUX5) was subjected to linear B cell epitope prediction analysis available at Immune epitope database (IEDB)
