 </sup> server to evaluate the similarity in binding patterns among a conserved region in the alphavirus structural polyprotein and its corresponding homologous region in the human protein. GalaxyPepDock works by identifying templates from experimentally resolved structure databases to predict the protein structure, followed by an energy-based optimization to provide structural flexibility. Default parameters available with the tool have been used and the back-end data containing the parameters used for docking are not available. Crystal structure of HLA-DRB1 complexed with Type II collagen peptide (PDB ID: 6BIN) was retrieved from Protein Data Bank database

 </sup>. The resident peptide in the crystal structure was stripped off using PyMol to make the binding groove of HLA-DRB1 available for docking the viral peptide and its human homologue.
