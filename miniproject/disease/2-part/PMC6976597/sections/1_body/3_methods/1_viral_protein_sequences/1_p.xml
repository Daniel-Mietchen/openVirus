Structural polyproteins of the six arthritogenic alphaviruses: Chikungunya virus (strain S2-African prototype)(UniProt ID: Q8JUX5), the Ross river virus (strain NB5092) (UniProt ID: P13890), the Semliki forest virus (UniProt ID: P03315), the Mayaro virus (strain Brazil) (UniProt ID: Q8QZ72), the O’nyong-nyong virus (strain SG650) (UniProt ID: O90369) and the Barmah forest virus (UniProt ID: P89946) were investigated for the presence of conserved regions. Amino acid sequences of these proteins were retrieved from the UniProt database
