<p id="Par20">In the present work, through an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis we have identified the presence of conserved regions in the structural polyprotein of alphaviruses. A high sequence identity (71%) suggests that the origin of commonality in the clinical features may lie in the amino acid sequence of the structural polyprotein of the viruses. On comparative analysis of these regions of consensus with the human proteome, we have identified proteins that share stretches of homologous regions with the structural polyprotein. Further, very interestingly we found that presence of auto antibodies specific to some of these proteins in rheumatoid arthritis (TableÂ
