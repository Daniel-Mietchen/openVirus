<p id="Par18">Viral infection as one of the etiological agents for autoimmune diseases is being discussed for a long time. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon including molecular mimicry, bystander activation and viral persistence

 </sup> individually or in multiple combinations to account for the immunopathology observed at the site of infection and/or sites of autoimmune disease and normally the infections precede the occurrence of inflammation in the target organ

 </sup>. Triggered immune response as result of infection is critical for viral clearance. However, in some instances, immune regulatory mechanisms may aberrate, leading to the breakdown of self-tolerance, resulting in immune-mediated attack directed against both viral and self-antigens as it happens in the case of molecular mimicry or shared homology between viral and host epitopes
