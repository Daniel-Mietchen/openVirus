Criteria used for analyzing and short listing peptide sequences have been explained clearly in materials and methods section. Most of the softwares used for HLA class II-peptide binding prediction and B cell epitope prediction are also available on the public domain and have been referenced accordingly. Protein structures used are from protein data bank and the relevant literature has been cited wherever appropriate. The other raw datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. We declare that we will be fully willing to comply with the journal policy and will be able to make any materials/data available required for the review process and thereafter.</p>
