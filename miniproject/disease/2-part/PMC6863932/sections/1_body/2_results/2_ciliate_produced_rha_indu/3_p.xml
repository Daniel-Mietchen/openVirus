<p>The quality of the antibody response was assessed by HAI assay at week 8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). An HAI response against B/Bri was detectable after i.m. route of immunization, but not after s.c. route. Likewise, B/Bri neutralizing antibodies were detectable after i.m. immunization with the ciliate derived rHA (
