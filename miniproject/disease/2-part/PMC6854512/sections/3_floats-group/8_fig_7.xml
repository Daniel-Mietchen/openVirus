  <p>MAGT1 and TUSC3 were required for the full glycosylation of LASV GP. Genotypes of

   <sup>–</sup> cells (B), as determined by Sanger sequencing of genomic PCR products. WT cells were also sequenced as a reference. The PAM sequence and sgRNA targeting gene exons are shown in yellow boxes. Putative cleavage sites of Cas9 are also indicated by arrows. Mutations of knockout cells are listed at the bottom. Only cells displaying frameshift mutations were chosen as candidate knockout cell lines. Although HEK293T cells have seven copies of the 
   <italic>MAGT1</italic> gene and two copies of the 
   <italic>TUSC3</italic> gene, the observed number of alleles for 
   <italic>MAGT1</italic> and 
   <italic>TUSC3</italic> could be less than their copy numbers. (C) Expression and glycosylation profiles of LASV GP in infected

   <sup>–</sup> cells or WT cells as a control. Cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01 were harvested at 36 hpi and subjected to Western blot analysis with GP2-specific serum. Knockouts of 
   <italic>MAGT1</italic> and 
   <italic>TUSC3</italic> were confirmed by their specific antibodies. NP, STT3A, and STT3B were also detected. GAPDH was detected as a loading control for each lane. Hypoglycosylation of viral glycoprotein is indicated by red triangles. Supernatant viral titers derived from different cell lines were determined by the immunological plaque assay. The data presented here represent the means ± the SD of three independent experiments, and each independent experiment had two replicates.
