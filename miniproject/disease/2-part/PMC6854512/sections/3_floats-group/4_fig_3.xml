  <p>Confirmation of the interactions between LASV GP and subunits of the OST complex by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. HEK293T cells were transfected with a pCAGGs plasmid encoding Twin-Strep-tagged LASV GP or GFP, and at 48 h posttransfection the cells were harvested and lysed at 4°C. LASV GP and GFP were pulled down from the cell lysates by magnetic Sepharose beads coated with Strep-Tactin XT as bait (Input). Purified bead fractions were screened for endogenous STT3A (A) and STT3B (B) by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to human STT3A and STT3B, respectively. (C to H) A pCAGGs plasmid encoding V5-tagged RPN1, RPN2, OSTC, or DDOST; 6×His-tagged MAGT1; or Flag-tagged TUSC3 was cotransfected into HEK293T cells with a plasmid expressing LASV GP or GFP. Purified bead fractions were screened for RPN1 (C), RPN2 (D), OSTC (E), DDOST (F), MAGT1 (G), and TUSC3 (H) by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibodies specific to the V5 (RPN1, RPN2, OSTC, and DDOST), 6×His (MAGT1) or Flag (TUSC3) epitopes. LASV GP and GFP were detected by an anti-Strep antibody (A to H, left). GAPDH was also detected as a control of cell lysate input and bead fraction output (A to H, bottom). Bands indicating specific interactions between LASV GP and the OST subunits are marked with a red star. Note that some of the OST subunits were found to migrated into diffused bands and formed high-molecular-weight aggregates in the SDS-PAGE gels. LASV GP but not the control GFP was able to pull down all of the subunits identified in our MS data set.</p>
