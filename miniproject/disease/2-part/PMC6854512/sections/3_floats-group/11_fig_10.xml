  <p>The preferential requirement for STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation was conserved among arenavirus GPs. pCAGGs plasmids encoding Strep-tagged glycoproteins of four OW arenaviruses (A) and two NW arenaviruses (B) or VSV-G, influenza A virus HA, and HIV-1 GP160 (C) were transfected into

   <sup>–</sup>, and WT cells. Cells were harvested at 24 h posttransfection and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies specific to the Strep epitope. Hypoglycosylation patterns of virus glycoprotein are indicated by red triangles. GAPDH was also detected as a loading control for each lane.

(E) The supernatant virus titers and viral RNA copy numbers of the LCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC viruses in HEK293T cells treated with the indicated concentrations of NGI-1. DMSO was added as a control. Viral titers of &lt;10 PFU/ml were considered undetected and are marked with a red number sign (“#”). (F) Viral foci were observed by fluorescence microscopy at 36 hpi in cells infected with the rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP) and rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP)/MACV GPC viruses. The viral foci in OST-knockout cells, especially in
