<p>We found that knockout of 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> caused hypoglycosylation of viral GPC, while knockout of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> did not have such an effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), suggesting a preferential requirement for the STT3B isoform in the glycosylation of LASV GP. This result shows characteristics that differ from those of flavivirus, since DENV NS1 and NS4B were shown to be fully glycosylated in STT3A or STT3B knockout cells (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), and only simultaneous knockdown of STT3A and STT3B causes a major glycosylation defect of NS1 (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Different dependencies of STT3A and STT3B for N-glycosylation were also found in VSV-G, influenza HA, and HIV-1 GP160 proteins, indicating the diverse mechanisms of modification utilized by different viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10C</xref>). Nevertheless, both STT3A and STT3B were shown to be directly or indirectly required for the formation of infectious rLCMV/LASV GPC viruses but did not significantly influence the number of progeny viruses released (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>). Virions released from 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells showed reduced incorporation of GPs into virion particles and a partly reduced binding ability to normal permissive cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, was able to strongly inhibit virus propagation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>) by affecting virus infectivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>) without resulting in significant cytotoxicity. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of the host OST complex by NGI-1 may provide a useful treatment option to efficiently inhibit virus spread and reduce the fatality rate caused by Lassa fever in the future.
