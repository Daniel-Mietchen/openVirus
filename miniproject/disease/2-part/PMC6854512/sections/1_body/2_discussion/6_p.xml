<p>The OST complex utilizes dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (OS-PP-Dol) as donor substrates for the N-linked glycosylation of asparagine residues in the N-X-T/S consensus sites of newly synthesized proteins (

The STT3B-OST complex is substantially more active and shows a reduced ability to discriminate different oligosaccharide structures; in contract, the STT3A-OST complex is extremely selective and preferentially glycosylates nascent proteins with the fully assembled Glc

 <sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is interesting to associate this distinct substrate-selective characteristic of STT3A and STT3B with the recently reported glycan heterogeneity of LASV GP. Analysis of the LASV glycome composition by hydrophilic interaction chromatography ultraperformance liquid chromatography revealed that the virus possesses an abundance of underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans, which form punctuated clusters to shield the proteinous surface from the humoral immune response (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). It remains unknown whether the site-specific heterogeneity of virion surface glycans has any relevance to the preferential utilization of host OST isoforms by viruses during the glycosylation process. Further studies are needed to deeply elucidate the physiological significance of this host glycosylation strategy utilized by arenaviruses.
