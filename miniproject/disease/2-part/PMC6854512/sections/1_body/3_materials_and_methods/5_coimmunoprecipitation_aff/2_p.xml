<p>For AP-MS, an innovative in-bead digestion strategy was used to obtain the highest yield. Briefly, washed beads were resuspended in 100 μl of distilled water and then reduced in 2 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) at 56°C for 30 min, followed by alkylation in 5 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Then, 0.5 μg of sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) was added, and the mix was incubated overnight at 37°C. The resulting peptides were separated from the beads by a magnetic rack and subjected to desalination and concentration by C
 <sub>18</sub> bonded Solid Phase Extraction Disks (Empore). Purified peptides were then subjected to electrospray ionization, followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection, as described previously (

The obtained raw MA spectra were subjected to analysis by ProteinPilot version 5.0 for peptide sequence identification against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded in 2017), which was set to human species restricted. The threshold value of the false discovery rate (FDR) was set to &lt;0.05.
