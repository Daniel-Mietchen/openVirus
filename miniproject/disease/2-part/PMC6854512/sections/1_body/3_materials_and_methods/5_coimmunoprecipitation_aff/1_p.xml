<p>For AP-MS, 5.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells preseeded in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid encoding LASV GP with a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag or an equal amount of plasmid encoding the single Twin-Strep-tag as a control using the cationic polymer polyethylenimine. For coimmunoprecipitation, plasmids encoding the OST subunits were cotransfected into HEK293T cells with Twin-Strep-tagged LASV GP or GFP as a control bait. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were collected and washed with prechilled PBS by low-speed centrifugation. The cells were then lysed in 500 μl of prechilled lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% NP-40, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]; pH 8.0) for 1 h and cleared by centrifugation at 4°C for 20 min at 13,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>. The supernatant was incubated with 60 μl of MagStrep XT beads overnight at 4°C. Then, the beads were washed with prechilled wash buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20) three times. For coimmunoprecipitation, purified bead fractions were eluted by buffer BXT, and eluates were subjected to Western blot analysis.
