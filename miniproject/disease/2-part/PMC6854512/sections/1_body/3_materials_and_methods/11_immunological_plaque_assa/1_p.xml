<p>BHK-21 cells preseeded in 24-well plates were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus. After incubation for 1 h, viral supernatants were discarded, and DMEM containing 1.1% sodium carboxymethylcellulose and 2% FBS was added to the cells. At 48 h postinfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized, and blocked in 5% defatted milk containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (dissolved in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the cells were incubated with anti-NP serum (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature or 4°C overnight. Then, the plates were washed extensively in wash buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) three times for 5 min each, followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed three more times, and viral plaques were stained using an enhanced HRP-DAB chromogenic substrate kit (Tiangen Biotech, China). Viral titers were determined based on the number of PFU.</p>
