<p>RNA was extracted from cells and supernatants with a total RNA kit and a viral RNA kit (Omega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Japan) and random primers. Specifically, S genome (+) cDNA of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus was synthesized using a genome-specific primer (GTACAAGCGCTCACAGACCT) to distinguish from the S antigenome (–) or viral mRNA. qRT-PCR was performed using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Japan) and the following gene-specific primer pairs: S genome (+) (forward, GTACAAGCGCTCACAGACCT; reverse, GTTACCCCCATCCAACAGGG) and GAPDH (forward, AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG; reverse, AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC). For supernatant viral RNAs, the absolute quantity of the viral S genome was determined by performing a standard curve experiment using an S genome-encoding plasmid as a standard sample. For cellular RNAs, the relative quantity of the viral S genome was determined by performing a comparative
