<p>Recombinant LCMV (ARM strain) expressing LASV and MACV GPs (rLCMV/LASV GPC and rLCMV/MACV GPC viruses) were generated by reverse genetic techniques, as previously reported (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Briefly, we constructed plasmids containing full-length antigenomic cDNA of the LCMV (ARM strain) L and S segments (or an S segment in which NP was linked with GFP via a P2A self-cleaving peptide sequence) flanked by a T7 promoter in their 5′ termini and a hepatitis delta riboenzyme sequence in their 3′ termini, respectively. Then, LCMV GP was replaced by LASV GP (Josiah strain) or MACV GP (Carvallo strain) using PCR and an In-Fusion HD cloning kit (TaKaRa). The two plasmids were cotransfected into T7 RNA polymerase stably expressing cells (BSR-T7) to direct the intracellular synthesis of viral L and S RNA antigenomes and the initial translation of NP and LP. Four days after transfection, the initially rescued viruses were transferred into BHK-21 cells for further amplification.
