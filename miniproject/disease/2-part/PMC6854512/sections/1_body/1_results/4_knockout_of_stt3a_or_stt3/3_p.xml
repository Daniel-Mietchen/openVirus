 <sup>–</sup> cells may have reduced viral infectivity. We calculated the ratio of viral titers to viral genome RNA copy numbers in the supernatant as an indicator of viral infectivity. As shown in

 <sup>–</sup> or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> knockout cells exhibited reduced viral infectivity. Viral infectivity was further visualized by the infection of a rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP)/LASV GPC virus, in which LCMV NP was linked with GFP by a P2A self-cleaving peptide. Cells infected with the rLCMV (NP-P2A-GFP)/LASV GPC virus were immobilized, and viral foci were observed at different time points. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, knockout of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> did not reduce the number of viral foci; however, the viral foci in 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells, suggesting reduced virus infectivity. Based on these results, we concluded that the inhibited propagation of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus by the knockout of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> was mainly due to the reduced viral infectivity.
