<p>Since knockout of STT3A or STT3B had no significant effects on the replication of the rLCMV/LASV GPC genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), we tested whether knockout of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> affected the release of viral particles. To this end, 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells were infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC, and both intracellular and supernatant viral genomes were measured by qRT-PCR at 48 hpi. The ratio of the supernatant viral genome level versus the intracellular viral genome level was calculated as an indicator of virus budding ability. Knockout of STT3A or STT3B had no significant effect on virus budding ability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting that 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> did not affect viral release. Although the absolute viral genome levels were partly reduced in 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells, the extent of reduction (&lt;2-fold) was insufficient to explain the dramatic reduction in viral titers in the supernatants (&gt;30-fold reduction, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).
