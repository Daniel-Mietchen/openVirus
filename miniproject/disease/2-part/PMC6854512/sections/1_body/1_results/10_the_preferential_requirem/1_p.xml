<p>Arenavirus GPs are all highly glycosylated. We next sought to explore whether the preferential requirement for STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation is conserved among other arenaviruses. Plasmids encoding GPs of OW arenaviruses, including LCMV, Mopeia virus (MOPV), Lujo virus (LUJV), and Dandenong virus (DNAV) (
