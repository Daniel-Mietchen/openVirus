<p>To test whether STT3A and STT3B can affect the infectivity of other arenaviruses, two other viruses, LCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC, were chosen as representatives of OW and NW arenaviruses to explore their propagation in

 <sup>–</sup>, and WT cells. Cells were infected with viruses and harvested at 36 hpi. Supernatant viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers were determined by the immunological plaque assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10D</xref>, both the titers and the RNA copy numbers of the LCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC viruses were reduced in the three OST-knockout cells, demonstrating the impaired propagation of both viruses. Even so, the viral RNA copy numbers were reduced less than the viral titers, especially for the rLCMV/MACV GPC virus, indicating that virus infectivity was affected, which is in line with that of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus. NGI-1 was also able to severely reduce the viral titers, whereas viral RNA copy numbers were only mildly reduced (
