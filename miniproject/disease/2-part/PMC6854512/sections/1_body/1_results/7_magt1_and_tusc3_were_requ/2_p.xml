<p>We then sought to explore the roles of MAGT1 and TUSC3 in virus propagation. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of 
 <italic>MAGT1</italic> and 
 <italic>TUSC3</italic> cell lines were constructed (
 <italic>MAGT1</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> and 
 <italic>TUSC3</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells) as described above and confirmed by sequencing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>) and Western blot analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). The expression levels of both MAGT1 and TUSC3 were also decreased in 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells, indicating that their expression relies on the existence of STT3B. Although virus titers were partly reduced in 
 <italic>MAGT1</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> and 
 <italic>TUSC3</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells compared to that in WT cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>, right), glycosylation of LASV GP was not significantly altered in these two cells. The inefficiency of functional knockout might be explained by the functional compensation between the two proteins. The level of TUSC3 in WT cells was almost undetectable by Western blotting, while a deficiency of MAGT1 was accompanied by obviously increased expression of TUSC3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>, lanes 1 and 5). To confirm this finding, the 
 <italic>MAGT1</italic>
 <sup>–</sup>
 <italic>TUSC3</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cell line was constructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Both 
 <italic>MAGT1</italic>
 <sup>–</sup>
 <italic>TUSC3</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells were then infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus, and we observed the same hypoglycosylation pattern of viral GP in the two cells compared to the glycosylation pattern in WT cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>), indicating that MAGT1 or TUSC3 was required for full viral GP glycosylation. The virus titer derived from 
 <italic>MAGT1</italic>
 <sup>–</sup>
 <italic>TUSC3</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells was also dramatically reduced compared to that derived from WT cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Similarly, the viral foci in 
 <italic>MAGT1</italic>
 <sup>–</sup>
 <italic>TUSC3</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), as in 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells.
