<p>To functionally annotate interactors, 591 host proteins identified here were submitted to Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary Relationship (PANTHER) to perform gene ontology (GO) analysis (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and Table S1 in the supplemental material, 591 proteins were clustered into 22 groups based on the cellular components, demonstrating the extensive cellular distribution of LASV GP interactors. Multiple proteins were clustered into compartments of the host secretory system, such as the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane. Interactors residing in these cellular components might participate in the maturation process of LASV GP and thus affect viral replication.
