<p>To verify the interactions between LASV GP and the OST subunits identified here, coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses were performed. Twin-Strep-tagged LASV GP with its associated proteins was purified from cell lysates. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged with a Twin-Strep-tag was also set as the control bait. Endogenous STT3A and STT3B or exogenously expressed RPN1, RPN2, OSTC, and DDOST/OST48 were detected in the GP fraction but not in the GFP-purified fraction (

Most of the OST subunits (excluding DDOST) migrated into diffused bands and formed high-molecular-weight aggregates, probably because of stable associations with other subunits of the OST complex. We also compared our data set to a previous interactome of LCMV GP and found that 127 proteins were common (Table S1) (

These results suggested a high confidence level of our interactome results and confirmed that LASV GP interacted specifically with the host OST complex.
