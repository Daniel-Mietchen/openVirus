<p>To explore whether the reduced GP levels in virions derived from 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> or 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells affect virus infection, the binding abilities of these virions were tested. Genome RNA-normalized virions derived from different cells were added to BHK-21 cells, and the virus binding ability was measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>, virions derived from 
 <italic>STT3A</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic>
 <sup>–</sup> cells exhibited a partial defect in their ability to attach to normal BHK-21 cells. Based on these results, we concluded that knockout of 
 <italic>STT3A</italic> and 
 <italic>STT3B</italic> reduced the level of GP incorporated into viral particles and hindered the ability of the virus to bind permissive cells.
