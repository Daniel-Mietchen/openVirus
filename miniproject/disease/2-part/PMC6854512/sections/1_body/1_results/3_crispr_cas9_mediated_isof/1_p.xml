<p>The GPs of arenaviruses are highly glycosylated (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and the absence of even a single GP glycosylation site could globally attenuate the arenavirus 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). We hypothesized that the OST complex is central to GP modification and might therefore play a vital role in virus propagation. Because of partly redundant functions of the two isoforms in N-linked glycosylation, most glycoproteins in host cells can be modified by both OST isoforms except for a few special proteins that are preferentially modified by either STT3A or STT3B (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). STT3A and STT3B also display distinct enzymatic properties, and differential utilization of the two isoforms may represent distinct glycosylation patterns (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It remains unknown whether the glycosylation of LASV GP requires both OST isoforms.
