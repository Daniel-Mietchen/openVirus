<p id="Par30">YFV (vaccine strain 17DD), MAYV (Strain BeAr20290), CHIKV (Genotype ECSA – Strain BHI3762/H804917, kindly provided by Dr. Maurício Lacerda Nogueira), VACV group I (Isolate Caragola eye I), VACV group II (Isolate Caragola eye II), and CPXV (strain Brighton Red) were individually multiplied in Vero cells in MEM that contained 1–2.5% FBS, 0.25 μg/mL amphotericin B, 100 U/mL penicillin 100 U/mL (Schering-Plough, Brazil), and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a large 175 cm
 <sup>2</sup> bottle. Subsequently, for YFV, MAYV, and CHIKV, the cell infection supernatant was transferred to tubes and centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 5 min. The clarified supernatants from these centrifugations were stored at − 70 °C. VACV and CPXV were purified on a sucrose gradient as previously described [
