This method, from an educational perspective, combines hands-on experience with a classroom virology course to allow the instructor to expand the students (and her/his own) knowledge. Thus, the purpose of our “Virus Goes Viral” kit was to explore the revolutionary aspect of giant viruses and also the classically explored aspects of animal virus interactions with cell lines and integrate them into the study of virology.
