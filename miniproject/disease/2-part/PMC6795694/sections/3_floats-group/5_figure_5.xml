  <p>HA stalk-based approaches. Influenza HA comprises two functionally distinct domains; globular head and stalk. The globular head is variable among the viruses and immunologically dominant and, thus, the majority of neutralizing antibodies are directed to the head that harbors the receptor-binding site (RBS). The stalk is conserved and, therefore, stalk antibodies show broad protection against diverse strains within a group. However, the stalk is immunologically subdominant because of the physical shielding by the bulky head and the close proximity to the viral membrane. To preferably induce the broadly protective stalk-reactive antibodies, two vaccine approaches were designed; chimeric HA and headless HA. Chimeric HA consists of stalk domain derived from important target strains such as H1, H3, or B viruses fused with head domain from irrelevant avian strains such as H5, H6, or H8. Multiple immunizations with different chimeric HAs selectively increase stalk antibodies. Headless HA (stalk-only HA) lacking the head domain can induce only stalk antibodies through multiple vaccinations. Hyperglycosylation in antigenic sites in head domain results in the redirection of antibody responses toward stalk domain. The HA structure was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (HA of A/swine/Iowa/15/1930, PDB ID 1RUY) and the final image was produced by PyMOL program).</p>
