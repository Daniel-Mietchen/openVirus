  <p>Major principles of developing a UIV. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Induction of broadly protective antibodies specific to conserved regions in the HA stalk or head, NA, or M2e has been extensively investigated. The antibodies bind to viral surface proteins either on virion or expressed on virus-infected cell membrane. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognizing the conserved epitopes of influenza internal proteins such as NP, M1, or PB1 has been shown to be critical for broad protection through the clearance of the virus-infected cells.
