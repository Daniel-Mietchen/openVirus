<p>A number of alternative strategies are being investigated for their potential to serve as a UIV platform. First approach is to use infection-competent but replication-defective viruses. For instance, the M2 knock-out influenza virus (M2SR) rescued from M2-producing cells is able to infect cells but does not produce progeny virus due to the lack of functional M2 protein. The M2SR was shown to induce strong cell-mediated and humoral immunity and to provide broad protection against both homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenge in mice and ferrets (Sarawar et al.,

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A conceptually similar to M2SR, PB2 knock-out influenza virus could be produced in PB2-expressing cells as a vaccine. The protection efficacy of PB2-KO vaccine was tested against diverse influenza strains in mice (Victor et al.,

 <xref rid="B233" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ui et al., 
 <xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Pseudotyped influenza A virus also presents a similar replication-incompetent virus approach. The pseudotyped influenza virus lacking HA produced in HA-expressing cells can infect cells and express all the viral proteins except for HA. Studies have shown that the vaccination of mice and ferrets with the pseudotyped influenza virus generated a vigorous T cell response and reduced lung viral loads and weight loss after challenge with homologous and heterologous influenza viruses (Powell et al., 
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Baz et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These approaches based on replication-defective viruses should be rigorously evaluated for safety, considering potential reversion into virulence by acquiring the wild type gene by reassortment with circulating viruses (Lowen,
