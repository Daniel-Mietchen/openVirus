<p>Many strategies have been undertaken on the pursuit of developing a universal influenza vaccine (UIV) (Paules et al., 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The induction of cross-protective immune responses directed toward conserved B cell or T cell epitopes is a major principle underlying broad protection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The direct binding of antibodies to the viral surface proteins interferes with their functions and results in virus neutralization before cell entry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Alternatively, the antibodies may bind to viral antigens displayed on the surface of virus-infected cells and mediate effector functions to remove the infected cells. A cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) can kill the virus-infected cells in an independent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Several conserved viral antigens such as M2 extracellular domain (M2e), HA stalk and receptor binding site, NA, and T cell epitopes in the internal proteins such as polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), NP, and M1 were defined as targets for eliciting cross-reactive immune response. A variety of vaccine platforms were tested for effective exposure of those antigens to the immune system (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>; Estrada and Schultz-Cherry, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). While these vaccines showed broader cross-protection than the classical inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), their protection potency was weak. They provided partial protection against the antigenically distant viruses, and the protection breadth is usually limited to the same group (subtype-specific or HA group-specific) and not effective in another HA group. Thus, there exists a considerable gap between the current status, and the ultimate goal, of a truly universal vaccine.
