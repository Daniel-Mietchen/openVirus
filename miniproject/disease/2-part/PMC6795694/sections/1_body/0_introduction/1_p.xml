<p>Influenza viruses present a high level of antigenic diversity and variability due to their segmented RNA genome. These viruses are classified into four major types, A, B, C, and D, based on their nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) genes. Human infecting type A and B viruses are further classified into multiple subtypes or lineages, respectively, depending on the antigenicity of viral surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA) genes (Paules and Subbarao, 
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Influenza A and B viruses co-circulate in every season and, thus, c represents the primary targets of seasonal influenza vaccines (Sridhar et al., 
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition to seasonal epidemics, influenza viruses have caused pandemics at the intervals of ~10â€“40 years since the 1918 Spanish flu H1N1, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 being the last outbreak (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). While vaccination remains the most cost-effective measure to prevent influenza virus infections, antigenic drift in the surface antigens allows these viruses to escape antibody-mediated neutralization (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>). In addition, the sudden occurrence of pandemics is often accompanied by zoonotic spillover of the surface genes into the human-infecting viruses, rendering preexisting vaccines ineffective to newly emerging viruses. The variation caused by genetic drift and shift is unpredictable, posing a serious challenge to the management of influenza outbreak. Based on the amino acid sequences of HAs, influenza A viruses (IAVs) are divided into two phylogenetic groups. The IAV HA group 1 viruses include H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17, and H18, while the group 2 viruses comprise H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, H15 (

Influenza B viruses (IBVs) are not divided into subtypes but circulate as two distinct Yamagata-like and Victoria-like lineages. Influenza C viruses (ICVs) generally cause a mild respiratory disease in humans and do not cause epidemics (Dykes et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). Contemporary influenza epidemics are caused by the H1N1 and H3N2 of the IAVs and one or two lineages of the IBVs, dictating trivalent (TIV) or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) containing two IAV antigens and one or two IBV antigens, respectively (Ambrose and Levin,
