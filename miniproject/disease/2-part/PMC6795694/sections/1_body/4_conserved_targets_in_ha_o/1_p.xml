<p>The inability to induce a complete protection by HA stalk-based approach led to a search for alternative targets for UIVs. Human monoclonal antibody CH65, mimicking the interaction with sialic acid, was shown to bind to the RBS in HA and neutralize multiple H1N1 influenza strains (Whittle et al., 
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A caveat is that this antibody demonstrated stringent structural requirements for neutralization and mutation at the binding region led to generation of escape mutants. A panel of head-reactive monoclonal antibodies was also isolated and shown to recognize conserved region in the RBS and neutralize multiple influenza viruses (Krause et al.,
