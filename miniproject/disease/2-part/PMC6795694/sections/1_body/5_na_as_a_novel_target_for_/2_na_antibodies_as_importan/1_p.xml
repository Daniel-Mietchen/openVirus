<p>The 1968 H3N2 pandemic gave us important lessons pertaining to NA-mediated protection. The antigenic drift of NA is independent of HA; the pandemic involved a shift in HA, but NA remained close to the previous influenza A/H2N2 viruses (Schulman and Kilbourne, 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>). Notably, it has been shown that individuals with higher N2 antibody titers are less likely to be infected with the H3N2 pandemic, depicting the contribution of NA antibodies to broad protection (Schulman, 
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Murphy et al., 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Monto and Kendal, 
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">1973</xref>). However, NA has been largely ignored in the formulation of influenza vaccines due to the general beliefs that NA antibodies do not inhibit viral entry and that NA is less abundant than HA on a virion. Furthermore, the lack of a convenient assay to measure functional NA antibodies has rendered the NA forgotten antigens in influenza vaccines for decades (Eichelberger and Monto, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Most of the current vaccine approaches focus on the induction of HA antibodies, both in trivalent/quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines and in the recent UIV candidates. However, it has been increasingly acknowledged that NA antibodies are important and independent correlates of protection and that NA immunity should be considered when evaluating vaccine potency. Clinical studies have shown a correlation between vaccination-induced or preexisting NAI antibody levels and decreased frequency of influenza infection and illness (Couch et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Monto et al., 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Further, a human challenge model depicted that NAI titers correlated more significantly with protection and disease severity than HAI titers (Memoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), or even HA stalk antibodies (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The observations in the human challenge models suggest that NA should be given full consideration as a vaccine antigen for better protection.
