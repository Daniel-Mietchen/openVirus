<p>NA is a tetrameric type II transmembrane glycoprotein and the second major surface protein of influenza viruses. The role of NA in influenza infection cycle is classically known as an expedited release of virus particle from infected cells by cleaving off the sialic acid residue present in host cell membrane, thus enabling multiple rounds of infection by the newly generated viral progeny. In addition to the canonical role that operates at later stage of infection, other functions of NA relevant to the infection cycle are being recognized. For instance, the sialidase activity of NA is critical for viral entry into a host cell at early stage of infection. At the entry site in the mucus, influenza virus meets mucosal defense proteins such as mucins that are highly glycosylated and capture viral HA. NA is able to release the captured viral particles via sialidase activity, allowing them to reach the host cells successfully (Cohen et al.,

 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, with the same sialidase activity, NA facilitates HA-dependent membrane fusion and enhances the viral infectivity by removing the sialic acid residues from the virion-expressed HAs (Su et al., 
 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Additionally, NA cooperates with HA to enable crawling and gliding motions of influenza virus on cell surface to enhance viral entry into a cell (Sakai et al., 
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). More interestingly, some of the H3N2 viruses use their NA for receptor binding instead of HA, suggesting a novel role of NA other than receptor-destroying activity (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Mogling et al., 
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These observations show that NA performs multiple functions in the entire infection cycle, suggesting that NA antibodies may represent an important means of protection against influenza viruses.
