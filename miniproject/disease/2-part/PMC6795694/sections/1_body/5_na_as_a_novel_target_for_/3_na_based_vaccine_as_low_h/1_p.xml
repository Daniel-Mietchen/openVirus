<p>Although the importance of NA-immunity in protection against homologous and heterologous influenza infections is clearly established, only a few literatures have demonstrated the cross-protection of NA-only vaccine constructs. One recent study in a mouse model has reported that computationally engineered recombinant NA proteins containing consensus sequences show broad protection within the H1N1 subtype (Job et al., 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Some other studies reported that VLPs expressing NA provided cross-protection against heterologous challenge in mice and ferrets (Easterbrook et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Walz et al., 
 <xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and recombinant NA in a mouse model (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wohlbold et al., 
 <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, co-administration of H7 HA and N3 NA in modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors did not demonstrate enhanced protection efficacy as compared to the efficacy of MVA-HA or MVA-NA vaccine alone (Meseda et al., 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A predominant immune response in favor of HA over NA, when presented in an influenza virion, is already well-documented (Johansson et al., 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>), and the dissociation of HA and NA eliminates this antigenic competition (Johansson and Kilbourne, 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). These observations together suggest that NA-specific immunity may be dwarfed by competition with highly immunogenic HA in the final vaccine formulation. It could be argued that if the controlled ratio of HA and NA (dwarfing NA) is the strategy adopted by successful virus infection to minimize the host immune surveillance, then a deliberate perturbation of their ratio (increasing NA) in the vaccine formulation may be a promising strategy for effective protection. It was shown that the ratio of HA/NA could vary widely (up to 50 fold) without affecting viral fitness by a single mutation in the viral promoter (Lee and Seong, 
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). It remains to be seen if such a reverse-genetic approach could be harnessed to enhance the potency of NA-based vaccines.
