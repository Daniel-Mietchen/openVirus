<p>Besides the Leningrad and Ann Arbor strains, an independent cold-adapted vaccine strain (X-31ca) that was previously used for trivalent seasonal vaccine (Jang et al., 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccine (Jang et al., 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2013c</xref>), and 2009 pdmH1N1 vaccine (Jang et al., 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>), was recently tested as a UIV in a mouse model (Jang et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Mice vaccinated with single or two doses of X-31 ca LAIVs were completely protected against lethal challenge of heterosubtypic strains encompassing both HA group 1 and 2 IAVs. Interestingly, boosting with heterosubtypic LAIVs carrying different HA and NA surface antigens showed more potent cross-protection than homologous boosting. T cell immunity and NK cell-mediated ADCC activity was demonstrated to contribute significantly to the observed cross-protection. As the first report of pan-influenza A protection covering both HA groups, these results merit further studies in a ferret model for clinical relevance. Hence, the LAIVs appear to be a powerful tool to develop a UIV that confers broad and potent cross-protection as a stand-alone vaccine or in combination with other strategies.
