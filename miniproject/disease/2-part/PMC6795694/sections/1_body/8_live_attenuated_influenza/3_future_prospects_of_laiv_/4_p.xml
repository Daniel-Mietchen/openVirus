<p>Another important aspect of LAIV-based strategies lies on the LAIV strains. During the past century, H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A viruses were the most prevalent strains in humans, causing annual epidemics as well as occasional pandemics, except for the temporal circulation of H2N2 during 1957â€“1968 (Kilbourne, 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Accordingly, seasonal influenza vaccines are recommended to include H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine antigens for more than 40 years since 1977. Therefore, it is likely that most contemporary population has preexisting T cell immunity to H1N1 and H3N2 strains through natural infections or vaccinations. It should be remembered that currently licensed LAIVs (A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca and A/Leningrad/134/17/57 ca) are of H2N2 subtypes. Probably, the nature of strain itself does not really matter for seasonal influenza vaccine, for which strain-specific immunity is focused on the surface HA antigen. However, for eliciting cross-protection, the role of conserved region become important (see section HA stalk-based UIV approaches, Conserved targets in HA other than stalk, NA as a novel target for a UIV for HA/NA and section T cell immunity as an essential factor for truly universal influenza protection for internal proteins). It is likely that human populations under 50 years of age (born after 1968 when H2N2 became extinct) has little preexisting immunity against H2N2, but predominantly against H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. It will therefore be worthwhile to examine whether cold-adapted LAIVs of H1N1 (Jang et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) or H3N2 origin (non-existent, to our knowledge) offer a beneficial effects on boosting the preexisting cross-reactive T cell immunity and antibody effector functions (section Mode of protection by a UIV;
