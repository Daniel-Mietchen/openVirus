<p>The HA stalk-based approach currently leads the mainstream of UIV development. Influenza HA is the primary target antigen of the currently licensed seasonal vaccine, and HAI antibodies serve as the “gold standard” when evaluating the protective efficacy of HA-based vaccines (Ohmit et al., 
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, HA-based vaccines provide only strain-specific protection to antigenically homologous viruses, necessitating annual update of the surface antigens of seasonal vaccines to match the circulating viral strains. HA comprises two distinct domains; globular head, and stalk domains. The head domain is highly variable and immunologically dominant and thus the majority of HI antibodies are directed to the head domain that harbors the RBS (

In contrast, the HA stalk domain is relatively conserved among the viruses, and therefore eliciting antibodies specific to the stalk is considered as a key to developing a UIV. However, the stalk is generally regarded as immunologically subdominant, due to masking effect by bulky head domain and close proximity to the viral membrane (Krammer and Palese, 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Crowe, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Krammer, 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), which necessitates rational design of a HA antigen and novel vaccination strategies to increase stalk-reactive antibodies. The major protective function of HA stalk antibodies is to lock the HA trimer in a prefusion state. This prevents pH-dependent conformational change of HA that triggers the membrane fusion and release of viral genome into cytoplasm of host cell (Ekiert et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The membrane fusion inhibitory activity of the stalk antibodies may lead to neutralization of influenza viruses, although the neutralizing potency is weaker than head antibodies that directly prevent the receptor binding. Besides the neutralizing activity, stalk antibodies have multiple indirect mechanisms that contribute to broad protection, including antibody-dependent effector mechanisms (Jegaskanda et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>) and the inhibition of the NA enzymatic activity (Wohlbold et al., 
 <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). To overcome the low immunogenicity of HA stalk, genetic modifications were required for efficient exposure of stalk to the host immune system. Prime-boost vaccination with chimeric HAs or “headless” HAs were designed to boost stalk-reactive antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Alternatively, hyperglycosylation in HA head resulted in the redirection of immune response from head to stalk (Krammer and Palese, 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These approaches have paved the way to increase the breadth of protection against influenza viruses.
