<p>It is well-recognized that the stalk is less immunogenic than head and that the stalk antibodies are less potent in virus neutralization than the head antibodies. Therefore, multiple immunizations (three or four times) with stalk-based vaccines are required for inducing a sufficiently protective level of antibody response. More importantly, most humans have a diverse history of exposure to influenza antigens, by natural infection, or vaccination. The established immune memory influences the subsequent immune response to a UIV, posing a great challenge to rendering qualitatively uniform and protective immune responses in humans. As discussed earlier, the HA stalk-based vaccines elicit broad-spectrum protection within the same HA group, but usually fail to provide protection to strains belonging to different HA group (Krammer et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Margine et al., 
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These results apparently dissent from the finding that some of the stalk monoclonal antibodies isolated from humans recognize all IAV subtypes, neutralizing both group 1 and group 2 viruses, presenting a promising prospect of developing pan-influenza A therapeutic solution (Corti et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Isolation of rare antibodies with extremely broad neutralization potency from humans with prior vaccinations or infections (Corti et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) indicates that our immune system is able to find the cryptic and conserved epitopes and generate specific antibodies to the regions. However, inducing such antibodies to a protective level by vaccination remains a big challenge. Some recent reports encourage other options such as the activation of the conserved “cryptic” epitopes via antigen processing mechanisms (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>) or deliberately down-regulating surface antigens (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, Fc-engineering technologies developed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies may be harnessed to modulate FcR-Fc mediated effector functions (DiLillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) to achieve broad protection. A comprehensive understanding of immune response to broadly neutralizing epitopes and structure-based antigen design is required for the rational design of a pan-influenza A vaccine covering both group 1 and group 2 IAVs, as a consensus criterion of UIV (
