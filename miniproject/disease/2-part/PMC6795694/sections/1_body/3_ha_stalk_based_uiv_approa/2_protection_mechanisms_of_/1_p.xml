<p>A primary function of stalk-reactive antibodies is membrane fusion inhibition. Following the influenza virus entry into the cells via endocytosis, a pH-dependent conformational change of HA proteins triggers the membrane fusion between the virus and endosome, leading to release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Binding of the antibody to the stalk interrupts the conformational change of HA and prevents subsequent membrane fusion. This leads to the trapping of the virus in the endosome, eventually aborting the infection (Ekiert et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sui et al., 
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Moreover, binding of the stalk antibody blocks the access of proteases to the cleavage site located in stalk region and prevents protease-dependent cleavage of the HA precursor into HA1 and HA2 subunits, which is a prerequisite for the conformational change of HA (Ekiert et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Brandenburg et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These two overlapping functions of stalk-reactive antibodies result in inhibition of membrane fusion and direct neutralization of the virus. In addition to these mechanisms that operate at the early stage of infection, the stalk antibody may also bind to the newly expressed HA proteins on the cell surface, and interfere with the viral budding or release, at the later stage of infection (Tan et al.,
