<p>Following the first clinical vaccine trial in the 1960s, significant progress has been made. Improved understanding of RSV immunology and structural biology as well as recent advances in vaccine technology are the bases of some of the successes. There are currently a large number of candidates in the pre-clinical phase or undergoing clinical trials, and we are waiting for the information to become available from these studies. Among the candidates in advanced clinical trials, nanoparticle and subunit vaccines are the most promising for pregnant women and the elderly, whereas live-attenuated, vector-based or subunit vaccines are being considered the paediatric population. Ongoing studies could identify effective candidates. An active instrument against infection is needed since RSV infection can cause serious complications in infants, young children and the elderly.</p>
