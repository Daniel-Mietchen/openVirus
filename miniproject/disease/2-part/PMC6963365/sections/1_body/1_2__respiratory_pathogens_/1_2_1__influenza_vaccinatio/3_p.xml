<p>Every year during the influenza season, together with the two subtypes of influenza A virus (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), two lineages of influenza B viruses (B/Victoria/2/87-like and B/Yamagata/16/88-like) simultaneously circulate; in some years, the influenza B viruses are responsible for the major disease burden [

 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-07-00168" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-07-00168" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Unlike influenza A viruses, humans are the sole host with epidemiological relevance for influenza B viruses. Influenza B viruses evolve mainly through genetic reassortment between strains of different lineages. This allows for the escape from host immunity and the preservation of the ability to cause disease. Regardless of the lineage, influenza B infection can cause severe disease and death [

During influenza season, influenza C virus can circulate infecting humans, dogs, and pigs, sometimes causing severe illness and local epidemics; however, influenza C virus is less common than the other types of influenza viruses and usually it only causes mild disease in children.
