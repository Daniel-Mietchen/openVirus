<p>There has been an increase in the incidence of pertussis in the European Union from 2011 onwards [

The resurgence of pertussis observed in recent years seems to be a complex but real phenomenon due to a number of reasons, including the use of acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines in many locales. Lack of mucosal immune responses after aP vaccine administration favour infection, persistent colonization and transmission of the pathogen. Moreover, earlier waning of protective immunity and the circulation of 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic> variants depleted of vaccine-included antigens further favor the increase in pertussis disease [
