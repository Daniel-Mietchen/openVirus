<p>IAV-S is a swine virus with zoonotic potential (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is ubiquitous in swine producing regions around the world, and with variable frequency, swine-to-human transmission does occur. Fortunately, most transmission events are limited in scope of disease and subsequent human-to-human transmission. However, the 2009 influenza pandemic is a stark reminder of the potential for influenza viruses to jump species and become a pandemic. Reverse zoonosis, IAV transmission from people to swine, is being detected with similar frequency. This phenomenon is an important mechanism for transferring human viruses into swine where the virus can adapt to swine and be maintained as a potential reservoir of human-like IAV that could jump back to humans. Other zoonotic swine viruses are more regional in distribution and usually are not considered to cause significant economic loss. Crossover events with these viruses are much less frequent when compared to IAV-S; however, they can have a higher case fatality rate in people (Japanese encephalitis virus, Hepatitis E virus). Most zoonotic swine virus crossover events are very rare and typically cause minimal human disease, however, in 1998, Nipah virus, a previously unknown virus, emerged in swine in Malaysia. It caused a respiratory infection with high morbidity in all ages of swine on several farms. Sick pigs transmitted the virus to farm workers causing a severe illness with a Case Fatality Rate of about 40% in the initial outbreak (
