<p>Starting with these data, the simulation process per each parish was automated again. Using the MRP, the task was saved to be executed to simulate the housing behavior with DB. The VM was turned off to save its status; on top of this, ten-linked VM clones were created. These VMs needed to be configured to run simulations with different data. Once the simulation process finished, all output files were unified, the VMs were deleted, and the results were validated using a python script.</p>
