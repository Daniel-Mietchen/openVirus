<p>The database used to obtain the influenza morbidity was the hospital registry made available by the INEC. The cases of 2009, considering the code J09 to J12, have been summed by parish, which is the smallest political-administrative limit available in the database. To obtain the disease rates, the population used as the denominator was extracted from the 2010 INEC census since one-year difference will not affect the relative value between parishes.</p>
