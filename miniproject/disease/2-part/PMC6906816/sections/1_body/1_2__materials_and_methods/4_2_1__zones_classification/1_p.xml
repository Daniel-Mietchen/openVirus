<p>The spatial division of Ecuador was identified by a six-digit primary code that represents each parish as a political-administrative unit [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This type of coverage is a polygonal vector that has the same characteristics in each unit, from which a centroid was calculated for each register with the objective of substituting every polygon for its representative spot. This characteristic allows for inquiries and links with the databases about houses and population census made by INEC, as well as with the health databases compiled by the INEC from registers of the Public Health Ministry.
