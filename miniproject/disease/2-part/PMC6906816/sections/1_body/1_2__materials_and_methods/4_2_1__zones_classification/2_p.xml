<p>The source for the elevation digital model is the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) at a resolution of one arc-second (approximately 30 meters) available for most of the land surfaces that lay between 60°N and 54°S [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Once imported in a Geographic Information System (GIS), the elevation of the centroid of each parish can be extracted from this raster layer, and the weather conditions related to those points can be estimated. For this analysis, information about the 1040 parishes of the country was used.
