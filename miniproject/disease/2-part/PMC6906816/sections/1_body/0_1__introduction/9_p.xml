<p>The rapid transmission in crowded areas including schools and nursing homes has been confirmed by the WHO. The main objective of this study is to raise the hypothesis about relationship between the thermal conditions inside social housing projects and respiratory diseases in Ecuador. Specifically, the relation between influenza virus transmission, temperature, and relative humidity (RH), as potential conditions for the increasing virus transmission, is analyzed. For the analysis, it was considered the temperature information and relative humidity stimulates virus transmission (A/Panama/2007/99 virus), based on results of experiments done on guinea pigs in controlled spaces and inoculated with a human stain of the virus and healthy guinea pigs.</p>
