<p>In Ecuador, local governments have between their competences to promote “… safe and healthy habitat and guarantee the right to have a dwelling” [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], supported by laws and norms proposed by the central government. The minimum conditions in housings are determined by Ley Orgánica de Ordenamiento Territorial, Uso y Gestión de Suelo (law to regulate the use of the land) which establishes the following: (a) to have access to clean water, electricity, and sewage system in working conditions; (b) finished kitchen and bathroom; (c) elevators when housings are buildings if they are required in the national and local construction codes; (d) completely built communal areas in buildings and blocks of buildings” [

Finally, a plan to improve the living conditions of families in extreme poverty and vulnerable situation has being executed “to guarantee the right of people to have a safe and healthy environment and an appropriate and worthy housing, independently of their social and economic situation.”
