<p id="Par45">Another function of M2 is participation in the formation and budding of new influenza A virions. The study of this feature began with the discovery that viral replication is inhibited by antibodies that recognize the extracellular domain of M2, despite the small amount of M2 on the surface of influenza A virus [

Using reverse genetics and mutational analysis, it has been shown that truncated forms of M2, or forms with mutations in the cytoplasmic tail, further reduce the level of free M1 in the cellular environment, which is required for the assembly and budding of new virions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The major role in M2-mediated budding and scission processes is played by the amphipathic region (residues 45â€“62), which interacts with various host cell proteins involved in remodeling the cell membrane (reviewed in [
