<p id="Par47">The functional ortholog of influenza A virus M2 is M2 from influenza B virus (BM2), which also carries electrons through the membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], interacts with the influenza B matrix 1 protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>], crucial for virus assembly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and has an HxxxW motif in its transmembrane part [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. However, the sequences of M2 and BM2 have significant differences. For example, the extracellular part of BM2 consists of only seven amino acid residues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] (the consensus for human BM2e according to analysis of 9011 sequences from the Influenza Research Database is “MLEPFQI”). Because of its small size, BM2e is most likely not able to establish a protective immune responses [
