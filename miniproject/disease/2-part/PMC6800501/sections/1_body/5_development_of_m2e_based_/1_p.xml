<p id="Par59">The inhibition of replication of some influenza A strains by 14C2 antibody [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>] merited further study since the extracellular part of the M2 protein is very conservative compared with HA and NA, and the cross-protective effect can be directed precisely at M2e. Study of the protective properties of 14C2 in BALB/c mice showed that it significantly reduced the replication of influenza A (but not influenza B) virus in lung tissue. This prompted the suggestion that the higher immunity of adults who have previously had influenza A infection compared with children is provided by the presence of M2e antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. However, subsequent studies have shown that M2e itself is a weak immunogen and that only about half the people infected with influenza A virus are able to produce anti-M2e antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. There is no reliable evidence that such a low concentration of antibodies plays any protective role [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. It has also been suggested that the introduction of M2e epitopes into the influenza vaccine will have a priming effect on the production of antibodies before subsequent influenza A virus infection [
