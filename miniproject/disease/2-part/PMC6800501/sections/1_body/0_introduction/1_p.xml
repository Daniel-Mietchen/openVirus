<p id="Par27">The extremely high variability in the antigenic properties of influenza virus is related to the structure of its genome that allows reassortment and the structural flexibility of the viral glycoproteins, which tolerate amino acid residue substitutions in the major antigenic sites without loss of function. Often immunity raised against previously circulating variants is not capable of protecting against newly emerging drift variants. In addition, completely new antigenic variants of the influenza virus are occasionally introduced into the human population; since the population is immunologically naive to them, these viruses spread easily and can cause pandemics. These features of influenza infection explain why there is interest around the world in developing a universal influenza vaccine, which could induce a cross-reactive immune response to the most conservative parts of the viral proteins.</p>
