<p id="Par28">Classic influenza vaccines commonly induce antibodies to the viral surface antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), mainly to their immunodominant hypervariable regions. Constant antigenic drift allows the virus easily to escape the action of these antibodies, reducing the effectiveness of vaccination and leading to a need for annual updating of vaccine strains in the seasonal influenza vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. The performance of seasonal influenza vaccines can be improved by increasing the speed of vaccine production and using new adjuvants and new vaccination strategies. However, these vaccines will not be able to protect against newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses because of significant antigenic differences. Potentially pandemic viruses have been identified and many vaccines, based on different approaches and platforms, have been developed against them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. However, these vaccines also have narrow specificity and may not have cross-reactivity, even within a single subtype. There has, therefore, been significant interest in the development of new vaccines that would have a longer and wider spectrum of action [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and which would provide long-term protection not only against drifted variants of influenza A viruses of one subtype but also against viruses of other subtypes. One approach to expanding the spectrum of the protective action of influenza vaccines is to enhance the induction of cross-reacting immune response factors that target highly conserved antigens in influenza viruses of various subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The influenza virion contains multiple conservative domains that, because of their functional significance, are rather weak immunogens; classical approaches to immunization are not able to induce a strong immune response to these sites.
