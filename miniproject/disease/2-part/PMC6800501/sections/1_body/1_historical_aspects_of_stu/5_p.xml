<p id="Par36">In 2003, another study was published in which rabbits were immunized with 4 peptides from the N-terminal section of M2, with overlapping areas: а.a. 2–24, а.a. 2–12, а.a. 8–18 and а.a. 13–24. Further study showed that they all produced antibodies capable of recognizing each of the four peptides. It has also been shown that antibodies recognizing the N-terminus of M2 (a.a 2–12) have virus-neutralizing activity against both influenza A and B in vitro [

The authors suggested that this part of M2 may contain one epitope that can induce antibodies with inhibitory activities against both viruses, but there is no additional evidence that could confirm that anti-M2e immunity can suppress influenza B virus replication. Later, the same group of scientists reported that a small area of M2 EVETPIRN (a.a. 6–13) can produce antibodies 8C6 and 1B12, but their protective effect has not yet been sufficiently studied [
