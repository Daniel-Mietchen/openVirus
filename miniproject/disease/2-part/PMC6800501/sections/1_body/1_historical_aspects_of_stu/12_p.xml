<p id="Par43">The 7th segment of the influenza A virus genome can be subjected to alternative splicing with the formation of M2 mRNA and mRNA3; the formation of M4 mRNA is also possible in some strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. This process can proceed independently of other influenza A virus proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] using only the host cell machinery. However, a number of papers have reported the control of M1 mRNA splicing using other influenza A virus proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. Currently, it is known that NS1 provides the main regulatory function of the amount of M2 in infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], rather than polymerase proteins, as was previously thought [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>].
