<p>The Yangtze River Delta, located in Eastern China, includes the provinces of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, and is among the areas at highest risk for AI epidemics in China [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces were chosen as sites for the present study, as they account for the highest proportion of egg and poultry production in the Yangtze River Delta, at 49.7% (3.18 million tons) and 40.7% (2.61 million tons), respectively [

In addition, the geographic proximity of these provinces to the research team as well as researchersâ€™ familiarity with local dialects maximized ease of access and communication. Study participants were commercial chicken farmers whose main source of income was chicken farming. Unlike chicken farm employees and subsistence farmers who raise a small number of chickens in their backyard, commercial chicken farmers must make all management decisions and take full responsibility for their profits and losses. Chicken production is the most common form of poultry farming in China [
