<p>This study found that poultry farmers who had higher risk perception regarding human AI infection reported higher rates of PPB adoption. This finding is consistent with Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) [

 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-03832" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], both of which have been applied to understanding personal protective health behaviors. However, the study further found that poultry farmers with higher risk perception regarding poultry infection with AI also reported higher rates of BPB adoption. These findings suggest that the principles of PMT and the HBM could be extended to the field of economic threat analysis and could be applied to understand and predict personal economic behaviors (i.e., avoiding economic loss). Further study is warranted to determine whether the mechanism of influence for BPBs is similar to that for personal protective health behaviors.
