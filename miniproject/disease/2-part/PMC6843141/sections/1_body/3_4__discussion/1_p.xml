<p>This study examined Chinese poultry farmers’ risk perception and coping behaviors regarding human infection with A/H7N9 and poultry infection with A/H5N1. The study found that farmers’ perceived risk of poultry being infected with A/H5N1 was significantly higher than their perceived risk of human infection with A/H7N9, and that their total frequency of BPBs against A/H5N1 was significantly higher than the frequency of PPBs against A/H7N9. These findings reflect a positive correlation between risk perception and coping behavior regarding AI. Moreover, farmers were less familiar with human A/H7N9 infection than with A/H5N1 infection in poultry.</p>
