<p>Influenza virus infection is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases. Seasonal influenza viruses, including H1N1pdm09, H3N2, and type B viruses, cause annual epidemics, despite the use of vaccines against influenza virus. Other subtypes of influenza A virus from other animal species such as chickens and pigs have caused sporadic human cases. For example, highly pathogenic influenza virus subtype H5N1 is circulating among poultry in Asian countries and Egypt and has transmitted to humans (

Reassortant H5Nx viruses such as H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8 viruses that possess the hemagglutinin (HA) segment of a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus and the neuraminidase (NA) segment of another subtype have emerged and spread in European and North American countries (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). It is difficult to prepare vaccines against these H5 and H7 viruses in a timely manner; therefore, the first line of defense against such viruses is antiviral drugs, such as NA inhibitors and an endonuclease inhibitor.
