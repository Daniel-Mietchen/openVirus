<p>We next tested the sensitivity of the 23 IRDTs against H5N1 and H5N6 viruses. The two H5N1 viruses (H5-1 and H5-2) were isolated from raw poultry products that were illegally brought into Japan by international flight passengers (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Uchida et al., 2019</xref>). These H5 viruses are circulating in avian species and have the potential to transmit to humans (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Nunez and Ross, 2019</xref>). The detection limit of the 23 IRDTs ranged from 10
 <sup>3</sup> to 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per 100 μl for the two H5N1 viruses (H5-1 and H5-2) and from 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per 100 μl for the three H5N6 viruses (H5-3, H5-4, and H5-5) (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The sensitivity of the IRDTs for H5-3 and H5-4 was 10–100 lower than that for H5-5. For H7N9 viruses, we used a prototype H7N9 virus (H7-1) that was isolated from the first reported human H7N9 case in 2013 (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2013</xref>) and a highly pathogenic H7N9 isolate (H7-2) that emerged and was isolated from a human in 2017 (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Another highly pathogenic H7N9 isolate (H7-3) was isolated in 2017 from Muscovy duck meat, which was brought by passengers from China to Japan (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Shibata et al., 2018b</xref>). The detection limits of the 23 IRDTs for these H7N9 viruses ranged from 10
 <sup>1</sup> to 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per 100 μl (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The sensitivity of the IRDTs for H7-3 was 100–1000 higher than that for H7-1 and H7-2. Several IRDTs detected the H5 and H7 viruses and the seasonal viruses with similar sensitivity. The most sensitive IRDT for H5Nx and H7N9 viruses was Sofia Influenza A + B FIA.
