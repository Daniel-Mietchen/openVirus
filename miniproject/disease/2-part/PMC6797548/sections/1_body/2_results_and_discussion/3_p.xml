<p>We examined the sensitivity of these 23 IRDTs for each of three isolates of H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B/Victoria-lineage, and B/Yamagata-lineage isolated between 2016 and 2018 (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The detection limit of the IRDTs for seasonal H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses ranged from 10
 <sup>1</sup> to 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per 100 μl (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The sensitivity for H3N2 viruses tended to be lower than that for H1N1pdm09 viruses. A similar trend was observed in our previous reports (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Sakai-Tagawa et al., 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The detection limit of the IRDTs tested for the B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-lineages ranged from 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per 100 μl (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All tested IRDTs possessed similar sensitivity for B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-lineages but lower or similar sensitivity for seasonal influenza B viruses compared with that for seasonal influenza A viruses (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The most sensitive IRDT for seasonal influenza A and B viruses was Sofia Influenza A + B FIA.
