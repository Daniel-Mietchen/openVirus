<p>In this study, all tested IRDTs possessed sufficient sensitivity to detect seasonal H1N1pdm09, H3N2, and type B viruses, as well as H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9 viruses, which are potentially transmittable to humans (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Nunez and Ross, 2019</xref>). Most of the IRDTs tested in this study showed similar sensitivity for seasonal influenza A and B viruses as the IRDTs we tested previously (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Sakai-Tagawa et al., 2017</xref>). Sofia Influenza A + B FIA showed the best sensitivity to all of the influenza A and B viruses tested. Of note, the sensitivity of several of the IRDTs for seasonal influenza viruses differed by 10 times compared with our previous study (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Sakai-Tagawa et al., 2017</xref>). This difference may be due to modifications of the IRDTs to improve their sensitivity to recent seasonal influenza viruses. Therefore, we need to continue to periodically monitor the sensitivity of IRDTs.
