<p>In addition to evaluating the clinical benefit of routine molecular POCT for influenza, we will also use this opportunity to answer other important research questions including the ideal specimens for respiratory virus testing (upper vs lower respiratory tract specimens) in patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), the difference in viral load between these two specimen type and whether changes in viral load over time (kinetics) in respiratory samples or the presence of viral RNA in the blood is related to and predictive of clinical outcome.</p>
