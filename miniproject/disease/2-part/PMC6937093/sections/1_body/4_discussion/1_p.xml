<p>We hypothesise that the use of a routine molecular POC ‘test-and-treat’ strategy for influenza in adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness will improve adherence to national guidelines for the management of influenza and may improve patient outcomes. We expect increased, timely detection of influenza and that this will lead to improved use of NAI treatment. Rapid and appropriate use of NAI treatment in influenza may also lead to decreased complication and mortality and may shorten length of stay in hospital. The rapid detection of viruses may improve isolation facility use within the NHS with subsequent reduction in nosocomial transmission of viruses and improvements in patient flow through acute areas. The use of a POCT for respiratory viruses may also identify patients where unnecessary antibiotic use can be safely discontinued, promoting antibiotic stewardship and reducing antimicrobial resistance.</p>
