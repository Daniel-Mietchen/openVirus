<p>The subjects' anonymity will be maintained. The study team will keep a log of each subjectâ€™s name, hospital identification (ID) number, date of birth and unique participant trial number. The participant details will be recorded on the secure NHS Edge system in a similar manner, including NHS number. This participant trial number is used on documents after screening to maintain confidentiality. Documents that are not anonymous (eg, signed informed consent forms) will be maintained separately, in strict confidence and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. A secure database will be used to enter data from the CRFs at the completion of the study, followed by data lock.</p>
