<p>Demographic and clinical data will be collected for all patients at enrolment from paper and electronic medical records including: age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, vaccination status, comorbidities, medication use, symptoms, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, observations (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygenation status), laboratory results, radiology results, antimicrobial and antiviral use prior to hospitalisation and provisional diagnosis. Data will be recorded on a standardised case report form (CRF) and transferred to a secure electronic database. Once patients have been discharged or after 30 days (whichever is soonest), outcome data will be collected retrospectively from electronic and physical case notes, electronic prescribing systems and laboratory and radiological results systems including: use of antivirals, duration of antivirals, time from assessment to antiviral use, use of antibiotics, duration of antibiotic use, use of side room facilities, time from assessment to isolation facility use, time to clinical stability, duration of supplementary oxygen use, duration of hospitalisation, complications including ICU and HDU admission, representation and readmission to hospital within 30 days, final diagnosis and mortality. The number of diagnostic tests and procedures performed will also be recorded and data will also be collected on the turnaround time of respiratory virus test results in each group. Patients withdrawn from the study will have no further data collected.</p>
