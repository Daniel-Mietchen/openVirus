<p>The primary outcome (proportion of patients infected with influenza treated with NAIs) will be measured only in patients with confirmed influenza, that is, the intention-to-treat-infected (ITTI) population. Difference in proportions and unadjusted ORs will be used to compare the groups. The effect of group on the primary outcome will be further assessed using multiple logistic regression to control for the following covariates: age, sex, influenza vaccine status, receipt of antibiotics prior to admission, duration of illness, comorbidity, temperature, C reactive protein, severity of illness and clinical group.</p>
