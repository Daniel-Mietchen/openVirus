<p>Many studies did not adequately assess the underlying conditions such as HIV and malnutrition. HIV infection is a risk factor for severe influenza disease as well as for PTB, and it is an important contributor to the overall burden of severe influenza in high HIV‐prevalence settings.

 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> If the association with severe disease is higher in patients with the underlying HIV infection, it may be difficult to differentiate the role played by the individual infection. Other conditions such as malnutrition, which like tuberculosis are prevalent in HBC, were not evaluated in included articles and may be confounders in the association between influenza and PTB. The numbers of participants in most studies were small, and this could have limited the ability to detect significant associations. Other important areas that were not addressed by the studies reviewed include whether influenza infection caused reactivation of latent tuberculosis or whether the acute viral infection precipitated a visit to the doctor in patients who already had tuberculosis disease. Studies in Chinese were not included in the review, and therefore, our review may not reflect the full body of literature on this topic.
