<p>Of the five studies reporting on pandemic influenza only, two descriptive studies from HBCs reported a high prevalence of tuberculosis in cases with severe influenza‐associated disease.

 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> These studies presented limited univariate analyses. Pandemic influenza may behave differently to seasonal influenza because of lack of pre‐existing immunity, and the likely interaction between influenza and tuberculosis might be immunologically mediated. High levels of cytokines produced as part of the inflammatory response to infection with a pandemic virus have been reported to result in severe influenza‐associated lung damage.

 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> High‐quality epidemiological studies are required to assess whether the severe disease and outcomes associated with influenza‐PTB co‐infection are driven by pandemic phenomena as this may have implications for recommendations and prevention strategies. However, even if the association between influenza and PTB is less marked during seasonal influenza epidemics, targeting individuals with active PTB for influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment in HBCs could still potentially prevent significant morbidity and mortality and might also prevent further spread of tuberculosis during the intensive phase if influenza increases coughing. In this review, all the analytical studies were conducted in high burden countries. It is important to understand the background prevalence of tuberculosis where studies are conducted for better interpretation of the results. In countries with low tuberculosis burden, it is possible for studies not to identify increased prevalence of co‐infection or detect an association between co‐infection and severe outcomes, purely because of low numbers due to low tuberculosis prevalence in the community. In some of the analytical studies included in our review, lack of association may be due to the inclusion criteria, for example only including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) cases with acute presentation and not systematically testing for PTB in patients with severe respiratory illness. Depending on the magnitude of tuberculosis burden, results may have different implications for prioritization in different settings.
