<p>In an observational study from South Africa, hospitalized cases with influenza‐PTB co‐infection compared to cases with tuberculosis only had increased risk of death (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1‐10.1]). This association was, however, only observed in patients with symptoms ≥7 days (aRRR 5.5, 95% CI 1.2‐25.30) and not in cases with symptoms &lt;7 days (aRRR 0.9, 95% CI 0.1‐8.6).

 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> A case‐control study from Indonesia investigating the putative association between tuberculosis and influenza virus infection reported no association between the development of clinically active PTB, either through reactivation of latent tuberculosis or directly after exposure to 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>, and influenza virus infection as measured by unpaired serology in cases with newly diagnosed tuberculosis and community controls. The proportion of individuals with influenza virus antibody titres ≥10 against influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses in patients with tuberculosis were similar to matched community controls; however, the antibody titre levels for influenza A(H3N2) virus at time of tuberculosis diagnosis were significantly higher (1.7 times higher, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .002) in cases with PTB compared to controls. In addition, the difference in titres between cases with advanced PTB on chest X‐ray and their controls was significantly higher than in cases with mild to moderate tuberculosis and their controls.
