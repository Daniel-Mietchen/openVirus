<p>We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature identified through searches using online databases. For our search, we included terms for influenza (“influenza” or “flu” or “influenza virus” or “human influenza”) and for tuberculosis (“tuberculosis” or “TB”). The Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane, CAB Abstracts and Global Health databases were searched. The search strategy, which was completed in consultation with a research librarian, differed slightly by database (Appendix 
 <xref rid="irv12670-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). In addition, bibliographies of papers that were reviewed were checked for further relevant publications. The search was restricted to articles published in English, French, Italian, German, Russian, Finish, Japanese or Portuguese.
