<p>Individual studies were independently assessed for potential bias or confounding. When studies used either cohort or case‐control designs, we used the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale to rate the quality of the included papers.
 <xref rid="irv12670-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> Studies were considered high quality if the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale was ≥7 out of 9 and were considered of low quality if the score was ≤3 out of 9. Study methods differed; summary measures (odds ratios, relative risks), when reported, were abstracted. Data synthesis consisted of reporting the key findings of the different studies. Where possible the studies were classified according to whether they fall among the 22 high tuberculosis burden countries (HBC) that account for aproximately. 80% of world's tuberculosis cases.
