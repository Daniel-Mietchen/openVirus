<p>To generate MVA-based ZIKV vaccine candidates, we sub-cloned each of the ZIKV transgenes (prME, prME ΔTM, Env, Env ΔTM) with parental MVA plasmid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00216-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). After transfection of AatII-restriction enzyme linearised MVA-ZIKV plasmids, MVA particles were extracted and purified. DNA extraction from purified MVA vaccines was carried out to verify the correct transgene DNA length. The correct generation of all MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates was verified by PCR, using flanking regions (primer p7.5 and primer TKR), confirming the integrity of the transgenes within the MVA-ZIKV genomes (

To ensure the viral preparation was satisfactory, we tested the MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidate expressing the prME ΔTM, under negative stain and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirming the brick-shaped morphology and size (~305 nm by 260 nm) expected of the MVA vector, as described elsewhere [
