<p>We assessed the immunogenicity of our MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates by monitoring the anti-ZIKV E antibody titres, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after a non-adjuvanted and single intramuscular vaccine immunisation in BALB/c mice (n = 6), by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At four weeks post-immunisation, all MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates induced the production of anti-ZIKV E antibodies, with an antibody increase trend in the groups in which the vaccines were lacking the E transmembrane domain (TM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00216-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). At this timepoint, MVA Env ΔTM induced the highest level of antibodies (mean endpoint titre = 1.56). At 12 weeks post-prime immunisation, the amount of anti-ZIKV E titres elicited by the MVA vaccine candidates showed a non-statistically significant increase between vaccinated groups, with the prME ΔTM group having the highest mean log reciprocal titre of 1.55 (

Furthermore, we assessed cellular responses from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), elicited by MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates after four weeks post-immunisation. Interferon-γ (IFNγ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay showed that three out of six BALB/c mice receiving MVA prME ΔTM induced modest IFNγ-producing T cell responses (mean = 85.5 spot forming units (SFU)/10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs), while the rest of vaccine candidates induced smaller amount of IFNγ-producing T cell responses (mean &lt; 20 SFU/10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs). Taken together, MVA-ZIKV vaccines are immunogenic in BALB/c mice and humoral responses remained similar between 4 to 12 weeks after a single vaccination dose, whereas low levels of cellular responses were detected at 4 weeks post-immunisation.
