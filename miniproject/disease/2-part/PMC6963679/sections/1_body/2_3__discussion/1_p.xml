<p>A ZIKV vaccine target product profile [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00216" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] indicates that a preferred dose regimen in a Zika vaccine development is a single immunisation, although a minimal requirement of more than one dose is still a possibility. However, the challenge remains of ensuring protective efficacy in prime-boost regimens using a short vaccination interval, with the added burden of duplicating the administration cost, its delivery, dose, storage, etc.
