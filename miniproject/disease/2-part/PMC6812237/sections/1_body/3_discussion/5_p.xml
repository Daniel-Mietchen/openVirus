<p id="p0095">Month-wise analysis of influenza activity in the present study showed that in our region two peaks of epidemic of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were observed. First peak started in winter season during February–March and second peak was observed in post monsoon season i.e. August–September where second was dominant. Increased influenza activity in monsoon and post monsoon seasons also observed in other studies [

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. First peak started in February–March i.e, in cold &amp; low solar radiation season with a decreasing trend in number of cases during April–June; dry and sunny season which indicated increased influenza activity in cold temperature and in low solar radiation [

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Exact reason for increased influenza activity in winter is not known but when temperature drops people spend more time indoors, making it easier for the virus to spread in-house (8). No/low number of cases were reported in 2011, 2013–14 and 2016 which may indicate that most of the people were vaccinated during 2009–10 out of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positives for which decline in transmission occurred over 2013–14. On lowering of the host immunity over few years, the population was again susceptible to acquire infection and thus, epidemic resurgence again in 2015. Presumably the situation was repeated in 2016 and again due to lack of immunity majority of the population affected in 2017. This could be due to absence of a programme for flu vaccination in the country, where pandemic panic was the driving force for the community to take a preventive vaccine. This force became weak over time possibly because of the increase in the health system preparedness in handling emergencies and early diagnosis cum treatment measures that reduced the population fear to face the situation.
