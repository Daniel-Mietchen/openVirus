<p id="p0125">The study results are worth noting on its strengths and limitations. We used detailed hospitalization data from an enhanced surveillance system that covered all hospitals in the state, and individual-level clinical data also allowed us to assess the effect of age, gender and underlying co-morbidities on the risk of death among Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 patients. It reflects that adults as well as young aged were mostly affected by the wave of this pandemic Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 suggesting risk of acquisition of infection by most active and productive age group which should be considered in any future preventive plan. Although children are the principal targets in any immunization programme, the adults also need emphasis in such a situation where they are equally susceptible and risk is high due to movement and exposure. The co-morbid conditions associated with mortality should be taken into account and health providers can recommend influenza vaccination on priority to patients with discussed medical conditions. These high-risk patients also need careful attention when become hospitalized with flu like illness. Besides, early antiviral therapy can be targeted during such pandemics in countries like India, where laboratory investigation for all suspected patients may not be feasible.</p>
