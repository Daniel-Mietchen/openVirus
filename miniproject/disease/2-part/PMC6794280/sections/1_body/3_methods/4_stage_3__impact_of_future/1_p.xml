 </sup>. These different options were, specifically: (i) GCAM-RCP 4.5 (High Climate Mitigation)—stabilization scenario in which total radiative forcing is stabilized shortly after 2100, (ii) AIM-RCP 6.0 (Low Climate Mitigation)—stabilization scenario in which total radiative forcing is stabilized shortly after 2100, without overshoot, by the application of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (iii) MESSAGE-RCP8.5 (Business as Usual Emissions)—worsening scenarios with ongoing increasing, unchecked, greenhouse gas emissions over time, leading to high greenhouse gas concentration levels. Although we only used a single overall climate model (HADGem2-AO) due to computational constraints, this model offers good agreement with other alternative models

 </sup> and a ‘middle of the road’ option in terms of realised changes to future host distributions compared to 32 other models (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). To estimate host presence probability in the future we needed to predict fine-scale future habitat data under the RCP scenarios. As only coarse land-use categorisations are currently available

 </sup> with, for instance, a ‘primary’ land-use having a wide variety of possible natural habitats from arctic tundra to tropical rainforest, we therefore separately empirically estimated future land use-land cover (LULC) change using the spatiotemporal patterns contained within the MODIS land-cover time series

 </sup>. For each grid cell, at the same grid cell resolution as set out above, we calculated the frequency of each LULC change seen in the 2001–2012 MODIS dataset for the surrounding square of 25 grid cells around each grid cell. We converted this frequency to a probability by dividing by the total possible number of changes, and based on these probabilities, we simulated yearly LULC change across the region of interest for each grid cell from 2012 until 2070, and ran this simulation 100 times to create a bank of future possible landscapes. These were then summarized into three consensus landscapes representing low (with anthropogenic changes rejected where possible), medium (by choosing the majority consensus across all 100 runs) and high anthropogenic change, (more anthropogenic changes (e.g. urban, cropland, mosaic cropland) were preferentially chosen across the landscape) and we aligned these three scenarios to SSP1, SSP2 and SPP3, respectively (for scenario details see below)
