<p id="Par23">We allowed those individuals that had contracted EBOV to travel between grid cells (specifically individuals in Exposed and Infectious but not Funeral compartments) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), but assumed for simplicity that the overall net movement of susceptible individuals between cells was zero. As previously supported with empirical data, we employed a movement model that was weighted by both geographic distance and human density
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>, and was also geographically constrained to known transportation routes. The transmission rate

  <italic>f</italic>

 <italic>t</italic> (Supplementary Equation 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) with the probability of travel by road per day 
 <italic>ε</italic>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>). Global roads dataset contains in total 585413 routes from tracks to multi-lane highways and has been extensively validated for Africa
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. We allowed travellers to move freely (agnostic to any particular transportation method or country boundary) across the continent up to 10 road junctions in any directionalong the road network starting from the centroid of the target cell (Global Roads Open Access Data Set from
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>), giving a potential of up to 500 km of linear travel per time step. Each proposed travel end point was given an individual probability from the daily distance travelled probability curve from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> of ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>, which is derived from transport data and validated against mobile phone data. For air travel, we set the potential pool of travellers as the individuals in grid cells containing airports across the world from Open Flights Airport Database
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>, plus all the Exposed individuals in the 8 grid cells surrounding each airport grid cell. We sampled randomly from a binomial distribution the number of travellers per grid cell and time step 
 <italic>t</italic> (Supplementary Equation 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) with the probability of travel by air per day 
 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub>, being proportional to the total number of flights per day divided by the population of that country
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. We allowed travellers to move up to 2 edges on the current airline routes from airport origin using
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. This approximates a traveller taking either a one or two-legged journey. Final destinations were sampled at random, based on all potential air routes having equal priority, but in most cases potential destinations were located nearby, which by default meant that more distance travel was less likely than travel to a nearby location. We decided to keep each edge on the network as equal likelihood due to a lack of comprehensive and detailed information that we could find on passenger numbers at the time of modelling. For both road and air travellers, individuals were then added to the correct compartment of their final destination in the new grid cell and removed from the same compartment of the original source grid cell.
