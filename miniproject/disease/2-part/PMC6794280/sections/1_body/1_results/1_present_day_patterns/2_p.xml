<p id="Par9">Similar to historic data (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), the distribution of the final size of the simulated outbreaks was multimodal with distinct peaks at very low numbers (less than 3 cases) and medium outbreaks (3–1500 cases) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Under extensive simulation, the most common outbreaks were very small, at odds with the observed data, with singleton or two-person outbreaks frequently observed. We are also able to explore the lower probability areas of the distribution effectively and, unique to the simulation data, there is a third peak of outbreaks (here we term ‘epidemics’) with high, to very high, numbers of cases (1500+). This threshold of assigning an outbreak with greater than 1500 cases as an epidemic also corresponds to the top 1 percentile of a log-normal distribution approximating the variation in pre-2016 observed outbreak sizes (~1538 cases per year). Of the ~2500 simulation runs for present day conditions, epidemics (&gt;1500) occurred approximately in 5.8% of the yearly simulations, with catastrophic epidemics (&gt;2,000,000) occurring in around 2.3% of simulations, or once every 43.5 years given current conditions. From the sensitivity testing, the key parameters that affected outbreak size were illness length and R
 <sub>0</sub>, which positively increased case numbers (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5A</xref>), whereas the annual spill-over rate (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5B</xref>) was most impacted by the spill-over rate constant (strongly positive), shape of the poverty/spill-over curve (weakly positive), and by host movement distance (weakly negative).
