<p id="Par11">The increases seen in the area affected is mirrored by greater total numbers of spill-overs experienced in future scenarios, with the greatest increase seen under the MESSAGE-RCP8.5 SSP3 scenario at 7.92 (CI 7.62–8.19) spill-overs per year. Spill-over numbers increased with greenhouse gas concentrations (represented here by the RCP value) with a mean 0.257 spill over a year increase between the GCAM-RCP4.5 SSP2 (High Climate Mitigation + Middle of the Road Development) and AIM-RCP6.0 SSP2 scenarios, and a mean 0.343 spill over a year increase between the AIM-RCP6.0 SSP3 (Low Climate Mitigation + Regional Rivalry Development) and MESSAGE-RCP8.5 SSP3 scenarios. Greater increases were seen, however, with SSP change, with a mean 1.297 spill over a year increase between GCAM-RCP4.5 SSP1 and GCAM-RCP4.5 SSP2 scenarios and a mean 1.475 spill over a year increase between AIM-RCP6.0 SSP2 and AIM-RCP6.0-SSP3. In general, the probability of the index cases resulting in small outbreaks reduced in future environments, whereas the chance of epidemics increased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). For instance, the proportion of epidemics per year (&gt;1500 cases) decreased in the GCAM-RCP4.5 SSP1 to 3.43% (from 5.8% in present day) but increased in all others, with AIM-RCP6.0 SSP3 gaining the greatest number, with epidemics in 9.5% of all simulations. The number of catastrophic epidemics (&gt;2,000,000), generally increased with both RCP and SSP values up to 3.43% and 3.54% for the AIM-RCP6.0 and MESSAGE-RCP8.5 SSP3 scenarios respectively, but again saw a decrease from the present-day level (2.3 %) to 1.19% in the ‘best case’ future scenario (GCAM-RCP4.5 SSP1).
