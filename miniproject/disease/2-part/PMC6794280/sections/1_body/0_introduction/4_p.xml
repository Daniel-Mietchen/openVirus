<p id="Par6">In 2014, a spill-over in Gueckedou district, Guinea of Ebola-Zaire virus led to an EVD outbreak ~100 times larger than any of the previous 21 known outbreaks

 </sup> due to, amongst other drivers, widespread infrastructure breakdown, mass migration, crop abandonment and a rise in endemic diseases due to overrun healthcare systems. Recent work has uncovered the human-to-human transmission patterns underlying this outbreak, using case

 </sup> to demonstrate that EVD spread can be successfully predicted by a dispersal model that is weighted by both geographic distance and human population density. Attempting to understand zoonotic epidemic risk, however, using a human-only transmission model and without incorporating host ecology would inevitably lead to areas with high human density and connectivity being identified as the regions with the highest risk, despite some areas of these lacking competent hosts. Therefore, to model both the spatial variation in spill-over risk and, concurrently, the likely progression of subsequent outbreaks in human populations, we need to take a system-dynamics modelling approach

 </sup>. Key non-linear feedbacks can also be captured, for example, the trade-off between increasing human populations and any potential loss of reservoir host species through anthropogenic land-use conversion. We can use this approach to create a methodological test-bed to design adaptive vaccination and epidemic preparedness regimes across Africa that are future-proof with respect to changing ecological and human landscapes
