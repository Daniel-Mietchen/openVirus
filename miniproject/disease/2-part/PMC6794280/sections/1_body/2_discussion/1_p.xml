<p id="Par12">Our Ebola system-dynamics model, in the absence of case data, is able to recapitulate the known endemic area of EVD accurately, but also suggests that other areas of the continent, such as West and East Africa are also potentially at risk. Despite there being only two known spill-overs, there is a paucity of information to discount EVD risk in West Africa, and given the lack of data to quantify the likelihood of the 2014â€“2016 West African outbreak reoccurring, the risk of an outbreak in this region should be considered valid. These findings support previous work that has suggested that several countries in Africa could be at risk despite having experienced no known cases

 </sup>. That our results here differ from previous case-driven analyses is unsurprising given minimal case data available to build correlation-based models and common problems associated with small data sets, such as model instability, where many differently specified models have similar likelihoods, and biases caused by the limited geographic coverage of case reports

 </sup>. Indeed, the disagreement, for instance, we see between the observed data and simulation outputs, in terms of the frequency of small infection events, could also be due to a minimum detection threshold for outbreak size, especially given very high numbers of fevers being misdiagnosed as malaria

 </sup> have been effective to contain recent outbreaks, the sporadic spatial and temporal nature of spill-over events has meant it is currently unclear where preventative health care infrastructure should be best targeted. Our risk surfaces can be useful here, for instance, as we show that some parts of the endemic area have a higher chance of turning into very large outbreaks (Congo, Uganda, southern parts of West Africa). Also, the scale of our simulations is very flexible and, therefore, our framework could be employed adaptively in real outbreak situations. For each outbreak, for instance, we can simulate the expected spread of the disease and as vaccinations occur it would be possible to update the spatial inputs and rerun the model. Future work could, therefore, focus on making our model an available tool for health care professionals.
