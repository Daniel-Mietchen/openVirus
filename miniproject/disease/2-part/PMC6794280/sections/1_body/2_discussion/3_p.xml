<p id="Par14">There is a similar lack of information to fully understand the true distribution of global EVD importation risk, as there have only been a handful of documented importations observed so far. The pattern we report is effectively a recreation of the shape of airline network when flying from locations that commonly experience outbreaks. Any errors made in delineation of the dominant areas that experience outbreaks will, therefore, be propagated into this prediction. Future EVD importation risk will be an emergent property of the interactions between areas of Africa that are likely to experience the disease, the healthcare response in terms of treatment and containment, and the shape and size of the airline network at that time. Future research could, using our approach, model the likelihood of index cases occurringÂ in different parts of Africa managing to reach every country given different sets of healthcare interventions.</p>
