 <caption>
  <p>Comparison of 2070 EMM simulation scenarios by EVD-EBOV final outbreak size. Circles represents standardized residuals from a chi-squared test of association (χ = 466.27, df = 10, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) between simulation scenario and final outbreak size category. More orange/red colours show a greater than expected (vs. randomly allocated) number of outbreaks for any given combination of scenario and final outbreak size, with more blue colours representing fewer than expected outbreaks. Size of circle also indicates the overall quantity different to expected, with large circles contributing more to the overall chi-value compare to smaller circles
