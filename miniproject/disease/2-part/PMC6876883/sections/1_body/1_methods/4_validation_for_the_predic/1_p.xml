<p>The coefficient of determination,

 <sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to the percentage of the variance of the observed time-series that is explained by the model, was calculated. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) was calculated using real values and predicted values for influenza activities in the validation set from the 41
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2015 to 14
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2019. The onset of influenza weeks for ILI is defined as the weighted percentage that exceeds the national baseline [
