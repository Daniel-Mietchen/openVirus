<p>The non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) are translated as polyprotein: P123 and P1234 (in smaller proportion) (Solignat et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]). First nsP4 is cleaved off from nsP123 to form the replication complex, which produces the negative strand (Barton et al., 1991[
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]); this is detected during the early phases of CHIKV replication. When nsP123 concentration is enough to support an efficient reaction, it is cleaved into mature nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 (Solignat et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]). These proteins, together with host cell proteins, act as a plus-strand RNA replicase, which produces the 26S sub-genomic plus-strand RNA using the negative-strand RNA as a template (Shirako and Strauss, 1994[
 <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]). This 26S sub-genomic RNA encodes the polyprotein precursor for structural proteins, which is cleaved to yield C, pE2, 6K, and E1 by an autoproteolytic serine protease (Solignat et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]). C and 6K proteins are accumulated in cell's cytoplasm for the formation of new nucleocapsids, which are assembled with a copy of the viral genome by means of proteolytic cuts. E3, E2, and E1 proteins, are post-transcriptionally modified and initiate their glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum and translocated to the Golgi apparatus and pack in vesicles to be delivered in the cell membrane. When the nucleocapsid interacts with the glycoproteins accumulated in the cell's membrane, the viral particles under the maturation process acquire a membrane envelope and then they are finally released by exocytosis (Bautista-Reyes et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]).
