<p>The coupling of protein synthesis, RNA synthesis, and the virion assembly on membranous structures assures that the newly synthesized RNA genome can be associated with C protein, thus initiating the assembly process. RNA encapsidation initiates the budding of particles into the ER-derived membrane vesicles, formation of which is believed to be induced by prM/E heterodimers (Welsch et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]; Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]). These immature virions that have budded into the ER, are then processed by carbohydrate addition and modification as they proceed through the Golgi membrane system. It is likely that the transportation through the
 <italic> trans</italic>-Golgi network requires the presence of the glycosylated prM protein, which is obtained after prM/E heterodimers dissociation. prM is cleaved, just prior virus release, by the host-encoded furin, into a pr peptide and a membrane-associated M protein, allowing for the cleavage of E proteins and thus helping in the virion maturation. Virions follow the exocytosis pathway and are released into the extracellular space by fusion of vesicles containing virions with the plasma membrane (Keelapang et al., 2004[
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]). Mature viruses are released from the host cell by exocytosis and the new mature virus can infect more cells (Suwanmanee and Luplertlop, 2017[
 <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]).
