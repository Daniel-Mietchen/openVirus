<p>To date there is not a specific treatment to eradicate the infection by arboviruses, the treatment choice is basically to reduce the symptoms, although, the viral replication is not affected. A vaccine for DENV has been recently implemented to be used in people aged 9 to 45 years living in endemic areas (Barrows et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). However, there are limitations to the application of this vaccine, since it has been reported that people who have never had dengue are more susceptible to developing a more severe disease, if they are vaccinated. In addition, the Philippine government suspended the use of the vaccine after the death of three people due to dengue despite being vaccinated (Dyer, 2017[
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). Therefore, there is no vaccine available for the treatment of DENV (Lim et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]).
