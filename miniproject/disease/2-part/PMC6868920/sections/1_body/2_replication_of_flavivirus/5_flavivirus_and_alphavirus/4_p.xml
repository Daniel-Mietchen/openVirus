<p>For instance, a compilation of studies, from 1997 to 2012, describes the use of natural products of 31 species (that belong to 24 different plant families). Those studies include the analysis of species as Cladosiphon okamuranus, Leucaena leucocephala, Mimosa scabrella, Tephrosia madrensis, Cryptonemia crenulata, Gymnogongrus griffithsiae, Meristiella gelidium, among others. From which, were isolated approximately ten phytochemicals: as Fucoidan, Galactomannan, Glabranine, 7-O-methyl-glabranina, Galactane, hyper√≥eside, Kappa carragenane, Zosterice acid, 4-hydroxypanduratine A, panduratine A. These compounds belong to various kinds of chemical families such as: polysaccharides sulfated, flavonoids, quercetine and natural compounds of chalcone, which have anti-proliferative activity against dengue virus (Abd Kadir et al., 2013[
