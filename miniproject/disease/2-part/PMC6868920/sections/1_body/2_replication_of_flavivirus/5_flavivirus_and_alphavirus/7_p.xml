<p>However, Roy et al. (2017[
 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]) assessed a set of 9 natural products against zika virus, their results show that 6 of these compounds may inhibit the virus replication and have interaction as no competitive inhibitors of the NS2B-NS3 protein. In another study, that involved over 1350 extracts of plants as inhibitors of the DENV polymerase using the domain RdRp of DENV-2 NS5, 49 extracts showed an inhibition of at least 80 % infection, and one of these extracts, obtained from 
 <italic>Cryptocarya chartacea</italic> exhibited 90 % inhibition at a concentration of 10 Âµg/ml. Subsequent purification of this extract reported 10 compounds: 1 pinocembrin and 9 chartaceone derivatives of pinocembrin. The pinocembrin did not show antienzymatic activity, however all the chartaceone derivatives showed different values of inhibition (Allard et al., 2011[
