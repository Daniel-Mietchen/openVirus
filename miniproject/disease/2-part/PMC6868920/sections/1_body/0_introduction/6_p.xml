 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> is dengue virus, one of the main public health problems in tropical and subtropical regions. There is an alarming estimation of 390 million of dengue infections per year, with distribution in almost all countries of the American region. The clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic or mild fever to severe dengue (hemorrhagic and shock syndromes), with a mortality rate of up to 20 % among the patients with severe dengue (Bhatt et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; PAHO-CHA-IR, 2016[
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]). Dengue fever may be caused by four different serotypes: DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, or DENV4 (Kostyuchenko et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]), where the immunity towards the infecting serotype is life-long; however, severe forms of the disease may occur after the second or subsequent infection caused by a different dengue virus serotype, since the cross-protection against other serotypes is limited (Martina et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; Torres et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]). Recently a fifth serotype has been published, however it seems to be limited to the sylvatic cycle only (Mustafa et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]). The development of vaccines against dengue has not been easy, perhaps due to the genomic variability of its four serotypes and the complexity of its pathogenesis. Currently there is an approved vaccine: CYD-TDV (under the commercial name DengvaxiaÂ®), developed by Sanofi Pasteur, however there is still no clarity about its safety and efficacy (Malisheni et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; Prompetchara et al., 2019[
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]).
