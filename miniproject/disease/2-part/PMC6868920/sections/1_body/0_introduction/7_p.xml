<p>ZIKV is a public health problem since it caused a pandemic between 2015 and 2016, with more than one million cases reported only in Latin America (Hennessey et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Two genotypes have been described (African and Asian), based on the phylogenetic analysis (Shi and Gao, 2017[
 <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]). Its infection may be asymptomatic or may present acute fever and rash; the reports have associated the infection with congenital syndromes and severe neurological complications (Musso and Gubler, 2016[
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). These neurological complications can be a consequence of the activation of protein complexes involved in the proliferation and apoptosis processes of glial cells. Although ZIKV presents a mature structure similar to other known flaviviral structures (Shi and Gao, 2017[
 <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]; Wang et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]), some of its clinical manifestation differs from other flaviviruses. Additionally, the genomic divergences among the ZIKV strains/isolates can in turn be associated with the differential clinical manifestations of the infection (Shi and Gao, 2017[
 <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]; Wang et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]).
