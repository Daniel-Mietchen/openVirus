<p>Arbovirus (arthropod-borne viruses) is a group that comprises viruses which belong to four different families: Togaviridae, Reoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Bunyaviridae, these are characterized by a cycle of transmission between vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors and are responsible for the development of emerging and re-emerging diseases worldwide in recent decades (Hubálek et al., 2014[

The Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are primary vectors for arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, zika and chikungunya viruses guaranteeing their permanence and circulation in the population (Leta et al., 2018[
