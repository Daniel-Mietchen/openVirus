<p>The ORF of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> encodes for a polyprotein which is processed by host and viral proteases in three structural proteins, the C protein of nucleocapsid, a glycoprotein precursor of prM membrane, and a glycosylated envelope protein E, along with seven non-structural proteins (NS) viz. NS1, NS2A/B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5, which are arranged from terminal N to C. The process of proteolysis of the polyprotein of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> is carried out through the combination of four different proteases (Bollati et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).
