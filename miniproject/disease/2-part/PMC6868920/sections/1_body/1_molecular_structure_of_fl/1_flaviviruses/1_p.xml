<p>All viruses included in the 
 <italic>Flavivirus </italic>genus have some common characteristics: a size of 40-60 nanometers; an envelope that is covering an icosahedral nucleocapsid, which protects the genetic material; and a single positive sense RNA strand, which is approximately 10.000 to 11.000 bases in length. This strand has a unique open reading frame (ORD) consisting of approximately ~3400 codons, that encodes for a unique viral polyprotein (Brinton and Basu, 2015[
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). These viruses show a type I cap in the 5'-end. The presence of a methylation in 5' cap in the RNA viral genome has an important role to play in the viral translation/replication process and is involved in the evasion of the immune reactions that restrict the viral replication in the host. Presence of Poly (A) tails at 3'-termini, in the 5' and 3' terminal regions, there are short conserved sequences whose functions are still unknown. The 
 <italic>Flavivirus </italic>genome works as a viral mRNA and as a template for the synthesis of small RNA chains. Its organization is maintained between the different genera (Lindenbach and Rice, 2003[
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; Brinton and Basu, 2015[
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]).
