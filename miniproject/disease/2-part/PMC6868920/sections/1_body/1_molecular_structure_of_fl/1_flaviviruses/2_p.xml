<p>In the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, most of the members have the typical genome with a similar order of genes and some conserved non-structural proteins (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). However, they diverge notoriously in the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements of the RNA located at their 3' and 5' ends. For example, the polyproteins translated from the genomes of 
 <italic>Hepacivirus, Pestivirus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pegivirus</italic> begin with an AUG sequence that is found at the 3' end. This is the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). On the contrary the translated protein of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> is dependent on a type I cap located at the 5' end. The genome of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family is organized as follows:
