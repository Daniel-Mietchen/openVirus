<p>The 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus, consisting of about 29 virus species, is characterized by an icosahedral symmetry and a genome that consists of a positive sense single-stranded RNA of approximately 11.8 Kb length. This ssRNA is composed of two open reading frames (ORFs), the one on the 5' end produces non-structural proteins (nsP1-4), and the second one at the 3' end that produces five structural proteins called: capsid protein (C), envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2), and two small cleavage products (E3 and 6K). The 5' end of the CHIKV genome also shows a 7-methylguanosine cap (Figure 1
