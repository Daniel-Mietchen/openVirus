<p>The structural proteins are required for entry, assembly, and budding steps. These proteins are processed as a polyprotein, which are cleaved by capsid and host proteases into C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1 proteins. The proteins E3 and E2 have pE2 as intermediary compound, cleaved by host furin protease. The N-terminal domain of E3 is an uncleaved leader peptide for E2, which may help shield fusion peptide in E1 during egress. The E1 glycoprotein mediates the virus-membrane fusion. The E2 mediates the binding to the receptors and attachment factor on the cell membrane and is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. At low pH E1 and E2 dissociated in the endosome, which trigger the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, thus releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm (Li et al., 2010[
