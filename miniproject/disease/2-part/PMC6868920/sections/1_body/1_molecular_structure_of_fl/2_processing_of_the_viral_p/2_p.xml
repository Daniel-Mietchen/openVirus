<p>Among the structural proteins, the C protein of nucleocapsid protects and encapsulates the genetic material. An envelope glycoproteins prM/M creates the superficial structure of the virion. The protein prM/M has an important role in the maintenance of the spatial structure of the E protein, which is composed of three different structures, envelope domain I, II, and III (EDI, EDII, EDIII, respectively), connected to the viral membrane (Zhang et al., 2017[
