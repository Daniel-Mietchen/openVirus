<p>In the case of WNV, NS1 reduces the regulation of the IFN-Î² and IL-6 transcription mediated by TLR3; nonetheless, this inhibition can be dependent on cell type (Chen et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). It has been reported that the expression of the WNV, YFV or DENV-2 NS1 protein, does not alter the TLR3 translation levels in two cell lines (HeLa and HEK-293) (Baronti et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). This could indicate that the TLR3 pathway is not exclusive in the control of flaviviruses replication and they possess other mechanisms for evading the host immune response.
