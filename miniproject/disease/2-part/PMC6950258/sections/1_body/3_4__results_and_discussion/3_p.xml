<p>Development and life cycles of mosquitoes, and the pathogens they carry, are highly dependent on local ecosystems. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are cold-blooded insects that require specific temperature ranges to survive, as well as water reservoirs to breed and develop [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Tropical and subtropical climate conditions characterized by elevated temperature, prolonged rainfall, and high air humidity hence serve as an exceptionally suitable environment for mosquitoesâ€™ survival, development, and replication [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, erratic rainfall patterns can positively or negatively influence the emergence of mosquito-borne outbreaks. Increased rainfall and flooding events may increase the potential vector breeding sites and habitats for mosquito larvae. However, excessive rainfall may result in flash floods, which may destroy mosquito eggs or wash away larvae [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As virus carrying mosquitoes require aquatic breeding sites, a scarcity in rainfall and prolonged droughts may lead to desiccation of larvae [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Especially during dry seasons, populations in tropical countries tend to store rainwater, which forms a stagnant water environment suitable for mosquitoes to lay eggs, hence maintaining potential breeding sites even in dry conditions. The development of mosquito larvae is furthermore promoted with increased surrounding temperature, allowing for faster maturation. Moreover, adult female mosquitos feed more often on blood and thus may transmit infectious agents with higher frequency [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Viral replication within the mosquitos is furthermore increased, leading to a reduced extrinsic incubation time with a rise in environmental temperature. As a result, warmer temperature conditions mainly during the rainy season, both contributing to high humidity levels, allow tropical mosquitos to flourish, thus, promoting the occurrence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne outbreaks and persistent virus circulation between host and vector populations [
