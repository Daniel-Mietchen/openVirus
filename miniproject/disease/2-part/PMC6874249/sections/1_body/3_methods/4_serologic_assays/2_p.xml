<p>We performed all serologic assays in a Biosafety Level 2 or 3 laboratory. First, we screened samples by using an HI assay for antibodies, as described previously (

 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:20 to H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, H6N6, H7N9, or H10N8 subtypes and those with an HI titer 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:40 to H9N2, pH1N1, or H3N2 subtypes, as previously described (
