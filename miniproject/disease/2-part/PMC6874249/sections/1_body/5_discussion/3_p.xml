<p>Overall, seroprevalence of antibodies against H9N2 subtype in this study was higher than reported in previous serologic studies in China and the seroprevalence was highest in Shandong Province compared with other provinces. Li et al. reported a 3.04% seroprevalence between 2009 and 2011 in occupationally exposed populations (

 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:40, and for MN titers, 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1:80, for seroprevalence to avoid overestimation and reduce cross-reactivity with seasonal influenza viruses (
