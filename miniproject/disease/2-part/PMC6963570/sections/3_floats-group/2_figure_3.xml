 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic tree of whole genome sequences of MeV genotype B3 from patients involved in transmission clusters. Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree, obtained using the Bayesian Evolutionary Analyses Sampling Trees (BEAST v 1.10.4) software [
   <xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The software was run with the general time-reversible substitution model, a gamma distribution for the rate variation among sites, an exponential relaxed clock, and a coalescent/exponential growth tree prior. Posterior support values above 70% are displayed. Transmission clusters identified by epidemiological investigation are indicated as A to E and highlighted with different colors.
