<p>Measles outbreaks continue to occur in regions where vaccination coverage is below the WHO target for measles elimination. The decrease of vaccination coverage and the decline of wild-type MeV circulation pose the risk of immunity gaps in specific age groups, which should be carefully monitored in surveillance and vaccination programs. Measles-containing vaccines confer robust and sustained protection against circulating wild-type MeV strains. Sequencing of MeV genome during outbreaks showed the genetic stability of the virus, with little evolution and no positive selection pressure. Measles may occur in fully vaccinated individuals. These cases are generally characterized by a benign clinical course, low viral load, and no onward transmission and do not seem to be caused by escape mutant MeV strains. Taken together, these findings support the use of the current measles-containing vaccines. Vaccination campaigns should be promoted and enhanced to pursue the goal of measles eradication.</p>
