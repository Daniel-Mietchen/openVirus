<p>During the 2017â€“2018 outbreak, we observed 11 cases of measles in previously immunized subjects, probably representing cases of secondary vaccine failure. Measles infections in vaccinated individuals are increasingly being reported when outbreaks occur in highly vaccinated populations [

Secondary vaccine failures were not associated with particular MeV genotypes, and sequencing of the MeV H gene did not identify any mutation in the epitopes of hemagglutinin recognized by neutralizing antibodies that could suggest the emergence of an escape mutant.
