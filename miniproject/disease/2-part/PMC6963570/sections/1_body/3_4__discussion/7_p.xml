<p>Finally, vaccine failure could be due to inborn defects in innate antiviral immunity and response to vaccination. In this regard, single-nucleotide polymorphisms of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes and genetic variants of genes involved in MeV infection, such as CD46, have been associated with measles vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies and T cell response [

Thus, the role of an individual’s genetic background in vaccine responsiveness and vaccine breakthrough should be investigated.
