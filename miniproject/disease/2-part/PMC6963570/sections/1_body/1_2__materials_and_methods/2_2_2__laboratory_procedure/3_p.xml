<p>MeV was isolated from clinical samples by inoculation onto B95-A cells and titrated by the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) method in 96-well plates. The neutralizing activity of antibodies induced by measles-containing vaccine was evaluated by microneutralization assays with the Edmonston A Schwarz measles vaccine strain and clinical isolates of MeV in B95-A cells grown in 96-well plates. The 50% neutralizing dose (ND50) was calculated with the Karber formula. A neutralizing titer &lt;1:8 was considered negative.</p>
