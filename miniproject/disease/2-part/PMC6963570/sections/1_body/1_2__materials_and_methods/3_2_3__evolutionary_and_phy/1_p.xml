<p>For evolutionary analysis, the most abundant B3 dataset (25 complete genomes) was input to BEAST [
 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] together with the corresponding sampling dates. The mutation rate was calculated using the general time-reversible (GTR) model [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-07-00199" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a relaxed molecular clock, and a coalescent/exponential growth tree prior. The phylogenetic results were further confirmed by repeating the analysis with different substitution models and prior and molecular clock parametrizations.
