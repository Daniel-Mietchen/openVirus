<p>We also analyzed if mutations had occurred in neutralizing epitopes of MeV strains involved in the outbreaks. MeV possesses two glycoproteins on the envelope, the H and fusion (F) proteins. The H glycoprotein is involved in binding to cellular receptors on the target host cells, which triggers F protein-mediated membrane fusion and virus entry into the cell. Following infection or vaccination, neutralizing antibodies directed against both H and F glycoproteins are elicited, but those targeting the H glycoprotein mainly account for protection against MeV infection [

Thus, we sequenced the full gene encoding the H glycoprotein and compared the amino acid sequence of the H protein of MeV isolates used in the cross-neutralization assay, which were representative of outbreak strains, with the sequence of the Edmonston A vaccine strains. This analysis showed that the putative epitopes targeted by the neutralizing antibodies (i.e., BH1, NE, HNE, SSE, RBE, and BH26 epitopes) were conserved in epidemic MeV strains (
