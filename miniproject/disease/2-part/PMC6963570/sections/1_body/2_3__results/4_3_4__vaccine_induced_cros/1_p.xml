<p>The results of MeV neutralization assays in a group of healthy subjects vaccinated with two doses of measles-containing vaccines showed that all subjects had neutralizing antibodies against the MeV vaccine strain and the clinical isolates of epidemic MeV genotype B3, D4, and D8 strains, without significant differences in neutralization titers among sera with different levels of MeV IgG antibodies. In addition, the cross-neutralizing antibody titers against the epidemic MeV strains were not significantly different from the neutralization titers against the vaccine strain (
