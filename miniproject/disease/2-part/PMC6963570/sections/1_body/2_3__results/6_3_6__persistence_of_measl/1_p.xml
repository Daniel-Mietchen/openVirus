<p>To evaluate the persistence of measles vaccine-induced immunity, the titers of MeV IgG antibodies were analyzed in a group of subjects for whom information on measles vaccination status was available and who had received â‰¥2 doses of measles-containing vaccine. This analysis showed the presence of protective MeV IgG antibody titers (i.e., &gt;0.120 UI/mL) in over 90% of subjects and the persistence of sustained antibody levels up to 30 years after vaccination (
