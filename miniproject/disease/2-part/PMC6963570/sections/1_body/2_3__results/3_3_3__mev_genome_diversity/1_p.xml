<p>To investigate the genetic diversity and evolution of MeV during an outbreak, we sequenced the MeV full genome directly in biological samples collected from subjects involved in transmission clusters, according to epidemiological links. A total of 25 full genome sequences were obtained from five transmission clusters of MeV genotype B3 that occurred in 2017, including a large transmission cluster (Cluster A) which started from contact in an emergency room (
