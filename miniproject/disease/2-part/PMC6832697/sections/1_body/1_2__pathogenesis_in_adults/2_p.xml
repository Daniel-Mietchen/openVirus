<p>In addition to the classic symptoms of ZIKV infection described above, the most common neurological symptom associated with ZIKV infection in adults is GBS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00886-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This link was first described during the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013, in a case-control study comparing patients with GBS (cases), patients with a non-febrile illness at the same hospital (control group 1), and ZIKV patients with no neurological symptoms (control group 2) [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All GBS cases exhibited generalized weakness, the majority were unable to walk, and mechanical ventilation was required for 12/42 patients [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Significantly more ZIKV patients with GBS had IgM antibodies against ZIKV (93%) than control group 1 patients, while ZIKV was detected in 100% of control group 2 patients, providing evidence for ZIKV as a risk factor for GBS [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During the South and Central American outbreak, ZIKV was confirmed as a potential trigger for GBS [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with reports stemming from many countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Reported symptoms were similar to the French Polynesian study, and almost all patients had evidence of ZIKV infection based on either detection of ZIKV RNA or antibodies against ZIKV, in addition to a recent ZIKV-like illness. Where reported, GBS onset tended to be parainfectious, with no asymptomatic period between ZIKV disease and GBS onset [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, while 25â€“33% of patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), only three deaths were reported (due to respiratory failure and sepsis) among all GBS cases [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. When follow-up with patients occurred after hospital discharge, it was reported that almost all patients recovered successfully from all motor deficits, although in some cases this took as long as six months to one year, and others retained some level of disability at the end of the study [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, GBS associated with ZIKV infection was not restricted to a single subtype across both outbreaks. During the French Polynesian outbreak, nerve conduction studies suggested GBS was most commonly of the AMAN subtype [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The AMAN and AMSAN subtypes were also reported in Brazil, Colombia, and Honduras, however, it was most common for GBS to be of the AIDP subtype, which could suggest a different mechanism of pathogenesis during the South and Central American outbreak [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nonetheless, these reports identify GBS as a rare but consistent and dangerous potential outcome of ZIKV infection since the French Polynesian outbreak.
