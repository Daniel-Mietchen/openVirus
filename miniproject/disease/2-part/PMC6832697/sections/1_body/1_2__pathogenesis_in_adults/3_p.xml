<p>In addition to GBS, there have been a variety of case reports and case series describing other rare outcomes that may be associated with ZIKV infection. In one study from a hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, these included other neurological symptoms such as encephalitis, transverse myelitis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which is considered to be a chronic version of GBS [

Symptoms such as hematospermia occurred only in a small fraction of men who tested positive for ZIKV RNA in their semen, however in a separate study, it was also observed that the presence of ZIKV RNA correlated with lower semen volume and reduced sperm count and motile sperm count [
