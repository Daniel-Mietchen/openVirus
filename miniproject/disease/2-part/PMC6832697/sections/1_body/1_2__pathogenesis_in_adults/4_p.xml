<p>In recent outbreaks, ZIKV has been detected in a wide variety of bodily fluids, including blood, urine, CSF, saliva, semen, vaginal secretions, cervical mucus, and breast milk (

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Sexual transmission has been documented for ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], however there is currently no evidence to suggest that transmission via blood transfusion, saliva, or breastfeeding may occur. Several studies that have examined ZIKV dissemination also analyzed clearance of the virus from bodily fluids over time. In many cases, ZIKV is rapidly cleared, in line with the acute infection most patients experience. However, prolonged presence of ZIKV RNA has been documented in a number of cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00886-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In one study of ZIKV patients in the United States (96% acquired ZIKV infection in other countries), ZIKV RNA was detected as late as 13 days POS in vaginal secretions, 34 days POS in semen, 36 days POS in urine, and in one case, 176 days POS in whole blood [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further, Paz-Bailey and colleagues found in their prospective cohort study of 252 ZIKV patients that the median time to clearance of viral RNA was 15 days POS in serum, 11 days in urine, and 42 days in semen [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, even 90 days POS, 11% of male patients still had ZIKV RNA in their semen [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Given the possibility of sexual transmission, several other studies have understandably focused on ZIKV RNA persistence in the female and male genital tracts. Similar to the American study above, two case reports identified ZIKV RNA in vaginal or cervical mucus swabs until 14 and 11 days POS, respectively [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In men, ZIKV RNA has been detected in semen over 100 days POS, and in one case was detected as late as 240 days POS [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. One study detected ZIKV antigens in spermatozoa, which provides a potential mechanism for sexual transmission [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Factors that are associated with a longer time to clearance of ZIKV RNA from semen, include increased age, presence of conjunctivitis, and less frequent ejaculation, as men who ejaculated four times per week cleared ZIKV 21 days earlier than those who ejaculated once per week [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These results must be interpreted with a degree of caution, as the presence of ZIKV RNA does not guarantee or necessarily indicate the presence of an infectious virus. Indeed, Mead et al. were only able to culture ZIKV from semen samples within the first few weeks POS, and only when greater than 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies of ZIKV RNA were detected per milliliter of semen [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is consistent with cases of sexual transmission of ZIKV, all of which occurred within the first 41 days POS, with most occurring within the first 20 days [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, although the detection of ZIKV RNA in bodily fluids may overstate the possibility of transmission, the significance of its persistent detection remains to be fully elucidated.
