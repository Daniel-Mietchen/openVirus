<p>Several studies have also characterized ZIKV pathogenesis in pediatric cases of ZIKV infection. In one case report, a seven-year-old boy in Brazil presented with vomiting, headache, and tonic-clonic seizures, but no classic symptoms of ZIKV infection [

Similar CNS involvement was observed in a 15-year-old girl with ZIKV RNA in her CSF, who presented with left side paralysis and paresthesia (tingling sensation) seven days after developing left arm pain, headache, and conjunctival hyperemia (excess of blood in the blood vessels) [

Similar to what is typically described in adult ZIKV infection, maculopapular rash and fever were present in the majority of patients (94% and 74%, respectively), while 48% presented with arthralgia, 36% with conjunctivitis, and approximately 1 in 4 patients had gastrointestinal or respiratory involvement [

The authors noted that symptoms like arthralgia and myalgia were more common in adult cases than pediatric cases, and more common in 12–17-year-old patients than the 1–11-year-old patients, although the implications of this observation are unclear [
