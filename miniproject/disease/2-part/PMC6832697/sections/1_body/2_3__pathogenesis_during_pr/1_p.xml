<p>The shocking link between ZIKV infection and pathogenesis during pregnancy first came to light early during the South and Central American outbreak, when a cluster of 58 cases of fetal microcephaly were reported in a single month in Northeastern Brazil, compared to an average of only nine cases per year over the previous four years [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Since then, improving our understanding of ZIKV-induced fetal microcephaly and CZS has been a primary focus of ZIKV research. ZIKV-specific IgM has been detected in the CSF of neonates with fetal microcephaly, which is indicative of central nervous system (CNS) infection, and suggests that infection of the developing fetus may be required for fetal microcephaly to develop, not just infection of the mother [

Fetal microcephaly and other negative fetal outcomes are most closely linked with maternal ZIKV infection early in pregnancy (first trimester), with one study finding that the risk of below-average neurodevelopment fell by 46% each trimester (

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, a separate study observed that women who gave birth to microcephalic infants had significantly higher serum neutralizing activity and antibodies reactive to the ZIKV envelope protein domain III, compared to control women [

Other birth defects linked to ZIKV infection include patent foramen ovale (failure of a natural hole between the left and right atria of the heart to close before birth), clubfoot, cryptorchidism (failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum), ophthalmologic problems, hearing abnormalities, and difficulty swallowing [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In some cases, fetal death following maternal ZIKV infection has also been reported [
