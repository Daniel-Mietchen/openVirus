<p>In addition to its novel epidemic capacity, these outbreaks have also highlighted the association of neurological symptoms with ZIKV infection. In adults, the primary neurological condition associated with ZIKV infection is Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an acute peripheral neuropathy that causes ascending paralysis. The link between ZIKV infection and GBS was first recognized during the French Polynesian outbreak and was documented in several countries in the South and Central American outbreak that followed [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00886" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There are at least three subtypes of GBS: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). AIDP features mononuclear cell (macrophage or T cell) infiltration into the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and destruction of myelin sheaths. For AMAN and AMSAN, pathology is limited to motor neurons or motor and sensory neurons, respectively. Pathology in these subtypes occurs when antibodies against gangliosides on the axon’s plasma membrane cause macrophages to insert between the axon and Schwann cell, leaving the myelin sheath intact but blocking conduction [

Although plasma therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) treatment improve GBS prognosis, approximately 25% of patients require mechanical ventilation, up to 20% retain some disability one year following the disease, and between 4–15% die from GBS [
