<p>Many vector competence studies have focused on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti aegypti</italic> (the urbanized subspecies of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, compared to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti formosus</italic>, the ancestral form restricted to sylvan biomes of West Africa) [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], which has been partially due to the ease of rearing these mosquitoes in laboratory settings [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as well as the confirmed role of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti aegypti</italic> in the transmission of epidemic viruses DENV, YFV, CHIKV, and ZIKV. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of ZIKV vector competence literature focuses on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (reviewed [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]). The conclusion from all these analyses is that there is substantial variation in susceptibility to ZIKV across 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations, with variations within populations observed across various viral strains [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, given the explosive spread and breadth of the 2015â€“2016 ZIKV outbreaks, coupled with recent evidence of vector-adaptive mutations facilitating CHIKV adaption to a novel vector (CHIKV E1 A226V [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], followed by independent secondary E2 mutations such as L210Q or K252Q [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], favoring 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> transmission), substantial effort has been expended on alternative vectors. ZIKV transmission competence has been demonstrated in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [

 <italic>Ae. notoscriptus</italic> [

 <italic>Ae. camptorhynchus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. vitattus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> [

 <italic>Sabethes cyaneus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In addition to these species, the role of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes, in particular 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, which is often the most abundant tropical urban species, remains controversial. Field evidence suggesting the potential infection of this vector [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] initiated substantial efforts to examine 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> by means of vector competence analysis. Despite this early evidence, the vast majority of the vector competence literature that has been published to date do not support the ability of this mosquito to become infected and transmit ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,

 <xref rid="B100-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], with no robust field evidence supporting its role during outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. However, it cannot be ruled out that only specific virus/mosquito population combinations allow for effective transmission. It is also worth noting that some of these analyses are not conducted with mosquito species in the range of ZIKV circulation, e.g., 
 <italic>Ae. notoscriptus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. camptorhynchus</italic>, which were used to determine if Australian mosquitoes have the potential to transmit ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Likewise, 
 <italic>Sabethes cyaneus</italic> has never been implicated as a vector of any arboviral pathogen [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], but served as a colonized proxy for other sylvatic 
 <italic>Sabethes spp.</italic> mosquitoes to assess the potential for ZIKV to spill back into a sylvatic cycle in the Americas [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
