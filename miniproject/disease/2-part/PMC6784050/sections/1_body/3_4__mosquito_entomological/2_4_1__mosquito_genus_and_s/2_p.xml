<p>Experiments investigating the competence of mosquito genera and species not commonly associated with the transmission of a given arbovirus must likewise be grounded in ecologic relevance. For example, with respect to vectorial capacity, a mosquito species that is transmission-competent for a given agent but does not exhibit a tendency toward biting humans (whether because it does not live in areas populated by humans, or as a matter of host preference) is unlikely to play a role in urban transmission cycles of human-amplified viruses. Therefore, in such a situation, experiments conducted on this hypothetical vector would require clear communication of the rationale and hypotheses.</p>
