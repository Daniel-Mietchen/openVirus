<p>In summary, vector competence analyses, which are critical to arbovirology, involve complex and ever-evolving methods. Given the intersection of so many elements (entomology, virology, logistics/containment, etc.), it is not surprising that there is a substantial degree of variability in how these studies are conducted across labs. The ZIKV epidemic in the Americas illustrates how, despite the large amounts of data that have been generated, meta-analyses are currently not possible due to experimental variances. While outright standardization is currently impossible, the increasing calls for standardization in data reporting represent a springboard that the arbovirology community can utilize in some feasible approaches to increase both transparency and reproducibility in vector competence assessments. </p>
