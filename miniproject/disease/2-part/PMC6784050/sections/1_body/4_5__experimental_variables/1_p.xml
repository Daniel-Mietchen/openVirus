<p>In addition to parameters that are intrinsically vector-driven or virus-driven, vector competence experiments include a multitude of variables in experimental design. A great many of these arise from the inherent conflict that arises from attempting to capture the entirety of complex biological systems with experimental rigor and control, resulting in compromises between the standardization of methods and ecological relevance, and sometimes the requirements for arthropod containment. Herein, we consider the roles of bloodmeal dosage, bloodmeal type (artificial versus live, compositions of artificial bloodmeals, effects of anticoagulants, etc.), sequential blood feeding, and ambient temperature during extrinsic incubation.</p>
