<p>Despite the large body of evidence supporting the higher infectivity of freshly harvested virus for arthropod infection in multiple mosquito/virus combinations, this finding is not universal. In an analysis of ZIKV (strain TS17-2016), two populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Townsville and Innisfail, Queensland, F3–F5 and F2–F3, respectively) were exposed to both freshly (7.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>)/mL) or frozen ZIKV (7.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL). Even considering the negligible difference in titer, neither mosquito population demonstrated significant increases in infectivity (Townsville fresh: 0% versus Townsville frozen: 10%, Innisfail fresh: 17% versus Innisfail frozen: 18%), dissemination (Townsville fresh: 0% versus Townsville frozen: 10%, Innisfail fresh: 17% versus Innisfail frozen: 12%), and transmission (Townsville fresh: 0% versus Townsville frozen: 10%, Innisfail fresh: 11% versus Innisfail frozen: 6%) [

It is worth noting that in this experimental paradigm, frozen virus and fresh virus were generated from disparate stocks, with the frozen preparation undergoing concentration prior to freezing, underscoring the profound effect exerted by disparities in methodologies. Given the wide range of methodologies utilized in laboratory vector competence analysis, it is important to consider the preparation of the viral stock utilized for experimental bloodmeals, especially in the context of standardization.
