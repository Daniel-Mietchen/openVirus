<p>Upon the introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, two hypotheses gained considerable traction as potential explanations for the unprecedented breadth of the outbreak and the observation of sequelae such as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and Guillain–Barré syndrome: i) ZIKV underwent an adaptive evolutionary process that enhanced urban transmission by either adapting for enhanced mosquito infectivity/transmission, or increasing/prolonging human viremias, and/or ii) the virus was stochastically introduced to a region with a large immunologically naïve population with a large population of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, allowing for both explosive transmission and the emergence of rare sequelae [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Given that ZIKV exists as two distinct lineages, African and Asian, with the American outbreak strain being considered a recently evolved clade within the Asian lineage [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], vector competence analyses were able to examine not only whether recent strains are more transmissible, but also whether this was associated with lineage/genotype. Surprisingly, several early studies demonstrated that multiple 
 <italic>Ae. aeygpti</italic> populations were more efficiently infected by African lineage ZIKV compared to Asian lineage or American outbreak strains [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which was a finding that was also demonstrated in one population of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These data appear to indicate that the contemporary strains from the Asian lineage and the American outbreaks are not more infectious in urban mosquito populations, although mosquito population combinations lead to a high degree of variation in experimental outcomes. This finding is best exemplified by one analysis that noted strain variation in terms of infectivity and transmissibility within the African ZIKV clade in a single population of mosquitoes (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, New Caledonia) [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Nonetheless, the unprecedented spread of the American outbreak and the lack of major outbreaks detected in Asia [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] led some to investigate differences in transmissibility between American outbreak strains and other Asian lineage strains. So far, only one hypothesis that has been supported as related to NS1 antigenemia, which was associated with an A188V mutation in Asian lineage ZIKV strains just before the South Pacific and American outbreaks began. The increased NS1 secretion from infected host cells mediated by this substitution, and thereby a higher antigen load, enhances Ae. aegypti infectivity, which may have contributed to ZIKV’s recent efficient spread [
