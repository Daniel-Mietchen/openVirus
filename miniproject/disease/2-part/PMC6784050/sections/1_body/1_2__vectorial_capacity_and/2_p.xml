 <italic>m</italic> = the number of female mosquitoes with respect to the host, 
 <italic>a</italic> = the daily blood-feeding rate on the host in question, 
 <italic>b</italic> = the transmission rate among exposed mosquitoes (vector competence), 
 <italic>p</italic> = the daily survival rate of the mosquito species/population in question, and 
 <italic>n</italic> = the time it takes for the mosquito species/population in question to transmit the virus after initial exposure (EIP) [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Vectorial capacity encompasses a marriage between mosquito intrinsic factors (genotype, microbiome, etc.) as well as extrinsic factors, often environmental, that affect behavior, longevity, etc. Indeed, vector competence itself encompasses two of the parameters that inform a vector’s capacity—“b” the transmission rate, and “n” the EIP; both can be empirically determined for a given mosquito population and agent in laboratory settings. In considering what role vectorial capacity plays in anticipating/addressing arboviral outbreaks, one can consider the mosquito species 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse). Prior to the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) chikungunya virus outbreaks taking place beginning in 2005, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was largely considered to be a secondary vector for a multitude of arboviral pathogens, which was a tenant that was at least in part driven by its more catholic feeding behavior compared to the highly anthropophilic 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These more indiscriminate feeding behaviors, coupled with its ecologic plasticity and the field isolations of a multitude of arboviral agents, both zoonotic and mainly human, from pools of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (including but not limited to La Crosse, eastern equine encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) have largely supported its preconceived role as a secondary or “bridge” vector. Nonetheless, in the absence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (e.g., reports of autochthonous dengue transmission in Suffolk County New York in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], as well as the outbreaks of CHIKV in Italy and France in 2017 [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), or in the face of overwhelming field evidence (e.g., ZIKV-positive, DENV2-positive, and CHIKV-positive 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> pools from the 2007 outbreaks in Gabon [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00867" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]), this species can serve as a primary epidemic vector. Furthermore, even poorly competent/relatively refractory vectors are capable of initiating/sustaining outbreaks of arboviral disease if behavioral and ecologic factors, which play major roles in vectorial capacity, compensate [
