<p>One critical limitation in our analysis is that we do not consider injections of other stimulants (e.g. cocaine, and methamphetamine). A certain portion of HIV transmission among PWID occurs among this population but the data to calibrate the difference between injecting only heroin, heroin and other substances, and other substances but not heroin is problematic and is beyond the scope of this study. Our historic estimates should be less certain in areas where the majority of injection events were with cocaine and more certain in areas where the majority of injection events were with opioids.</p>
