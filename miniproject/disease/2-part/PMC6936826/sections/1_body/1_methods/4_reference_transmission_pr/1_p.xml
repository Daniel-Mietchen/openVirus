<p>Estimates of the probability of HIV transmission per exposure through receptive syringe sharing range from 0.0051 to 0.0189, depending on the genetic subtype (B vs. E) [

 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because most of the estimates of the HIV risk were obtained from studies in Thailand, we assume that PWID injected PH and used HDS syringes [
