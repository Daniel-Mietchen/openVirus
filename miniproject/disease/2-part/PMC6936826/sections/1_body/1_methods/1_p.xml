<p>In building a model we used the following mechanistic logic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215042.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A person can become HIV infected when a number of HIV viruses enters his or her bloodstream. This number (viral burden) is the product of the transmitted volume of liquid and viral load (concentration of virus in a unit of liquid). The use of BTH or PH could modify viral burdens (viral loads multiplied by the transmitted volume of liquid) and the volume of transmitted liquid can be altered by different injecting practices (e.g., high dead-space [HDS] syringes, sharing and rinsing). Thus, individuals with the same viral load in their bodies can transmit different amounts of virus depending on which heroin type they use and which injecting practices they employ. Injecting practices in turn can be affected by cultural realities such as injecting norms, the availability of replacement syringes, and the experience of the PWID involved. If one knows the combination of risk factors and the effect of each factor on HIV transmission, one can directly estimate the risk of HIV transmission. In reality, however, most of the evidence for the impact of each of these factors on HIV risk is either qualitative or indirectly quantitative; thus, we have to consider a number of simplifying assumptions based on available data.
