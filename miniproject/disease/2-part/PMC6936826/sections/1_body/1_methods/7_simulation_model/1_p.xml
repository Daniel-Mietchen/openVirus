<p>Agent-based models are microsimulations that reproduce individual behaviors in the context of social networks and account for environmental and individual risks. In our model we simulate communities of PWID where individuals form injecting networks, can share syringes and equipment, and transmit HIV from one person to another. These models allow detailed description of injecting practices where HIV transmission risk is detangled into individual components: sharing LDS syringes, sharing HDS syringes, and using PH versus BTH. Injecting networks in our model have different sizes and connectivity and implement different injecting norms (high and low probability of sharing). Flexibility in network structure allows us to imitate a variety of areas (e.g. urban or rural) when more information about specific structures is known. The worst-case scenario is set up to consider a highly dense network with high-risk behaviors of agents who use a large proportion of HDS syringes and inject PH. On the other extreme, best case scenario, we consider a network with low level of sharing, use of LDS syringes, and BTH. The latter scenario leads to very low HIV incidence and illustrates an exemplary success case of harm reduction. All other scenarios are between these two extremes. One such scenario is when individuals switch from BTH to PH and less experienced individuals join the network without knowledge of or adherence to the safe norms. Specific model setting assumptions are described below.</p>
