 <underline>The role of BTH from a historical perspective (Scenarios A1 and A2)</underline>. By considering communities with both 95% and 5% BTH use, our model was able to simulate HIV prevalence among PWID in the western (3%-10%) and eastern United States (3%-20%), resulting in HIV rates similar to those observed in Holmberg et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Tempalski et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215042.g004">Fig 4</xref> we present simulated HIV prevalence in the western (scenario A1) and eastern (scenario A2) United States for different proportions of high-risk networks. Simulated prevalence depends on the proportions of high-risk networks, but that dependence is small in the areas with a high proportion of BTH but quite substantial in the areas with PH.
