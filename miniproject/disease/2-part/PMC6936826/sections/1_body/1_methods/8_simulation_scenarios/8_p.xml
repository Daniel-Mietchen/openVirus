<p>We present the ranges of parameter values in 
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Because the actual parameter distributions are not known we used the triangular distributions, which could be viewed as a sum of two uniform distributions and are commonly used in simulations when the actual shape of the distribution is not known. Because of the different nature of the input parameters we assume their independence conditioned on whether an individual belongs to high or low risk network.
