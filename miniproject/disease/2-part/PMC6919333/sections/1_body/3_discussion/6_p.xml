 </xref> Cidofovir has been shown to reduce adenoviral loads in a case series of 7 patients (all of whom survived) but its use, as in our patients, is limited by nephrotoxicity.

  <sup>21</sup>
 </xref> Brincidofovir, a lipid ester of cidofovir, is an emerging alternative adenovirus therapy that does not cause nephrotoxicity and is currently undergoing randomised controlled evaluation.
