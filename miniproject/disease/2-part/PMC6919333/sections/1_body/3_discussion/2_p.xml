<p id="p0075">The clinical and radiological features of adenovirus sLRTI are similar to sLRTI of other infectious aetiology, which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. In reported outbreaks in immunocompetent people,

 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Ultimately, from reflection on these cases and review of the literature, there appear to be no clinical features specific to adenovirus sLRTI. This means that, for admitting clinicians, a careful review of the patient's history and identification of salient epidemiological risk factors (e.g., housing, occupation, known local outbreaks) remain of paramount importance.
