<p id="p0100">Severe lower respiratory tract infection with adenovirus, especially type 7, can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Clinical and radiological features are similar to other infective causes of LRTI, pneumonia and ARDS (including severe influenza) but, as in Case 2 and similar to recent influenza epidemics, presenting symptoms can be non-specific. Positive adenovirus PCR can support a diagnosis in patients with a clinically compatible syndrome and no other identified aetiology, and higher viral loads are associated with worse prognosis. Although treatment is predominantly supportive, early use of cidofovir may improve outcomes. These two rare cases highlight that adenovirus sLRTI should be considered in the differential diagnoses of immunocompetent adults presenting with sLRTI, pneumonia, and/or ARDS.</p>
