<p>To perform ancestral reconstruction of the unobserved sampling countries (
 <italic>k</italic> = 6) and locations (
 <italic>k</italic> = 20), discrete phylogeographic analyses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] were performed using the empirical tree distributions generated for the Central and East African data sets of subtypes C, A and D. To avoid over-parameterisation, for each subtype the location exchange process was modelled using symmetric continuous-time Markov chains [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] with an approximate CTMC conditional reference prior on the overall rate scalar and a uniform prior distribution [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Bayesian analysis was run using BEAST v1.8.4 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] with BEAGLE library 2.1.2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] for an MCMC chain of 10 million iterations, sampling 10,000 samples of all parameters and 1,000 trees for each subtype. We jointly estimated the expected number of country and location changes along the branches of the posterior tree distribution using a “robust counting” approach implemented in BEAST v1.8.4 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Specifically, we inferred on a branch-by-branch basis the history of virus movement between each pair of countries and each pair of locations. We used the R package “circlize” [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] to summarise the estimated number of migrations between countries in the form of circular plots. We also used an in-house script to estimate the proportion of within-country virus lineage movement over time. The script takes an input the “robust counting” files from BEAST v1.8.4, i.e. a tab-delimited file with three columns (source location, sink location, estimated date of virus migration), and a tab delimited file containing 2 columns (location, country), and generates the proportion of virus lineage movement within a single country over time (available from the authors upon request).
