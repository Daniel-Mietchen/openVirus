<p>In an attempt to disentangle why subtype C is more prevalent than subtypes A1 and D, we sought to infer its transmission potential directly from sequence data [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Several studies have suggested a higher transmissibility of subtype C compared to A [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and a higher transmissibility of subtype A1 compared to D [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This could explain the increase in the prevalence of subtype C in Kinshasa from 2.1% in 1997 to 9.7% in 2002 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and to 15% in 2007–2008 (see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s013">S1 Fig</xref>). To investigate the transmission potential of subtype C we consider the subtypes’ basic reproductive number R
 <sub>0</sub>, which is defined as the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case in a completely susceptible population. Assuming a sampling probability that takes into account the number of isolates per subtype in relation to the number of infected people in each country [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], our genetic estimates obtained using a birth-death model indicate an R
 <sub>0</sub> ~ 3 for all subtypes, with no statistically significant differences among subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s012">S12 Table</xref>). However, as reported in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s012">S12 Table</xref>, credible intervals associated with R
 <sub>0</sub> estimates are relatively large and could potentially prevent the detection of an actual difference among subtypes. Overall, these estimates are in line with previous findings [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but relatively lower than some estimates obtained with an alternative logistic coalescent model specifically focusing on sub-clades of subtype C (R
 <sub>0</sub> ~ 5–6). For our analyses, we however favoured the use of a birth-death model, mainly because it has been demonstrated that birth-death models deliver better performances when approximating stochastic exponential population growth [
