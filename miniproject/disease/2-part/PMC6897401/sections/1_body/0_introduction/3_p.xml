<p>In this study, we investigate the spatial origins of the main HIV-1 subtypes using 346 newly-generated protease and reverse transcriptase sequences from the DRC. We undertake a comparative genetic analysis of the three main HIV-1 subtypes, A1, C and D, that have persistently co-circulated across 20 locations in Burundi, DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda and we elucidate their evolutionary dynamics and patterns of spatial spread. Our analysis extends our understanding of the origins of the subtype C epidemic, and reveals distinct patterns of spread of the main HIV-1 subtypes in a region that covers ~40% of all infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
