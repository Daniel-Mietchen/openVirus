<p id="Par25">Most research on the effect of previous DENV-immunity on the severity of clinical symptoms of ZIKV infection is based on experimental models

 </sup>. Cohort studies are the golden standard to epidemiological designs to estimate disease incidence and would give the most reliable understanding of the role of previous DENV exposure on ZIKV infection. However, the reduction in the incidence of Zika after the last epidemic in Brazil in 2016 limits the ability to use prospective studies

 </sup>. Some cohorts previously designed to study dengue and that have been adapted to also study Zika are of great value. For example, a recent study in the Pau da Lima cohort in Salvador, a large city of the NE region, Brazil, found that the titres of DENV-antibodies measured before the Zika epidemic were inversely associated with the risk of ZIKV infection
