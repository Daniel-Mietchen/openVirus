<p>RRV belongs to the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus, within the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family. The single-stranded, positive-sensed RNA genomes are approximately 11.8 kb and encode both nonstructural (nsP1 to -4) and structural (C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1) genes through two separate open reading frames (ORFs) (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Structural and nonstructural genes are initially translated as separate polyproteins, which are subsequently autocatalytically cleaved to produce the individual protein products. The genome is flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (

Previous RRV phylogenetic studies based on partial E2 analysis of a limited number of RRV isolates identified three distinct and divergent RRV genotypes (G1 to G3), described as displaying strong geographical structure within “North-Eastern” (G1), “Western” (G2), and “Eastern” (G3) Australian lineages (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It has been proposed that G3 viruses, which were first detected during the PICTs epidemic, replaced both G1 and G2 viruses following the resolution of the outbreak and are both currently extinct or in low circulation (
