<p>RNA was extracted from clarified Vero cell supernatant using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche), as per the manufacturer’s instructions, with some modification. Briefly, clarified supernatant was filtered and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (4,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 20 min) in Millipore Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal units (Merck). Concentrated filtered virus supernatant (200 μl) was then emulsified in 400 μl of Roche lysis buffer. RNA extraction then proceeded as per the standard protocol. RNA was quantitated and assessed for quality using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently diluted to within working range of more sensitive analysis with the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Qubit RNA HS assay kit; Invitrogen) in order to standardize RNA for Illumina library preparation.
