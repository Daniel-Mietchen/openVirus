<p>To estimate the nucleotide substitution rate and the divergence times of RRV genotypes and sublineages, Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was conducted within the BEAST v1.8 (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) package to generate a median clade credibility (MCC) tree. Prior to Bayesian analysis, TempEst v1.5 (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) was employed to assess the temporal signal of the data set prior to analysis. A high degree of clock-like behavior was observed (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.879) in root-to-tip regression analysis, suggesting temporal signal and appropriateness of the data set for estimation of temporal parameters. The GTR + Ð“
 <sub>4</sub> + I nucleotide substitution model was applied to the data set, under an uncorrelated log normal (UCLN) relaxed molecular clock with a constant-size demographic model. Default prior settings were used for all parameters. Three independent MCMC chains were run and subsequently assessed for convergence (ESS values of &gt;200 for all parameters) within Tracer v1.7 (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). MCC trees were inferred with an appropriate 10% burn-in within TreeAnnotator v1.8 before visualization and editing within FigTree v1.4. To define the geographical structure of phylogenetic groups, isolates were coded as belonging to one of five geographical categories: north WA, south WA, central WA, Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs), or Australia excluding WA.
