<p>Complete coding regions were aligned using MAFFT 7.338 (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), as implemented in Geneious v11.1, and then manually trimmed to remove 5′ and 3′ noncoding regions for phylogenetic analyses. JModelTest v2.1 (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) was employed to determine the best fit nucleotide substitution model (GTR + Г
 <sub>4</sub> + I) for the WGS data set for subsequent phylogenetic reconstructions based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
