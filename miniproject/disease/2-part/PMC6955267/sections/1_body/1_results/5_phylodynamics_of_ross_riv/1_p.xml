<p>Collectively, the phylogenetic structure and tMRCA estimates of the RRV genotypes suggest that long-term RRV evolution is characterized by periodic bursts in genetic diversity, likely signifying the emergence of fit variants. To investigate changes in demographic patterns of RRV over time, we estimated the changes in relative genetic diversity using a flexible Bayesian coalescent skyline model that allows for the characterization of temporal changes in demographic history. The Bayesian skyline plot estimates changes in effective population size through time under the assumption of the absence of selection pressure; however, since RRVs are known to undergo selection pressure (also see the selection analysis), we infer our results as changes in relative genetic diversity to be consistent with previous studies (
