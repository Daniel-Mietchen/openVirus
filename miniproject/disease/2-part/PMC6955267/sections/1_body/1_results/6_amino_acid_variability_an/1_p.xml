<p>Complete coding sequence alignment revealed conservative and nonconservative amino acid substitutions in each gene of the RRV genome. Each distinct genetic group G1 to G4 was defined by unique amino acid residues (see Table S2). It should be noted that even single amino acid substitutions at critical sites of the genome have influenced the epidemiology of significant alphaviruses in the past. The E1-A226V transition in the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) genome enhanced transmission of this variant by
