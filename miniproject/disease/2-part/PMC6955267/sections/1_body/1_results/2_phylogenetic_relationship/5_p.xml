<p>All isolates originating from the Pacific Islands epidemic (1979–1980) grouped within G3 and shared a high degree of nucleotide identity (99.6% to 100% average pairwise identity). Among the six Western Australian-derived G3 isolates (1984–1989), four were derived from north WA and two were sampled in the south of Perth. Previous studies concluded that the Pacific Islands epidemic was initiated by the introduction of RRV into the Pacific by an infected Eastern Australian traveler, as Pacific RRV isolates grouped with the Eastern RRV lineage (

Our data, based on analysis of isolates sampled from throughout WA soon after the epidemic interval, do not support the previous geographical classification of RRV genetic groups and also identified closely related viruses within WA close to the resolution of the PICTs epidemic. Analysis of a larger number of isolates from throughout Australia from this period may resolve the origins of the Pacific Islands epidemics.
