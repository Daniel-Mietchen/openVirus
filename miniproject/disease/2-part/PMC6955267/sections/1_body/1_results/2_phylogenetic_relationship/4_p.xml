<p>Interestingly, G2 and G3 viruses appear to have cocirculated in northern WA in the early 1980s and again in the south in the late 1980s. On both occasions, G2 was likely dominant in the local region prior to cocirculation and remained so after cocirculation was observed. This is the first observation of spatial and temporal cocirculation of two distinct RRV genetic groups. Two separate and distinct viruses were derived from isolate AN572, sampled from Kununurra in northern WA in 1984, one of which grouped with G2 (AN572.2) and the other with G3 (AN572.1), exemplifying the spatial and temporal cocirculation of these two genetic groups.</p>
