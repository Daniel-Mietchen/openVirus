<p>The average pairwise nucleotide identities of all genome regions, as well as additional gene properties, are presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed throughout the genome. The nsP3 gene was the most variable of the nine RRV genes studied in this data set, with an average pairwise (PW) nucleotide identity of 95.2%. The nonstructural genes, nsP1 and nsP2, and the structural genes, E1 and E2, were the most conserved genome regions studied (average PW identity, 98.0% to 98.4%).
