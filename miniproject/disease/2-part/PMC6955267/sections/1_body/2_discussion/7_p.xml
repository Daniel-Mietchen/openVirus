<p>Replacement of the opal stop codon by an arginine and cysteine residue, as was seen in isolates K3011 and P42214, respectively, has been described for other alphaviruses, including CHIKV and SINV (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), but this is the first time these mutations have been identified in the RRV genome. In addition, the loss of otherwise well-conserved proline-rich domains within the hypervariable domain (HVD) and the nucleotide deletions of various lengths that were observed in multiple isolates may have significant implications in terms of RRV replicative fitness, virulence, vector competence, and human pathogenesis that will need to be investigated. Only partial 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences were resolved for all isolates included in our study. The UTRs of alphaviruses play roles in the regulation of viral gene expression and replication and can significantly influence the host range, vector competence, and pathogenesis of alphaviruses (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Complete sequencing of these regions within the RRV isolates will be pursued in the near future.
