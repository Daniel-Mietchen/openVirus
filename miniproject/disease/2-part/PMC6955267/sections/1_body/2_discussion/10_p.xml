<p>Prior to our investigation of 106 RRV whole genomes, analysis of RRV selection pressure had been restricted to 8 genome sequences and 62 partial E2 gene sequences (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Consistent with previous reports for vector-borne RNA viruses, both RRV ORFs were observed to be under significant negative selection pressure. Additionally, several codons within the nonstructural (nsP1 248, nsP1 441, and nsP3 333) and structural (E3 5 and E1 113) polyproteins were found to be under significant positive selection pressure. The internal nonstructural proteins of vector-borne RNA viruses, such as RRV, are not expected to differ greatly in selection pressure compared to that of non-vector borne RNA viruses, as these proteins do not interact with host proteins and therefore are not influenced by host alternation (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). We identified sites under diversifying selection within the structural genes, and this has not been observed on many occasions in vector-borne RNA viruses. One site under positive selection was observed in the structural E gene (E 332) of Murray Valley encephalitis virus that likely played a role in immune evasion, conferring a fitness advantage to the dominant lineage (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The specific structural genome sites under positive pressure that were observed in our data set, within E3 and E1, have not been extensively studied; therefore, the exact consequences of mutations at these sites are difficult to predict. It is of note, however, that substitutions at these sites were mainly observed within isolates of G3 and G4 and may confer a fitness advantage.
