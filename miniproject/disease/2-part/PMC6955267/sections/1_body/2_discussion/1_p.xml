<p>In this study, we sought to better understand the evolutionary history and genomic diversity of Ross River virus (RRV) and to expand the current phylogeny which, until now, had been based on a small portion of the E2 gene. We generated the most informative RRV data set to date with 94 new and 13 previously published near-whole-genome RRV sequences. This data set has enabled a more thorough and robust analysis of RRV phylogeny and evolutionary history and has allowed potentially significant observations within genome regions that had not been extensively studied previously. We identified four distinct genotypes (G1 to G4) of RRV, including the newly described G4, that have circulated in Australia during our 59-year study period.</p>
