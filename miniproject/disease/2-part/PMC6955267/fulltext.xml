Past RRV phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses have been based on partial genome analyses only. Three geographically distinct RRV lineages, the Eastern, the Western, and the supposedly extinct North-Eastern lineage, were classified previously. We sought to expand on past phylogenies through robust genome-scale phylogeny to better understand RRV genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics. We analyzed 106 RRV complete coding sequences, which included 13 genomes available on NCBI and 94 novel sequences derived for this study, sampled throughout Western Australia (1977&#x02013;2014) and during the substantial Pacific Islands RRV epidemic (1979&#x02013;1980). Our final data set comprised isolates sampled over 59&#x02009;years (1959&#x02013;2018) from a range of locations. Four distinct genotypes were defined, with the newly described genotype 4 (G4) found to be the contemporary lineage circulating in Western Australia. The prior geographical classification of RRV lineages was not supported by our findings, with evidence of geographical and temporal cocirculation of distinct genetic groups. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis revealed that RRV lineages diverged from a common ancestor approximately 94&#x02009;years ago, with distinct lineages emerging roughly every 10&#x02009;years over the past 50&#x02009;years in periodic bursts of genetic diversity. Our study has enabled a more robust analysis of RRV evolutionary history and resolved greater genetic diversity that had been previously defined by partial E2 gene analysis.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Ross River virus (RRV) causes the most common mosquito-borne infection in Australia and causes a significant burden of suffering to infected individuals as well as being a large burden to the Australian economy.

Infection with RRV is associated with malaise, myalgia, rash, and potentially persistent and debilitating joint symptoms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). People living in the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory are at highest risk of infection (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Disease notifications demonstrate seasonality, based on ideal climatic and environmental conditions that influence vector and reservoir populations, generally during the warmer months (January to April) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Regarded as both a vector and vertebrate host generalist, RRV transmission is maintained in a sylvatic cycle between diverse mosquito vector species and vertebrate amplifying hosts (reviewed in references <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Based on serological surveys and infection studies, macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) are considered to be the most significant vertebrate hosts of RRV in Australia (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Humans are often incidental dead-end hosts in this enzootic cycle, with a typical infection resulting in low-magnitude short-lasting viremia that is insufficient for ongoing transmission (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A large virgin-soil RRV epidemic occurred in multiple Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) in 1979&#x02013;1980, infecting roughly 500,000 individuals (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In the absence of macropod hosts in the PICTs, an epidemic human-mosquito-human transmission cycle has been suggested for this outbreak, possibly initiated in Fiji by a viremic traveler from Eastern Australia (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The PICTs outbreak highlights the potential for spatial expansion and large epidemics of RRV in naive human populations where a competent vector is present (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>RRV belongs to the <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus, within the <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family. The single-stranded, positive-sensed RNA genomes are approximately 11.8&#x02009;kb and encode both nonstructural (nsP1 to -4) and structural (C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1) genes through two separate open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Structural and nonstructural genes are initially translated as separate polyproteins, which are subsequently autocatalytically cleaved to produce the individual protein products. The genome is flanked by 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Previous RRV phylogenetic studies based on partial E2 analysis of a limited number of RRV isolates identified three distinct and divergent RRV genotypes (G1 to G3), described as displaying strong geographical structure within &#x0201c;North-Eastern&#x0201d; (G1), &#x0201c;Western&#x0201d; (G2), and &#x0201c;Eastern&#x0201d; (G3) Australian lineages (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It has been proposed that G3 viruses, which were first detected during the PICTs epidemic, replaced both G1 and G2 viruses following the resolution of the outbreak and are both currently extinct or in low circulation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Western Australia (WA) is the largest Australian state, making up a total land mass of 2.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, an area considerably larger than most countries. The northern and western coasts of WA meet the Indian Ocean, while the southern coast is bounded by the Southern Ocean. Despite being geographically vast, only approximately 10% of the Australian population live in WA and &#x0003e;80% of Western Australians reside in the southwest corner, where the state&#x02019;s capital, Perth, is located (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). RRV transmission and disease cases can occur in any of the state&#x02019;s three major climatic regions: the tropical/subtropical north, the temperate south, and the central arid regions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Activity of medically significant arboviruses, including RRV, has been monitored in northern WA since the 1970s through an annual mosquito trapping program and intermittent opportunistic sampling (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). More regular mosquito sampling is nonviable due to the logistical barriers of accessing remote areas of the Kimberley and Pilbara (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A routine surveillance program based in the more heavily populated southwestern regions of WA has been in place since 1987, with regular trapping of mosquitoes in high RRV-risk areas along the coast (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Viruses isolated from trapped mosquitoes are identified with specific monoclonal antibodies in a fixed-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, more recently, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). To date, there has yet to be a genome-scale phylogenetic study conducted on RRV in Australia, with only 13 unique whole-genome sequences published and available on NCBI as of July 2019, which includes a single isolate from Western Australia (DC5692, accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/HM234643" assigning-authority="genbank">HM234643</ext-link>).</p><p>To infer the spatiotemporal evolution of RRV in Australia and to better define its evolutionary dynamics and genetic diversity, we conducted a genome-scale phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of mosquito- and human-derived RRV isolates from a range of Western Australian locations between 1977 and 2014. Sequences were analyzed with publicly available whole-genomes previously deposited in GenBank. Whole-genome analysis will provide more robust and comprehensive estimates of Ross River virus evolutionary rates and assessment of evolutionary history and relationships between distinct isolates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Whole-genome sequencing of Ross River virus isolates.</title><p>The complete coding genomes of 94 RRV isolates were successfully sequenced in this study (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).

No isolates belonging to G1, which contains the RRV prototype, T48, were detected within WA during our study period. Nonparametric bootstrapping showed strong support (100% of 1,000 bootstrap replicates) for each of the four genotypes. The majority of isolates sampled in this data set (58 of 106) and all isolates collected in WA since 1996 belonged to the G4 genotype, indicating that it is the contemporary and dominant genotype in circulation in Western Australia. Recently sampled isolates from QLD (2016&#x02013;2018) were also classified as G4, indicating that this group may also be in current circulation in the east of Australia.

G2 viruses sampled 1977&#x02013;1984 were collected in the Kimberley region of northern WA (sublineage G2A), whereas isolates sampled subsequent to this period, between 1987 and 1995, were composed exclusively of samples collected from southern and central WA (sublineage G2B). Three human-derived Western Australian RRV isolates, collected 1989&#x02013;1992, clustered with the southern G2B sublineage. It may appear as though the G2A lineage in the north was the source of the G2B lineage in the south, based on their sampling dates. However, it must be noted that virus sampling in the north predates sampling in the south of WA, and there are no data to indicate what viruses were in circulation in the south prior to 1987. Interestingly, the northern G2A lineage demonstrated greater genetic diversity than the southern G2B lineage.</p><p>The detection of multiple isolates from the G2 and G3 genotypes within Western Australia, which were previously classified as the Eastern and Western Australian lineages, respectively, calls into question the supposedly strong nationwide geographical structure of RRV genetic groups. Further evidence of this lack of strong nationwide geographical structure is evident when a maximum likelihood phylogeny was constructed with our whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data set and published partial E2 gene sequences (see Fig. S1). Notably, G3, previously designated the Eastern lineage, contained isolates sampled from QLD, WA, Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, and the Northern Territory, all within a 5-year period (1983&#x02013;1988).</p><p>Interestingly, G2 and G3 viruses appear to have cocirculated in northern WA in the early 1980s and again in the south in the late 1980s. On both occasions, G2 was likely dominant in the local region prior to cocirculation and remained so after cocirculation was observed. This is the first observation of spatial and temporal cocirculation of two distinct RRV genetic groups. Two separate and distinct viruses were derived from isolate AN572, sampled from Kununurra in northern WA in 1984, one of which grouped with G2 (AN572.2) and the other with G3 (AN572.1), exemplifying the spatial and temporal cocirculation of these two genetic groups.</p><p>All isolates originating from the Pacific Islands epidemic (1979&#x02013;1980) grouped within G3 and shared a high degree of nucleotide identity (99.6% to 100% average pairwise identity). Among the six Western Australian-derived G3 isolates (1984&#x02013;1989), four were derived from north WA and two were sampled in the south of Perth. Previous studies concluded that the Pacific Islands epidemic was initiated by the introduction of RRV into the Pacific by an infected Eastern Australian traveler, as Pacific RRV isolates grouped with the Eastern RRV lineage (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Our data, based on analysis of isolates sampled from throughout WA soon after the epidemic interval, do not support the previous geographical classification of RRV genetic groups and also identified closely related viruses within WA close to the resolution of the PICTs epidemic. Analysis of a larger number of isolates from throughout Australia from this period may resolve the origins of the Pacific Islands epidemics.</p><p>Genomic analysis revealed the expansion of genetic diversity among the emergent G4 viruses since the early 1990s, with two major sublineages characterized thus far. The majority of G4 isolates (51 of 58 isolates, 1994&#x02013;2014) belonged to a distinct sublineage (G4A) which included several recent human-derived isolates from QLD. The second major sublineage (G4B) contains several mosquito-derived isolates from north and central WA (1994&#x02013;2010) as well as two human-derived isolates sampled in QLD in 2004 (QML1) and 2016 (MIDI13). Interestingly, the earliest isolates of both distinct sublineages were isolated from mosquitoes collected on the same day and location in 1994 at Whim Creek in the Pilbara region. The mechanism by which G4 seemingly became the dominant lineage of RRV in circulation is yet to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Evolutionary history of RRV genetic groups.</title><p>To infer the time scale of emergence of RRV genotypes, we estimated the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and evolutionary rates of each defined genetic group based on a maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) under an uncorrelated log normal (UCLN) relaxed molecular clock (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).

Such opal stop codon-to-arginine transitions have been observed in several strains of other alphaviruses, including O&#x02019;nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and CHIKV, and this is the first documented observation of such a transition in RRV. Introduction of an arginine codon into a CHIKV isolate significantly reduced joint morbidities in infected mice compared to that in mice infected with the wild type (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Virus replication did not appear to be affected. ONNV isolates that contained the opal stop codon all demonstrated the opal-to-arginine residue change by the fifth passage on Vero cells, suggesting that variants of ONNV containing both residues exist as a quasispecies and have different abilities to replicate in different hosts (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In the present study, an opal stop codon-to-cysteine (TGT) transition was observed in the nsP3 gene of P42213 (G3), an isolate from the Cook Islands sampled at the conclusion of the PICTs epidemic in 1980. Such a transition has been described in an isolate of Sindbis virus (SINV; S.A.AR86) and was associated with neurovirulence in mice, in comparison with a similar avirulent SINV strain, Girdwood, which retained the opal codon (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>The potential biological implications of these observations in relation to RRV pathogenicity, replicative fitness, and transmission dynamics are not yet known and should be explored.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we sought to better understand the evolutionary history and genomic diversity of Ross River virus (RRV) and to expand the current phylogeny which, until now, had been based on a small portion of the E2 gene. We generated the most informative RRV data set to date with 94 new and 13 previously published near-whole-genome RRV sequences. This data set has enabled a more thorough and robust analysis of RRV phylogeny and evolutionary history and has allowed potentially significant observations within genome regions that had not been extensively studied previously. We identified four distinct genotypes (G1 to G4) of RRV, including the newly described G4, that have circulated in Australia during our 59-year study period.</p><p>Among the most significant findings was the identification of a long-term pattern of RRV evolution, whereby RRV genotypes emerge periodically, roughly, every decade. Emergent lineages were observed to demonstrate extensive geographical movement in a relatively short time frame. Sweeps in genotype dominance were observed in our investigation, whereby previously dominating genotypes were replaced by newly emergent variants. Within Western Australia, for example, G2 appeared to have been the dominant lineage in circulation between 1977 and 1995. G4 viruses were first detected in WA in 1994 and appeared to quickly become the dominating lineage throughout the state, with no G2 or G3 isolates detected in WA, or Australia as a whole, since 1995. The potential biological and ecological drivers of these apparent sweeps of genotype dominance within Western Australia are yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Virus isolates sequenced in our analysis were derived from a wide range of mosquito vector species. RRV is a vector generalist and has been isolated from over 40 unique species of mosquito across Australia (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The diverse climates, landscapes, and weather patterns among the southern, central, and northern regions of Western Australia result in different mosquito breeding conditions and species distributions. For example, in the tropical northern regions of WA, where freshwater breeding sites associated with floodplains are plentiful, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Culex annulirostris</named-content> is generally the dominant vector species. In the south, specifically along the Swan Coastal plan, saltwater marsh mosquitoes such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aedes vigilax</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aedes camptorhynchus</named-content> dominate (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In general, a greater diversity of mosquito species is observed in WA&#x02019;s north than in the south. The genetic diversity among the distinct RRV genotypes characterized in this study may have some impact on vector competence, and it is possible that mosquito ecology may potentially influence the distribution and evolution of RRV in WA. Our preliminary analysis has not identified any unique or characteristic genetic features that are shared among viruses derived from specific mosquito species, but this will be investigated further in the future. The northern G2A lineage was observed in our study to be more genetically diverse than the southern G2B lineage. Genetic diversity of G2A may be driven by the greater diversity of mosquito species present in the north or potentially by the likely greater transmission that occurs among potentially larger populations of amplifying hosts in the state&#x02019;s rural north. Long-term endemicity of G2A in the state&#x02019;s north may also explain the genetic variability between isolates. The near identical clusters of sequences sampled in the south may indicate continual seeding of virus from other locations, possibly, the north of WA or interstate.</p><p>Western Australian viruses analyzed in this study were sampled during routine mosquito-based surveillance conducted by the WA Department of Health and the University of Western Australia. The surveillance program was initiated in the southwest region, where the majority of the WA population resides, in 1987, and the earliest samples from the south in our data set date to this time. Prior to this, study isolates derived from northern WA regions in 1977&#x02013;1986 were collected as part of an independent research project (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Mosquito-based surveillance activities in the central, remote, and arid regions of WA are only usually conducted opportunistically in response to extreme weather events and are not conducted as frequently as in the more populous regions of the south with larger at-risk populations. Central WA isolates are more limited for this reason. The number of available virus isolates greatly increased from the mid-1990s onwards, when the Western Australian mosquito trapping program had become well established. For these reasons, the densities of samples collected per year and per location within Western Australia were not uniform. All attempts were made to maximize the spatiotemporal range of isolates through the selection of samples to represent this wide range, where possible.</p><p>The previous classification of RRV genetic groups into geographically distinct lineages, that is, the North-Eastern (G1), Western (G2), and Eastern (G3) Australian lineages, is not supported by the findings of this study, and we propose that this nomenclature is no longer valid. The Eastern lineage was composed of isolates sampled Australia wide. The contemporary G4 lineage was also found to be geographically dispersed, with isolates sampled in the west and east of Australia. While isolates grouping with the Western lineage were only detected in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, it cannot be said definitively that this genotype is exclusive to the west, as sequence data derived from the eastern states is limited in comparison to our western data set. No isolates of the North-Eastern lineage were sampled in WA during our study period, possibly as our sampling within Western Australia was limited during the time G1 was likely in higher circulation. It is plausible that lineages of RRV were once more geographically structured and only became dispersed with the more recently emergent G3 and G4 genotypes with the advent of increased travel or due to an undefined fitness advantage that supported greater dispersal. A likely possibility is that G1 and G2 were erroneously regarded as geographically distinct due to the lack of representative sampling from a broad range of locations through time in earlier studies.</p><p>All viruses within G3 and G4 contained a unique and characteristic 12-amino-acid insertion within the nsP3 region. It has been suggested that this insertion, first observed in G3 isolates derived from the Pacific Islands epidemic, conferred a fitness advantage to RRV that resulted in increased case reporting in Australia and replacement of the G1 and G2 lineages (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Increased RRV case burden is more likely the result of RRV becoming a notifiable disease in Australia around the time of resolution of the Pacific Islands epidemic. Furthermore, in the present study, we show that G2 viruses circulated in Australia until at least 1995, 15&#x02009;years following the first detection of G3. Our temporal analysis suggests that the G3/G4 group, and likely the characteristic 12-amino-acid insertion, emerged in approximately 1968 (95% HPD, 1961&#x02013;1974), 11&#x02009;years prior to the PICTs epidemic, and so it is unlikely that the insertion itself bears any importance in epidemic fitness. The significance of this apparently fixed 36-nucleotide insertion in terms of RRV fitness and virulence will be explored further.</p><p>Replacement of the opal stop codon by an arginine and cysteine residue, as was seen in isolates K3011 and P42214, respectively, has been described for other alphaviruses, including CHIKV and SINV (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), but this is the first time these mutations have been identified in the RRV genome. In addition, the loss of otherwise well-conserved proline-rich domains within the hypervariable domain (HVD) and the nucleotide deletions of various lengths that were observed in multiple isolates may have significant implications in terms of RRV replicative fitness, virulence, vector competence, and human pathogenesis that will need to be investigated. Only partial 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTR sequences were resolved for all isolates included in our study. The UTRs of alphaviruses play roles in the regulation of viral gene expression and replication and can significantly influence the host range, vector competence, and pathogenesis of alphaviruses (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Complete sequencing of these regions within the RRV isolates will be pursued in the near future.</p><p>In comparison to the phylogeny and evolutionary rates inferred from analysis of the partial E2 (250&#x02009;bp) gene sequence (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), a greater diversity of RRV was resolved. The partial E2 phylogeny constructed using the isolates sequenced for this study was found to be insufficient to discriminate between the G3 and G4 genotypes, with poor bootstrapping support for most clade-defining nodes. The nucleotide substitution rates and divergence times of lineage-defining nodes estimated with our WGS data set were slower and older than the estimates of the previous partial E2 phylogeny. These previous estimates were inconsistent with estimates derived from other studies of alphavirus evolutionary rates (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Our RRV data set was estimated to have diverged from an ancestral strain roughly 94&#x02009;years ago. Timescales have been estimated for other alphaviruses, including SINV (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), CHIKV (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Making meaningful comparisons of these timescales is currently difficult given the various evolutionary models and data sets utilized in these analyses. It would be informative to compare the timescales of these viruses in the future, when equivalent data sets can be obtained with further whole-genome sequencing studies.</p><p>Prior to our investigation of 106 RRV whole genomes, analysis of RRV selection pressure had been restricted to 8 genome sequences and 62 partial E2 gene sequences (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Consistent with previous reports for vector-borne RNA viruses, both RRV ORFs were observed to be under significant negative selection pressure. Additionally, several codons within the nonstructural (nsP1 248, nsP1 441, and nsP3 333) and structural (E3 5 and E1 113) polyproteins were found to be under significant positive selection pressure. The internal nonstructural proteins of vector-borne RNA viruses, such as RRV, are not expected to differ greatly in selection pressure compared to that of non-vector borne RNA viruses, as these proteins do not interact with host proteins and therefore are not influenced by host alternation (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). We identified sites under diversifying selection within the structural genes, and this has not been observed on many occasions in vector-borne RNA viruses. One site under positive selection was observed in the structural E gene (E 332) of Murray Valley encephalitis virus that likely played a role in immune evasion, conferring a fitness advantage to the dominant lineage (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The specific structural genome sites under positive pressure that were observed in our data set, within E3 and E1, have not been extensively studied; therefore, the exact consequences of mutations at these sites are difficult to predict. It is of note, however, that substitutions at these sites were mainly observed within isolates of G3 and G4 and may confer a fitness advantage.</p><p>Further whole-genome sequencing of isolates sampled from throughout Australia, covering a wide temporal and spatial range, may provide greater certainty to our evolutionary and selection pressure analysis and, in particular, our estimates of divergence times of distinct genetic groups. Continued surveillance and sequencing of RRV isolates, from a wide spatiotemporal range, should be undertaken to monitor the ongoing evolution of RRV into the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Virus isolates and RNA extraction.</title><p>The virus isolates included in this study are listed and described in Table S1 in the supplemental material.
