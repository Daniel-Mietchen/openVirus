<p>Virosomes are lipid vesicles that incorporate virus‚Äêderived protein and are devoid of viral genome and internal proteins.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">80</xref> The membrane proteins can either be produced via recombinant technology or purified from the corresponding viruses. During surface protein purification, virus membrane is normally solubilized and reconstructed using mild detergents without causing denaturation. After solubilization, nucleocapsid and other viral components will be removed via ultracentrifugation.
