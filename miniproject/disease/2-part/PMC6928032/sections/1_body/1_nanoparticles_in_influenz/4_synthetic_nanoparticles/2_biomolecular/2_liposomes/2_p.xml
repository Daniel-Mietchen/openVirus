<p>Hong and colleagues reported higher virus‐specific antibodies with long‐lasting protective immunity and 100% survival rate against lethal viral challenges for a cationic liposome‐DNA complex (CLDC)‐adjuvanted influenza vaccine candidate compared to un‐adjuvanted formulation.

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">75</xref> A similar enhanced immunogenicity effect was reported in a study comparing between vaccination with the commercial FLUZONE® Quadrivalent alone and FLUZONE® Quadrivalent with CLDC. Only the Fluzone/CLDC‐vaccinated animals had lower virus replication when challenged with H1N1 influenza viruses.
