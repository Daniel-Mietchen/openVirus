<p>Liposomes are formed through self‚Äêassembly upon dispersion of certain amphiphilic lipids in aqueous buffer.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">71</xref> These structures can be modified accordingly to achieve desirable features that suit their application purpose, such as achieving particular size and charge to enable entrapment of antigens to be used in vaccines. Liposomes can provide controlled release of antigen, while their plasticity and versatility enable them to overcome biological barriers, such as mucosa and skin. They can gain access to APCs via IM or SC injection routes and be used as both delivery vehicle and immunopotentiator.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">72</xref> Advanced methods to produce liposomal vaccines, including lyophilization, cryoprotection, and sterilization, can enhance chemical stability of the lipids and widen their applicability in vaccine development.
