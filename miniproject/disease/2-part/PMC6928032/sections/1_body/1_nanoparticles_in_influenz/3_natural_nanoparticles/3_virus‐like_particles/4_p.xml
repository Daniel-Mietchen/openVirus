<p>Virus‐like particle‐based vaccines have been widely explored in the design of influenza vaccines, with promising results in providing protection against the infection. An influenza VLP‐based vaccine candidate consisting of influenza HA, NA, and matrix protein (M1) (H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013) was reported to successfully elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice when administered either via the intramuscular (IM) or intranasal immunization routes. Notably, only 10 μg of H7N9 VLPs was required to achieve a 100% survival rate against a lethal dose of H7N9 virus.

It was shown to protect infected mice against a lethal challenge from distinct influenza A viruses (H3N2 and H5N1).
