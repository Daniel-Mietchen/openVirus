<p>There are several licensed human prophylactic VLP‐based vaccines such as Cervarix®, Gardasil®, and Gardasil9® against human papillomavirus (HPV) and the third generation Sci‐B‐Vac™ vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV). VLP‐based approaches are also explored as a promising approach for the development of a universal influenza vaccine.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> To design a successful VLP‐based vaccine, the most applicable VLP construct has to be selected and antigens need to be incorporated without destabilizing the VLPs. To achieve this, each biological virus‐derived particle needs to be studied in detail for their properties and possible side effects before use in human.
