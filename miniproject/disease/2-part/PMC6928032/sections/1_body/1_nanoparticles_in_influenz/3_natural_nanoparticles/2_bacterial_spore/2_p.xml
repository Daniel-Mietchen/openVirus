<p>Spores are quiescent cells that can be produced by certain bacterial species such as the Gram‐positive 
 <italic>Bacilli</italic> and 
 <italic>Clostridia</italic>.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Spore formation is a survival strategy that enables the bacteria to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Typically, mature spores are 800‐1200 nm in size and have either a spherical or ellipsoidal shape.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Interestingly, a spore can self‐assemble into its functional structure and when used as a vaccine carrier, it can protect the antigens on its surface from degradation and stimulate an immune response.

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> The spores of 
 <italic>B subtilis</italic> have high stability, low production cost, facile construction, and a good safety profile which earns them the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> Moreover, they can be administered via the oral pathway, where they can protect the antigens from degradation by stomach acid prior to reaching immune cells within the small intestine.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> In vaccine design, these bacterial spores are usually conjugated to vaccine antigens through recombinant technology. However, for them to work efficiently, the vaccine antigens need to be of certain size and complexity to effectively activate antigen presentation.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Apart from that, the possibilities of transferring selectable marker genes, and release of live recombinant bacterial spores, are major concerns. Recently, antigen co‐administration and antigen adsorption to non‐recombinant spores were reported as safer alternatives.
