<p>Tandiflu1 is an influenza VLP‐based vaccine candidate comprising of a hepatitis B virus core (HBc) VLPs fused to four conserved antigens from M2e and HA stalk. Vaccination with Tandiflu1 led to the production of cross‐reactive and protective antibodies, which resulted in 100% protection from a lethal influenza challenge with H1N1 in mice. In addition, serum transfer from vaccinated animals successfully conferred protection from influenza‐associated illness in naïve mice.

 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> A single vaccine shot that contains multiple VLPs against different virus subtypes can result in broad protection. Mice vaccinated with a mixture of influenza VLPs containing 4 different HA subtypes of influenza A viruses (H1, H3, H5, and H7) were protected from lethal challenges with same subtypes and also other hetero sub‐typic strains that were not included in the vaccine.
