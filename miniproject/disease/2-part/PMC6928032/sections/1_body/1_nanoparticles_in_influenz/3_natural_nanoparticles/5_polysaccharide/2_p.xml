<p>Polysaccharides have various characteristics that make them suitable to be used for nanovaccine preparation, including having immunomodulatory effects and a good safety profile, as well as being biocompatible and biodegradable. They are natural polymers with glycosidically linked carbohydrate monomers.

It was reported that the chitosan NP‐encapsulated DNA vaccine induced prolonged release of the plasmid DNA and effective immune responses are induced compared with DNA vaccine alone.
 <xref rid="irv12697-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Chitosan is approved by the US FDA for use in pharmaceuticals and food, but generally they have a few disadvantages such as poor solubility and low transfection rate that need to be considered before being used in influenza subunit vaccine development.

When these materials were used to package whole inactivated influenza virus and administered as vaccines, high IgG titers were elicited in immunized mice and rabbits.
