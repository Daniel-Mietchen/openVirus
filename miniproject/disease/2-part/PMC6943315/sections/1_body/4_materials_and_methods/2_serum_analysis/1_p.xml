<p>Serum samples from 112 cats (37 from the Valdivia area, 75 from Chiloe Island) were tested for FeLV, FIV and CDV. Serum samples from the remaining 19 cats were not available. Progressive FeLV infection was determined by detection of the p27 antigen using a commercial ELISA kit (sensitivity 94% and specificity 100%) (INgezim FeLV DAS; Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain), and antibodies against FIV were detected using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit INgezim FIV (sensitivity 99% and specificity 100%) (Ingenasa), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Due to the low volume of serum available, samples were pre-screened for CDV antibodies using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). In brief, Vero cells (CCL-81) were infected with the Onderstepoort strain of CDV with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 or were mock-infected with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) to generate a negative control. After one hr of infection at 37°C the inoculum was removed, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and DMEM supplemented with 2% (v/v). Heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added for further cultivation at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 hr. Cells were then washed once with PBS, fixed with 80% (v/v) acetone at −20°C for 10 min and rinsed twice with PBS. To prevent non-specific binding, a blocking step using 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min at 37°C was performed. Serum samples diluted 1:100 in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS were added and incubated for two hr at 37°C. Cells were then washed two times with PBS and CDV-specific antibodies were visualized by adding a fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibody (anti cat-IgG-Alexafluor488; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, U.S.A.), diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA in PBS for one hr at 37°C. Finally, cells were washed twice with PBS and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) [
