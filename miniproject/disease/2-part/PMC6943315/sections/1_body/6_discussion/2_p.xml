<p>Canine distemper virus is one of the most important infectious disease of carnivores worldwide and has the second highest fatality rate of any infectious disease after rabies in domestic dogs [
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Evidence of CDV infection has been reported in several families of terrestrial carnivores, including Canidae, Felidae, Hyaenidae, Mustelidae, Mephitidae, Procyonidae, Ursidae, Ailuridae and Viverridae [
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the last decades, CDV has occurred as large-scale epidemics in felids [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that domestic cats can be efficiently infected by CDV [
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, few reports of CDV in domestic cats have been described worldwide [
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], with seroprevalences ranging between 4.5 and 23% [
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CDV exposure in a domestic cat in Chile.
