<p>The results of this study indicate that exposure to feline pathogens is lower when compared to previous urban domestic cat studies. However, due to their intrinsic behavior, rural domestic cats might transmit pathogens and parasites to sympatric threatened carnivores inhabiting nearby natural habitats. In addition, these cats can act as reservoirs of zoonotic agents. This study highlights the importance of performing pathogen screening in owned free-roaming rural cats in order to identify their pathogens. This should be the first step to establish its potential as reservoirs and the risk of disease transmission to wildlife, other domestic animals and humans, guiding the implementation of effective management and control measures in rural communities.</p>
