<p>Exposure to the vector-borne pathogens 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> has been evaluated in cats in large cities in Chile. Seroreactivity for 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. was 86% in cats sampled in three large cities (Coquimbo, Santiago and Valdivia) [
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and 71% in Valdivia city [
 <xref rid="r79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]; while for 
 <italic>R. felis</italic>, it was 72.7% in cats from Santiago city [
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Only a few studies in South America have evaluated the molecular occurrence of 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> sp. in cats, mostly in Brazil [
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In Chile, 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> sp. (18.1%) was molecularly detected in cats from the city of Valdivia [
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Occurrence of 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> sp. in the present study was lower than that reported in Valdivia city [
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Different sample size, type of sampled populations (i.e. demographics, urban 
 <italic>vs.</italic> rural populations), or vector distribution may explain the difference in pathogen occurrence [
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. 
 <italic>B. henselae</italic>, detected in this study, is one of the three species associated with cat-scratch disease and other syndromes in humans [
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Chile, mandatory reporting of this disease is not required. Nevertheless, more than 200 human cases of bartonellosis were diagnosed between 1997 and 2000 in Chile [
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], emphasizing the zoonotic importance of this agent in the country.
