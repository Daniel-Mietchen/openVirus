<p>Therefore, our goal was to determine the occurrence of important carnivore pathogens in owned, free-roaming domestic cats from remote isolate rural communities in southern Chile, assessing the exposure and/or infection with bacteria and viruses with different transmission modes. The free roaming behavior of these cats in rural areas increases the possibilities of contact with wildlife. Thus, the results of this study evaluate how owned, free-roaming domestic cats could act as reservoir of pathogens to wildlife.</p>
