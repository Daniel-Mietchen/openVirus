<p>The domestic cat (
 <italic>Felis silvestris catus</italic>) is one of the most widely distributed terrestrial mammals [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] due to their association with humans, and it has been listed among the 100 worst non-native invasive species in the world [
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Owned, free-roaming domestic cats are abundant in rural Chile, where they are usually allowed to wander, sometimes around natural preserved areas. Their ability to roam increases their probability of interacting with other domestic animals and wildlife species, and their chances of contact with a range of pathogens. These owned free-roaming cats are rarely subjected to any prophylactic programs or receive any type of veterinary care, further increasing their probability of pathogen infection [
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This makes them a potential reservoir of pathogens of relevance for wildlife [
