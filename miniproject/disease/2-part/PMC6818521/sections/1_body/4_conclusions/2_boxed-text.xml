   <p>We used a fast and automated molecular point-of-care test (POCT) for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus on site. This allowed identification of the aetiology of respiratory infections in 11 of 42 (26%) symptomatic cases. All subjects with influenza and close contact with individuals with influenza were treated with oseltamivir.</p>

   <p>In the laboratory the aetiology of the common cold was detected in 75% of the elite athletes. These athletes did not suffer from ‘non-infectious airway inflammation in athletes’.</p>

   <p>Nine different respiratory viruses were detected, causing seven clusters of respiratory infections within the team. Coronaviruses were the most common viruses. Most viruses probably originated in Finland.</p>
