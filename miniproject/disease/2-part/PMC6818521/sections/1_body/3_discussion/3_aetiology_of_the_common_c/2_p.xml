<p>We detected the probable causative virus in 75% of the elite athletes with the common cold. Causality is supported by a 4%–6% occurrence of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic adults.
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> Only two earlier studies carried out in Australia in warm climate conditions have investigated the viral aetiology of acute respiratory symptoms in summer sport elite athletes. In one study the recovery rate was 29% and in the other it was 27%.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> These low detection rates led to the commonly cited conclusion that in the majority of cases the symptoms could be due to non-infectious airway inflammation. Our observations in winter sport athletes do not support that conclusion. The virus recovery rate of 75% in elite athletes is as high as in other aetiological studies in adults.
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> A higher viral recovery rate in adults may not be obtained because PCR tests may detect only 50%–90% of serologically diagnosed respiratory virus infections.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 32</xref> The occurrence of respiratory infections tended to be more common in elite athletes than in other team members. The difference may be explained by higher physical and psychological stress in elite athletes. It is of interest that the severity of illness among the athletes did not differ from that among the staff (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Before and during the Winter Games, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were occurring in Finland and influenza and coronavirus epidemics were under way in South Korea. The prevailing virus epidemics obviously contributed to the transmission of the infections.
