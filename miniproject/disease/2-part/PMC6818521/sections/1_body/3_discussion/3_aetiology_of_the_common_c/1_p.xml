<p>Our study is the first to detect the aetiology of respiratory infections in elite athletes using molecular POCT at a major event. All available POCT virus diagnoses (positive and negative) were later confirmed at a laboratory. Diagnostics had clinical implications in the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infections. In addition to early treatment with oseltamivir, POCT enabled effective post-contact oseltamivir prophylaxis for close contacts, for example, those living in the same accommodation or travelling on the same flight or in the same vehicle.
