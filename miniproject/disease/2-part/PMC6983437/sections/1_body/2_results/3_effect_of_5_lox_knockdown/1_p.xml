<p>We hypothesized that daidzein affected 5-LOX-mediated enzymatic oxidation of AA, as zileuton inhibited daidzein-induced antiviral activity. We attempted to knockdown endogenous 5-LOX by transfection with a siRNA against canine-5-LOX. Based on the immunoblotting results (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C), 5-LOX expression levels in MDCK cells were suppressed. We then measured the influenza virus titer in the culture medium. In control siRNA-transfected MDCK cells, daidzein inhibited virus replication by approximately 50.8% [flu: flu + daidzein, inhibition rate = 100 – 100 × 4.91 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/9.99 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> (%)] (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). In contrast, following knockdown of 5-LOX, daidzein reduced virus replication to 26.5% [flu: flu + daidzein, inhibition rate = 100 – 100 × 7.07 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/9.62 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> (%)] (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). The difference in the viral titer between daidzein-treated control siRNA MDCK cells (4.91 ± 1.18 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml) and daidzein-treated 5-LOX knockdown MDCK cells (7.07 ± 1.53 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> FFU/ml) was significant (
