<p>The titer of influenza virus in the culture medium decreased in a dose-dependent manner following addition of daidzein (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Daidzein inhibited influenza virus multiplication at an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 51.2 µM (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The effect of daidzein addition on the cell viability of MDCK cells was analyzed, however, it was found that cell proliferation was not affected by up to 400 µM of daidzein (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). To clarify the mechanism of antiviral activity of daidzein, the following experiments were performed with the addition of a daidzein concentration fixed at 275 µM. This concentration of daidzein in the culture medium inhibited influenza virus multiplication by approximately 85% and did not exert toxicity on MDCK cells.
