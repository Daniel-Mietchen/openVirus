<p> The cells for analysis of 5-LOX activity were prepared by culturing non-infected monolayer sheets of MDCK cells in 10-cm dishes supplemented with or without 275 µM daidzein (mock-treated cells: 3 dishes and daidzein-treated cells: 3 dishes). After 24 h, the dishes were washed twice with PBS. The cells were harvested into 1.5-ml tubes containing 500 µl of 2% bovine serum albumin containing DMEM using a cell-scraper. The cells were homogenized and then evenly divided into six tubes. Arachidonic acid (AA) was added to each tube to a final concentration of 120 µM and incubated for 180 min at 37°C with gentle mixing with a microtube mixer. After 180 min of incubation, 4 volumes of methanol containing 100 µM 2,6-di-
 <italic>t</italic>-butyl-4-methylphenol (Wako) was added. The tubes were mixed by vortexing for 1 min, and then centrifuged at 12,500 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant (500 µl) was either stored at −80°C or used to detect 5-, 12-, and 15-HETE and AA. HETEs and AA were measured as described above for lipid peroxide analysis. The content of HETEs and AA was normalized to the protein concentration, which was measured by BCA protein assay.
