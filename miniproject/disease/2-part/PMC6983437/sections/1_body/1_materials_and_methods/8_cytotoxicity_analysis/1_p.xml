<p>The WST-8 assay [using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan)] is a modified MTT assay that measures the mitochondrial reduction capacity and can quantify cell viability.

 </sup> After treatment with daidzein or 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HpETE), the cells in 96-well plates were incubated with 10 µl of Cell Counting Kit-8 solution {containing with 4-[3-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate sodium salt} in medium for 1 h at 37°C. Absorbance was measured photometrically at 450 nm. Cell viabilities were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance measured in non-treated cells.
