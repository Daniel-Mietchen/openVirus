<p>To analyze lipid peroxides, the concentration of 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHCh), a cholesterol-derived peroxidation product, 4 isomers of hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), which are linoleate-derived peroxidation products, and 3 isomers of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 8-iso-prostaglandin F
 <sub>2α</sub> (8-iso-PGF
 <sub>2α</sub>), which are arachidonate-derived peroxidation products, were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (HODEs, HETEs, and 8-iso-PGF
 <sub>2α</sub>) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7β-OHCh) as previously described.
