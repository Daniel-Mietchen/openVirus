 </sup> reported the pharmacokinetics of the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein in humans. Subjects consumed single soybean flour-based meal (0.84 g flour/kg body weight) and plasma concentration of isoflavones were analyzed throughout the 35-h post-meal period. This soybean flour-based meal provided 2.7 µmol/kg body weight of daidzein. Daidzein concentration in plasma reached maximum values of 3.14 ± 0.36 µmol/L.

 </sup> A subject weighting 60 kg would have consumed 41.2 mg (162 µmol) of daidzein. Based on the results of this report, in order to increase the plasma concentration of daidzein to 51.2 µM, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for anti-influenza activity, it is estimated that 667.4 mg of daidzein must be consumed. On the other hand, Cheng

 </sup> reported the effect of a high dose of isoflavones (300 mg/day) on coagulation function in postmenopausal women. After 1-year treatment with a high dose of isoflavones, the changes in liver function, hematological parameters, and coagulation test were not different from those of the control subjects.

 </sup> The dose of isoflavones administered in this clinical study corresponds to less than half of the estimated dose of daidzein that can exert anti-influenza activity. The duration of daidzein administration for the treatment of influenza infection is thought to be 5 days. Further research is necessary to examine the safety of short-term high dose administration of daidzein.
