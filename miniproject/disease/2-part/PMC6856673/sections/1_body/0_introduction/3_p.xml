<p>In operational SyS systems, syndrome TS are monitored with automated aberration detection algorithms in order to detect unexpected changes that could potentially be caused by an epidemic. A useful criterion for selecting a specific syndrome TS for a SyS system is an assessment of the nature of the change that can be detected. Any syndrome TS that is monitored with any aberration detection algorithm should be able to detect a sudden and very large variation in the number of cases reported. However, detecting a large change in a syndrome TS is of little interest for surveillance if the aim is early detection of disease epidemics. In this case detecting small changes in a time series which may represent the onset of an epidemic is of greater importance. Changes in syndrome TS should be detected with a high degree of certainty and as soon as possible after the epidemic has started. Estimating the minimum size of an epidemic that could potentially be detected in a syndrome TS may serve as a useful criteria for comparing syndrome TS performance and provide guidance for their selection.</p>
