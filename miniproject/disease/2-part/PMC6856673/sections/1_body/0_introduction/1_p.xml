<p>Early warning systems are critically important for controlling emerging or reemerging diseases. Dealing with a disease epidemic in its early stages is easier and more economical than dealing with an epidemic that has become large and widespread (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Traditional passive early detection systems rely on reports submitted to veterinary public health authorities by various healthcare stakeholders when they observe suspect cases in the field. This surveillance activity covers a large part of the animal population and the costs associated with data collection and analysis are relatively low (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, the performance of these passive surveillance systems suffers from frequent under-reporting due to the lack of stakeholder awareness, especially regarding emerging diseases, and fear of the consequences of reporting a disease occurrence (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To enhance traditional passive surveillance systems, real-time or near real-time surveillance systems have been developed. These systems, commonly called syndromic surveillance (SyS) systems (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), are based on pre-diagnostic often unspecific routinely collected data which is available prior to laboratory confirmation of the causative agent of an epidemic. A great variety of data can be used for syndromic surveillance (e.g., laboratory requests, milk production, Google queries, and many others). These data are converted to time series (TS) for monitoring and are referred to as syndromes (
