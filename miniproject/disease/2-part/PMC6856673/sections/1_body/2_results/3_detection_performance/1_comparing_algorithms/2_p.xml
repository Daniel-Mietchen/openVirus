<p>Despite the similarities mentioned above, the two algorithms had different relative performance depending on the syndrome TS. The Holt-Winters algorithm outperformed EWMA for 12 syndrome TS: 
 <italic>AMD_stillbirth, AMD_mortality_calves, AMD_mortality_adults, ASR_OTHER_adults, ALIS_abortion, ALIS_BVD, ASR_GI_calves, ASR_calves, ASR_RESPI_calves, ASR_RESPI_adults, ASR_GI_adults</italic>, and 
 <italic>ASR_adults</italic>. The EWMA algorithm outperformed HW for only 2 syndrome TS: 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_young</italic>, and 
 <italic>ALIS_IBR</italic>. Both algorithms had equivalent sensitivity and specificity for 2 syndrome TS: 
 <italic>ASR_abortion</italic>, and 
 <italic>ASR_OTHER_calves</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The HW algorithm had equivalent or a better balance between detection timeliness and the average number of false positive alarms than EWMA in most syndrome TS (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). However, EWMA had better timeliness for 
 <italic>ALIS_IBR</italic> and 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_young</italic>.
