<p>Syndrome TS with lower mean weekly counts (e.g., 
 <italic>ASR_RESPI_calves, ASR_GI_calves, ASR_abortion, ASR_OTHER_adults, ASR_OTHER_calves</italic>) were better for detecting all epidemics, as there was a general increase in the overall detection performance for all metrics as the mean weekly count in the syndrome TS decreased (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, the relationship varied between metrics. 
 <italic>Se</italic> and 
 <italic>Sp</italic> decreased in syndrome TS with the largest mean weekly counts (Spearman ρ coefficients equal to 0.878; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for 
 <italic>Se</italic>, and 0.941; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for 
 <italic>Sp</italic>). PPV had the strongest relationship with syndrome TS mean weekly count. The smaller the mean weekly count the larger the PPV ranging from 44.9 to 97.4 in syndrome TS with the largest to smallest mean weekly counts, respectively (Spearman ρ coefficient 0.95; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The average number of false positive signals per year decreased for syndrome TS with the largest to the smallest mean weekly counts, respectively (Spearman ρ coefficient −0.945; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Timeliness decreased when the weekly mean number of counts increased (Spearman ρ coefficient −0.943; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). NPV had the weakest relationship with syndrome TS mean weekly count (Spearman ρ coefficient 0.610; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.012). The observation that increased detection performance was associated with decreased mean weekly counts was not related to decreasing relative variance in syndrome TS with smaller weekly mean counts. The CV increased as the mean weekly count of the syndrome TS decreased (Spearman ρ coefficient −0.863; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).
