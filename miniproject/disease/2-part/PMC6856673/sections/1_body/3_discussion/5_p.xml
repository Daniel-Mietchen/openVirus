<p>Syndrome TS that do not perform well for detecting small epidemics may have other uses in surveillance (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). SyS data can be used to define the normal behavior of disease and pathogens in animal populations in the absence of a specific epidemic. This information may have value for setting national benchmarks (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) or for supporting other surveillance programs (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). SyS may provide some evidence for the absence of certain diseases, or it may help to better understand farmers' production practices and veterinarians' clinical practices. Bovine Virus Diarrhea and IBR in Switzerland and the associated syndrome TS (
 <italic>ALIS_BVD</italic> and 
 <italic>ALIS_IBR)</italic> are a good illustration of the potential alternative use of syndrome TS. Switzerland started an eradication program for BVD in 2008 which dramatically reduced the number of BVD cases (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and the country has been officially free from IBR since 1990 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In our study, both syndrome TS had poor detection performance. Using other syndrome TS alone or a combination of syndrome TS, could potentially be more effective for early detection of a new epidemic of BVD or IBR in Switzerland. The syndrome TS 
 <italic>ALIS_BVD</italic> and 
 <italic>ALIS_IBR</italic> may have more value for monitoring long term trends in the epidemiological situation of the two diseases. This information could be especially relevant for BVD, as Switzerland is not free from the disease. The 
 <italic>ALIS_BVD</italic> syndrome TS could be used to monitor long term trends in the number of suspect BVD cases, which may be useful for monitoring the impact of control measures, or farmer and veterinarian responses to these control programs.
