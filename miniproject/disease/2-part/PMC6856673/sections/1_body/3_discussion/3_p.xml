<p>In our study, overall detection performance (collated for all epidemic types) differed greatly from individual detection performance for epidemics of different magnitudes. It was not surprising that detection performance was lower for small and very small epidemics compared to larger epidemics. Small increases in cases per unit of time can easily remain unnoticed in the background noise of a TS, especially when the TS contains on average, a large numbers of cases per unit of time. Other studies have assessed TS detection performance using epidemics of different magnitude, but only reported overall detection performance by collating the results obtained for epidemics of different magnitude [see for example (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)]. Our study demonstrated that overall detection performance may result in misleading interpretations of the sensitivity and specificity of the surveillance system. Overall detection performance may mask the fact that a specific detection algorithm applied to a specific TS may actually only detect large increases in the number of cases. For example, 
 <italic>AMD_mortality_calves</italic> syndrome TS performed very well overall (Sensitivity = 85.9 and specificity = 89.9 for all epidemics combined) but performed poorly for detecting very small and small epidemics, as only 60.6% of the very small epidemics and 71.6% of the small epidemics were detected. We strongly recommend that in future studies researchers report the specific detection performance obtained for different epidemic sizes and shapes in order to avoid overestimating the overall detection performance of the surveillance system.
