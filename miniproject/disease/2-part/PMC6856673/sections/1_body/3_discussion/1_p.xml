<p>In this study, different syndrome TS performed differently depending on the type and magnitude of simulated epidemic, suggesting that all syndrome TS are not equally suited for detecting all types and magnitudes of epidemics. Our study illustrates that the event detection performance is dependent on the characteristics of three components: the syndrome TS, the epidemic, and the aberration detection algorithm. Since these three components are interrelated, they should be evaluated together.</p>
