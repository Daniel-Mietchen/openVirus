<p>The 
 <italic>ASR</italic> (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asr-ch.ch/en/asr/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://asr-ch.ch/en/asr/</ext-link>) is the private umbrella organization of the Swiss cattle breeding organizations. Beginning in 2013 the ASR developed and implemented a database containing cattle illness diagnoses reported by farmers and veterinarians. All cases were reported using a coding system with four levels ranging from least specific (i.e., organ affected) to most specific (e.g., infectious agent isolated). Data were available for the most common cattle breeds in Switzerland: Braunvieh, Fleckvieh, and Holstein, which represent the majority of the Swiss dairy cattle population. No data about beef cattle were available. The timeliness of reporting to this database is unknown. Data were available from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 2016. Three syndrome TS were created based on the age category of diseased animal: abortions (
 <italic>ASR_abortion</italic>), diseased calves (
 <italic>ASR_calves</italic>), and diseased adults (
 <italic>ASR_adults</italic>). In the ASR database calves are defined as cattle up to 6 months of age. Abortions are defined as calves born dead, or born alive but having died within the first 24 h of life. The syndrome TS 
 <italic>ASR_calves</italic> and 
 <italic>ASR_adults</italic> were each split into three syndrome TS based on the most frequent diagnostic classification found in the database: gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., 
 <italic>ASR_GI_calves</italic> and 
 <italic>ASR_GI_adults</italic>), respiratory symptoms (i.e., ASR_
 <italic>RESPI_calves</italic> and 
 <italic>ASR_RESPI_adults</italic>), and cattle having a classification of “other” in the ASR classification schema (i.e., 
 <italic>ASR_OTHER_calves</italic> and 
 <italic>ASR_OTHER_adults</italic>). The category “other” encompasses various unspecific symptoms such as fever, anorexia, changing behavior or reduced production. The precise coverage of the dairy cattle population by the ASR is unknown but it is expected to be high.
