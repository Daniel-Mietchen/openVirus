<p>A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and, assuming equal costs for false negative and false positive alarms, we graphically defined the optimal alarm threshold where 
 <italic>Se</italic> and 
 <italic>Sp</italic> were at a maximum. The timeliness of the first alarm raised during an epidemic time period was computed. Detection timeliness was the time lag (in weeks) between the start of the epidemic and the first alarm. A value of 1 meant that the first alarm was raised during the second week of the epidemic. Single spikes were excluded from the computation of the detection timeliness as they always lead to detection on the first, and only week of the epidemic. The cumulative number of cases occurring because of the epidemic when the first alarm was raised (
 <italic>cum_cases</italic>) was also calculated. We calculated Spearman's nonparametric correlation coefficients (œÅ) to test the association between the size of the syndrome TS (in terms of counts per week) and the detection performance of the syndrome TS.
