<p>All statistical analyses were implemented in R x64 version 3.4.1 (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Dynamic regression was performed with the functions glm (package “stats”), glm.nb [package “MASS” (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)], and stl [package “forecast” (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)]. The stl function was also used to estimate the detrended and remainder component of each syndrome TS and calculate the strength of the seasonality. The expected numbers of counts at time t for HW were estimated with the predict functions of the “forecast” packages. EWMA and HW aberration detection algorithms were executed using the package “Vetsyn” package (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).
