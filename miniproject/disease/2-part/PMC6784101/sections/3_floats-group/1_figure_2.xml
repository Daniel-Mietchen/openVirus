  <p>Worldwide spread of major epidemic Chikungunya clades: Asian Urban American (AUL-Am), ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (ECSA-IOL) and ECSA Middle Africa South America (ECSA-MASA). This figure is rendered using the R package Leaflet with the underlying data based on parsimony ancestral reconstruction of metadata for place of isolation on the tree resulting from neighbor-joining tree search with collapsed branches under 80% bootstrap threshold (see Materials and Methods for more details). The circles on the map represent locations from which a transmission event originates. The color transparency represents the number of times a transition between characters occur on a location (node) or between locations (edge) (darker lines = more transitions). Boxes labeled “I” and “II” indicate that line crossed the International Date Line (e.g., AUL) or the shortest physical path between the two points (for mapping purposes only) was through the North Pole (e.g., ECSA-IOL).</p>
