  <p>Schematic of the 3â€™UTR architecture of all major CHIKV strains. The phylogeny on the left is derived from a maximum-likelihood tree based on a genomic alignment of six representative sequences. For each strain, the sequence with the longest UTR was selected as a representative (WA: AY726732.1, ECSA-IOL: JF274082.1, ECSA-MASA: KY038946.1, AUL-Cbn: KT327163.2 (Mexico), AUL-Am: MF001517.1 (USA), AUL-Asia: KF318729.1 (China). All boxes correspond to exact coordinates of annotated structural/nonstructural elements. A scale bar is provided for the nucleotide coordinates.</p>
