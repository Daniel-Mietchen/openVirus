 <caption>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>d</bold>) Secondary structure cartoons, structural alignments and base-pair probability plots (dot plots) of the structured CHIKV 3’UTR elements SL-Y, CSE, SL-a, and SL-b. Colored squares in the dot plot report a pairing of two bases, with full squares corresponding to 100% pairing probability. The base pairings pattern of the corresponding most stable, minimum free energy structures are shown in the lower triangles, while the upper triangles show the base pairing probabilities considering all possible alternative, suboptimal structures. Colors in structure drawings, alignments and dot plots indicate how many different types of base combinations are found for a particular base pair (red: 1; yellow: 2). All structure plots show the consensus structures as calculated by 
   <monospace>RNAalifold</monospace> [
   <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. For each structure, the free energy (E) and the 
   <monospace>RNAz</monospace> [
   <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] z-score (z) are provided. Negative z-scores indicate a structure is more stable than it would be expected for other RNAs of the same dinucleotide content. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Sequence logo of the intrinsically unstructured repeat element UR, computed from all HMM-derived homologous sequences within the data set. Structure cartoons are not shown since the overall base pairing probability is essentially zero for this sequence.
