<p>Assessing each CHIKV taxon as an individual, and bearing in mind the concept of phylogenetic independence, we cannot conclusively state that CHIKV sequences isolated in the Americas are divergent enough from ancestral sequences in Africa and Asia to be considered two new American lineages. This logic, however, is limited when considering the similar phylogenetic structure of IOL rising from Eastern African taxa. This non-uniformity represents the difficulty in qualifying lineages based on subjective interpretation.</p>
