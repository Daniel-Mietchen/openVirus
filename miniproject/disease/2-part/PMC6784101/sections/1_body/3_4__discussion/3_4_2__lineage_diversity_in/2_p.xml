<p>Asian Urban and IOL are the main lineages of CHIKV in Asia [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Moreover, Asian Urban has since emerged in Central America in 2013 and South America in 2014 [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] forming the AUL-Am clade. The Americas faced a devastating outbreak in 2013â€“2014 after the AUL lineage was introduced to the Caribbean [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], causing nearly 3,000,000 estimated cases. In 2014, the ECSA lineage was detected in Brazil as well [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Based on our phylogeny, the additional sister group lineage to both ECSA-IOL and ECSA-MASA, which encompasses Southern African isolates and is related to a few Asian isolates (of the African/Asian lineage) has no major outbreaks reported.
