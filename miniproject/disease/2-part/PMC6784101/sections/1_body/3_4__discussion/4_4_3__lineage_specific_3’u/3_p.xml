<p>The structural aspects of alphavirus RNA is understudied when compared to other arboviruses. While repeat motifs were shown to be a crucial architectural pattern in alphavirus UTRs, many studies focused on the role and nature of these sequence repeats, without asking how far RNA structure might be the evolutionary driving force behind UTR evolution. A recent study employing SHAPE structure probing (selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) experiments could not find evidence for large-scale structural conservation of RNA within alphaviruses [

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] could associate RNA structure elements with replication efficiency and antiviral response [
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. We identified structured elements in the 5’UTR of CHIKV, however did not observe strong covariation patterns (data not shown). Likewise, the structured elements SL-a and SL-b in the 3’UTR exhibit only a few covariations. This observed lack of covariation might be due to the high degree of sequence conservation in the 3’UTR. Alternatively, it could also be a consequence of a sampling bias, as many samples in our dataset originate from individual outbreaks and therefore only represent a fraction of the CHIKV population. In contrast to other arboviruses, such as flaviviruses carrying exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the lack of covariations makes it difficult to assert to what extent secondary structure conservation is a driving force of CHIKV UTR evolution. This is underlined by a weak support of structure-associated z-scores for elements SL-a and SL-b (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d). Contrary, the SL-Y and CSE elements have very stable structures as indicated by strongly negative z-scores. One of the most striking features of the CHIKV 3’UTR is presence of multiple copies of the unstructured UR region separating structured regions. Our findings indicate that the evolutionary forces acting on CHIKV 3’UTR manifest as a process that can rapidly rearrange structured and unstructured RNA elements, as observed in a recently emerged partial duplication of CHIKV strains isolated from the Caribbean [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Consequently, our predictions encourage further experimental validation to assess the structural and functional role of these proposed elements. In particular, it would be highly informative to elucidate whether or not these elements mediate the production of standalone non-coding RNAs. Additionally, experiments could reveal whether these conserved elements act in cis or trans.
