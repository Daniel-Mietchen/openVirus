<p>Earlier work in alphavirus 3’UTRs reported a varied architecture of repeat sequence elements (RSEs) [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], which appear to influence virus replication in mosquito cells without affecting infectivity in mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, molecular evolution experiments with engineered CHIKV 3’UTRs in mosquito and mammalian cells suggest that improved fitness was acquired mainly due to mutations in protein coding regions [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Still, the specific biological functions of individual 3’UTR RSEs have not been studied in detail. The comparative genomics approach employed in this study confirms the previously reported repeat organization in CHIKV 3’UTR sequences. It is now possible to conclusively associate repeat sequences with distinct RNA secondary structures that are conserved among all lineages. Importantly, the organization of all CHIKV 3’UTRs follows a common pattern characterized by an alternating arrangement of structured, i.e., SL-a, SL-b, and SL-Y, and unstructured regions. The latter are defined by a lack of any RNA structure, as predicted by single sequence and consensus folding algorithms. This suggests that these regions of the CHIKV genome exist in a predominantly unpaired state, rendering them highly accessible.
