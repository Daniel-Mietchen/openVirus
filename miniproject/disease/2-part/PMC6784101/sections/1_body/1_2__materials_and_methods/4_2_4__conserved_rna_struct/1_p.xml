<p>Evolutionary conservation of functional RNAs is typically achieved by nature at the level of secondary structures. Comparative genomics approaches aim at detecting these conserved, structured RNAs as patterns of covariation in genome sequence alignments, typically constructed from phylogenetically narrow subgroups. To this end, Covariance Models (CMs) are statistical models of RNA structure formation that extend traditional Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) by simultaneously representing sequence and secondary structure information [
