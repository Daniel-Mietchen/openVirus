<p>Two complete ORFs of CHIKV were extracted from the complete viral sequences for the phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence alignments of the individual ORFs were computed using 
 <monospace>MAFFT</monospace> [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] under default settings and visualized in 
 <monospace>AliView</monospace> [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In order to examine the possibility of recombinant sequences, we used RDP and methods therein (RDP, GENECONV, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, and PhylPro) [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
