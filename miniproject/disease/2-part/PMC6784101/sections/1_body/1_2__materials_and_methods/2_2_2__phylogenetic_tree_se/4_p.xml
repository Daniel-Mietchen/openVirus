<p>According to recently published phylogenies of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], viruses from the Western African clade form a sister group to all other CHIKV clades. Given these results and the absence of co-circulating Western African strains with any other CHIKV lineage, we selected this clade as the outgroup for the phylogeny of CHIKV. de Bernardi Schneider [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] observed Western Africa as a monophyletic clade sister to all other clades by utilizing an external outgroup (O’nyong nyong virus), thus the selection of this group should not yield an inherent bias on the tree topology at the same time that it results in a cleaner molecular sequence alignment given the outgroup sequences belong to the same virus species as the ingroup. We performed the same procedure for a subset containing the 111 complete 3’UTR sequences from the 590 whole genome sequence data set.
