<p>We executed a 1000-replicate ultrafast bootstrap analysis of clade frequencies [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and a SH-aLRT measure of support [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The ultrafast bootstrap analysis is a variation of the traditional bootstrap using heuristics and constraints to speed the search for optimal tree topologies. The SH-aLRT is an approximation of the likelihood ratio, a direct measure of how much the evidence supports the hypothesis.
