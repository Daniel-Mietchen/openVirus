<p>No significant recombination events (
 <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt; 0.05) were detected in the aligned data sets, therefore we kept all 590 sequences in the data sets. The phylogenetic tree search performed with 
 <monospace>IQ-Tree</monospace> resulted in a best-scoring heuristic maximum likelihood tree for CHIKV with 590 genomic sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Deep ancestral branches that define the lineages had high (&gt;90) SH-aLRT support/ultrafast bootstrap values. More recent branches had lower SH-aLRT support/ultrafast bootstrap values. The phylogenetic hypothesis for CHIKV with branch values is available online as
