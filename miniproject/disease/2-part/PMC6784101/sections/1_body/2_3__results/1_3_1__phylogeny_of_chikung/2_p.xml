<p>The four viral strains grouped as expected according to reports in the literature [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00798" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; however, the increased number of taxa in the tree allowed us to better investigate relationships of clades and infer source-sink events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00798-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition to the four major lineages—AUL, ECSA, IOL, and WA—our decision to split the concept of ECSA into its three regions, Eastern Africa, Central (Middle) Africa, and Southern Africa, rose from the presence of distinct clades in this large-scale phylogeny. The epidemic strain from the ECSA-MASA clade was first found in Middle Africa and later identified in South America. The AUL lineage gave rise to an extensively nested American lineage which spans North, South, and Central America, as well as the Caribbean.
