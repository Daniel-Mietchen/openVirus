<p>Reviewer #1: This study seeks to clarify the degree to which occurrence of Aedes malayensis in Singapore exacerbates the risk of yellow fever virus introduction to that country. The authors conducted a rigorous experimental study of vector competence with an Aedes aegypti control, and a field study to ascertain human attraction. It is the latter that is tripping me up a little, in that no unbaited traps were used to determine the number of Ae. malayensis that might have entered the net in the course of daily movement. Can the authors specify what the "other" mosquitoes captured via this method were? Were any of them species well known to not be attracted to humans?</p>
