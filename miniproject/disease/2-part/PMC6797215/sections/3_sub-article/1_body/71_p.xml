<p>Ae. malayensis was first described in Singapore in 1962 and has subsequently been reported in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Taiwan. It probably occurs throughout southeastern Asia. So it is not a new introduction and has probably been in the region for thousands of years. Given that history and the multiple opportunities for introduction of YFV into the region in the past, is Singapore now at greater risk of a yellow fever outbreak that it was 200 or 400 years ago? If Ae. aegypti populations are maintained at a low level in Singapore, it may actually be at a lower risk, regardless of the presence of Ae. malayensis. </p>
