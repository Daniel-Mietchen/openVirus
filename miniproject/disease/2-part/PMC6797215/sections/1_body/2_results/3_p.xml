<p>The proportion of infected females that developed a disseminated infection (i.e., the dissemination rate) also increased with infectious dose (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007783.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The highest infectious dose resulted in 42.9% and 57.1% dissemination in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, respectively. Infectious dose was the only statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) predictor of dissemination rate (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Together, these results indicated that although 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was slightly more susceptible than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> at low infectious doses, the two species had a similar YFV susceptibility overall.
