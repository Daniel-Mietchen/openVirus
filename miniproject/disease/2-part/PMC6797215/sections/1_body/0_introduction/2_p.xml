<p>With 18.5 million visitors in 2018, Singapore is a global hub for tourism, trade and transport that includes one of the busiest ports in the world and a major international airport. These features put Singapore at high risk for introduction of arboviruses, including YFV. Strict and sustained vector control measures together with household structural improvements, currently achieve very low densities of the domestic arbovirus vector 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] supports the hypothesis that peridomestic mosquito species untargeted by vector control measures may contribute to ‘cryptic’ arbovirus transmission [

 <italic>Aedes malayensis</italic> (a member of the 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> subgenus) breeds in urban parks of Singapore and is experimentally competent for DENV and CHIKV [
