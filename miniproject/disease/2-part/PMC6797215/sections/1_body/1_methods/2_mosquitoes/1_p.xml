 <sup>th</sup> generation of a laboratory colony of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> maintained at the Institut Pasteur in Laos was used as a control. The 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> colony was initiated with mosquito eggs collected from two forested areas located in the Northern (Sembawang) and the Southern (East Coast Park) regions of Singapore [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> colony originated in the town of Paksan, Paksan district, Bolikhamsai province, Laos. Mosquitoes were reared under controlled insectary conditions (28Â°C, 70% relative humidity, 12:12 hour light cycle). Eggs were hatched synchronously in a vacuum chamber for 1 hour. Larvae were reared in 24 x 34 x 9 cm plastic trays containing 1.5 L of dechlorinated tap water and supplemented with Tetramin (Tetra) fish food at a density of 400 larvae per tray. Six hundred adults were kept in 30 x 30 x 30 cm Bugdorm-1 insect cages with permanent access to 10% sucrose solution.
