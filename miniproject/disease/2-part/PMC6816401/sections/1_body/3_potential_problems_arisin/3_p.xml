<p>As the enhancement of flavivirus infections due to ADE would be a danger signal for the development of flavivirus vaccines including WNV, this issue needs to be addressed and excluded during vaccine development. Immunological cross-reactivity between WNV and other flaviviruses in serological diagnosis is well described.

 </sup> Potential infection-enhancing effects of WNV-antibodies have only been subjected of few studies until now, mainly in the context of ZIKV emergence. Plasma samples from convalescent human WNV- (but not TBEV-) infections were demonstrated to enhance ZIKV infections both in vitro and in vivo.

 </sup> On the other hand, no ADE was observed in mice previously infected with ZIKV and then challenged with WNV. Depending on the ZIKV strain used, these animals were even better protected against WNV than those na√Øve to ZIKV.

 </sup> The complementary animal experiment (ZIKV challenge after WNV infection) has not yet been described. In addition, vaccine-induced ADE between different members of the JEV-serocomplex (WNV, JEV, Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus) is not very probable in light of existing data.

 </sup> Nevertheless, the finding that WNV-antibodies can enhance ZIKV-infections is of relevance, since both viruses have overlapping distribution.

 </sup> It highlights the need to investigate potential ADE caused by a given vaccine candidate in detail, ideally by using clinical data in addition to laboratory-based studies. For existing flavivirus vaccines, e.g. the licensed TBEV or YFV vaccines, the availability of large sets of human sera from immunized individuals greatly facilitates such analyses.
