<p>A potential way to address the issue of cross-reactivity-induced ADE is the elimination of some of the conserved sequences from the vaccine. It has been demonstrated that by inserting point mutations near and into the fusion loop domain of the E protein, the binding of antibodies from heterologous flavivirus infections is significantly diminished.

 </sup> A vaccine candidate for ZIKV, consisting of an RNA coding for a ZIKV virus-like particle, contains four such point mutations and did not induce ADE for DENV.

 </sup> A similar strategy could be used for a WNV vaccine. Mutant WNV E-proteins have been developed and shown to significantly diminish cross-reactive binding of antibodies against heterologous flaviviruses.
