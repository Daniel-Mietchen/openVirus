<p>Initial clinical trials have provided good safety profiles for the WNV candidate vaccines. The existing flavivirus vaccines against YFV and TBEV are in use for decades and are generally well tolerated. On the other hand, a recently developed and (at least in some countries) licensed DENV vaccine has caused substantial discussion on vaccine safety. The tetravalent vaccine CYD-TDV was designed to protect against all four major DENV serotypes and consists of the YFV vaccine virus genetically modified to express the DENV prM/E proteins. Large clinical efficacy trials revealed a small, but significant, increase in the risk for hospitalization due to DENV in individuals na√Øve to the virus. In contrast, those with pre-existing DENV-immunity were protected from DENV-caused disease.

 </sup> The exact reasons for these observations still have to be determined. Achieving vaccine-mediated protection against DENV is intrinsically challenging due to the need to equally protect against each of the four serotypes. It is debatable to what extent similar problems would occur with a WNV vaccine. Nevertheless, the only WNV candidate vaccine that underwent a phase II clinical trial so far consists of the same backbone-technology as CYD-TDV. It can, therefore, be assumed that the manufacturers first want to fully clarify the causes of the problems associated with CYD-TDV before the technology is further expanded to other infections.
