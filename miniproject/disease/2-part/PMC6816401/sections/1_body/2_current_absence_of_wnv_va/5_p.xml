<p>For most of these alternative licensure strategies, a correlate for protection is required. This means that a (usually immunological) marker which is indicative for the successful induction of a protective immune response has been established. A key result from vaccination studies with WNV is the capability of antibodies to mediate complete protection. This is highly similar to other flaviviruses, and in the cases of YFV or JEV, specific titers in neutralizing antibodies serve as a correlate for protection.

 </sup> In case of vaccines for YFV, this threshold was established via experiments in non-human primates.

 </sup> However, non-human primates are much less susceptible to WNV than they are to YFV, which complicates the establishment of such a threshold in these animals.

 </sup> Likewise, the fact that most of the people infected with WNV do not develop clinical symptoms makes the identification of an antibody-mediated correlate of protection via clinical data challenging, even during larger scale trials.
