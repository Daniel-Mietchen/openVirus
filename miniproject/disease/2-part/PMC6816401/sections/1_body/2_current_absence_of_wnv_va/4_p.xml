<p>Clinical vaccine development includes different phases, represented by studies of increasing scale. Whereas initial phase I and II testing for safety and immunogenicity can be performed with dozens to hundreds of participants, vaccine efficacy has to be demonstrated via large phase III studies in populations affected by the pathogen. As WNV-outbreaks occur sporadically and the affected regions vary, it is extremely difficult to evaluate the impact of vaccine-mediated protection in such an efficacy trial, which is planned for a specific region during a specific time span. Given the detailed epidemiological information available for WNV outbreaks in the USA since 1999, it might nevertheless be possible to identify hotspots with relatively high WNV incidence, which could be suitable areas for efficacy trials, but it is hard to predict for how long such a trial would need to run.

 </sup> However, uncertainty in planning efficacy studies is not a WNV-specific problem, in fact, many emerging viruses show highly variable patterns in magnitude and localization of their outbreaks. Clinical ZIKV-vaccine developments are confronted with strongly decreasing case numbers in the areas affected most during the 2016 epidemic. As a consequence, vaccine developers are discussing alternative licensure models with regular authorities.

 </sup> Such strategies include accelerated licensure pathways or the FDA animal rule, i.e. the licensure of a vaccine if suitable animal models for efficacy testing exist, developed primarily to encounter potential threats of bioterrorism.
