<p>In addition, two inactivated whole virus vaccine candidates have been evaluated clinically. Firstly, two doses of a hydrogen peroxide inactivated WNV vaccine led to detectable neutralizing antibodies in approx. 50% of the study participants. The authors indicate that this result might be improved by adding a third dose or by using an alternative inactivation protocol which combines hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde.
 <sup>20</sup> Secondly, three doses of formaldehyde inactivated WNV particles induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies.
