<p>The main obstacle to study early tropism of MeV and other

 <xref rid="B190-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. The advantages of this model are the presence of all four cell types in the CNS (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia), the possibility to produce OBC from any transgenic animal, and the unique opportunity to have a direct visibility of the CNS as an open window. Moreover, several slices can be made from each substructure. Therefore, a large number of conditions can be tested with a very limited number of animals, making this model ethically preferable, compared to in vivo experiments. The main weaknesses of OBC are the lack of a vascular system with circulating leukocytes and the decreasing susceptibility to infection through time concomitant to the development of astrogliosis [
 <xref rid="B168-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Murine OBC offer many possibilities but mice are not susceptible to infection so their OBC would not be suitable to study early tropism. On the other hand, golden hamsters are susceptible to MeV infection. Thus, hamster OBC might be a more relevant
