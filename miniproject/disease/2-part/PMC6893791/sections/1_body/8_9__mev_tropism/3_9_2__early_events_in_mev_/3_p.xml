<p>To date, the very first cell target of MeV infection in CNS, is unknown. A recent study focused on cell susceptibility during MeV infection in the CNS using hippocampus organotypic brain cultures (OBC) from IFNAR deficient genetically modified C57BL/6 mice expressing human SLAM receptor [

While all cell types were susceptible to infection in the absence of IFN-I response, the permissiveness of astrocytes and microglia strongly decreased when astrogliosis was observed in immunocompetent OBC. Astrogliosis and microgliosis have been observed in MeV encephalitis [

 <xref rid="B188-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. These data could explain why infection of astrocytes and microglia in post-mortem analysis are barely detectable.
