<p>The H and F proteins constitute the viral fusion complex that is responsible for the viral entry into the host cell. The H protein is a tetramer organized as a dimer of dimers responsible for the binding to the entry receptor. The F protein mediates the fusion between the virus and the host plasma membranes. The F is a trimer first produced as a precursor F0 that is cleaved in the trans-Golgi by a furin protease in F1 plus F2 subunits linked by a disulfide bond. The extracellular domain is constituted by the F1 and F2 subunits containing the fusion peptide at the N terminus followed by two complementary heptad repeat domains, respectively at the N terminus (HRN) and the C terminus (HRC). While the crystal structure of the prefusion form of the F protein has been described [
