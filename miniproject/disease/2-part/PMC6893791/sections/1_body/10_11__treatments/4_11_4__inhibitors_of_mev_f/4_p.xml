<p>The fusion inhibitor peptide (FIP), Z-D-Phe-L-Phe Gly that is a small hydrophobic peptide and other small molecules such as AS-48 or 3G (an analogue of AS-48) can block the membrane fusion in vitro [

 <xref rid="B253-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>]. These inhibitors are known to stabilize the prefusion state of the F protein. Nevertheless the use of these inhibitors leads to the emergence of mutations in the HRC of the F that can evade their efficacy leading to the selection of MeV hyperfusogenic variants [
