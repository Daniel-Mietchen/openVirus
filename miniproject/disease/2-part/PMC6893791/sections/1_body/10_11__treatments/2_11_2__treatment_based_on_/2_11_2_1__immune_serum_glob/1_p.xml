<p>From the 1940s, intramuscular injection of immune serum globulin was reported to confer up to 79% protection to unvaccinated patients having close contact with measles infected patients [
 <xref rid="B200-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. More recently, effectiveness of immune serum globulin as post-exposure prophylaxis was estimated from 50% to 69% during the 2014 measles outbreak in British Columbia in Canada. However, this estimation is highly controversial because many other factors could have contributed to prevent the appearance of the disease. Indeed, the potential pre-exposure immune status as well as the unknown exposure intensity and timing make the effectiveness of the immune serum globulin very difficult to quantify [

 <xref rid="B202-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. This led to the necessity to increase the doses of immune serum globulin in order to maintain a protective level of measles antibodies [
 <xref rid="B201-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. However, as mentioned in paragraph 7.3, SSPE seems to develop mainly when the exposure to MeV occurs during the first years of age before the immune system is completely mature and when maternal antibodies are still lasting [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, administration of immunoglobulin may have led to SSPE cases [
 <xref rid="B203-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>] and the use of MeV-specific antibodies to treat rodents after infection via intracerebral route led to persistency of MeV infection and encephalitis [
 <xref rid="B204-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>,
 <xref rid="B205-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>,
 <xref rid="B206-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Thus, the use of immunoglobulins to treat measles infection should be very carefully thought before introduction in therapies and would greatly benefit from the combination with other antivirals acting at different levels of the viral replication cycle in order to cure the infection instead of inducing persistency.
