<p>At the beginning of the infection, the innate immune response relies on the detection of PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular pattern) by pathogens recognition receptors (PRR) such as the RIG-I like Receptors (RLRs) in the cytoplasm [

Among the RLRs recognizing the double stranded RNA patterns for activation of the type I interferon response, RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible gene I) is activated by several RNA viruses including MeV [
