<p>Fusion inhibitors such as 3G or FIP are tested on MeV and it has been documented that several mutations emerged in F protein in order to escape the treatment. The impact of these mutations (I87T, M94V, S262R, L354M, A367T, N462K) on the fusion machinery is of great interest [

 <xref rid="B127-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. One of the most interesting mutations that emerged is located at the residue 262. The escape mutation S262R confers hyperfusogenicity, as well as the mutant S262G that has been described in a real case of SSPE [
