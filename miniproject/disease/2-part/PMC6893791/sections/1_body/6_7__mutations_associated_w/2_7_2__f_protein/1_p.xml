<p>The F proteins observed in SSPE cases present several mutations conferring a hyperfusogenic phenotype. F is produced as metastable protein in its pre-fusion state. This pre-fusion state is generally less stable in the CNS isolates. The F can also fuse without H engagement to any known receptor. Thus, it is suggested that these mutations facilitate CNS spread [
