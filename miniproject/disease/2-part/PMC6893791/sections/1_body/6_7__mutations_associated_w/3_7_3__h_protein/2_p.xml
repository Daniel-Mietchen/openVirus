<p>In a modified Edmonston strain expressing a murine-adapted H protein from a neurovirulent strain CAM/RB, the substitutions G195R and S200N lead to complete loss of neurovirulence in mice C57BL/B6 [

Due to questionable strains and animal model used in this study, these data have to be considered carefully and these findings might be difficult to transpose to human SSPE cases. Nevertheless, it highlights the potential existence of a specific site in H involved in neurovirulence or a site of an unknown neuron-specific receptor.
