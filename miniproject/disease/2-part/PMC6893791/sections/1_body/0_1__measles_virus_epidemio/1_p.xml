<p>Measles virus (MeV) is the etiologic agent responsible for measles disease. Humans are the only known reservoir for MeV. Despite the availability of a very efficient vaccine [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], measles remains one of the most contagious diseases with a R0 ranking from 12 to 18 [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] meaning that (in a fully susceptible population) an infected patient will on average transmit the infection to 12 to 18 individuals. This propagation rate may even increase among people with low or compromised immunity [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Viral transmission generally occurs from person to person through aerosols [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and precedes onset of skin rash, making the disease even more difficult to contain. After decades of emergences mainly restricted to the poorest countries, measles has made a strong comeback and re-emerged in industrialized countries [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] where access to the vaccine was supposed to be easier. Measles killed more than 100,000 people every year [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] since 2010. In 2017, 110,000 people died from measles, mostly children under five years old [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indeed, in the absence of vaccination, children are the main targets of MeV [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], although adults can be infected as well [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Last year, WHO documented 268,038 confirmed cases. Nevertheless, according to other estimations, there are 7 to 20 million people getting infected by measles each year [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
