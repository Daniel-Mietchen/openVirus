<p>Multiple murine models have been developed to address specific question about MeV pathogenesis, CNS invasion, antiviral treatments, and persistence (

 <xref rid="B144-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. When these receptors are ubiquitously expressed (notably in the CNS) these very artificial models highly facilitate MeV entry. In SLAM transgenic suckling mice infected intranasally, MIBE-related mutants such as MeV F L454W were able to propagate in lungs, meninges, and neural cells in brain parenchyma confirming the maintenance of its ability to infect a host from the respiratory tract [

Additionally, such animal models allow not only the study of the key factors of the cells permissiveness independently of the entry step, but also to validate the efficacy of antiviral drugs in the most stringent context, since the virus spread is the most difficult to block [
