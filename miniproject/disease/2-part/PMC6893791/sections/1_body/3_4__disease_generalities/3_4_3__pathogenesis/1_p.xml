<p>Pathogenesis starts with MeV infection of myeloid cells in the respiratory tract. As mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-viruses-11-01017">Section 2</xref>, the two known entry receptors for MeV wild-type strains are SLAM/CD150 and nectin-4 [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These antigen presenting cells (APCs) migrate to the lymph nodes and transmit the viral infection to SLAM expressing lymphocytes with subsequent spread of the virus in the lymphatic and vascular systems (viremia). During the late stages of the infection, circulating infected immune cells that reach the respiratory tract and the skin can transmit the infection in cis to epithelial cells expressing nectin-4 on their basolateral side [
