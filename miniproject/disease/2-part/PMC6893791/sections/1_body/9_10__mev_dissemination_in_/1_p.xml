<p>In SSPE brain tissue, extracellular MeV has not been detected, suggesting that neuron-to-neuron viral dissemination can occur without released infectious viral particle [

 <xref rid="B193-viruses-11-01017" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. The functional analysis of hyperfusogenic MeV bearing a mutated F protein T461I confirmed this theory by being able to disseminate exclusively from cell-to-cell in human primary neurons [
