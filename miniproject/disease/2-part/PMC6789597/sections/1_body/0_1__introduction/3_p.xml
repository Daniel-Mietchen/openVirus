<p>ZIKV infection is usually asymptomatic or produces a relatively mild illness with an uneventful recovery [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, during the 2015 epidemics in South America, ZIKV became a global health threat, showing increased virulence, rapid spread, and an association with severe neurological complications such as an unexpected rise of microcephaly cases in fetuses and newborns and a remarkable increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome cases [

 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. ZIKV is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of infected female
