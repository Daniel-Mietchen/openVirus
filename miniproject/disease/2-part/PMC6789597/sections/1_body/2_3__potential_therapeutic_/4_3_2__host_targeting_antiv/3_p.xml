<p>Similar to the purine synthesis inhibitors, compounds inhibiting the synthesis of pyrimidines have also been shown to affect ZIKV replication. Pascoalino et al. screened a library of 725 compounds from a collection of chemically diverse FDA-approved drugs with known and unknown mechanisms of action. The entire library was screened at 20 µM against ZIKV infecting Huh7 cells. The authors identified the 6-azauridine (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.3 μM) and another pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor, 5-fluorouracil (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.3 μM), which inhibit thymidylate synthase (the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of thymidine biosynthesis) [

 <xref rid="B92-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and thus have human fetal risk which is not unexpected because they deplete the cellular pool of nucleotides, affecting proper development of the fetus. In addition, the authors have identified lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, whose activity against ZIKV was confirmed through a dose-response assay (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.7 μM) [

 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In addition, Sarkey et al., demonstrated that a short-term parenteral course of high-dose lovastatin in mice markedly attenuated nervous system injury and, thus, could be eventually used in inflammatory peripheral nerve diseases such as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), a consequence of ZIKV infection [
