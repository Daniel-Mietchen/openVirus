<p>In order to maintain proper replication, viruses rely on the supply of nucleosides from the host cells. Ribavirin is a guanosine analogue that has broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses [

 <xref rid="B88-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain ribavirinâ€™s antiviral properties including indirect mechanisms such as inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibition (IMPDH) and immunomodulatory effects as well as direct mechanisms such as interference with RNA capping, polymerase inhibition, and lethal mutagenesis [

Our group and others demonstrated the inhibitory activity of ribavirin against ZIKV strains of different geographic origins in several cell lines such as Vero cells, human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) [

Recent studies have shown that merimepodib (MMPD or VX-497) and mycophenolic acid (MPA), two IMPDH inhibitors, also inhibit ZIKV-RNA replication in different cell types, including Huh-7 cells, human cervical placental cells, and neural stem and primary amniotic cells [

 <xref rid="B92-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Azathioprine, another inhibitor of the purine synthesis and immunosuppressive compound, was shown to abolish ZIKV replication in HeLa (cervical cancer cells) and JEG3 (human choriocarcinoma cell line) cells; however, its use in pregnant women is not recommended [
