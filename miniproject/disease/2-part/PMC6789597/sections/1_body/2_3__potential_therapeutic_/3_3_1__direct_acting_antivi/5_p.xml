<p>BCX4430, an adenosine nucleoside analog, is a selective inhibitor of the viral RdRp. This compound has already been shown to have broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of RNA viruses including WNV, YFV, Marburg and Ebola viruses [

 <xref rid="B63-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. BCX4430 acts on NS5 polymerase, promoting chain termination of viral RNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It was found to inhibit ZIKV replication in Vero cells with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 3.8–11.7 µg/ml with selective index values of 5.5 and 11.6 depending on the viral strain [
 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In addition, treatment of AG129 mice infected with ZIKV (Malaysian strain, P-6-740) twice daily (BID) with an intramuscular dose of 300 mg/kg of BCX4430 significantly reduced viremia and protected 87.5% of treated mice from mortality. This protection was also observed when treatment was initiated 24 h after infection [
