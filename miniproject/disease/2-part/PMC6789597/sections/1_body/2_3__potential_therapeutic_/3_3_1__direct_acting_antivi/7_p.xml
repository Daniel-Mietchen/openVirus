<p>NS2B-NS3 trypsin-like serine protease plays a key role in virus replication by contributing to viral polyprotein processing. Studies done by Lee et al. identified 10 compounds with inhibitory activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 50 µM) and binding activity (K
 <sub>D</sub> of ∼5–10 μM) against the Zika NS2B-NS3 protease from testing 71 HCV NS3/NS4A inhibitors that were initially discovered by high-throughput screening of ∼40,000 compounds [

 <xref rid="B73-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], have been tested against NS2B-NS3 protease, and some of them have been found to inhibit ZIKV protease activity. Lim et al. evaluated 22 polyphenol compounds and found that seven had an EC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 22 to 113 μM [

Roy et al. identified five flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, luteolin, isorhamnetin, apigenin) and one natural phenol (curcumin) which were shown to inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3 protease by binding to a pocket on the back of the active site and allosterically affect the structure-activity property of Zika NS2B-NS3 protease. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> from the flavonoids ranged between 1.3 and 56.3 μM whereas the curcumin EC
 <sub>50</sub> was 3.5 μM [

 <sub>50</sub> below 15 μM. However, 12 of those compounds were considered Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS). Three (temoporfin, niclosamide, and nitazoxanide) of the 12 remaining compounds had an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value ranging from 1.1 to 15.9 μM. Temoporfin displayed a very low EC
 <sub>50</sub> value (nanomolar range) and, when tested in a lethal mouse model, was able to inhibit viremia and protect 83% of infected mice. In addition, mice that survived did not present any signs of neurological disorder [

Similarly, a study done by Yuan et al. using an in-silico structure-based approach to rapidly screen a large chemical library of 8277 compounds, successfully identified eight clinically approved drugs with inhibitory activity on the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease [

 <sub>50</sub> value of 24.82 μM and treatment of mice with 100 mg/kg of the drug BID from day 1 to 13 post-infection, significantly (
