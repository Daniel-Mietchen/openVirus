<p>The current search for ZIKV antiviral options is being conducted through several different approaches which target different steps of the replication cycle: by screening of different compound libraries or by the repurposing of drugs with known active efficacy against other diseases and that are already being used in clinic. In addition, natural products [

 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] as well as antibody-based candidates [

 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceuticals-12-00101" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] are being evaluated but are outside the scope of this review. Antivirals can be classified according to their mode of action in (i) direct-acting antivirals, directed against viral targets, or (ii) host-targeting antivirals, aimed at targeting cellular components needed for the viral cycle. Therefore, in the last few years, a large number of drugs and therapeutic candidates have been discovered or repurposed with ZIKV activity both in vitro and in pre-clinical studies and a few of them have been evaluated in clinical trials (
