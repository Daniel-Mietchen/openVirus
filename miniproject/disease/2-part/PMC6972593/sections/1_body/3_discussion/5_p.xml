<p>Previous studies have touted the use of antioxidant therapies, such as N‐acetyl‐l‐cysteine (NAC) and vitamins including C and E for reducing influenza pathogenicity with some promising results.

 <sub>2</sub> and peroxynitrite, all of which have been implicated in influenza pathology, we suggest that a better alternative is to specifically suppress ROS production at its source, rather than to use a generalized antioxidant strategy that relies on widespread distribution and downstream chemical inactivation.

 <xref rid="resp13524-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Our data provide evidence that targeting endosomal ROS is an effective approach for preventing airway inflammation and lung injury to both mild and highly pathogenic IAV. The current findings demonstrate a clinical potential for endosome NOX2 inhibitors, particularly as a means for preventing influenza pathology. Whilst our study shows a clear potential for prevention of this inflammation to pandemic influenza by delivering an endosome NOX2 inhibitor prior to infection, it remains to be determined whether these inhibitors can limit the pathology when delivered post‐infection. This is certainly worthy of future investigation and is therefore a limitation of the current study. Important for these future studies is an examination of the effect of Cgp91ds‐TAT on the resolution of pandemic influenza which should include a comprehensive analysis of critical arms of both the adaptive and humoral immune systems. These studies will provide strong evidence for whether endosome NOX2 oxidase inhibitors have therapeutic potential in a post‐viral infection setting. In conclusion, the present study supports an emerging strategy that aims to suppress oxidative stress caused by IAV infection that could provide novel and effective approaches to avoid/alleviate influenza pathology.
