<p> Mice were divided into six groups depending on the received drugs. Each group included at least 12 animals. The animals in the five groups were infected, under light ether anesthesia, intranasally (50 μL each) with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 at doses of 10 to 105 TCID50 per mouse, which amounted to 10–1 to 103 LD
 <sub>50</sub>. The sixth control group remained uninfected. After 24 h, all groups were divided in half. One half of the animals was injected intraperitoneally with 500 μL/mouse of saline daily for the following 4 days, and the other half was injected with the Rb. LPS at a dose of 400 μg/500 μL/mouse. Mice not injected with any agents were the controls. The experimental design is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Blood was sampled from the animals that survived by the end of the experiment (day 14), after euthanasia in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> chamber; blood cells were precipitated; and the resulting serum was frozen at –20°C until the H5N1 influenza virus antibody titer in the serum was determined by ELISA.
