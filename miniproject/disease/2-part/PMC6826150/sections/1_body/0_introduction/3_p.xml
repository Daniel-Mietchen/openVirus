<p> Compound E5564 (Eritoran), a synthetic analogue of the non-toxic lipid A from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, when administered in a certain regimen to C57BL/6J mice, was shown to protect mice from death caused by the mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The nuclear non-histone high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein/amphoterin, which is a DAMP, is known to be released relatively late after the infection onset and is involved in the development of both gram-negative sepsis and influenza complications, interacting with MD-2 and activating TLR4 [

 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. TLR4 activation leads to a cytokine storm with an accentuated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferons, tumor necrosis factors, interleukins, and chemokines [

 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], with a lipid A structure similar to that of lipid A from R. sphaeroides, is an endotoxin antagonist that inhibits activation of the synthesis of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines by human blood cells [
