<p> The administration of the Rb. LPS to mice caused a 1.5-fold increase in the TNF-α level in blood serum compared to that in the control mice by day 3, which remained at about the same level until day 5 of the experiment. It should be noted that the serum TNF-α level in the control mice was quite high (74.7 ± 8.7 pg/mL), indicating a sensitized state of the animals. Production of TNF-α in the blood of the influenza-infected mice depended on the virus dose and showed positive dynamics during the experiment. The administration of the Rb. LPS to infected mice enhanced TNF-α production in their blood (
