<p> The dynamics of IL-6 synthesis in all experiment variants was similar. The IL-6 level increased significantly (1000- to 2000-fold) by day 4 of the experiment. IL-6 production in the infected mice depended on the virus dose. The IL-6 level in response to the introduction of the Rb. LPS was comparable to that in the influenza-infected mice. The administration of the Rb. LPS to infected mice slightly increased IL-6 production by day 5 of the experiment (

These findings demonstrate that a viral infection causes a dose-dependent induction of the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, with the induction increasing with time. These cytokines are produced mainly by monocytes and macrophages in response to both bacteria and viruses, using independent signaling pathways involving different surface and intracellular receptors but the same adapter proteins and transcription factors. The data on the induction of TNF-α and IL-6 synthesis show that the administration of the Rb. LPS to influenza-infected mice enhanced the pro-inflammatory response of their immune cells (
