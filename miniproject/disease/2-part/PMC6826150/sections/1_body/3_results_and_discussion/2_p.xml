<p> The administration of the Rb. LPS to the control mice and infection with a dose of 10 TCID50 of the H1N1 influenza virus, followed by the administration of the Rb. LPS, did not affect the survival rate of the animals until the end of the experiment (day 12). In the group of mice infected with the influenza virus at a dose of 300 TCID50, 14% of the mice survived until the end of the experiment; additional administration of the Rb. LPS increased mortality in mice (

LPS to healthy mice did not affect the condition and weight of the control animals. Mice infected with 10 TCID50 of the H1N1 virus showed no signs of disease and began rapidly gaining weight on the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> day after infection, until the end of the experiment (day 12). Additional administration of the Rb. LPS to the animals infected with the virus at this dose led to a decrease in the animalsâ€™ weight after day 7 of the experiment. Virus infection (300 TCID50) markedly affected the condition of the mice, causing significant inflammation and weight loss. The administration of the Rb. LPS to infected mice worsened the condition of the animals and led to additional weight loss (
