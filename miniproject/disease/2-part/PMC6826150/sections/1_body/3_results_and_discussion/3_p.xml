<p> Survival and weight changes in the animals infected with the H5N1 or H1N1 influenza virus revealed the absence of a protective effect on the part of the Rb. LPS on mice against a lethal infection (

Daily (for 5 days) intravenous administration of Eritoran starting 2 days after infection was shown to protect mice from the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus. Protection from DAMPs released from influenza infected and destroyed cells that occurred through the TLR4- dependent mechanism [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The virus type determines the response mechanisms of innate immunity to infection. The signaling pathways in an infection caused by different H5N1 and H1N1 virus strains differ and determine the survival rate and pathology of the inflammation [
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Obviously, the infection in our experiments develops through molecular mechanisms other than cell activation through the TLR4 pathway. Probably, the administration regiment and Rb. LPS concentration used in our experiments were ineffective in protecting against these viral strains.
