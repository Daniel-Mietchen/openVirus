  <p>The effect of cfa-miR-197 on the expressions of KPNA6 mRNA and viral replication. The MDCK cells were overexpressed with pSilencer_miR-197, which encodes cfa-miR-197. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were collected. (
   <bold>A</bold>) cfa-miR-197 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) KPNA6 expression levels were determined in the cells transfected with pSilencer_Scramble or pSilencer_miR-197 for 48 h by RT-qPCR (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01 is designated as **). Moreover, cfa-miR-197 was either overexpressed or inhibited, followed by infection of B/Victoria lineage viruses for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cellular KPNA6 in infected cells and (
   <bold>D</bold>) viral PB1 in supernatants were determined in the cells with pSilencer_miR-197 and miR-197 inhibitor by RT-qPCR (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 is designated as *; 
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01 is designated as **; 
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001 is designated as ***). RNA U6 and GAPDH was used as an internal control for microRNA-197 and KPNA6, respectively, whereas the cells treated with scramble and negative control inhibitor were used as calibrators for silencing vector and microRNA inhibitor, respectively.
