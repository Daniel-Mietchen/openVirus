<p>To identify canine microRNAs which were associated with influenza B virus infection, MDCK cells infected with Victoria lineage, Yamagata lineage, or mock were collected at 6, 12 and 24 h. Next-generation sequencing revealed the list of differentially expressed microRNAs with 2-fold or greater change in influenza B viruses-versus mock-infected cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00986-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, 28 upregulated microRNAs and 15 downregulated microRNAs were presented in Victoria lineage infected MDCK cells. Among those microRNAs, cfa-miR-181a was upregulated at 12 and 24 hpi. While it decreased at 12 hpi, the expression of cfa-miR-197 was increased at 24 hpi. On the other hand, the overexpression of 13 microRNAs and the downexpression of 5 microRNAs were found in the cells infected with Yamagata lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00986-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). A comparative investigation of microRNAs in response to both lineages of influenza B viruses demonstrated that 38 and 13 unique microRNAs were dysregulated in the cells infected with Victoria and Yamagata lineage, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00986-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). In contrast, five upregulated microRNAs including cfa-miR-197, cfa-miR-215, cfa-miR-361, cfa-miR-1841, and cfa-miR-1842 were overlapped between the two datasets.
