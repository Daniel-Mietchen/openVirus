<p>Furthermore, the effect of cfa-miR-197 overexpression on KPNA6 expression was determined. This investigation demonstrated that cfa-miR-197 were overexpressed when the cells were treated with pSilencer_miR-197 (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0075). Additionally, the effect of cfa-miR-197 on viral replication was investigated. The cells were transfected with pSilencer-miR-197 and cfa-miR-197 inhibitor, followed by influenza B virus infection for multiple time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00986-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D). The results demonstrated that the cells treated with plasmid overexpressing cfa-miR-197 had significant down-expressions of KPNA6 at 48 hpi (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0323) and viral PB1 at 24 and 48 hpi (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.076 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.034, respectively). In contrast, the cells treated with cfa-miR-197 inhibitor demonstrated significantly higher expression of KPNA6 at 24 and 48 hpi (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0347, respectively) and PB1 at 24 and 48 hpi (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005, respectively). Taken together, these results indicated that KPNA6 might be directly regulated by cfa-miR-197, affecting influenza B virus replication.
