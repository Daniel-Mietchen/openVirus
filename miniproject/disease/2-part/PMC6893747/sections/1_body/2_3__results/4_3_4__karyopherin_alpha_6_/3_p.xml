<p>To confirm whether KPNA6 was a putative target of cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215 in MDCK cells, luciferase reporter assays were conducted at 48 h after co-transfection of pmirGLO containing the 3′-UTR of KPNA6 and pSilencer encoding microRNA mimic. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00986-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B, cfa-miR-197 inhibited luciferase activity in the cells transfected with pmirGLO containing the 3′-UTR of KPNA6 at both position of 361–367 and 4399–4405, respectively. However, cfa-miR-215 had no effect on luciferase activity in the cells transfected with pmirGLO containing the position of 1169–1176 or 2784–2790 (
