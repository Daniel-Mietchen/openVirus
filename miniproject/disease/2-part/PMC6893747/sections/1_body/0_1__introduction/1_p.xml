<p>Seasonal influenza—a respiratory infectious disease with a high transmissibility rate and worldwide distribution—is caused by influenza A and B viruses [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Influenza A viruses have been extensively studied due to their association with high genetic variability and severe pandemics [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the other hand, influenza B viruses were divided into two genetically and antigenically distinct strains, namely Victoria and Yamagata, in the 1980s [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, molecular characterization of influenza B viruses has been little documented because a smaller impact of influenza B virus infection on public health was believed in the past [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recently, epidemiological investigations have revealed a massive effect of influenza B on the mortality rate and the severity [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This evidence has highlighted the need to study the influenza B infections in order to understand the pathogenesis.
