<p>In conclusion, this investigation provides canine microRNA profiles of permissive MDCK cell line infected with two different lineages of influenza B viruses, which are responsible for seasonal epidemics. Five common microRNAs including cfa-miR-197, cfa-miR-215, cfa-miR361, cfa-miR-1841, and cfa-miR-1842 were upregulated in the MDCK cells infected with either Victoria or Yamagata lineage. Among these microRNAs, KPNA6 could be the direct target of cfa-miR-197. Therefore, virus-mediated microRNAs may indirectly affect viral replication and pathogenesis through silencing host genes.</p>
