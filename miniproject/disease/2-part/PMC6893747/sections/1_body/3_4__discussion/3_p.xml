<p>In the previous years, microRNAs’ response to infection of influenza A viruses has been extensively studied in human cells. Recent investigations suggested that some microRNAs modulated pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects during influenza A viruses infected in A549 cell line [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00986" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, antiviral proteins produced from human lung epithelial cells and dendritic cells were controlled by several influenza A virus-mediated microRNAs [

Intriguingly, this study showed that cfa-miR-29c were increased when the cells were infected with influenza B virus (Victoria lineage). Similarly, the infection of seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus could induce the expression of hsa-miR-29c, leading to lowered NF-κB activity and decreased proinflammatory cytokines through up-regulation of A20 [
