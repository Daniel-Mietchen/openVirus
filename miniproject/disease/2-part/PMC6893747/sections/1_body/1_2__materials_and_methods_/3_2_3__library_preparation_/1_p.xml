<p>Purified microRNAs from the cells infected with the same viral strains and the same time-point were pooled together (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). One-hundred nanogram of the microRNAs from each group was used to construct the libraries with different indexes according to a NEBNext
 <sup>®</sup> Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina
 <sup>®</sup> (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The concentration of DNA libraries was quantified by using KAPA Library Quantification Kits for Illumina
 <sup>®</sup> Platform (Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa). The DNA libraries were pooled together with equal concentration, and then single-end sequenced (50 cycles) on a MiSeq Benchtop Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
