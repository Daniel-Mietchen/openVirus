<p>pSilencer 3.0-H1 (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and pmirGLO (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were used as a vector backbone to produce microRNA expression vectors and reporter vectors, respectively. Each 10 μL of the top- and bottom-strand oligonucleotides (10 nM) was added with 5 μL of 5× rapid ligation buffer (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), then denatured at 90 °C for 5 min, followed by annealing at 25 °C for 1 h (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00986-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Meanwhile, one μg of the pSilencer 3.0-H1 was cut with restriction enzymes 
 <italic>Bam</italic>HI and 
 <italic>Hin</italic>dIII (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. On the other hand, pmirGLO was cut with 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I and 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. For pmirGLO, the plasmids were treated with 1 µL of Antarctic phosphatase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). After that, the annealed fragment was ligated into linearized pSilencer3.0-H1 or pmirGLO with T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The plasmids were transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain JM109 competent cells (RBC Bioscience, New Taipei City, Taiwan) by heat shock method. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected and propagated, followed by using HiYield
 <sup>™</sup> Plasmid Mini Kit (RBC Bioscience, New Taipei City, Taiwan) for plasmid extraction. The concentration of each plasmid was measured by NanoPhotometer
 <sup>®</sup> (Implen, Munich, Germany). To confirm the recombinant vectors, the nucleotide inserts were investigated by Sanger sequencing.
