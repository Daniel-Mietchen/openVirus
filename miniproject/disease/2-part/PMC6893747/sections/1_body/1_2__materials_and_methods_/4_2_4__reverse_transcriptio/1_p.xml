<p>Prior to detecting the expression levels of candidate microRNAs, 100 µg of the microRNAs was polyuridylated by polyU polymerase (New England Biolabs). To generate cDNA, the microRNAs with polyU were then reverse transcribed with stem-loop (SL) poly A primers (5′-gtcgtatccagtgcagggtccgaggtattcgcactggatacgac-3′) [

 <sub>16</sub> in order to detect the expression level of mRNA. RevertAid™ reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The qPCR reaction consisted of 5 μL of Luna
 <sup>®</sup> Universal qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA, USA), 0.25 μL of each 10 μM forward and reverse primer, 1 μL of cDNA, and nuclease-free water was added to a final volume of 12 μL. The primer sequences and thermocycling conditions were available in

The expression of canine RNA U6 Small Nuclear 2 (RNU6-2) and Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was measured as an internal control for microRNAs and mRNA expression, respectively. The results were analyzed using StepOne™ Software v.2.2 analysis (Foster City, CA, USA). The expression ratio was calculated by comparative ∆∆C
 <sub>t</sub> method.
