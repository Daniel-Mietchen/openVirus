<p id="Par22">As the main concern about the spread of Zika virus disease is mother-to-child transmission resulting in brain malformations, it is of primary importance to study the effect of the virus on women and estimate the number of cases among them. Moreover, several studies and news articles reported a higher number of Zika virus infections in women compared to cases in men

 </sup>. It is probable that the higher male-to-female sexual transmission rate is a contributing factor to this skewing of the burden of disease toward women. Using our model, we compare the number of symptomatic cases in women and men (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Based on our model, we estimate a 39% surplus in the cumulative number of symptomatically infected women in comparison with the cumulative number of symptomatically infected men in Suriname, while the same surplus is estimated 65% in Costa Rica. Lozier

 </sup> reported a 90% surplus, also in Rio de Janeiro. In comparison with these studies, our simulation shows similar or somewhat smaller surplus of Zika cases in women, though, the high number given in these studies might also be attributed to the fact that women (and especially pregnant women) suspected to have Zika are more likely to visit their doctors because of the potential risk of birth defects and potentially because women visit doctors more often than men, as hypothesized in
