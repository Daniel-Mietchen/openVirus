 </sup>. The best fitting solutions obtained with parameters given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> are depicted together with the 99% confidence range, which was obtained by letting for all parameters a 1% relative error w.r.t. the best fitting parameters. Our model gives a reasonably good fit, reproducing the two larger outbreaks of 2016 and 2017 and a modest number of cases in 2018. We note that the two-peak case could not have been reproduced using a time-constant model.
