<p id="Par20">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, we plot the basic reproduction number of the constant model as a function of mosquito birth rate, and human–mosquito transmission rates and human-to-human transmission rate (with the rest of the parameters set as obtained in the fitting to data from Suriname). The figure suggests that mosquito control and sexual protection are both important factors in the spread of Zika fever and that vector control might be insufficient to control the disease if sexual transmission rate is high.
