<p id="Par2">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a virus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, primarily transmitted to humans by the bites of infected female mosquitoes from the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus, such as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>

 </sup>, widespread in tropical and subtropical regions and spreading in temperate areas as well. ZIKV is related to other arboviruses like chikungunya and dengue. Beside the major source of transmission (mosquito bites) the virus can also be passed on through other means. Unlike the above-listed diseases, Zika can be transmitted through sexual contacts, mostly from men to women

 </sup>. The disease can be passed from a person with Zika before the start of the symptoms, while having symptoms, and after their symptoms end. The virus may also be passed by asymptomatic carriers

 </sup>. Studies suggest that ZIKV can remain in semen longer (possibly even six months) than in other body fluids

 </sup>. Another important way of transmission is from expectant mother to her child during pregnancy or around the time of birth. This may lead to Congenital Zika Syndrome the symptoms of which include microcephaly and a specific pattern of brain damage. The virus can also be transmitted through blood transfusion and breastfeeding
