  <p>Attenuation of PR8/AA and PR8/Len viruses in vivo. Six-to-8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) were infected intranasally (i.n.) with the indicated FFU of PR8/AA (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) or PR8/Len (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) viruses and then monitored daily for 2 weeks for body weight loss (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>) and survival (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>). Mice that lost 25% of their initial body weight were sacrificed. Data represent the means and SDs of the results determined for individual mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5). The viral 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD
   <sub>50</sub>) for PR8/AA and PR8/Len were calculated based on survival data using the method of Reed and Muench [
   <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>) Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA test comparing % body weight loss between groups (* 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) Statistical analysis was performed using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test (* 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
