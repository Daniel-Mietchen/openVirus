  <p>Location of the 
   <italic>ts, ca</italic> and 
   <italic>att</italic> mutations of AA and Len MDV in the viral polymerase complex. (
   <bold>A</bold>) PB1 (green spheres) and PB2 (purple sphere) mutations responsible for the ts, ca and att phenotype of AA are shown on the reference model of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp, complex (PDB ID 5M3H) [
   <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The RdRp complex is shown as a surface-rendering model with its subunits PA (blue), PB1 (yellow) and PB2 (purple), and bound vRNA (red). Dotted square (red) indicates the PB2 cap-binding domain. Red asterisk shows the approximate location of the endonuclease catalytic site of PA. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Close-up images of the locations of the AA PB1 mutations E581G and A661T (left) and K391E (right). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Same as in (
   <bold>A</bold>) but for Len. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Close up locations of LenV591I (PB1, left), K265N (PB1, right) and V478L (PB2, right) mutations. All images were generated and rendered in the program Pymol [
