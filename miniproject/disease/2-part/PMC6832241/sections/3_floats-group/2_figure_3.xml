  <p>In vitro characterization of PR8/AA and PR8/Len viruses. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Multicycle growth kinetics: MDCK cells (12-well plate format, 4 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were infected at low MOI (0.001) with PR8/WT (white bars), PR8/AA (black bars) and PR8/Len (grey bars) viruses and placed at 33 °C, 37 °C, or 39 °C. Tissue culture supernatants were recovered at the indicated times post-infection (p.i.) and viral titers were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/mL) using an anti-NP mAb (HB-65). Data represent the means and SDs of the results determined from triplicate wells. Dotted black lines indicate the limit of detection (200 FFU/mL). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Plaque assays: MDCK cells (6-well plate format, 1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> cells/well) were infected with PR8/WT, PR8/AA or PR8/Len viruses and incubated at 33 °C, 37 °C, or 39 °C for 3 days. Plaque phenotype was assessed by immunostaining with the HB-65 anti-NP mAb.
