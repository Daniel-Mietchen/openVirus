  <p>Contribution of PB2 and PB1 mutations of PR8/AA and PR8/Len in the viral polymerase activity at different temperatures. HEK293T cells (12-well plate format, 4 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were transiently co-transfected with 250 ng of the indicated combinations of ambisense pDZ expression plasmids encoding the PB2 and PB1 from PR8/WT, PR8/AA and PR8/Len together with the pDZ encoding PA and NP PR8/WT proteins; together with 500 ng of the hPol-I-GFP (
   <bold>A</bold>) and -Gluc (
   <bold>B</bold>), and 100 ng of SV40 Cluc to normalize transfection efficiencies. After transfection, cells were placed at 33 °C, 37 °C, or 39 °C, and reporter gene expression was evaluated 24 h later by GFP imaging (
   <bold>A</bold>) and Gluc expression (
   <bold>B</bold>). Gluc activity was normalized to that of Cluc. Data represent means and SDs of the triplicates. Normalized reporter expression is relative to that in the absence of pDZ NP plasmid. Data were represented as relative activity considering the activity of each polymerase complex at 33 °C as 100%. *,
