<p>Both of the commercial/licensed lineages of LAIV (AA and Len) have mutations in the PB2 and PB1 viral segments. Thus, we next evaluated which of the viral segments has a more significant impact on the temperature sensitive phenotype in PR8. Using the same minigenome approach and different combinations of PB2 and PB1 viral segments of PR8/WT, PR8/AA or PR8/Len, GFP (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) expression levels were evaluated. PR8/WT polymerase activity was similar at the three tested temperatures (33 °C, 37 °C and 39 °C), while reporter gene expression by PR8/AA and PR8/Len polymerase complexes was reduced at 37 °C and, more markedly, at 39 °C, similar to our initial minigenome studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref>). When PR8/AA PB2 or PB1 were combined with PR8/WT PB1 and PB2, respectively, we observed reduced GFP and Gluc expression levels at 37 °C and 39 °C as compared to those at 33 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). However, the AA PB1 mutations conferred a stronger 
 <italic>ts</italic> phenotype effect than the AA PB2 mutations. In the case of PR8/Len, both the PB1 and PB2 segments induced a similar decrease in GFP and Gluc expression at 37 °C and 39 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). Remarkably, the combinations that contain only one of the viral segments (PB2 or PB1) with the LAIV mutations (AA or Len) had an accentuated 
 <italic>ts</italic> phenotype in our minigenome assays. These results demonstrate that mutations in both PB2 and PB1 segments are responsible for the 
 <italic>ts</italic> phenotype of AA and Len MDV and an additive effect in the polymerase activity at high temperatures is observed when both viral proteins (PB2 and PB1) have the aforementioned mutations.
