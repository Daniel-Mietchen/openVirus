<p>To have a more complete analysis of immune responses, we also evaluated and compared the induction of CD8 T cell responses by PR8/AA and PR8/Len (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>). To that end, groups of C57BL/6 mice (
 <italic>N</italic> = 5) were immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> or 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU PR8/AA, or mock-vaccinated (PBS). At 10 days p.i., lungs and spleens were recovered and processed to collect CD8 T cells. The results showed that vaccination with both PR8 LAIVs induced NP- and PA-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>D,F). Although no statistical differences were observed when comparing the responses induced by PR8/Len versus PR8/AA (with the exception of the levels of PA-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of mice vaccinated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>C), the number of CD8 T cells in the lungs and spleen tended to be greater after vaccination with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len and 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/AA than with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU PR8/Len. These results suggest that vaccination with both LAIVs elicits a robust virus-specific CD8 T cell response in the spleen and lung.
