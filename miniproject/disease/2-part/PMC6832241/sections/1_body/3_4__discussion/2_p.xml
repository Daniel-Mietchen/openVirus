<p>Since a direct comparison of the mutations responsible for the 
 <italic>ts, ca</italic> and 
 <italic>att</italic> phenotype of the US AA and the Russian Len MDVs in the same virus backbone had not been conducted, we introduced the mutations of the Russian Len MDV into PR8, and compared them to our previously described PR8 containing the US AA MDV mutations [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Using a minigenome assay, we observed that the mutations of the Russian Len MDV resulted in a greater reduction in polymerase activity at non-permissive (37ºC and 39ºC) temperatures compared to those of the US AA MDV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained when the replicative phenotype of a recombinant PR8 containing the mutations in the PB2, PB1 and NEP of the Russian Len MDV (PR8/Len) was examined, and compared to our previously described PR8/AA [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In vitro results (multicycle growth kinetics and plaque phenotype) demonstrated that PR8/Len was more attenuated at high temperatures (37 °C and 39 °C) than PR8/AA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f003">Figure 3</xref>), similar to our minigenome results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Analogous results were obtained in vivo since PR8/Len was more attenuated than PR8/AA, with the PR8/Len MLD
 <sub>50</sub> being ~5× greater than the MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of PR8/AA (
