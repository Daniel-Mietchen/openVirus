 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] IAVs. Likewise, the mutations of the Russian Len MDV conferred robust 
 <italic>ts, ca</italic> and 
 <italic>att</italic> phenotypes in the genetic background of PR8. It remains to be determined whether this also applies to different influenza virus strains and/or subtypes. Nevertheless, our results have important implications for the development of new and improved LAIVs for the treatment of human and/or animal influenza infections. Specifically, our findings with PR8 suggest that it may be possible to update the MDV backbone of the currently available US or Russian H2N2 LAIVs by simply introducing the mutations of the Russian Len or US AA MDVs into the backbone of a more recent H1N1 (and maybe H3N2) seasonal circulating strain. However, it will be important to demonstrate that introduction of these 
 <italic>ts, ca</italic> and 
 <italic>att</italic> mutations results in the desired attenuated phenotype since we have previously shown that introduction of the US AA MDV mutations into the backbone of a recent pandemic Cal/09 did not resulted in an attenuated phenotype in vivo [
