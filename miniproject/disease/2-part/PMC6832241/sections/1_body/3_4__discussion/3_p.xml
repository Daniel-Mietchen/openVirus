<p>When we compared the ability of PR8/AA and PR8/Len to induce protective immune responses against homologous (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>) viral challenges, as well as CD8T cell responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>), we found that it was necessary to immunize mice with a ~ 1 log higher dose of PR8/Len (10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU) than PR8/AA (10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU) to reach similar levels of humoral (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>) and cellular (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>) responses. Notably, vaccination with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len induced complete protection against a homologous challenge with PR8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f007">Figure 7</xref>), while similar levels of protection against heterologous challenge with X-31 were observed using 10x more PR8/Len than PR8/AA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Although no statistically significant differences were observed in the levels of influenza-specific CD8 T cells induced with 10
 <sup>3</sup> or 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, or 10
 <sup>3</sup> of PR8/AA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f006">Figure 6</xref>Aâ€“C), levels of positive CD8 T cells in the lungs from mice vaccinated with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU PR8/Len and 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU PR8/AA were similar - and greater than those observed in mice infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of PR8/Len, correlating with the level of protection against X31 challenge (
