<p>The mutations responsible for the 
 <italic>ts, ca</italic> and 
 <italic>att</italic> phenotypes of the two commercially available MDVs (US (AA) and Russian (Len)) have been previously described [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. One mutation in PB2 (N265S), three substitutions in PB1 (K391E, E581G and A661T) and one amino acid change in NP (D34G) are the major contributors to the 
 <italic>ts, ca</italic> and 
 <italic>att</italic> phenotype of US AA MDV. Mutations located in the PB2 (V478L), PB1 (K265N and V591I) and in the NEP (M100I) are responsible for the 
 <italic>ts, ca</italic> and 
 <italic>att</italic> phenotype of the Russian Len MDV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Using a bat influenza A virus polymerase structure solved by X-ray crystallography as a reference model (PDB ID 5M3H, [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]), which is homologous to H1N1 virus polymerase complex with greater than 80% sequence similarity (PB2: 83%, PB1: 89% and PA: 83%), the location of these mutations are identified as distal from the endonuclease catalytic site of the PA subunit and appear rather random. However, upon closer inspection, we realize many of these mutations are at or near the interface between subunits, in particular, A661T mutation present in the PB1 from US AA MDV, and V591I and K265N mutations found in the PB1 from Russian Len MDV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f009">Figure 9</xref>B,D, respectively). Therefore, we speculate that the mutations responsible for the 
 <italic>ts</italic>, 
 <italic>ca</italic> and 
 <italic>att</italic> phenotype may relate to their effect on polymerase complex formation, possibly affecting the stability of the complex, rather than affecting the stability of each subunit itself. Of particular note, it is interesting to see the presence of a mutation within the cap-binding domain of PB2 subunit (V478L, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00928-f009">Figure 9</xref>C), possibly affecting its cap-snatching activity to generate a 5â€™-capped primer for transcription initiation. This mutation is only found in the Russian Len MDV, and perhaps explains the difference seen in its attenuation when compared to that of US AA MDV. However, further experiments are necessary to elucidate the roles of the LAIV mutations and to gain a better mechanistic understanding of these attenuated LAIVs.
