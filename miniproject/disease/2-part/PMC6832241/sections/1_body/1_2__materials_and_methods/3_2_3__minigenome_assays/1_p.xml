<p>The ability of PR8/WT, PR8/AA and PR8/Len viral polymerase complexes to replicate and transcribe at different temperatures (33 °C, 37 °C and 39 °C) were evaluated in HEK293T cells (12-well plate format, 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates). Cells were co-transfected in suspension, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US), with 250 ng of the indicated combinations of ambisense pDZ-PB2 (WT, AA or Len), pDZ-PB1 (WT, AA or Len), pDZ-PA and pDZ-NP plasmids, together with 500 ng of two reporter viral (v)RNA-like expression plasmids encoding the GFP and Gluc driven by a human RNA polymerase I promoter (hPol-I-GFP and hPol-I-Gluc, respectively), and 100 ng of a reporter plasmid expressing Cypridina luciferase (Cluc) under the control of the constitutively active simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter (pSV40-Cluc) to normalize transfection efficiencies. Cells transfected in the absence of pDZ-NP were included as a negative control. Empty pDZ plasmid was used to keep the amount of transfected plasmid DNA constant in the negative control. At 24 h post-transfection (p.t.), cells were analyzed for GFP expression and photographed using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX81) and camera (QIMAGING, Retiga 2000R); Gluc and Cluc expression levels were determined in tissue culture supernatants (TCS) using the BioluxGaussia and Cypridina Luciferase Assay kits (New England BioLabs) and quantified with a Lumicount luminometer (Packard). Reporter Gluc gene activation was normalized to that of Cluc and shown as fold induction over the level of induction of the negative control (no pDZ-NP). Mean values and standard deviations (SDs) were calculated and statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student 
 <italic>t</italic>-test with Microsoft Excel software. Data are represented as relative activity considering the activity of each polymerase complex combination at 33 °C as 100%.
