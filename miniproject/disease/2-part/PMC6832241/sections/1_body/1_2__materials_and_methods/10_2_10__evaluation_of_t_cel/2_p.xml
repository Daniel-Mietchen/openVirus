<p>Single cell suspensions were prepared for Flow cytometry analysis by staining in PBS containing 1% FBS, purified CD16/32 (clone 2.4G2), NP and PA tetramers, and the following antibodies: TCRβ-PerCPCy5.5, CD8α-FITC, CD4-BV421, CD44-APCCy7, and CD62L-PECy7. Cells were subsequently stained for viability using Live Dead Aqua (Invitrogen). All antibodies were obtained from eBioscience, BD Biosciences, or Biolegend. PA and NP tetramers [
