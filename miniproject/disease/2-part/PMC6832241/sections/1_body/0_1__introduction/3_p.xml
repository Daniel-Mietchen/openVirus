<p>LAIVs have been generated by passaging influenza viruses at gradually reduced temperatures in eggs or cultured cells to generate temperature sensitive (
 <italic>ts</italic>) viruses that replicate efficiently at low temperatures (cold adapted, 
 <italic>ca</italic>) but not at elevated temperatures (temperature sensitive; 
 <italic>ts</italic>); such viruses also possess an attenuated phenotype (
 <italic>att</italic>) in vivo [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00928" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The generation of these viral variants was based on the ability of influenza viruses to replicate in the upper (25–33 °C) and lower (37 °C) respiratory tract (URT and LRT, respectively). LAIVs have restricted replication at non-permissive temperatures encountered in the LRT (37 °C–39 °C) but are able to replicate efficiently at permissive temperatures encountered in the URT and nose (33 °C). As a consequence, they induce mucosal immunity at the site of infection (URT) [
