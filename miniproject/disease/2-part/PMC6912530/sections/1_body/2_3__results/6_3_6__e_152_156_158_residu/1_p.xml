<p>As virus fusion with host cells is highly dependent on conformational changes of the E protein triggered at low-pH, we hypothesize that the reduced fusion we observed with the mutant molecular clone BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> bearing E-152/156/158 residues from MR766 could be the consequence of conformational differences between E proteins of the two molecular clones. In order to test this hypothesis, BR15, BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766 sequences coding for TMD2-prM/E were codon-optimised for expression in mammalian cells and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. HEK-293T cells were transfected with different plasmids and positive cells were selected with antibiotics. The resulting stable cell lines were fractionated to evaluate the capacity of recombinant E proteins to fold properly, insolubility been a hallmark of misfolded proteins [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f005">Figure 5</xref>a revealed that BR15
 <sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766 TMD2-prM/E overexpression resulted in a greater E protein propensity to accumulate in insoluble fractions than that of BR15 overexpression, as shown by inversion of soluble/insoluble ratios. Interestingly, differences observed between BR15 and mutant BR15 TMD2-prM/E suggested that ZIKV E proteins bear different conformations that only depend on E-152/156/158 residues. To verify these observations, the same samples were immunoblotted using a 4G2 monoclonal antibody, which recognises a highly conserved fusion loop sequence of most flaviviruses. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f005">Figure 5</xref>b, 4G2 monoclonal antibody strongly reacts against E protein from BR15, whereas we could barely detect any signal with the two E proteins bearing E-152/156/158 residues from MR766. Preliminary in silico modelling of ZIKV E proteins suggest that changes in the glycosylation motif could affect structure of the glycosylation and fusion loops as well as interactions with surrounding residues (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-01444">Figure S2</xref>) and surface hydrophobicity (not shown). These data confirm that E-152/156/158 residues in the EDI domain support conformational changes on the ZIKV E protein, which could be detected in the fusion loop of EDII domain. Finally, these results suggest that conformational changes occur in BR15 E protein upon mutation of E-152/156/158 residues.
