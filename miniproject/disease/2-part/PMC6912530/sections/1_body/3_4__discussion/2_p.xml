<p>The first step in viral entry pathway involves nonspecific viral binding to cellular attachment factors. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, which are abundantly expressed on numerous cell types, are considered as low-affinity attachment factors by flaviviruses. These interactions serve to concentrate viruses on the cell surface and are mediated by the EDIII domain of E proteins [

Our data demonstrate that E-152/156/158 residues of ZIKV E protein do not influence virus binding, which suggests that domain EDIII conformation is not strongly affected by E-152/156/158 residues. We conclude that this initial step of ZIKV entry into cells does not depend on E-152/156/158 residues of the E protein.
