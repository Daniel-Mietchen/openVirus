<p>Activation of the Interferon regulatory factors (IRF) pathway was monitored by measuring 
 <italic>Lucia</italic> luciferase activity in A549-Dual™ cells. It was evaluated using QUANTI-Luc substrate (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. IRF-induced luciferase levels were quantified using a FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany). Results are presented with subtraction of values from mock-infected cells.
