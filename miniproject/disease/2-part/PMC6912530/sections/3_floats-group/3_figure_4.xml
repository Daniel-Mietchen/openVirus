  <p>Viral fusion in A549-Dual™ cells. Pre-chilled cells were incubated at 4 °C with ZIKV at MOI of 1. After 1-h incubation, cells were shifted to 37 °C. Chloroquine was then added to the culture medium. Viral RNA was measured by RT-qPCR 30 h at 37 °C. Error bars represent standard errors of two independent experiments. *:
