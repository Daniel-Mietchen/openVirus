To better understand molecular mechanisms underlying the increase in human cases with severe pathologies, we recently demonstrated the functional roles of structural proteins capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), and envelop (E) of ZIKV epidemic strains with the initiation of viral infection in human cells. Specifically, we found that the C-prM region contributes to permissiveness of human host cells to ZIKV infection and ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects, whereas the E protein is associated with viral attachment and early infection. In the present study, we further characterize ZIKV E proteins by investigating the roles of residues isoleucine 152 (Ile152), threonine 156 (Thr156), and histidine 158 (His158) (i.e., the E-152/156/158 residues), which surround a unique <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site (E-154), in permissiveness of human host cells to epidemic ZIKV infection. For comparison purpose, we generated mutant molecular clones of epidemic BeH819015 (BR15) and historical MR766-NIID (MR766) strains that carry each other&#x02019;s E-152/156/158 residues, respectively. We observed that the BR15 mutant containing the E-152/156/158 residues from MR766 was less infectious in A549-Dual&#x02122; cells than parental virus. In contrast, the MR766 mutant containing E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 displayed increased infectivity. The observed differences in infectivity were, however, not correlated with changes in viral binding onto host-cells or cellular responses to viral infection. Instead, the E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 were associated with an increased efficiency of viral membrane fusion inside infected cells due to conformational changes of E protein that enhance exposure of the fusion loop. Our data highlight an important contribution of E-152/156/158 residues to the early steps of ZIKV infection in human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>flavivirus</kwd><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>envelope protein</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd><kwd>fusion loop</kwd><kwd>viral fusion</kwd><kwd>cell entry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cells-08-01444"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Mosquito-borne Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), Yellow fever (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses belonging to flavivirus genus (<italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family), are four enveloped RNA viruses of significant public health concern worldwide [<xref rid="B1-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent ZIKV global outbreaks, with Brazil at the epicentre, highlighted how a previously neglected flavivirus can turn into a severe threat for human health. While human ZIKV infections remained only sporadic and with a limited impact for decades [<xref rid="B5-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], recent outbreaks revealed that ZIKV caused clusters of severe congenital and neurological abnormalities in infants and peripheral nervous system impairments in adults [<xref rid="B9-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Considering the dramatic increase of severe human cases, strategies to efficiently control this virus, either in terms of antiviral therapies or vaccines, are urgently needed and a granted requirement for more extensive studies.</p><p>Flaviviruses contain a genomic single-stranded positive RNA encoding a single large polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into three structural proteins (C, prM/M and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1 to NS5). The latter are responsible for virus replication, assembly and escape from host immune system, while structural proteins form the viral particle surrounding genomic viral RNA. Among structural proteins, the E protein is responsible for viral entry into host cells. Viral E protein first binds to cellular attachment factors and receptors, leading to virion internalisation primarily through a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway [<xref rid="B13-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In endosomes, fusion of viral and cellular membranes occurs after E protein conformational changes triggered by low pH [<xref rid="B14-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The E protein peptide chain folds into three distinct domains: a central &#x000df;-barrel (domain EDI), an elongated dimerization region (domain EDII), which includes the fusion loop, and a C-terminal, immunoglobulin-like module (domain EDIII) [<xref rid="B15-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most flavivirus E proteins are post-translationally modified by addition of a single N-linked oligosaccharide on residue N-154 located within the EDI-loop [<xref rid="B16-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Flavivirus E proteins represent one of the key determinants for viral pathogenesis. Flavivirus envelope supports virus tropism and single amino-acid changes can redirect virus tropism [<xref rid="B17-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Flavivirus E proteins also represent a major target for neutralizing antibodies but, at the same time, can be involved in enhancement/cross-reactivity of reactive antibodies [<xref rid="B18-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Recently, our studies on chimeric ZIKV clones between an epidemic Brazilian strain of ZIKV BeH819015 (hereafter called BR15) and a historical African strain MR766 highlighted an important role of two structural proteins prM/M, and E in ZIKV ability to infect human cells [<xref rid="B16-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We further showed that they contribute to the initiation of viral infection. Analysis of chimeric viruses indicated that C-prM region plays a role in triggering cell death by ZIKV and E protein is associated with viral attachment to host cells during early infection [<xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Flavivirus E proteins usually contain two <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites at position E-56 and E-154. The first site is lacking in ZIKV E protein and contribution of the second site in ZIKV viral cycle, including in the mosquito vector, has been recently highlighted [<xref rid="B25-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. N-linked glycosylation of the E protein was shown to be an important determinant of ZIKV virulence in a mouse model of viral encephalitis [<xref rid="B22-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B26-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In invertebrate vectors, ZIKV bearing an unglycosylated E protein was attenuated in its capacity to replicate in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="B27-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although a <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site is highly conserved among flaviviruses, which suggests of its biological importance, E proteins could remain unglycosylated as it has been observed in some ZIKV strains. To date, the exact mechanism by which the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation motif region of the E protein contributes to ZIKV infectivity still remains elusive. In the present study, we further characterised structural protein contribution in ZIKV infectivity by focusing on the ZIKV E protein. Our goal was to determine whether three E residues&#x02014;Ile152, Thr156, and His158 (hereafter called as E-152/156/158 residues)&#x02014;which surround the Asn154 composing the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site NDT, may have any effect on ZIKV&#x02019;s ability to infect human cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-cells-08-01444"><title>2.

Recombinant proteins comprised aa 275 to aa 775 of polyproteins, which correspond to the very end of prM protein (TMD2, used as signal peptide for E proteins) and the entire E protein.

Alteration of Residues E-152 to E-158 of ZIKV E Protein Does Not Affect Virus Binding to Host Cells but May Affect Virus Progeny Production</title><p>We previously showed that historical and epidemic ZIKV strains display differences in their abilities to bind host cells, leading to differences in cell susceptibility to infection (18, 19). Here, we further investigated the ability of the described mutant clones to bind onto A549-Dual&#x02122; cells. Virus binding assays were performed and analysed by RT-qPCR to determine virus particle binding onto cell surface after an incubation period of 1 h. Panels A and B show no difference between mutant clones and their respective parental clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These results contrast with other studies in mosquito cells [<xref rid="B27-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], suggesting that viral receptors may vary between vertebrate and invertebrate cells. These data suggest that alteration of residues E-152 to E-158 of ZIKV E protein does not affect virus bindings to A549-Dual&#x02122; cells.</p><p>Instead, these results suggest that E-152/156/158 residues might influence ZIKV progeny production. Indeed, the progeny production of MR766<sup>E-MUT</sup> was modestly but reproducibly increased in comparison to that of MR766 (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> PFU&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> vs. 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> PFU&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) at 72 hpi [<xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Differences in progeny production were observed at as early as 24 hpi. Similar differences were also seen on the percentages of the infected cell at 48 hpi.

Mutations at E-152/156/158 Residues Have No Effect on ZIKV-Induced Cell Death or Interferon Pathways</title><p>To determine whether differences described with the mutant viruses were associated with specific host-cell responses, we first analysed virus-induced cell death at 48 h and 72 h post-infection. No difference in cytotoxicity measured by LDH release was observed between wild-type and mutant viruses (MR766 and BR15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f003">Figure 3</xref>, panels a and b). We then took advantage of the properties of A549-Dual&#x02122; cells to test whether mutant viruses can trigger different host cell innate immunity. A549-Dual&#x02122; cells were derived from A549 cells by stable integration of two reporter genes: <italic>SEAP</italic> gene (Secreted Embryonic Alkaline Phosphatase) and <italic>Lucia</italic> luciferase gene under the respective transcriptional control of an IFN-&#x003b2; minimal promoter, which is fused to NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites or an ISG54 minimal promoter in conjunction with interferon-sensitive response elements. We examined possible activation of the IRF pathway by monitoring production of <italic>Lucia</italic> luciferase at 48 dpi and 72 hpi. Similar responses were observed in both wild-type and mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f003">Figure 3</xref>, panels c and d). The NF-&#x003ba;B pathway was not investigated, as we showed previously that this pathway is not activated upon ZIKV infection [<xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results indicate that differences in the mutant virus properties could not be explained by specific host-cell responses, which are consistent with our previous observations suggesting a link between host-cell responses and ZIKV nonstructural proteins [<xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-cells-08-01444"><title>3.5. E-152/156/158 Residues from BR15 Facilitate Viral Fusion</title><p>We showed earlier that E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 have a growth advantage without apparent association with cellular attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f002">Figure 2</xref>) or specific host-cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f003">Figure 3</xref>). We then studied viral fusion to test whether it could explain the observed growth advantage. Viral fusion of flaviviruses is commonly triggered from endosomes upon low-pH by a series of molecular changes within the E protein, resulting in the release of the nucleocapsid into cell cytoplasm. Chloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline, is a weak base that inhibits endosome acidification and consequently restricts viral replication of many viruses through inhibition of pH-dependent steps. Recently, chloroquine was shown to inhibit Zika virus infection in different cellular models [<xref rid="B36-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As BR15 and BR15<sup>E-MUT</sup> showed significant differences in the percentage of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f002">Figure 2</xref>f), we decided to focus on these two molecular clones for the following virus fusion experiments. We treated A549-Dual&#x02122; cells infected with BR15 or BR15<sup>E-MUT</sup> with 100 &#x000b5;M of chloroquine 1 hpi for 2 h and then cells were moved back to regular medium. Intracellular viral RNA was quantified 30 hpi by RT-qPCR. BR15<sup>E-MUT</sup> fusion was significantly restricted by chloroquine treatment compared to that of BR15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f004">Figure 4</xref>). These data suggest that E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 favour viral fusion with host-cell membranes.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-cells-08-01444"><title>3.6. E-152/156/158 Residues from BR15 Favour Conformational Changes within the Fusion Loop</title><p>As virus fusion with host cells is highly dependent on conformational changes of the E protein triggered at low-pH, we hypothesize that the reduced fusion we observed with the mutant molecular clone BR15<sup>E-MUT</sup> bearing E-152/156/158 residues from MR766 could be the consequence of conformational differences between E proteins of the two molecular clones. In order to test this hypothesis, BR15, BR15<sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766 sequences coding for TMD2-prM/E were codon-optimised for expression in mammalian cells and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. HEK-293T cells were transfected with different plasmids and positive cells were selected with antibiotics. The resulting stable cell lines were fractionated to evaluate the capacity of recombinant E proteins to fold properly, insolubility been a hallmark of misfolded proteins [<xref rid="B32-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B35-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Resulting fractions were subjected to an immunoblot analysis. We first used a rat antibody developed in-house, specifically raised against E protein domain EDIII [<xref rid="B28-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f005">Figure 5</xref>a revealed that BR15<sup>E-MUT</sup> and MR766 TMD2-prM/E overexpression resulted in a greater E protein propensity to accumulate in insoluble fractions than that of BR15 overexpression, as shown by inversion of soluble/insoluble ratios. Interestingly, differences observed between BR15 and mutant BR15 TMD2-prM/E suggested that ZIKV E proteins bear different conformations that only depend on E-152/156/158 residues. To verify these observations, the same samples were immunoblotted using a 4G2 monoclonal antibody, which recognises a highly conserved fusion loop sequence of most flaviviruses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01444-f005">Figure 5</xref>b, 4G2 monoclonal antibody strongly reacts against E protein from BR15, whereas we could barely detect any signal with the two E proteins bearing E-152/156/158 residues from MR766. Preliminary in silico modelling of ZIKV E proteins suggest that changes in the glycosylation motif could affect structure of the glycosylation and fusion loops as well as interactions with surrounding residues (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-01444">Figure S2</xref>) and surface hydrophobicity (not shown). These data confirm that E-152/156/158 residues in the EDI domain support conformational changes on the ZIKV E protein, which could be detected in the fusion loop of EDII domain. Finally, these results suggest that conformational changes occur in BR15 E protein upon mutation of E-152/156/158 residues.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-cells-08-01444"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The role of structural proteins in determining infectivity of human cells to ZIKV infection has been previously reported [<xref rid="B23-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Zika viruses of historical or epidemic strains display differences in their abilities to bind host cells leading to differences in cell susceptibility to infection. To further characterise biological properties of contemporary ZIKV strains, which have been associated with recent epidemics and severe forms of human disease, we investigated the role of E-152/156/158 residues of the envelope protein, residues located around a unique <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site (E-154) in viral entry into host cells. Our mutagenesis data showed that E-152/156/158 residues are responsible for the differences we observed in the infectivity of the virus and progeny production kinetics, without affecting viral attachment and host-cell responses. Further characterisations identified the E protein conformational changes in the fusion loop, supported by E-152/156/158 residues, as a major event in virus fusion and release of viral RNA into cell cytoplasm.</p><p>The first step in viral entry pathway involves nonspecific viral binding to cellular attachment factors. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, which are abundantly expressed on numerous cell types, are considered as low-affinity attachment factors by flaviviruses. These interactions serve to concentrate viruses on the cell surface and are mediated by the EDIII domain of E proteins [<xref rid="B38-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that E-152/156/158 residues of ZIKV E protein do not influence virus binding, which suggests that domain EDIII conformation is not strongly affected by E-152/156/158 residues. We conclude that this initial step of ZIKV entry into cells does not depend on E-152/156/158 residues of the E protein.</p><p>Viral particle internalisation could occur through distinct routes, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis or non-classical clathrin-independent endocytic pathways. These distinct entry modes depend not only on host cells but also on viral serotype or strain [<xref rid="B39-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Despite these differences in the internalisation process, genome release into the cytoplasm always occurs through E protein-mediated membrane fusion [<xref rid="B40-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The low-pH environment within endosomes triggers a series of molecular changes within flavivirus E protein resulting in fusion of viral membrane with endosomal membrane and subsequent release of the nucleocapsid into cell cytoplasm [<xref rid="B13-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The initial step in membrane fusion involves protonation-dependent disruption of E protein rafts at viral surface, resulting in conformational changes and formation of a fusion pore from which the nucleocapsid is released into the cytosol. Evidences suggested that the glycan loop modulates the overall Flavivirus E protein conformation and, specifically, fusion loop exposure [<xref rid="B41-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Sevvana and colleagues proposed that, given the close proximity of ZIKV glycan and fusion loops, any interaction of the glycan loop with a receptor on a host-cell surface might promote exposure of the fusion loop and facilitate formation of fusogenic trimers leading to membrane fusion [<xref rid="B43-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Another study based on antibody neutralizing activities demonstrated that residues surrounding ZIKV E protein glycan regulate virus antigenicity [<xref rid="B44-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In a previous study, we also evaluated immunogenicity of a chimeric viral clone ZIKBeHMR-2, in which the region encoding envelope proteins of MR766 African strain backbone was replaced with its counterpart from BeH819015 epidemic strain [<xref rid="B45-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Amino-acid substitutions I152T, T156I, and H158Y were introduced in the glycan loop of the E protein, making chimeric ZIKBeHMR-2 a nonglycosylated virus. Those results suggest that, rather than just determining the glycosylation, amino-acid residues at position 152, 156 and 158 play a pivotal role on accessibility of neutralizing antibody epitopes on mature virus particles. In this study, we demonstrated that changes in the glycan loop can modulate accessibility to the fusion loop. Although these observations were made independently of the presence of a glycan, it is conceivable that E protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation could provide another level of regulation on the access of the fusion loop. The role of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation on ZIKV E protein has also been investigated using pseudoviral particles, showing that reduced infectivity was observed with mutant viral particles lacking the N-glycan [<xref rid="B47-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Altogether, these studies suggest that conformational changes induced at the glycan loop most probably modulate fusion loop exposure and subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes, which strongly supports our observations.</p><p>One interesting finding from this study is that chloroquine treatment results in less BR15<sup>E-MUT</sup> entries than it does for BR15. This finding suggests that E-152/156/158 residues of BR15 increase pH sensitivity of E protein. To generate BR15<sup>E-MUT</sup>, its sequence was modified so that the coding region of the E protein IVNDTGH (amino acids 152 to 158) in BR15 was replaced with TVNDIGY motif from MR766, meaning that not only <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation motif was abrogated but also that histidine E-158 was changed into a tyrosine. Histidine residues have been described as pH sensors in flavivirus membrane fusion [<xref rid="B48-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Fusion initiation is crucially dependent on protonation of conserved histidine residues at the interface between domains EDI and EDIII of E protein, leading to dissolution of domain interactions and to fusion peptide exposure. Given the fusion differences we observed between wild-type and mutant BR15 molecular clones, further investigations on histidine E-158 protonation are required to determine its exact contribution to membrane fusion.</p><p>Finally, our analysis of virus inocula generated in Vero cells showed differences in particle-to-PFU ratios indicating that E-152/156/158 residues of BR15 E protein facilitate release of more infectious particles. In addition, we demonstrated with recombinant proteins that E-152/156/158 residues of epidemic ZIKV E protein also facilitate production of more soluble proteins. These results are supported by works of Mossenta and colleagues [<xref rid="B47-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Whether these observations are due to conformational changes occurring during virion production remains undetermined. However, in a study on flavivirus cross-reactive epitopes, Crill and Chang suggested that close packing of fusion peptide against its subunit partner and glycan on the upper surface protects the fusion loop from irreversible pH-induced conformational changes during maturation and secretion [<xref rid="B49-cells-08-01444" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. All these observations suggest that E-152/156/158 residues of epidemic ZIKV E protein could also be an advantage during virion maturation process.</p><p>Altogether, our data indicate that the envelope residues E152/156/158 of Zika virus influence early stages of virus infection in human cells. This study highlights the importance of E-152/156/158 residues in ZIKV biology and specifically in their roles in supporting viral fusion. These new findings could potentially help to design innovative strategies for future ZIKV infection control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge Pascale Krejbich-Trotot and Chaker El Kalamouni for helpful discussions.
