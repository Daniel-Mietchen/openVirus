<p id="p0090">Coumarin has the potential to significantly suppress the Dengue and chikungunya viral infections 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the need is to investigate the mechanism and other effects on

 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Flaviviruses like Dengue virus need their polyprotein processing by viral NS3 protease called NS3pro for its replication activities. Activation of NS3pro requires a 47-residue catalytic part of NS2B cofactor. NS2B stabilizes and completes substrates-binding pocket of NS3pro [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Therefore, targeting binding site of NS2B/NS3 complex could be a better approach in the development of a drug molecule. With this idea, molecular docking approaches using synthetic coumarin derivatives as ligands have been applied to check their anti-dengue protease activity that is known in the case of HIV [
