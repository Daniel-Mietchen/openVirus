<p id="p0095">In a study, from the plant 
 <italic>Myrtopsis corymbosa</italic> major compounds of coumarins (ramosin, myrsellinol, myresellin) and alkaloids (skimmianine, gama-fagarin and haplopin) were extracted and their inhibitory activities were checked against Dengue infection. They exhibited weak anti-dengue activity when used separately, but showed very significant activity when their crude product was applied that contain all the components. Specifically, they showed very low activity against dengue virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (DENV-NS5) when applied separately to cells. It indicated the possibility that anti-dengue effect was due to synergetic effect of many compound or because of some other molecules present in small quantities [

Subsequently, potential and mechanism of Resvertrol (RESV), a phytoalexin (hydroxylated derivative of coumarin) against dengue viral infection were investigated. In case of Dengue infection, a DNA binding protein namely, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) translocates from nucleus to cytoplasm that triggers many inflammatory responses. RESV attenuated migration of HMGB1 out of nucleus (HMGB1 retention in nucleus mediated by Sirt1 deacetylase) this leads to suppression of dengue virus replication by increasing the production of interferon-stimulated genes. HGB1 that is known as inducer of inflammatory responses, its inhibition by RESV indicated the possibility that RESV may act as a potential anti-inflammatory agent. However, this needs further confirmation [
