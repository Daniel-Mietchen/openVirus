<p id="p0055">Currently, anti-HIV approaches are to target several steps in virus life cycle including virus-host cell attachment, cell membrane fusion, integration, assembly besides the conventional target like inhibition of the reverse transcriptase, protease, integrase [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Chemical compound coumarins have been shown from many research studies to have anti-HIV effects. Coumarin derivatives, 4-Hydroxycoumarins (warfarin, 4-HC tetramer), Pyranocoumarins (Khellactone, Calanolide), Furanocoumarin, 3-phenylcoumarins, 4-Phenylcoumarins, Hybrid coumarin analogue, Toddacoumaquinone have shown pharmacological effect against HIV infection. They inhibit HIV protease, integrase, reverse transcriptase, viral DNA replication, vpr, sp1-related genes (cell cycle arrest), Tat, Rev, glycosylation [
