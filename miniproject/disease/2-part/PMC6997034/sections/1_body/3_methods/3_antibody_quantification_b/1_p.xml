<p>To assess influenza‐specific antibodies from vaccination or infection, serum was probed in ELISA. Commercial proteins (Sinobiological, Beijing, China) to represent challenge viruses and vaccine strains included the following: H1N1‐2009 HA (A/California/07/2009), H3N2‐2013 HA (A/Switzerland/9715293/2013), H3N2‐1968 HA (A/Hong Kong/1/1968), H7N7‐2013 HA (A/Anhui/01/2013), and NP (A/Switzerland/9715293/2013). Because of commercial availability, the H3N2‐2013 protein (A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2)) was used to represent the H3N2 vaccine strain (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)), which shared 98% HA amino acid homology and showed a high level of cross‐reactivity.</p>
