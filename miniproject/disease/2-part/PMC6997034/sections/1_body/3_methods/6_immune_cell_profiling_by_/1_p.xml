<p>To quantify and profile adaptive immune cells recruited during vaccination and infection, we used multi‐parameter flow cytometry using a panel of phenotypic immune cell markers. Single‐cell suspensions were prepared from lymph nodes (mLN from infection and iLN from vaccination), spleen or BAL, as previously described.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> Cells were then stained with Zombie live/dead (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), FcR‐blocked (anti‐CD16/CD32; BD Bioscience), and stained with one of the three cocktails containing a panel of monoclonal antibodies (all from Biolegend unless otherwise indicated) for 30 min on ice in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% FBS and 0.5% NaN
 <sub>3</sub>). Cocktail 1 for GC B and Tfh cells contains the following: anti‐mouse CD3‐BV605, B220‐PECy7, CD4‐APCCy7, PNA‐FITC (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA), CXCR5‐PerCPCy5.5, CD38‐PE and intracellular Bcl6‐PEDazzle594. For intracellular stains, cells were fixed in fixation/permeabilisation buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min on ice and stained with anti‐Bcl6‐PEDazzle594 in Perm/Wash buffer (BD Bioscience). GC B cells were defined as B220

 <sup>−1</sup> of 4% PFA for 20 min on ice. Samples were acquired by flow cytometry on a FACS Attune (Invitrogen) and analysed with FlowJo software.
