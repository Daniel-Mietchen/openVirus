<p>Results represent the individual result, mean ± SEM of 4–6 mice per group, unless indicated otherwise. Statistical significance was compared between the S‐IIV group versus PBS (indicated as

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and ***
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) using a one‐way ANOVA (unless indicated) on GraphPad Prism software v8. When only two groups were present in an experiment, a Student– t‐test was performed on GraphPad Prism software v8. The Pearson correlations were also performed on GraphPad Prism software v8. To compare the distributions of the AUC IgM and IgG between groups, a binomial test of the percentage values was performed for each observed value of eIIV groups versus the S‐IIV group on GraphPad Prism software v8 with a Wilson/Brown calculation of the confidence intervals.
