<p>To determine whether vaccination elicited antibodies that reduced or increased infection, we used an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> FACS protection assay. Raji cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> per well) were infected with a MOI of 4 of H3N2‐2013, H3N2‐1968 or H7N7 virus in the presence of mice or human sera (neat, 9 μL) for 16 h in MEM (1% Pen/Strep). Cells were then fixed (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm) and stained with anti‐NP‐FITC (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in BD permeabilisation buffer for 30 min on ice. Samples were acquired by flow cytometry on a FACS Attune (Invitrogen) and analysed with FlowJo software. H3N2‐1968‐recovered mouse serum and naïve mouse serum were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The % NP
 <sup>+</sup> cells were normalised to naïve mouse serum, and a ratio above 1 indicates increased infection and below 1 indicates reduced infection. For human samples, the fold change versus day 0 responses was calculated.
