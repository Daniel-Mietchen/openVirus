<p>To map HA‐specific antibodies to the length of the HA protein, we used a fragmented YSD HA library to bind immune mouse serum. A H3N2‐1968 HA‐YSD library was constructed as previously described.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> Yeast surface expressing HA (length 100–500 bp) was constructed from random digestion of the HA fragments derived from the H3N2‐1968 HA gene. Antibody‐positive yeast were isolated by cell sorting (FACSAria I cell sorter, BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and grown overnight in selective medium. Plasmids were then extracted by Zymoprep yeast plasmid miniprep II kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) and transformed in
