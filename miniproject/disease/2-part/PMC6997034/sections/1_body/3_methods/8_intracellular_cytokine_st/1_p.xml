<p>To quantify influenza‐specific T cells producing polyfunctional antiviral cytokines, single‐cell suspensions of BAL and mLN were infected with a MOI of 4 of H3N2‐1968 virus plus 10 U mL
 <sup>−1</sup> rhIL‐2 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), purified CD49d and CD28 (Biolegend) for 6 h before the addition of BFA Golgi‐Plug, and then incubated for further 12 h at 37°C. At 18 h post‐infection, cells were washed with FACS buffer, stained with anti‐mouse CD8‐PerCPCy5.5 and CD4‐APCCy7 (Biolegend) for 30 min on ice, and then fixed (BD Cytoperm/Cytofix) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then stained intracellularly with anti‐mouse IFN‐γ‐FITC, TNF‐α‐APC and IL‐2‐PE for 30 min on ice. Samples were acquired by flow cytometry on a FACS Attune (Invitrogen) and analysed with FlowJo software. Total cytokine production was calculated by subtracting background fluorescence using the no‐virus controls.
