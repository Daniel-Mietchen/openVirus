<p>Influenza‐specific VNA was measured by standard microneutralisation (MN) assay. Immune serum was pre‐treated with receptor‐destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan). Twofold serial dilutions from 1:5 to 1:3200 of mouse serum samples were prepared in virus medium (MEM, 1% Pen/Strep). An equal volume of 200TCID
 <sub>50</sub> 35 μL
 <sup>−1</sup> of influenza viruses, H1N1‐2009, H3N2‐2013, H3N2‐1968 and H7N7 (low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI); A/Northern Shoveller/MPF518/2008), was added to the sample dilutions (final serum dilution 1:10 to 1:1280) and incubated for 2 h. Then, 35 μL of antibody/virus was added to MDCK cells and incubated for 72 h. Standard haemagglutination assay and visualisation of cytopathic effect were used to measure virus inhibition.
