<p>In Australia since 2018, H‐eIIV and A‐eIIV have been preferentially given to older adults,
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> whilst the UK switched to the A‐eIIV for older adults in 2018/19. In the United States, the H‐eIIV is now given to 40% of vaccinated older adults.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> Therefore, no current consensus on vaccine utilisation has been achieved. In our initial report,
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> we identified an improved microneutralisation response against cell‐grown H3N2 by R‐eIIV compared with the A‐eIIV and H‐eIIV. Therefore, combining those earlier findings with the results of this study, we have found that each of the eIIVs has an advantage over S‐IIV, with indications that the R‐eIIV could provide better protection against vaccine‐matched H3N2, whilst A‐eIIV and H‐eIIV provide better cross‐protection against a broader array of influenza viruses. Future studies could examine whether combination strategies, for example alternating use of different eIIVs from year to year, could take advantage of the distinct strengths of the different eIIVs.
