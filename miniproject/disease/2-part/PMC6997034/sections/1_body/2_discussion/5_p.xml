<p>The earlier and more intense induction of GC B cells by A‐eIIV and not H‐eIIV or R‐eIIV may also be as a result of the persistent deposition of the antigen in the LN by follicular dendritic cells facilitated by the MF59 adjuvant, as sustained antigen availability has previously been shown to increase the number of GC and Tfh in the LN.

 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> A‐eIIV also induced larger memory B‐cell responses than the high‐dose vaccines, H‐eIIV and R‐eIIV. Previous vaccine studies for hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccines have also reported that low doses of antigen tend to favor immune memory

The formation of long‐term memory is an advantage for extended seasonal protection against influenza infection.
