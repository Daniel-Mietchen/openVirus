<p>Influenza virus is the only pathogen that is recommended for yearly vaccination, with over 500 million doses used globally every year.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> IIV has limited protection against infecting strains that are antigenically distinct from those contained in the vaccine. This can create a public health problem, such as recent H3N2 viruses, which have been more difficult to match and control with S‐IIV.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Newly available vaccine approaches, including eIIVs, could be utilised to provide longer duration and breadth of protection, as broadly protecting vaccines are needed, but no universal influenza vaccine is licensed yet.

 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> We therefore compared the immunogenicity, mechanism of action and protective potential of three commercially available enhanced vaccines, FluAd (A‐eIIV), FluZone‐HD (H‐eIIV) and FluBlok (R‐eIIV), with a standard seasonal influenza vaccine, FluQuadri (S‐IIV), in humans and mice. We found evidence to indicate that A‐eIIV and H‐eIIV may provide longer‐lasting and broader cross‐protection against influenza viruses than S‐eIIV and R‐eIIV.
