<p>HA stem‐specific antibodies have shown remarkable cross‐reactivity in some cases for different strains, subtypes and even pan‐influenza reactivity,
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> and clinical trials are underway for HA stem vaccines to induce broadly reactive antibodies.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> A‐eIIV induced HA stem antibodies that may contribute to H3N2‐1968 cross‐reactivity and also bring an additional level of protection against other IAV subtypes such as avian H7N7.
 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> From our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> protection assay, we saw that A‐eIIV dramatically reduced H7N7‐infected cells after vaccination in mice and humans, whilst other vaccine responses did not. These 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral responses could possibly be contributed to by antibodies specific to the H3‐stem and NP proteins. Antibodies targeting the highly conserved internal NP were also highly induced after vaccination in most vaccines, excluding R‐eIIV that does not contain NP, and A‐eIIV‐treated mice had greater recall of NP antibodies during influenza challenge. The NP protein has an even higher level of sequence conservation than the HA stem (95% versus 70–40%), and is expressed on the surface of infected cells and internally of virions,
