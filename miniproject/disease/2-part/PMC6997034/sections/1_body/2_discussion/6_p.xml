<p>Vaccine‐mediated protection was further assessed by lethal H3N2‐1968 challenge at long‐term (6 months) and short‐term (21 days) memory time points post‐vaccination. Consistent with our vaccine immunogenicity results, A‐eIIV showed superiority during infection by reducing lung inflammation and increasing Th1 and Th2 cytokines that are key for viral clearance.

 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> The H3N2‐1968 HA‐specific antibody response from A‐eIIV, most importantly lung IgA, was recalled at a higher magnitude and avidity compared with other vaccine groups. Influenza‐specific polyfunctional CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells were also selectively recalled by the A‐eIIV long‐term memory response, unlike other vaccine groups.
