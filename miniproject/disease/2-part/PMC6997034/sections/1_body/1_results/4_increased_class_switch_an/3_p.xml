<p>As AID is also responsible for the CSR that takes place in the light zone of LN, we determined the level of class switching (from IgM to IgG responses) at days 7 and 21 post‐vaccination using ELISA endpoint titrations of H3‐2013 HA‐specific IgG and IgM responses in mouse serum (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f and g and Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>). At day 7, the S‐IIV H3N2‐2013 HA response was predominantly IgM (66%) rather than IgG (34%), whereas the A‐eIIV response was predominantly IgG (59%) rather than IgM (41%) (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). This indicates an earlier switch from the default IgM isotype towards the IgG isotype by A‐eIIV. By day 21, the S‐IIV H3N2‐2013 HA IgG response increased (55% IgM, 45% IgG) but was still significantly lower than the A‐eIIV response (31% IgM, 69% IgG) (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h and Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the cross‐reactive H3N2‐1968 HA‐specific antibodies, consolidating an earlier class switch induced by the A‐eIIV for cross‐reactive responses as well (Supplementary figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>). The H‐eIIV and R‐eIIV, H3N2‐2013 HA IgM and IgG switch ratios were comparable to S‐IIV at both time points (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). Also, the H3N2‐1968 HA IgG subclass response observed in the A‐eIIV group of mice was increased for both IgG1 and IgG2a compared with the S‐IIV, and for H3‐stem for IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b, which are associated with greater effector functions and maturation of B‐cell selection,
