<p>A‐eIIV elicited stable long‐lived high‐avidity antibodies to vaccine strains and cross‐reactive HA proteins, H3N2‐1968 and H3‐stem. Therefore, we investigated further the germinal centre (GC) B‐cell reaction and associated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T follicular helper (Tfh)‐cell responses in the iLN induced by the eIIVs (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). A‐eIIV elicited a significantly increased Tfh response, which was more than double that of S‐IIV at day 7 and still ongoing at day 21 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Concurrently, the GC B‐cell response was also doubled at day 7 in the A‐eIIV group compared with S‐IIV responses (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). At day 21, Tfh and GC cell counts decreased by 30‐fold in most vaccine groups, but the A‐eIIV group still maintained significantly higher GC responses than S‐IIV (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02; Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). In comparison with S‐IIV, H‐eIIV and R‐eIIV vaccination did not display any significant increase in GC or Tfh cells (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b and c).
