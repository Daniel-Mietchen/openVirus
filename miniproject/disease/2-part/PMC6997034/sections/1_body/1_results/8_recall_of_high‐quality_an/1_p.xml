<p>To investigate the local inflammatory response, we performed a 12‐panel cytokine bead array for Th1, Th2 cytokines and chemokines (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a) in BAL after challenge. S‐IIV had a significant fold‐change increase in pro‐inflammatory IFN‐γ, IL‐6, TNF‐α and IL‐2 and anti‐inflammatory IL‐4 compared with unvaccinated PBS mice (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d), whilst A‐eIIV compared with S‐IIV induced a significant increase in pro‐inflammatory IFN‐γ, TNF‐α, IL‐9 and IL‐2, which may drive viral clearance in the lung, and IL‐4 driving a Th2 response. Further, H‐eIIV had an opposite effect compared with S‐IIV, with a significant reduction of both types of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, and also of the CCL2 and CCL4 chemokines, which may lead to reduced recruitment of immune cells to the lung. Finally, R‐eIIV had comparable responses to S‐IIV.
