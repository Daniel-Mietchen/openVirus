<p>To understand the protective potential of high‐avidity H3‐HA and H3‐stem IgG by eIIV in older adults, especially A‐eIIV, we evaluated the same vaccines in mice (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Mice were vaccinated twice, and post‐vaccination immune responses were assessed at days 7 and 21. The A‐eIIV group had significantly increased day 7 and 21 post‐vaccination magnitude of HA IgG responses to vaccine strains, H1N1‐2009 and H3N2‐2013 HA (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f), whilst other eIIVs were equivalent to S‐IIV for these HA IgG responses. In addition, the H1N1‐2009 NA IgG response was elevated for A‐eIIV at days 7 and 21 post‐vaccination, whilst H‐eIIV was delayed to until day 21 post‐vaccination compared with S‐IIV (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). As R‐eIIV also does not contain NA, no substantial NA‐specific IgG responses were detected. Furthermore, virus neutralisation antibodies (VNAs) at day 7 post‐vaccination (Figure 
 <xref rid="cti21107-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g) were significantly increased for A‐eIIV against H1N1‐2009 virus (907 ± 174 versus 293 ± 27 S‐IIV) and H‐eIIV and A‐eIIV against H3N2‐2013 virus compared with S‐IIV.
