<p>Human and mouse data for A‐eIIV have shown increased H3‐HA‐specific antibodies that are high‐avidity and cross‐reactive, but the protective potential of these responses is not known. Therefore, to determine vaccine‐mediated protection we challenged eIIV mice with a lethal dose of H3N2‐1968. We selected the H3N2‐1968 virus for mouse challenge as a well‐established model of heterosubtypic protection in T cell

 <xref rid="cti21107-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> The H3N2‐1968 virus has 85.3% amino acid similarity to the HA of the H3N2‐2014 virus in the 2017/2018 vaccines used. Challenge experiments were performed at 6 months post‐vaccination (long‐term memory) to study the potential waning of vaccine responses (Figure
