<p>Similar observations were made at short‐term challenge with H3N2‐1968 and H1N1‐2009. In the short‐term challenge, no difference was observed between S‐IIV and eIIV in terms of weight loss, but the local lung damage (by total protein concentration) was reduced in A‐eIIV and H‐eIIV compared with S‐IIV, whereas R‐eIIV was elevated compared with S‐IIV (Supplementary figure

Homologous short‐term challenge with H1N1‐2009 virus also showed protection for all vaccines and a strong superiority for the A‐eIIV in terms of VNA titres and H1N1‐2009 HA‐specific antibodies but comparable serum antibody ADCC activity (Supplementary figure
