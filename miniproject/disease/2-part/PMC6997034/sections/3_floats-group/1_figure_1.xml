  <p>A‐eIIV induces high‐avidity H3‐2013 and H3‐stem IgG in humans and mice. A randomised clinical trial to assess eIIV immunogenicity compared with S‐IIV, sampled blood plasma at days 0 (baseline), 7, 30 and 365 after vaccination 
   <bold>(a)</bold>. H3N2‐2013 HA titres 
   <bold>(b)</bold>, high‐avidity H3N2‐2013 HA 
   <bold>(c)</bold> and H3‐stem‐specific 
   <bold>(d)</bold> IgG responses were measured by ELISA. The same vaccines were assessed in a mouse model of vaccination and infection 
   <bold>(e)</bold>. Vaccine strains, H1N1‐2009 and H3N2‐2013 HA‐specific and H1N1‐2009 NA‐specific, day 7 and 21 post‐vaccination IgG titres by ELISA 
   <bold>(f)</bold> and day 21 post‐vaccination by VNA 
   <bold>(g)</bold>. Cross‐reactive, H3N2‐1968, H3‐stem HA‐specific and NP‐specific, day 7 and 21 post‐vaccination IgG responses by ELISA 
   <bold>(h)</bold>. Proportion of low‐ and high‐avidity H3N2‐1968 HA and H3‐stem‐specific IgG 
   <bold>(i)</bold>. Data represent the mean, SEM and individual responses,
