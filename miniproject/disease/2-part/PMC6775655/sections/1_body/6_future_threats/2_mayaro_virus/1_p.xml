<p id="Par87">MAYV (
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) was first discovered in a group of rural workers in Trinidad in 1954 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] and subsequently reported to occur in a sylvatic cycle in South America, probably involving NHPs and forest mosquitoes (
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp.). The virus, however, has never been isolated from an NHP and the definitive reservoir host is still unproven with antibodies having been detected in many vertebrates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. In Panama, a high prevalence of neutralising antibodies was reported in howler monkeys (
 <italic>Alouatta villosa</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], and in French Guiana, anti-MAYV HAI antibodies have been detected in red howler monkeys (
 <italic>Alouatta seniculus</italic>) (70/106; 66%) and golden-handed tamarins (
 <italic>Saguinus midas</italic>) (8/44; 18%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Subsequently, they were found again in red howler monkeys (
 <italic>A. seniculus</italic>) and golden-handed tamarins (
 <italic>S. midas</italic>) (19/42; 50%) in addition to (52/98; 53%), white-faced saki (
 <italic>Pithecia pithecia</italic>) (5/80; 6%) andÂ squirrel monkeys (
 <italic>Saimiri sciureus</italic>) (6/67; 9%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. More recent studies in Brazil in 2010 and 2014, have demonstrated anti-MAYV HAI antibody in free-living capuchins (
 <italic>Sapajus</italic> spp.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], black howler monkeys (
 <italic>Alouatta caraya</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and captive NHPs [black howler monkeys (
 <italic>Alouatta caraya</italic>), white-eared titis (
 <italic>Callicebus donacophilus</italic>) and tufted capuchins (
 <italic>Cebus apella</italic>)] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. There may also be alternate or additional non-primate vertebrate hosts, and it has been suggested that MAYV is introduced into canopy-dwelling NHPs by migratory birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This might account for higher serological evidence of infection in NHPs more active in tree canopies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>].
