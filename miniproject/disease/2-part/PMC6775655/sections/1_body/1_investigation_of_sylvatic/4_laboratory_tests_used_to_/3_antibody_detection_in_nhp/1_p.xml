<p id="Par37">Arboviruses are a diverse group of nearly 500 viruses that are distributed across nine different viral families that share common morphological and molecular characteristics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. With regard to sylvatic cycles in NHPs, the DENV, YFV, ZIKV and Spondweni (SPONV) are flaviviruses belonging to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> while CHIKV, Mayaro (MAYV) and o’nyong’nyong (ONNV) are alphaviruses within the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All are single-strand +ve-sense RNA viruses with the members of each family having close antigenic relationships to one another. Unfortunately, these antigenic similarities within the taxa can induce cross-reactive antibody responses causing uncertainty with serological diagnostic tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Additionally, the concept of original antigenic sin arises when sequential infections by different arboviruses leads to a greater antibody response to the virus responsible for the first infection. This is a particular problem with the multiple serotypes of DENV. Additionally, DENV and ZIKV (
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) possess similar antigenic surface epitopes (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> E protein) therefore eliciting indistinguishable antibody responses and false positives by some serological techniques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Alphaviruses have similar problems where, for example, methods targeting CHIKV antibodies to the E2EP3 protein (anti-E2EP3) cross-react with non-CHIKV alphaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] like MAYV or ONNV. Fortuitously, anti-E2EP3 can be used to differentiate between CHIKV infections and 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infections with 93% accuracy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It should be noted that some larger serological studies report results in terms of viral genera, i.e. 
 <italic>Alphavirus-</italic> or 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>-positive, thus not distinguishing the species.
