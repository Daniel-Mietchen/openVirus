<p id="Par31">Diallo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] stated that human landing catches are “the only effective method for sampling sylvatic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>”; however, humans must be vaccinated against YFV and using malaria prophylaxis. Further, some would consider this technique unethical. There are a variety of mosquito traps that use attractants such as light, carbon dioxide, lures (specially designed scents) or animal bait, but often their use is hindered by limited resources in remote locations. Additionally, traps may require a power source to operate a fan and must be set and checked daily to prevent captured mosquitoes from desiccation which renders them unidentifiable. Animal-baited mosquito net traps are cheap and easy to use but mosquitoes readily escape and the enclosure can alter mosquito behaviour [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Handheld sweep nets and aspirators are labour intensive and not species-specific but aspiration is more successful at capturing blood-fed individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Hosts on which mosquitoes feed can be discovered by direct observation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or by genotyping the blood meal found in engorged mosquitoes, so called blood meal analysis [
