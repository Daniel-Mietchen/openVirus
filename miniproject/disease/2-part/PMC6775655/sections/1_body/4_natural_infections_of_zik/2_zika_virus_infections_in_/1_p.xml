 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] when, as part of a YFV surveillance project, the ZIKV was isolated from a sentinel rhesus macaque (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) and the local sylvatic YFV vector, 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>. This provided evidence of a sylvatic circulation of the virus in NHPs and mosquitoes that feed on them. More extensive investigations in the region in the late 1960’s found high seropositivity in several NHP species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and led to the isolation of ZIKV from 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> (14/27 pools; 51.8%) and 
 <italic>Aedes apicoargenteus</italic> (1/1 pool; 100%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Due to the extensive arboviral investigations and periodic YFV and CHIKV activity in the NHPs and mosquitoes, researchers began to suggest the possibility of cross-protection (immunisation) between YFV and ZIKV (and possibly CHIKV) in NHPs. It was also suggested that successive arboviral infection (flaviviruses and alphaviruses) of mosquitoes may interfere with their ability to transmit virus [

 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> from the Saboya forest and in 1980 the ZIKV was also isolated from NHPs (Table
