<p id="Par79">In the Americas, ‘spillback’ infection from people to peri-urban capuchins (
 <italic>Sapajus libidinosus</italic>) and marmosets (
 <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) in two cities in Brazil was suspected to be the reason for several ZIKV RT-PCR-positive NHPs found in 2016 and 2017 during the large human epidemic (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. This finding rekindled speculation that a sylvatic cycle of ZIKV could become established. More extensive studies around Brazil, however, failed to identify ZIKV RNA by PCR and found only low seroprevalences and antibody titres to ZIKV, which were thought to indicate an absence of established sylvatic cycles (Table
