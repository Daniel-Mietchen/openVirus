<p id="Par70">Further serological investigations of 1880 potential vertebrate hosts on the Malaysian peninsula between 1963 and 1967 included 642 NHPs, and only 16 (2.5%) had antibodies to CHIKV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The first isolation of CHIKV from NHPs in Asia was in Malaysia, from wild long-tailed macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) sampled from 2007 to 2008; PCR and sequencing revealed the virus was distinct from the strain circulating in people at the time (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. In a subsequent serosurvey the following year, shortly after a nationwide outbreak in people, the prevalence of neutralising antibodies in wild long-tailed macaques (
 <italic>M. fascicularis</italic>) was very low (1/146; 0.7%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. However, nearby in northern Thailand at about the same time, a higher percentage (4/38; 10.5%) of captive northern pig-tailed macaques (
 <italic>Macaca nemestrina leonine</italic>) were found to be seropositive before and after CHIKV activity in people in the region suggesting macaques could become infected by CHIKV independently of people (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Finally, on the Island of Borneo (Malaysia) wild and semi-captive orangutans (
 <italic>Pongo pygmaeus</italic>) were seronegative to CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] indicating that sylvatic CHIKV may not infect this species or the virus might not have spread to islands in the region.
