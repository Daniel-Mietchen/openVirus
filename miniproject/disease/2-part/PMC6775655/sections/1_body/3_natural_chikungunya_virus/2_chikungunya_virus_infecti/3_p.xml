<p id="Par65">In Senegal, between 1972 and 1983, CHIKV was isolated from multiple species of NHP (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Over the same period, CHIKV was detected in forest-dwelling mosquitoes using multiple tests. Between 1972 and 1986, Diallo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] isolated 178 strains of CHIKV, in cell cultures or mice, from 599,582 forest canopy mosquitoes, mainly 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic>-
 <italic>taylori</italic> (129/8244 pools; 1.6%), 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> (27/3347 pools; 0.8%) and 
 <italic>Ae. dalzieli</italic> (12/2069 pools; 0.6%). A more detailed survey between 2009 and 2010 in the area (now considered a known focus of sylvatic arbovirus circulation due to previous CHIKV isolation in mosquitoes and NHPs) identified CHIKV by multiple tests in 15/50 species of mosquitoes captured [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] with 42 out of 4211 (10%) pools of mosquitoes sampled (39,799 mosquitoes) were positive for CHIKV. Of these positive pools, 16 were 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> (0.4%), five were 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> (0.1%), and five were 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> (0.1%). It was concluded that 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer-taylori</italic> (now recognised as two species: 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic>) were involved in the maintenance of the sylvatic cycle of CHIKV with 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> most likely to contribute to any ‘spillover’ of infection to people. Shortly thereafter, when blood meals of the above species were analysed by PCR, only 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> was found to have fed on NHPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] indicating that blood meal host preferences vary between mosquito species and that species other than NHPs may be involved.
