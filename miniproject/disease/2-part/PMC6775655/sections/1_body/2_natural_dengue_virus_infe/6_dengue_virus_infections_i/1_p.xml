<p id="Par58">In the Americas, Rosen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] found none of 105 NHPs sampled during an epidemic of dengue in people in Panama in 1941–1942 were seropositive against DENV, indicating a sylvatic dengue cycle was unlikely to be present at the time. Subsequently, between 2010 and 2012, wild-caught patas monkeys (
 <italic>E. patas</italic>) and rhesus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) from Puerto Rico had serological evidence of prior DENV infection (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. As there was no evidence for sylvatic cycling of DENVs in NHPs in the Americas, the authors suggested their results might represent ‘spillback’ infection, with the NHPs acquiring infections as part of urban cycles involving people on the islands. As viruses were not isolated, it was not possible to use phylogenetic characterisation to confirm the (urban) origin of the viruses.
