<p id="Par50">Rudnick’s studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] also included a comprehensive invertebrate survey, primarily targeting mosquitoes to determine their role in sylvatic cycles. Well over 500,000 mosquitoes (in excess of 69 species of 8 genera), representing the majority of species in Malaysia at that time, were collected from tree platforms in the canopy and at ground level using human landing collections, a variety of animal and CO
 <sub>2</sub>-baited traps, net traps and aspirators. DENV-2 and 4 were isolated from ground level 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and DENV-4 from a group of six species of canopy-dwelling mosquitoes reported as 
 <italic>Aedes niveus.</italic> The latter preferentially fed on NHPs when NHP-baited mosquito traps were placed in the forest canopy indicating the species’ probable role in the sylvatic cycle. Ultimately, the study showed there was a sylvatic cycle in the forest canopy in the Malaysian peninsula with all four DENV serotypes circulating between NHPs and mosquitoes (most likely those in the 
 <italic>Ae. niveus</italic> group).
