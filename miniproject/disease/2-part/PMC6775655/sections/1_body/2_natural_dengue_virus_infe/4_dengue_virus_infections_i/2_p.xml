<p id="Par54">In 1982, DENV-2 was isolated from a patas monkey (
 <italic>Erythrocebus patas</italic>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in eastern Senegal. Further serological investigations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] indicated there had been an amplification of DENV infections in local NHPs without a concurrent outbreak in the human population. Also, 28 viral isolations were made from forest-dwelling 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes taylori</italic>-
 <italic>furcifer</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes opok</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> in the Ivory Coast [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] although there was no evidence of disease in the human population. Similar findings in forest-dwelling 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. in Burkina Faso and Guinea at around the same time added further evidence that these mosquitoes may be involved in a sylvatic cycle of DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Ultimately, Rodhain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] concluded that the studies he reviewed indicated a sylvatic cycle existed in West Africa comprising the patas monkey (
 <italic>E. patas</italic>) and most likely 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic>. The levels of infection varied with amplifications being seasonal, especially in times of high rainfall. However, ‘spillover’ into local human populations appeared uncommon with only one report of DENV-2 being isolated from local people and the sylvatic mosquitoes 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> in 1990 during a dengue epidemic [
