<p>Using RNA as templates, RT-PCR was performed to amplify the envelope (E) gene. DENV-1 primers were designed for sequencing based on the DENV-1 standard Hawaii strain (GenBank accession number: KM204119) and DENV-2 strain (GenBank accession number: KM279569) [

 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. E gene sequences of 34 strains were obtained from the patient samples. The primers used in this article are listed in Tables
