<p>DENV, as a member of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. The DENV genome is approximately 11,000 nucleotides in length and encodes three structural proteins, namely, the capsid (C), premembrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins, and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) in a single open reading frame (ORF). Specifically, the 5' end of the DENV genome encodes the C/prM/E proteins, while the 3' end encodes the seven NS protein[

There are five DENV serotypes, which are referred to as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, and the distinctions between these serotypes are based on their antigenicity. Additionally, different serotypes can be further differentiated into different genotypes[
