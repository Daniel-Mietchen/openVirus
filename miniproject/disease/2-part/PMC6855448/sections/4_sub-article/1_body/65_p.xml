<p>Answer: Molecular clock detection is based on sequences in the data set. As we mentioned in the manuscript, the dataset we used to build the MCC tree will be detected by the molecular clock before the tree is reconstructed. The sequences contained in these data sets were obtained after BLAST, and they were sampled at different years, but most of them were sequences in recent years, so the results of molecular clock detection showed that they were biased toward the recent sequences. So we also used a uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock when building the MCC tree.</p>
