<p>Answer: It is undeniable that the sequence does have a great impact on the experimental results. The data set used in this study consisted of downloading all dengue virus data from genbank and screening out the invalid sequences. The data set contained a large number of sequences to study. For traceability we also used blast to find kinship sequences, and the results presented a continuous cross-year epidemic. The coverage of the sequence has a great impact on the study, such as silent transmission or sporadic cases plus insufficient reporting, which may lead to false inter-annual transmission. We have already described this in the discussion of the manuscript. The changed part is in the 385-388 lines of the manuscript.</p>
