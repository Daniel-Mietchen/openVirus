Many Asian I viruses were deposited to NCBI from China. Before reached to the conclusion that the origin of the virus isolated in this study derived from Southeast Asian countries, the author should pay more attention to the pre-existing Chinese viruses in phylogenetic analysis. Can you deny the possibility from Yunnan or other part of China?
