<p id="p0120">HDV is a defective virus incapable of autonomous propagation 
 <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. Its genome, a self complementary circular RNA of âˆ¼1700 nucleotides, encodes a single protein (the HDV-encoded delta antigen) (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). HDV requires HBV surface proteins, that are complexed with the delta antigen, to form transmissible virions 
 <xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>. Thus, HDV is usually considered a satellite of HBV, although recent data have shown that other enveloped viruses can promote HDV propagation, at least
