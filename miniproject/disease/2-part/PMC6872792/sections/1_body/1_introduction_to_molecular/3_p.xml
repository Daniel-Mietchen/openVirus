<p id="p0020">The TDRP reflects mutation rate in very short timescales and substitution rate in very long timescales, during which transient deleterious mutations are removed by the action of natural selection, leading to lower rate estimates 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Another factor most likely contributing to the TDRP is the saturation of nucleotide substitutions, which is extremely rapid in viral genomes, especially when the polymerase is error-prone 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, recent analyses indicated that, for all Baltimore classification groups, viral evolutionary rates tend to decrease continuously with the timescale of measurement 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Because the rate of decay is consistent with a power law relationship between substitution rate and sampling timescale, a model using a simple regression was at first proposed to estimate the TDRP effect on viral phylogenies 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Very recently, this approach was implemented in a Bayesian statistical framework, in which evolutionary rates can vary among different time epochs 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Before the introduction of such an approach, effective attempts to correct for the TDRP were performed by the use of nucleotide substitution models that allow site- and branch-specific variation in selective pressure (selection-informed models). These models, which were applied to analyze the ancient evolution of some viral lineages, at least partially correct for the effects of both purifying selection and substitution saturation in branch length estimation
