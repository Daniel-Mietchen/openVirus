<p id="p0080">A third hypothesis for the origin of HBV posits that hepadnaviruses co-speciated with their primate hosts in the New World and in the Old World. Thus, multiple zoonotic transmissions would have originated HBV genotypes found in humans 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. This scenario is supported by the diffusion of hepadnaviruses in diverse primate species and by the inferred divergence time of the 
 <italic>Orthohepadnavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Avihepadnavirus</italic> genera, that is very similar to that of their host classes 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. However, the recent identification of a novel hepadnavirus in capuchin monkeys confirmed that New World monkeys are infected by viruses that are very distantly related to HBV (

 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Instead, evolutionary analyses with human and NHP viral strains placed the origin of HBV ancestors in Hominoid Old World primates, preceding the formation of the human lineage
