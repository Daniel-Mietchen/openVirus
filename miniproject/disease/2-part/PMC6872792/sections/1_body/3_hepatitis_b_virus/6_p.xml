<p id="p0085">In summary, although considerable progress was achieved in recent years, a high level of uncertainty concerning the ultimate origin of HBV still exists. The particular organization of the viral genome (i.e. overlapping reading frames in a short genome) limits the variability of most of nucleotide positions (i.e. to avoid the introduction of nonsynonymous mutations) and results in a relatively slow mutation rate. This characteristic, along with the action of natural selection on particular genotypes 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, as well as the adaptation to different human populations 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, contributes to HBV variability and complicates inferences about its origin. Finally, different studies 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> have shown that, as for other viruses (see 
 <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Section 2</xref>), HBV substitution rates are affected by viral sampling time frames. Indeed, the evolutionary rates generated using information from ancient HBV genomes were shown to fit well with the TDRP regression line calculated for Baltimore Group VI and VII viruses (i.e., reverse-transcribing viruses) 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Crucially, these results indicate that, whereas tip calibration approaches have demonstrated to be useful in the reconstruction of recent epidemiological events 
 <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, limiting analysis to extant strains for the reconstruction of ancient HBV evolution can be misleading 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and that approaches that correct for the TDRP should be envisaged.
