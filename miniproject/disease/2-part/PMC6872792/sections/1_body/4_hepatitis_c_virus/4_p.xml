<p id="p0100">Presently, the HCV worldwide seroprevalence is estimated to be ∼1% 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, with about 71 million persons living with chronic infection 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The HCV epidemic apparently started recently, in the 1930s–1940s, as a consequence of practices that determined parenteral or percutaneous exposure (e.g., blood transfusion, vaccination campaigns, and intravenous drug injection)

 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. For instance, one of the most affected countries is Egypt, where the virus was most likely disseminated through nationwide vaccination programs or contaminated blood-derived products 
 <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. In fact, sexual or vertical transmission of HCV are relatively rare, and the overwhelming majority of infections occur via the parenteral/percutaneous route. Thus, due to historical reasons and to the transmission pattern, a small number of so-called “epidemic” HCV subtypes (1a, 1b, 3a, and 2a) account for most infections worldwide
