<p id="p0060">In conclusion, HAV emergence in humans likely represents a relatively recent evolutionary event, probably of zoonotic origin. Nonetheless, the ancestor of human hepatoviruses has yet to be identified. The characterization of other hepatoviruses in primates, and mammals in general, will be instrumental to the identification of the HAV ancestors and will clarify the evolutionary history of hepatoviruses.</p>
