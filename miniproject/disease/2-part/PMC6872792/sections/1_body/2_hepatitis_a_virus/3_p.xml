<p id="p0030">Based on genomic structure, HAV belongs to the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> within the genus 
 <italic>Hepatovirus.</italic> Nevertheless, many characteristics distinguish HAV (and hepatoviruses in general) from other 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family members. Some peculiar features include the primary tropism for hepatocytes, the ability to shed as nonenveloped virus in feces and as enveloped particles in blood, as well as some genomic features such as low G/C ratio, low CpG levels, and strong codon bias
