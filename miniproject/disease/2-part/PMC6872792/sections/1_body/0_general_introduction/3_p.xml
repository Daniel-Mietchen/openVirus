<p id="p0010">Human hepatitis viruses are extremely diverse and consequently belong to different viral families (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In recent years, the availability of high-throughput technologies has revealed that relatives of human hepatitis viruses can be found in a wide variety of animals. This finding, as well as the increasing availability of the genome sequences of human-infecting viruses sampled across different geographic areas, has largely expanded our knowledge about the genetic diversity and evolutionary origin of these human pathogens. In this Review, we thus focus on the latest insights into the possible events and ecological contexts that determined the origin and spread of human hepatitis viruses. A short presentation of the most widely used approaches to estimate the ages of viral lineages is also provided to contextualize recent research efforts on these viruses.
