<p id="p0150">Although several human hepatitis E cases have a zoonotic origin and orthohepeviruses A are found in diverse mammals, recent data indicated that one or more reverse zoonoses led to the emergence and radiation of HEV genotypes 
 <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. In fact, character state reconstruction on a large phylogeny revealed that humans were the most likely hosts of the ancestor of extant orthohepeviruses A 
 <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. This notion is in line with the observation that most, if not all, HEV genotypes can infect our species, whereas other animals are differentially susceptible to distinct HEV genotypes. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that reverse zoonotic events (also known as zooanthroponoses) are all but rare, and examples include other RNA viruses such as rotaviruses, enteroviruses, and human influenza viruses
