<p>The distribution of dengue incidence across various levels of each LC type and altitude was investigated by converting these geographical variables into categorical variables and subsequently stratifying monthly mean dengue incidence using the new indicator variables created. All the variables except wetlands and urban settlements were classified into three levels, with their lower and upper cut points being 30
 <sup>th</sup> and 70
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles, respectively (for a balanced distribution of data across the levels derived). Area under crop cultivation was classified into levels 0 − &lt;24%, ≥24- &lt;80% and ≥80%; area under savannah grassland 0 − &lt;1%, ≥1- &lt;20% and ≥20%; area under forests 0 − &lt;2%, ≥2- &lt;50% and ≥50%; and altitude 0 − &lt;11m, ≥11- &lt;285m and ≥285m. Area under wetlands and that for urban/built-up areas were categorized into two levels 0 and &gt;0% because their values were mostly skewed to the right with a high density of zero values. All the descriptive plots were developed using the ggplot2 package in R [
