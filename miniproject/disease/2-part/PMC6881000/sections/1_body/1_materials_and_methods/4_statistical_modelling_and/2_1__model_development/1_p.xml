<p>Univariable and multivariable analyses were implemented successively to generate a dengue incidence forecasting model. These analyses led to the identification of significant predictors, latent variables, and dummy variables for accounting for seasonal effects. Predictor variables included in these analyses were meteorological variables from the principal component analysis, all the environmental variables including altitude, and the spatial and temporal effects. For both univariable and multivariable models, a variable was considered as being significant if its 95
 <sup>th</sup> credible interval (representing 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles) excluded zero. These limits were chosen to obtain a range that had the highest density of the estimated parameter values around the median. Lagged variables of each of the meteorological variables analyzed were also tested in turns. Up to three lags were considered for each variable and a form that returned the least deviance information criterion (DIC) estimate was considered as being suitable.
