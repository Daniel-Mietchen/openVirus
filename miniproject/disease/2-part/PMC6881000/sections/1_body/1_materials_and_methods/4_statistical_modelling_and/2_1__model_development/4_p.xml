<p>Similarly, autoregressive (AR [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) model was used to account for temporal autocorrelation. Each province had 108 time units (between January 2001 to December 2009) that were used in the AR [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] model. The AR model assumed that dengue incidence in the current month was correlated with the that of the previous month.
