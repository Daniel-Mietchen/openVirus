<p>Environmental variables determine relative distributions of pathogens, vectors and hosts in space, and changes in their structure would destabilize established relationships (within and between communities) leading to emergence of infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this study, altitude and LC represented environmental variables used to determine the distribution of ecological niches for dengue. A number of studies have investigated the effects of altitude [

 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] on dengue incidence in various countries but not much has been done on the other LC types. Our analyses established a negative association between altitude and dengue risk. A survey conducted in Nepal along an altitudinal gradient showed that

 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], among others. Apart from influencing climate patterns, altitude modifies other factors that may influence mosquito survival such as vegetation cover, and availability/density of hosts.
