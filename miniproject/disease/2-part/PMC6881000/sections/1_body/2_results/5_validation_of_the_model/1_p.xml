<p>A comparison of the observed and predicted dengue incidences (2010–2012) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224353.g007">Fig 7</xref>) showed that the predicted incidence closely tracked the seasonal trends and identified peaks and troughs of the dengue occurrence patterns. However, during the September 2010 outbreaks, the predicted incidence was lower than the observed even though it was relatively higher than those of the other periods. The estimated Theil’s coefficient of inequality was 0.22.
