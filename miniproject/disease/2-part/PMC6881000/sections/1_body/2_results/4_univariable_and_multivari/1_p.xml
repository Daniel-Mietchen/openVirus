<p>Univariable analyses identified all the variables used including rainfall, minimum temperature, duration of sunshine, evaporation as being significant predictors for dengue incidence (
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Lagging temperature by two months and rainfall by one month provided better fitting models compared to using unlagged variables. However, to simplify the analysis, both minimum temperature and rainfall data were lagged for two months and used in multivariable analyses. On cartographic variables, only wetlands were not significant at this level of analysis.
