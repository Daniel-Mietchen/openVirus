<p id="Par73">Apart from HBV, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA also harbors m6A modification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Knockdown of METTL3 and METTL14 expression enhanced the titer of HCV, whereas FTO inhibition decreased the viral titer. They also found that YTHDF protein played a negative role in HCV replication. In addition, these proteins compete with the core protein of HCV by preferentially binding to the
