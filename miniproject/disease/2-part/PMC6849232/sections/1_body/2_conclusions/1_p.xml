<p id="Par83">The viruses described in this review are harmful to human health. Some viruses RNA undergo m6A modification such as Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], and adenoviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and are less pathogenic in human. Several advances have been made in understanding human pathogenic viruses in recent years, however, only few drugs for these diseases have been put on the market in the past decades. For this reason, it is necessary to focus on the development of new treatments that may replace or improve the standard therapies.
