<p>For the mosquito surveillance systems, higher numbers of traps increased the probability of detection; however, more traps also led to more tests and increased resource needs (

In contrast, for human surveillance of patients with ZIKV symptoms, the expected testing resources required were much lower and only increased slightly with higher incidence. For example, with 360 traps, an estimated 335 (95% UI: 275, 396) tests were required per week for vector surveillance. In contrast, approximately 10 (95% UI: 6, 14) tests per week were required for human surveillance with no ZIKV transmission and 12 (95% UI: 8, 17) tests per week with a high transmission scenario of 1,000 infections per week. Both systems had similar positive predictive values, with human surveillance being somewhat higher in low incidence settings (
