<p>We first analyzed the expected number of positive mosquito pools, human cases, and the probability of detecting infected vectors or humans for the four simulated surveillance strategies as described above. In a population of 100,000 and one infection per week, the expected number of positive mosquito pools or positive humans was essentially zero for all four systems (

Therefore, the probability of detecting a positive mosquito pool or infected human was very low, but highest (6.9%; 95% UI: 1.6%, 15.7%) for the mosquito trapping system with 720 traps and lowest for human surveillance (1.5%; 95% UI: 0.3%, 4.7%) (

When the incidence of infection increased to 10 infections per week, the probability of detection was 51% (95% UI: 15%, 82%) for the 720-trap system, 30% (95% UI: 8%, 57%) for the 360-trap system, 16% (95% UI: 4%, 35%) for the 180-trap system, and 14% (95% UI: 3%, 38%) for human surveillance. At the highest incidence rate of approximately 1,000 infections per week, all systems had a mean estimated probability of detection of greater than 78%.
