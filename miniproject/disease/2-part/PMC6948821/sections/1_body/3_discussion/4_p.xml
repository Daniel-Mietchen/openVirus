<p>Overall, the simulations suggested that virological surveillance of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> as performed in Caguas could potentially provide improved sensitivity to detect virus transmission, but the data from Caguas tell a different story. The observed data confirm that both systems were able to detect transmission in high and low incidence weeks, but they also indicated higher sensitivity for human surveillance. It is also important to consider these approaches in context. The Caguas study was conducted in high and low incidence periods after the peak of the outbreak in July 2016, when clinicians and the local population were already sensitized to ZIKV, which may have increased the number of observed cases. Passive surveillance for arboviral diseases in clinical patients is routine in Puerto Rico [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and many other locations, so testing of humans may represent little or no additional resource burden. In contrast, mosquito surveillance is less widely implemented and thus may require even more resources, especially for laboratory testing. The resource investment of mosquito-based surveillance is directly related to the sensitivity, which is not necessarily true for human surveillance. In the absence of human surveillance systems or to identify local transmission risk by detecting infected mosquitoes, virological surveillance of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> may be an effective approach.
