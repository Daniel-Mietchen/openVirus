<p>An important limitation to this study is that we did not collect data on attendant costs required for virological surveillance in mosquitoes and humans (e.g., traps, field work, laboratory supplies). These resource considerations are not trivial in terms of man hours and laboratory test costs. A second limitation was the considerable uncertainty around key model parameters. We accounted for uncertainty by sampling from parameter distributions, but those distributions were based on data from other locations and therefore do not necessarily reflect the reality of surveillance in Caguas. As described above, this was particularly evident when comparing the simulations to the observed data. We also used a very generic representation of trapping effort, including only the number of traps per person and collections based on the data from Caguas. We therefore ignored all components of spatiotemporal variability in vector populations, trapping effort, and incidence, despite their importance [
