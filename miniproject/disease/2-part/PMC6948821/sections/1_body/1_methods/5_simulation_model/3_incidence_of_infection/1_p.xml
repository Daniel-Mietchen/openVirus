<p>We simulated scenarios with human incidence ranging from one infection per 100,000 per week to one infection per 1,000 per week. In these simulations, we used the incidence in humans to calculate the number of infected mosquitoes using an average number of mosquitoes infected by an infectious person (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0
  <italic>HM</italic>
 </sub>). 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0
  <italic>HM</italic>
 </sub> was calculated as the product of the density of mosquitoes (
 <italic>r</italic>), mosquito biting rate (
 <italic>b</italic>), probability of human-to-mosquito transmission given an infectious bite (
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>HM</italic>
 </sub>), and duration of infectiousness in humans (
 <italic>d</italic>):

 <sub>
  <italic>HM</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>d</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We estimated ranges and uncertainty distributions for each of these variables based on previous research. We assumed 
 <italic>b</italic> = 0.63â€“0.76 bites per mosquito per day, which we approximated with a uniform distribution [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>HM</italic>
 </sub> = 0.5 (SD = 0.1), which we approximated with a normal distribution [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The duration of infectiousness in humans (
 <italic>d</italic>) was assumed to be similar to dengue, with a mean of 7 days (SD = 0.3) and approximated with a gamma distribution [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The expected number of ZIKV-infected female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> per week was estimated as the number of infectious humans multiplied by 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0
  <italic>HM</italic>
 </sub>. The probability of a single female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> being infected when trapped was calculated as the expected number of ZIKV-infected female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> divided by the mosquito population size (
