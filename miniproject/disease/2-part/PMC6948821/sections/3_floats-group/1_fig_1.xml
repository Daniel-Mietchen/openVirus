  <title>The total number of Zika virus infections detected and probability of detecting local transmission of Zika virus by testing 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females collected from CDC sentinel autocidal gravid ovitraps (SAGO) and emergency department patients with two or more Zika virus symptoms.
  </title>
  <p>Panel A shows the expected number of ZIKV-positive 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> pools detected per week by testing pools of 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> females trapped in the actual number of traps deployed in Caguas, Puerto Rico (360 SAGO traps: navy), half the number of traps as Caguas (180 SAGO traps: yellow), and twice the number of traps as Caguas (720 SAGO traps: black). Panel B shows the expected number of infected humans detected per week by testing patients in emergency departments showing two or more ZIKV symptoms (red). Panel C shows the weekly probability of detecting ZIKV by testing mosquito pools. Panel D shows the weekly probability of detecting ZIKV by testing symptomatic emergency department patients. The bands represent 50% uncertainty intervals.
