<p id="Par29">Since 2001, the Bureau of Epidemiology at the Thai Ministry of Public Health has mandated hospital-based HFMD surveillance. During 2001–2018, the ministry reported a total of 502,329 HFMD cases (ranging between 769 and 79,910 cases annually) with the highest prevalence in 2016 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] and ranged between 1.2 and 28.4 cases per 100,000 population. While the number of deaths from HFMD outbreaks declined from 7 in 2006 to 2 in 2012, the number of outbreak-related cases increased from 3961 in 2006 to 45,464 in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. This increase was mainly due to the first large-scale HFMD outbreak in 2012, which affected primarily infants and children (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Most cases were associated with CV-A6, but EV-A71 infection constituted the third most prevalent type [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>], although EV-A71 predominated in many provinces of Thailand in addition to CV-A6 and CV-A16 (Figs.
