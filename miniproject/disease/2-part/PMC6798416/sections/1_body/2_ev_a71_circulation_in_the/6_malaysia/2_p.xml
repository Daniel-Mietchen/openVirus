 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Epidemiological data suggest several common features of HFMD in Malaysia. First, the dominant EV-A71 genogroup B co-circulated with genogroup C. The monthly cases of each epidemic cycle peaked early in the year from February to April. Additionally, there was a drastic drop in EV-A71 cases in the second and third year after the epidemic cycle (2001–2002 and 2004–2005) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. According to the National Public Health Laboratory, EV-A71 was the most prevalent among the endemic cases between 2008 and 2009 [
