<p id="Par35">In the first major HFMD outbreak in the Asia-Pacific region reported in Malaysia in 1997, molecular characterization showed that it was related to subgenogroups B3, B4, C1, and C2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Specifically, the predominance of B3 was specifically associated with fatal cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Later on in 2000 and 2003, B4 and B5 were the predominant subgenogroups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Infections caused by subgenogroup C1 cases have generally been sporadic in Malaysia between 1997 and 2005 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Subgenogroup B5 was detected in Brunei (2006) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>] and Indonesia (2016) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Moreover, subgenogroup D, G and C1 circulated in India as endemic viruses between 2001 and 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>].
