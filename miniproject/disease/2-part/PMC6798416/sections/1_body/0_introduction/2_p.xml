<p id="Par13">EV-A71 is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> within the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. EV-A71 belongs to the species A enterovirus, which includes 25 other serotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although other members of the genus can infect multiple animals, EV-A71 only infects humans. The virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome encapsidated in a non-enveloped capsid virion. The viral genome is approximately 7500 bases in length and is flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) and a polyadenylated tail of variable length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The single open reading frame (ORF) encodes a large polyprotein, which is proteolytically cleaved by the viral protease into structural protein P1 (VP1-VP4), and nonstructural proteins P2 (2A-2C) and P3 (3A-3D).
