<p id="Par14">EV-A71 is transmitted predominantly via oral-fecal route, but also through contact with virus-contaminated oral secretions, vesicular fluid, surfaces and fomites. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with patientâ€™s aerosolized respiratory droplets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. EV-A71 can infect a wide range of cell types with different replicative capacity. Virus entry into susceptible host cells involves surface attachment, receptor binding and particle uptake into host cell through an endocytic pathway. The specific host cellular receptor for EV-A71 remains unknown, but until recently, there has been at least five different types of human cellular receptors identified so far. The first characterized receptor is the human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (SCARB2), also known as the lysosomal integral membrane protein II or CD36b like-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. SCARB2 was also identified to be a receptor for coxsackievirus genotypes A (CV)-A7, A14 and A16 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The second characterized receptor is the human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a membrane protein expressed on leukocytes. Several studies have shown, however, that only some strains of EV-A71 utilize this receptor for cell entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The third characterized receptor is the sialic-acid-linked glycan, which is express in abundance in the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelium cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The fourth receptor is human annexin 2 protein, which was identified as cellular host factor that interacts with EV-A71 during viral entry into human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The fifth attachment receptor is heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan, which is widely expressed in all cell types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Heparan sulfate was also observed to facilitate infection of RD cells by CV-A16, thereby serving as its receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However a recent study identified KREMEN1 as an entry receptor for CV-A10 and other coxsackievirus A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].
