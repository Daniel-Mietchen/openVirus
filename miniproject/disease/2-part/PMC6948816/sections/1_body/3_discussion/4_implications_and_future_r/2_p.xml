<p>ZIKV vaccine development faces considerable hurdles. First, the evaluation of vaccine efficacy has stalled because the reduced circulation of ZIKV has reduced the visibility of ZIKV-associated disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Second, it remains unclear if neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination are sufficient to protect women against vertical transmission and congenital abnormalities [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Third, it is not clear whether or how vaccine-induced antibodies against ZIKV will cross-react with other flaviviruses. To move vaccine development forward, we need to find regions where disease will occur to be able to conduct trials. This requires identifying populations that are at risk, and implementing surveillance there. These can either be regions where ZIKV is endemic, or where ZIKV outbreaks are likely to occur; throughout the Americas, there might be regions that did not experience an outbreak, but do have suitable conditions such as competent vectors. Conducting vaccine trials in disease outbreaks is complex, but there are tools to facilitate planning [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. ZIKV in an endemic setting, such as in Africa and Asia, could prove a suitable setting as well. However, ZIKV circulation in endemic setting is not well described and the occurrence of adverse outcomes in this context is less documented [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further research in understanding the transmission of the virus in an endemic context is therefore needed. Similarly, we need to increase the understanding of changes over time in vector abundance and population composition, since these influence the risk of new outbreaks.
