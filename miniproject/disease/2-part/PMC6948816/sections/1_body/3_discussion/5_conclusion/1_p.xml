<p>Preparedness is vital; the time until the next outbreak gives us the opportunity to be prepared. The next sizeable ZIKV outbreak in Nicaragua will likely not occur before 2035 but the probability of outbreaks will increase. Young women of reproductive age will be at highest risk of infection during the next ZIKV outbreak. Vaccination targeted to young women could curb the risk of a large outbreak and extend herd immunity. ZIKV vaccine development and licensure are urgent to attain the maximum benefit in reducing the population-level risk of infection and the risk of adverse congenital outcomes. The urgency of ZIKV vaccine development increases if immunity is not lifelong.</p>
