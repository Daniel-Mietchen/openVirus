<p> We thank the editor for their suggestion of an additional publication that seems to be missing from our reference list. However, it is important to point out that our inclusion criteria specified studies that analyzed some primary data. It seems the suggested reference solely analyzes secondary data. According to comments of the two reviewers, we decided to adopt a more focused approach to frame our scoping review. We modified a sentence at lines 8-10 of page 6 to reflect this.</p>
