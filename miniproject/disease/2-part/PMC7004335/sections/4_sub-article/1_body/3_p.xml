<p>I invited and received two reviews of your manuscript; both reviews raised some substantial concerns for your manuscript as it currently stands. I completely agree to the point raised by reviewers that your study missed many literature including ones that we published later (#check Samy et al. 2016). Please respond properly for all comments raised by our reviewers below. I would kindly ask you to check the Journal style requirements before submitting a revised version of your manuscript.</p>
