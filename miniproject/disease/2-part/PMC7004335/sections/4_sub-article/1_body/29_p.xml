<p> We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have reframed the review to focus more closely on vector species composition and arbovirus transmission dynamics with implications for public health, and as such we feel that the Pubmed search engine is suitable to identify relevant primary literature for our scoping review. Our search terms and inclusion criteria were intentionally broad to capture a wide range of studies. However, we have mentioned this as a limitation in the discussion, at lines 5-9 of page 17.</p>
