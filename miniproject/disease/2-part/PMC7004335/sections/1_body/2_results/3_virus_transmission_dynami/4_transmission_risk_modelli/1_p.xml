 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Lourenço et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] used vectorial capacity as a means of prediction, Marini et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and Majumder et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] used vector abundance and human case data, and Villela et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and Ospina et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] used disease notification and natural history. Rojas et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] found attack rates in Girardot and San Andres, Colombia to be highest among females, aged 20–49. Fitzgibbon et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] report that early host and vector heterogeneity significantly affect final epidemic size.
