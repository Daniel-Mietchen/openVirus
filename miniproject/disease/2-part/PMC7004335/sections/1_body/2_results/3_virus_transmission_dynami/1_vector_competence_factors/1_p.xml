 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] found that larger fluctuations in diurnal temperature range led to higher rates of chikungunya infection, and Xiao et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] found that maximum dengue infection rates occurred at 31°C. Mordecai et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] modelled 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and

 <italic>albopictus</italic> transmission in the Americas and found that mean temperature data accurately reflected Zika, chikungunya and dengue human case data. Transmission was found to occur between 18 and 34°C and maximal transmission was observed between 26–29°C, with less certainty surrounding the critical thermal minimum than the critical thermal maximum [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> was found to perform better in cooler temperatures [
