<p>Five articles studied correlations between entomological measures and risk of human dengue infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. One study conducted in Peru found that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> density was not associated with an increased risk of seroconversion [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. One study in Acre, Brazil found that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> density and risk of dengue increased with tourism and case importation [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. A study in Mexico City found a positive correlation between dengue incidence and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> indoor abundance, as well as monthly average temperature and rainfall [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Another study conducted in Peru found that an individual’s likelihood of being bitten in the home was directly proportional to time spent in the home, and body surface area. They did not find age or gender to be significant predictors [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] reported the circulation of four dengue serotypes in Brazil introduced between 2001 and 2012 (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) and reported an increase in dengue infection in Brazil during that time period, i.e. 587 cases/100 000 in 2001 to 1561 cases/100 000 in 2012. Monaghan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] predicted the seasonal abundance of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in the United States using meterorologically driven models as a means of estimating arboviral infection risk [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. All 50 included cities were found to be suitable during the summer months (July to September), while only cities in Florida and Texas were found to have 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> abundance potential during the winter months (December to March). Lo and Park [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] found that regions of Brazil with elevated temperature and precipitation were more conducive to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> presence and Zika virus cases. Da Cruz Ferreira et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] found that dengue occurrence increased by 25% when the average number of mosquitoes caught by traps increased by 0.1 per week. Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] assessed the effect of climatic and entomological variables on intra-annual variability in dengue incidence in Southern Ecuador. Da Rocha Taranto et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] examined the relationship between vector collection, species composition, hatching rates, and population density on dengue incidence. Hatching rate was found to be affected by population density and climate, and presence of vectors was associated with dengue incidence [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Ernst et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] found no correlation between 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> density and human age structure between two cities with different dengue transmission dynamics.
