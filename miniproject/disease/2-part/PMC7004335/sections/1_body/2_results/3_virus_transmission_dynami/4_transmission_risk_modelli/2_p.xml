<p>Eleven studies modelled dengue transmission dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] constructed a predictive model that accurately foresaw 75% of dengue outbreaks in Colombia. Reiner et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] reported that social proximity drives fine-scale heterogeneity in dengue transmission rates based on data from Peru. Three studies reported that meteorological variables including temperature and humidity are important determinants of transmission dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and one study found that transovarial transmission plays an important role in transmission dynamics depending on basic reproductive number [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Liu-Helmersson et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] predicted an increase in diurnal temperature range and increased dengue epidemic potential under climate changes in cold, temperate and extremely hot climates where mean temperatures are far from 29°C. Velasques-Castro et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] studied 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> dynamics in relation to host spatial heterogeneity and generated a dengue infection risk map, based on host dynamics. Taber et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] modelled the colonization of Pennsylvania by
