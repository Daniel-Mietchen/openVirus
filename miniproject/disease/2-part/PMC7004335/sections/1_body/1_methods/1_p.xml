<p>This study’s search strategy and data extraction protocol were developed 
 <italic>a priori</italic>. The list of definitions for each search term and the data characterization and utility form are available upon request. The review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220753.s002">S2 Table</xref> for this scoping review’s checklist. The preliminary search for this review was conducted on PubMed (National Library of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States). The search included the terms ‘zika’ OR ‘dengue’ OR ‘chikungunya’ AND ‘vector’ OR ‘Aedes aegypti’ OR ‘Aedes albopictus’. The search was conducted on March 1
 <sup>st</sup> of 2018, and included all studies since January 1
 <sup>st</sup> of 2013. We chose the year 2013 as a start date for our search to reflect the timing of chikungunya virus spread to the Americas, followed in 2014 by Zika virus. These years are thus characterized by co-circulation of multiple globally spreading arboviruses in the region. Upon selection of potentially relevant articles, studies were characterized according to main characteristics including study setting, virus of interest, study design, methods of mosquito collection and analysis, vector species discussed, and main findings. Zotero (Center for History and New Media, George Mason University, United States) was initially used for title and abstract screening. All studies were subsequently transferred to Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, United States) for data characterization and extraction. Two independent reviewers completed each step of the review following the broad initial screening, which was conducted by one reviewer.
