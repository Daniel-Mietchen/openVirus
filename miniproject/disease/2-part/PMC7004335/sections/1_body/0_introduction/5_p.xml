<p>This review summarizes the state of the literature surrounding the vectors of Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses and factors affecting virus transmission in the Americas, with a focus on public health implications. Waddell et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] conducted a comprehensive scoping review of the Zika virus literature in 2016. However, the authors identified a limited scope of literature on vector studies, and none specifically looked at vector populations of the Americas, highlighting the need for a scoping review focusing on this area given its relevance in understanding arboviral disease risk in the region. This scoping review aims to identify and characterize the literature pertaining to mosquito species vector competence and aspects of virus transmission dynamics in the Americas since the introduction of chikungunya in 2013. This timeframe includes the introduction of Zika virus and the ongoing co-circulation of three globally spreading arboviruses, namely Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses.
