<p>To determine vector competence, a species must be able to acquire, maintain, and transmit a pathogen, which is assessed through experimental infection studies. However, these studies are heterogeneous in both the mosquito populations and virus strains used, as well as methods measuring potential to transmit [
 <xref rid="pone.0220753.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The detection of viral particles in wild-caught mosquitoes does not signify vector competence on its own, but it lends support to evidence from laboratory studies, when coupled with the observation of human host-feeding behaviour. Field studies are also important to assess the relative importance of competent vector species in disease maintenance and/or transmission. Vector competence for Zika virus has been well established for

Interestingly, information on Zika virus vector species composition was abundant, but sparse on Zika virus transmission dynamics. Few studies examined natural infection rates of Zika virus [
