<p>While the statement in LN 205: “Vinauger et al. [29] experimentally demonstrated the importance of dopamine in relation to host-seeking behaviour” is interesting, this falls more within behavior than blood feeding. Host seeking and feeding are different strategies and dopamine being an attractant may not influence patterns of blood feeding unless you have species differences in the release of dopamine.</p>
