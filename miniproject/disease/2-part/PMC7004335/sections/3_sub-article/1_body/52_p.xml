<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript is a scoping review that provides an overview on the current state of entomological knowledge of the mosquito vectors of Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses in the Americas. The authors performed a thorough review of articles on these viruses and theirs hosts published between January 2013 and March 2018. I believe that this study represents a valuable overview of a wide body of research. However, I believe that the study does not entirely meet its own objectives, and could benefit from a more focused approach and a bit more synthesis. I am also concerned that the short time-frame examined by the authors does not provide a full and accurate picture of the literature on several topics. While the nature of publishing makes it impossible for a review to capture all of the most up-to-date papers, the time frame set by the authors starts too late to capture many valuable studies on important vector species. The authors’ time frame seems suited to a study of public health effects of these arboviruses in the Americas, but there is much more entomological literature from the ‘90s and 2000s that would provide a much more complete picture on this subject. I would strongly encourage the authors to broaden their time frame.</p>
