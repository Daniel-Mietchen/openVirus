<p>Influenza viruses are classified based on 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) surface proteins into a large variety of subtypes, some of which are a public health threat [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among these various subtypes, 16 subtypes of HA (H1–H16) and 9 subtypes of NA (N1–N9) belong to avian influenza viruses (AIV), while H17N10 and H18N11 subtypes are only detected in bats [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The wide circulation of AIVs in various hosts may lead to exchange of gene segments, which in turn leads to antigenic variation and formation of new AIVs. This can cause severe outbreaks and epidemics, resulting in huge economic losses to the poultry industry, and poses a serious threat to human health [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HA plays a central role in the life cycle of influenza A viruses through its involvement in receptor recognition, virus attachment, membrane fusion, and entry [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. HA is a single-pass type I transmembrane glycoprotein present as a homotrimer on the viral surface that extends ~130 Å from the membrane. Each HA monomer contains two subunits, HA1 and HA2, produced by protease cleavage of the inactive precursor, HA0. The globular head of HA1 carries a shallow grove, a receptor-binding site (RBS), which is responsible for receptor recognition and host tropism [
