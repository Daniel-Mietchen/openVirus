<p>In conclusion, LPAI A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) is the first reported isolate in Korea and may contain properties that would enhance virulence in the mammalian host. Owing to potential reassortments between H2N9 and other pre-existing viral subtypes in Korea, surveillance and characterization of all these viral subtypes is essential for management of AIV health risk in the early stages. </p>
