<p>In avian H2 influenza viruses, HA receptor-binding-site residues corresponding to the amino acids at positions 138, 190, 194, 225, 226, and 228 (using the H3 numbering system) are highly conserved [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Among these sites, the 220 loop (residues 221 to 228) is known to be involved in the increased affinity to the human receptor [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In human H2 and H3 viruses, leucine and serine substitutions at positions 226 and 228, respectively, have been shown to accompany their adaptation from avian to human hosts [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The substitutions Q226L and G228S were not found in the HA gene of A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9), which is consistent with H2N9 isolated from Hong Kong, indicating that the newly isolated H2N9 in Korea does not have enhanced human infectivity. In the HA gene of A/Korea/426/1968 isolated from humans, Q226L was not found, whereas position 228 contained a different mutation (228R). Therefore, receptor tropism of the new Korean H2N9 isolate did not change from avian to human.
