<p>The closest relatives of the viral genes sequenced in this study were identified using the BLAST function in GenBank
 <sup>Â®</sup> (NCBI). Phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA6 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 6.0, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA). Bootstrap values were calculated based on 1000 alignment replicates.
