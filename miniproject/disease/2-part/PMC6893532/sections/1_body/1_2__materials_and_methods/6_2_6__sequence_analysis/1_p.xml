<p>Raw sequence reads were quality-trimmed using Trim Galore! (Babraham Bioinformatics, UK) (q = 20). Influenza and non-influenza viruses were classified by DeconSeq (iden = 60) using a database created by downloading influenza virus sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databank. The homology of the segments 4 (HA), 5 (NA), and 8 (NS1), known to have high variability among influenza virus segments, was examined by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for nucleotides (BLASTn) in the influenza virus database. Among the results, the most homologous and the most common sequences were selected as the reference of this study. Sequence reads classified as influenza virus were mapped to the selected reference sequence using the gsMapper program (iden = 70, Coverage = 40). Consensus sequences obtained by mapping were corrected for sequence errors using a proofread program and open reading frames (ORF) were predicted using ORFfinder (NCBI) [
