<p>The fecal samples were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing antibiotic solution (100 U/µL of penicillin and 100 mg/µL of streptomycin) (Merck, St. Louis, MO, USA) and clarified by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C). Supernatants were filtered through a hydrophilic polyethersulfone membrane (0.45 µm pore size; GVS Syringe) (Novatech, Kingwood, TX, USA) to remove eukaryotic cells and bacteria. Processed samples were inoculated into the allantoic cavities of ten-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 days. Allantoic fluids were harvested and viral titers were determined using hemagglutination assays as previously described [
