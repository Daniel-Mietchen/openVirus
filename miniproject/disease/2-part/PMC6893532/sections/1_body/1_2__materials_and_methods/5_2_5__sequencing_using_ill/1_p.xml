<p>NGS was conducted by GnCBio (Daejeon, Korea) using HiSeq X as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, influenza RNA was evaluated using an Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and the concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer of BioPhotometer
 <sup>Â®</sup> (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The cDNA library of influenza RNA was generated using QIAseq FX Single Cell RNA Library Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands). cDNA concentration was measured using LightCycle qPCR (Roche, Penzberg, Upper Bavaria, Germany), and library size was checked using Agilent High Sensitivity D5000 ScreenTape System (Santa Clara, CA, USA).
