<p>Mutation in the ribonucleoprotein complex (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) could have increased the replication efficiency of the virus in a different host. Mutations in the internal genes were compared with those of H2N9 in wild birds to assess new variations and notably different residues were identified, as shown in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-01046-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The mutation E627K that enhances viral replication in mammalian cells in PB2 was not found in our H2N9 isolate [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-01046" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similar results were observed in other Hong Kong H2N9 isolates, but human H7N9 isolates had this mutation. In addition, the PB2 gene of our H2N9 isolate had several mutations (L89V, K251R, G309D, and H447Q) that may enhance polymerase activity and increase virulence in mice and mammals [
