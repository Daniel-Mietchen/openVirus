<p>In the sequence analysis, the number of AIV reads was 2,186,688, which accounted for 10.37% of the raw NGS data. Consensus contigs for eight segments of the AIV were obtained by data assembly and the error correction process. Investigation with ORFfinder (NCBI) confirmed that these contigs all have a complete ORF (
