<p>Phylogenic analysis for the eight genes of the AIV (A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018) (H2N9) was performed to assess their genetic relationships with those of domestic poultry and wild birds in Korea and neighboring countries, using data from NCBI. All phylogenic analyses of each gene are shown in the separate 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01046">supplementary information</xref>. The results showed that the surface genes (HA and NA) of our H2N9 strain were found to be widespread in various Eurasian countries, whereas the internal genes were found to be limited in East Asia countries.
