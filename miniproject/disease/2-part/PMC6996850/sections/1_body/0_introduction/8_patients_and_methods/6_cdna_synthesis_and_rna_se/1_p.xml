<p>Whole transcriptome c-DNA bar-coded libraries were prepared using 200–500 ng rRNA-depleted total RNA and SOLiD Total RNA-Seq Kit, (Life Technologies USA). The barcoded libraries from each study group were combined in color-balanced multiples of four at equimolar concentrations in every multiplex sequencing pool to preserve color balance for the SOLiD System sequencing run. An emulsion PCR was set up of Multiplex sequencing pooled library template at 0.7 pM concentration as per the guidelines using SOLiD EZ Bead E80 System kit (Life Technologies USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 3’ end of P2-enriched beads were modified for each sample and volume of beads was adjusted approximately 750,000beads/μL to 1.25 million beads/μL prior to loading on SOLiD platform.</p>
