<p>This study for the first time provides comparative transcriptome analysis of PBMCs obtained from hepatitis E patients and addresses impact of pregnancy. Next generation sequencing technology has proved to be a powerful tool providing comparative mRNA transcript levels of a very large number of genes from a clinical sample in a quantity that can be easily collected from a patient. However, as post-transcriptional modifications are important in determining functional outcome, such studies are generally used as useful pointers to identify target genes / pathways that must be validated by appropriate experiments. The data presented here highlights significant differences among clinical and subclinical infections in pregnant women that need to be extended to fulminant disease and confirmed by well-defined immunologic assays.</p>
