<p>In view of the association of defensins and S100 genes as well as Ig genes in disease presentation during pregnancy, we quantitated these genes using SYBR green-based quantitative real time PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g012">Fig 12Bâ€“12D</xref>). By both the assays, DEFA4 was not detected in the NPR-acute category while DEFA1 and DEFA4 genes were upregulated in the pregnant patients during acute and subclinical infections (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g012">Fig 12D</xref>). Additionally, raised expression of IGJ gene recorded by RNA-seq in the PR-2-CL and PR-3-CL patients when compared with the trimester-matched healthy controls was confirmed by TaqMan-RT-PCR. These results reveal reproducibility of RNA-seq results by both TaqMan and SYBR green-based real time PCR assays and ascertain validity of the conclusions drawn that need to be further confirmed by cell-based specific assays.
