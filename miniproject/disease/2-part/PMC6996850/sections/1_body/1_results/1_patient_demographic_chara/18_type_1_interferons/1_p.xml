<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in linking innate and adaptive immune response and can detect cytokines produced by the infected cells, type-I interferons being most important. It is therefore surprising that despite identifying several upregulated IFN-inducible genes, we did not detect raised expression of IFNα or IFNβ in all the patient groups studied. At protein level, we detected reduced circulating IFNα levels in these patients while IFNβ was not tested [
