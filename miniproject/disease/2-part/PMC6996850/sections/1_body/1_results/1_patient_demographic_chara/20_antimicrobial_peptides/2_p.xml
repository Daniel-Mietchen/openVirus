<p>An important observation is differential expression of transcripts of S100 series molecules. Members of this family are small, acidic calcium binding proteins and there is increasing evidence showing that these proteins also act as “danger associated molecular patterns”. These are endogenous ligands of TLR4 [

 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. An increased transcription of S100A8, S100A9, S100A11 genes was observed in the NPR patients. Higher expression of S100A8 during acute hepatitis in both trimesters and additionally S100A12 in the third trimester, with normal expression of S100A9 suggests similar role in the PR patients as well. A further comparison among acute and subclinical infections with respect to the PR controls showed upregulation of different molecules of S100 series in the acute disease while subclinical infections exhibited either downregulated or normal levels.
