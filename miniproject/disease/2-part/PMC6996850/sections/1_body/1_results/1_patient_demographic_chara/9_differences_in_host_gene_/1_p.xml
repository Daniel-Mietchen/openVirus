<p>The patterns of DEGs in PR-2-acute (PR-3-acute) groups were: total, 509 (411); up-regulated, 363 (334) and down-regulated, 146(77) genes (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228068.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). All the patients with clinical disease exhibited common GO terms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) related to non-specific and innate immune response such as response to stress, defense response, inflammatory response, death and immune system process. GO terms unique to NPR patients were blood coagulation and viral genome replication whereas the PR patients exhibited type I interferon production, regulation of interferon-beta production (PR-2-acute) and regulation of interlukin-8 production, regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade (PR-3-acute). Several GO terms related to ubiquination process were enriched only in the PR patients while none of the patient groups showed enrichment of adaptive immune response related GO terms.
