<p>Our data documented heightened innate immune response in terms of highly upregulated expression of transcripts associated with non-specific primary response and robust inflammatory response in the pregnant women with self-recovering hepatitis E. The study revealed that immune responses during the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> trimesters were distinctly different and recorded definite differences between clinical and subclinical infections during these trimesters. Disease presentation was associated with differential expression of S100 series, inversely proportion to overexpression of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in the pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggested a role in protection. Based on the confirmation of the gene expression profiles obtained in this study by several functional studies reported earlier in acute as well as fulminant hepatitis patients with or without pregnancy, it may be summarized that clinical presentation in hepatitis E represent distinct transcriptional profiles with respect to immune response. The extensive, informative data provided for the first time should form basis for future studies that will help in understanding pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis E during pregnancy.
