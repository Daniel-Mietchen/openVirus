<p>Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] described the case of a subject who presented, within five months of kidney transplantation, a tuberculous adenitis associated with extensive Kaposi's disease primarily involving mucous membranes, the digestive tract, the lungs, and the mediastinum. He benefited from anti-tuberculosis therapy that continued over the course of one year to a spectacular regression of all Kaposi's Sarcoma's lesions.
