  <p>Genome coverage and sequencing depth of ebolavirus assays</p>
 </caption>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">EBOV: Ebola virus; RESTV: Reston virus, SUDV: Sudan virus; TAFV: Taï Forest virus.</p>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">Reads from the first and second round were mapped together against reference sequences of each ebolavirus species. </p>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">A. Percentage of genome coverage achieved by each assay with an average of 10
  <sup>5</sup>, 10
  <sup>4</sup> and 10
  <sup>3</sup> copies per reaction. The exact number of copies per reaction is indicated in white text at the top of the bar. 
 </p>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">B. Sequencing depth by nucleotide position achieved by our assay for each ebolavirus species at an average of 10
  <sup>3</sup> copies per reaction and by the Artic V3 and Quick et al. protocols for the same EBOV specimen used in the generic protocol. Identical PCR products were used for Illumina- and MinION-specific library preparation and downstream sequencing platforms. Mapping only the first round yielded similar results in high-titred specimens (≥ 10
  <sup>4</sup> copies/reaction) (data not shown).
