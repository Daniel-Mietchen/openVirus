<p>A limitation of our study is that our virus panel did not include members of the species 
 <italic>Bundibugyo</italic> and 
 <italic>Bombali ebolavirus</italic>. Nonetheless, the validation with Ta√Ø Forest virus may represent the genetically closely related Bundibugyo virus; Bombali viruses are bat viruses not known to be pathogenic for humans [
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another limitation is the usage of modified bases such as inosines that increases the cost of primers. However, usage of such bases was required to reduce primer degeneracy. Another limitation is that we opted for a nested PCR protocol, which increases pipetting complexity and the risk of amplicon contamination. Standard laboratory precautions to avoid contamination must therefore be applied. Finally, although usage of both rounds is recommended, using the first round protocol only may provide sufficient results in cases of high viral load such as in symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is important to note that this protocol is designed for genomic characterisation of ebolaviruses, and is neither intended nor validated for diagnostic purposes.
