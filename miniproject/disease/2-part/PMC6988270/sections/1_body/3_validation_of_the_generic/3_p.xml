<p>In terms of sequencing depth, reactions containing on average 10
 <sup>3</sup> viral copies yielded around 2,000â€“10,000 reads/nt for all ebolavirus tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). At ca 10-fold lower amounts of viral copies per reaction, we were still able to achieve a coverage ranging from 55 to 95 per cent of the analysed ebolavirus genomes (

In sum, we achieved high genomic coverage and sequencing depth for divergent ebolaviruses that was comparable to that achieved by EBOV-specific assays [

 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Even if the generic protocol may be less sensitive than variant-specific approaches and fail to retrieve full genomes at lower virus concentrations such as in oligosymptomatic patients or in patients sampled during recovery, sufficient genomic information will be obtainable to design diagnostic protocols, taxonomically classify the ebolavirus variants causing the outbreak and complete full genomes by designing variant-specific primers bridging the sequence islets retrieved by the generic protocol.
