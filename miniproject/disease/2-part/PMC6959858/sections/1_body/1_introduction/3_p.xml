<p>Viral–bacterial coinfection frequently occurs, and a number of studies emphasize the potential risk of synergistic presentation during coinfection with respiratory viruses and bacteria, showing longer hospital stays and higher morbidity with variations in which bacterial strains were invaders being modified by personal or population immunity.

 </sup> Although most coinfection research has focused on influenza viruses, other viruses also participate in viral–bacterial coinfections, including RSV and adenoviruses.
