     <p>Among young children with solo-infections of influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and RSV, the overall viral–bacterial codetection rate was 60%. The most frequently codetected bacteria were 
      <italic>H influenzae</italic> in adenoviral infection (46.2%), 
      <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> in RSV infection (34.2%), and 
      <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> in influenza (50.0%; 5/10). Although the presence of viral–bacterial coinfection was not a risk factor for severe LRTIs, the codetection of 
      <italic>H influenzae</italic> was the protective factor for wheezing, and pneumococcal codetection was associated with reduced severity of viral LRTIs.
