<p>Data from the clinical virology laboratory at Asan Medical Center was used to determine the relative frequency of respiratory viruses detected at Asan Medical Center Children‘s Hospital during 2 recent consecutive influenza seasons (November 2015 to April 2016 and November 2016 to April 2017). During the study period, clinical and demographic data from hospitalized pediatric patients aged under 5 years with community-acquired single viral infections of influenza A/B, RSV A/B, or adenovirus detected by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Seeplex: Seegene Inc, Seoul, Korea) were abstracted from electronic medical records including clinical diagnosis, duration of hospital stay, underlying medical conditions, antibiotics use, need for intensive care unit stay, and/or mechanical ventilation. The analysis only included the first virus detected during a single clinical episode occurring within a 4-week period, and duplicates from the same patient were excluded. The following cases were excluded: healthcare-associated infection, coexistence of ≥ 2 different respiratory viruses, influenza cases confirmed only by rapid influenza antigen test, and respiratory viral infections other than adenovirus, influenza, or RSV.</p>
