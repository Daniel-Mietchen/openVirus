<p>With the exception of respiratory specimens only for rapid influenza antigen testing which were obtained by nasopharyngeal swabs, respiratory specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirates submitted to the clinical virology laboratory for detection of respiratory viruses were tested using real-time multiplex PCR (Seeplex), which differentiated 15 species of common respiratory viruses including influenza A and B, RSV A and B, and adenovirus. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected within 3 days of symptom onset and no later than 7 days from the patients who might have respiratory diseases with/or without fever, if possible prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy at our institute.</p>
