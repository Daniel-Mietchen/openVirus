<p>Remnants of nasopharyngeal aspirates after viral confirmation using multiplex PCR, which were kept at −70°C were used for the bacterial PCR as follows. Nasopharyngeal aspirates stored at −70°C, were thawed and centrifuged. We suspended a pellet in 180 μL of the enzyme solution (20 mg/mL lysozyme, 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Extraction and purification of DNA from this sample was done according to the manufacturer's instructions for the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany).</p>
