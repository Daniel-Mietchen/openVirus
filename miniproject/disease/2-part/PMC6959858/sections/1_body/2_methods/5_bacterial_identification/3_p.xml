 <italic>, S pneumoniae</italic>, and

 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]
 </sup> (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Bacterial PCR amplifications were performed using 20 μL reaction mixtures containing distilled water 10.8 μL, 10× PCR buffer 2 μL, 25 mN MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> 1.6 μL, primer set 0.4 μL each, 2.5 mM dNTP mixture 1.6 μL, 5U/μL Taq DNA polymerase 0.2 μL (TaKaRa Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan), and 3 μL of DNA extract. After placing reaction tubes within the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA), we maintained the temperature at 95°C for 5 minutes and then immediately went through 35 cycles, each consisting of 95°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute. The final cycle had a prolonged extension time of 5 minutes. Distilled water was used as a negative control.
