<p>Younger age and presence of underlying diseases were associated with the increased risk of accompanying wheezing (aOR, 1.85 and 5.05, respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Although RSV itself was a risk factor for wheezing in univariate analysis (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.13–9.87), there was no statistical significance in multivariate analysis. The codetection of 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> was the protective factor for wheezing (aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13–0.98).
