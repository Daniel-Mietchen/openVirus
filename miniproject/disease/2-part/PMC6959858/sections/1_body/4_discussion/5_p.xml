<p>Emerging evidence reveals that the airway microbiome changes were associated with postviral wheeze; especially, higher risk of developing persistent wheezing and asthma in the presence of 
 <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> in viral infection.

 </sup> In this study, however, there was no increased risk of wheeze in young children experiencing viral infections, irrespective of coexistence of 
 <italic>M catarrhalis.</italic> Our study suggested that codetection of 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> was significantly associated with lower odds of presentation with wheezing. Although this association does not necessarily mean causation, and the effect of previous or concomitant use of antibiotics cannot be excluded, the airway microbiome during viral infections is a relevant determinant of wheeze in young children.
