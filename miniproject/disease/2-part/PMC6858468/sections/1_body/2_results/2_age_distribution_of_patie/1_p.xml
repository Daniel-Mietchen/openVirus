<p id="Par11">Patients were divided into seven age groups to clarify the age distributions for these three paramyxoviruses, as follows: age 0–3 months, 4–6 months, 7–12 months, 1–2 years, 3–5 years, 6–10 years, and 11–14 years. Significant differences were found in the prevalence of RSV, PIV, and HMPV among all age groups (
