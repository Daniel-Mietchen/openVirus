<p id="Par12">Overall, in the 7-year period study, RSV and HMPV had similar seasonal patterns as well as two clear prevalence peaks each year. The larger peak of RSV and HMPV prevalence appeared during the change of season from winter to spring, mainly occurring in February to April every year. The smaller peak was mainly observed in August to October each year, during the shift from summer to autumn (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). PIV prevalence increased as autumn turned to winter and summer turned to autumn, and appeared between peaks of RSV and HMPV prevalence (Fig.
