Of the 11,398 patients tested, 5606 (49.2%) had positive results for one or more of the pathogens of interest, and 17.9% (1001/5606) of positive patients were found to have coinfection with two or more pathogens. The median age of pathogen-positive patients was 1.5 years (IQR, 0.7–3.0), and positive patients had a higher sex ratio (1.9:1) than patients who tested negative for all pathogens (1.7:1) (
