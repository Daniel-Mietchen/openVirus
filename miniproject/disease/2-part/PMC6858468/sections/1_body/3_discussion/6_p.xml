<p id="Par21">Some limitations of this study should be noted. First, because our study was mainly focused on the circulation of paramyxoviruses among hospitalized patients with ARI, paramyxoviruses in outpatients and the asymptomatic population were not included. Second, many factors can affect virus epidemics; meteorological data analysis alone may be insufficient to reach a final conclusive interpretation. Third, the current study was only conducted in three hospitals and may not be representative of the overall population.</p>
