<p id="Par16">ARI is one of the most common human diseases resulting in high mortality and mobility, and it is predominantly caused by respiratory viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Paramyxoviruses, including RSV, PIV, and HMPV, are the most important respiratory viruses in patients with ARI all over the world, especially among children under 5 years old [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These viruses are also an important cause of nosocomial infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Currently, no effective vaccines or drugs have been developed against these viruses, except palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, additional research must be carried out. In the present study, we sought to analyze the features of paramyxovirus infection and correlation with meteorological conditions in a subtropical region of southern China, by collecting respiratory samples from pediatric patients (≤ 14 years old) hospitalized with ARI in Guangzhou and testing for RSV, PIV, HMPV, and other common respiratory pathogens. Meteorological data were also collected between July 2009 and June 2016, for further correlation analysis. The goal of the study was to reveal information that could be useful in the prevention and control of these viruses.
