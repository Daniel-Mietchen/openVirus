<p id="Par18">In our study, neutrophil depletion neither ameliorated nor potentiated the timing or severity of weight loss during RSV infection in either C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice. Weight loss is considered a readout of disease severity in mice and it is largely driven by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells

 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell to the lung, nor was the formation of antigen-specific T cells in the lung altered. In light of this, it is perhaps not surprising that neutrophil depletion did not reduce weight loss in RSV infected mice. During influenza infection, neutrophils have been shown to guide the recruitment of T cells into the lung by leaving trails of the chemokine CXCL12
