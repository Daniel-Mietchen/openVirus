<p id="Par14">We found that neutrophils do not impair the establishment of an anti-viral, inflammatory immune environment, which is dominated by the production of type I IFNs

 </sup>. The induction of type I IFNs by alveolar macrophages (AMs) in response to RSV initiates the upregulation of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) encoding anti-viral mediators. This includes CCL2 which recruits anti-viral monocytes to the lung

 </sup>. Neutrophil depletion did not impair the recruitment of monocytes early during RSV infection; in fact, neutrophil depletion increased the total number of monocytes in the lung during RSV. This has also been observed in a house dust mite model

 </sup>. Furthermore, neutrophil depletion did not significantly inhibit the levels of IL-6, TNF-α or IL-1β as detected in the airways (in BAL fluid) confirming that neutrophils are not a major source of these mediators in the lung during RSV infection. AMs are a known source of these cytokines

 </sup>, so these data also suggest that AM function during RSV infection does not depend on cross-talk with neutrophils. Recently, it was found that the release of mature IL-1β from AMs during influenza infection requires a neutrophil-derived peptide

 </sup>. Together these studies highlight how the role of neutrophils varies between infections with different respiratory viruses.
