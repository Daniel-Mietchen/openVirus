<p id="Par20">While neutrophils are an important line of defense during many inflammatory conditions, their recruitment and activation must be tightly regulated to prevent bystander damage on host tissues

 </sup>. In a previous study we have shown that the inflammatory environment in the lung induced during RSV infection drives neutrophil activation

 </sup>. However, we could not detect any major differences in weight loss after neutrophil depletion during RSV infection. In addition, we could not detect any differences in mucus production after neutrophil depletion, although, in a study using a different RSV strain (2–20), neutrophil depletion decreased mucin production at day 8 p.i

 </sup>. It remains possible that neutrophils contribute to lung pathology during RSV infection that does not translate into weight loss. Indeed, neutrophils contribute to disease severity during infection with numerous influenza virus strains

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>. However, not all studies on influenza virus infection after neutrophil depletion are in agreement on whether neutrophils are beneficial (anti-viral) or detrimental (causing lung damage)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. These discrepancies may be due to the viral strain or dose used

 </sup>. It is therefore possible that lung pathology and mucin production are influenced by neutrophils in slightly different ways dependent on which mouse and infection models and type of viral strains used.
