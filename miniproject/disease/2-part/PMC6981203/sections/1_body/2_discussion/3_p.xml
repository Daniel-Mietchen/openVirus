<p id="Par15">TNF-α is an important cytokine during RSV infection, both for mediating RSV-induced illness and for activating cells such as neutrophils

 </sup>. We did not find a change in TNF-α levels in the airways of neutrophil depleted mice. In disagreement with our data, a previous study showed a 2-fold decrease of TNF-α in lung homogenate 24 h post RSV infection after α-Ly6G antibody depletion of neutrophils in BALB/c mice using a different strain of RSV (2–20)

 </sup>. The disparity between the two studies could suggest that the neutrophil response during RSV infection may differ depending on the mouse or viral strain used and the type of lung sample used for protein detection.
