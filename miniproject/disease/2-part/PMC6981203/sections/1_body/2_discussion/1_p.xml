 </sup>. Using a mouse model, we found that neutrophils do not act as major contributors to the pro-inflammatory environment or drive disease severity, despite their abundance in the lung following RSV infection. Furthermore, neutrophils do not appear to be an essential component of the host defense response as they do not restrict viral replication in the lungs. Overall, these data suggest that neutrophils are not exerting a beneficially anti-viral role during RSV infection.
