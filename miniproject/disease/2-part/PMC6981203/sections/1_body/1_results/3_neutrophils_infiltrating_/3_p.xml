<p id="Par11">We considered the possibility that the mouse model of RSV infection does not accurately mimic the massive influx of neutrophils observed clinically in infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, to enhance early neutrophil recruitment in our model, mice were treated i.n. with 10 μg recombinant CXCL1 6 h p.i. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), which resulted in neutrophils constituting 90% of the cells in the airways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), comparable to that observed in infants hospitalized with RSV induced bronchiolitis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Notably, we found that neutrophil enhancement by treatment with rCXCL1 6 h p.i. did not influence disease severity as measured by weight loss during the infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Next we wanted to test if the kinetics of lung neutrophil influx influences the severity of disease. In children with RSV induced bronchiolitis airway neutrophils are prominent during the peak of disease
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. However, in mice, the primary recruitment of neutrophils occurs before weight loss develops
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. To better model influx of neutrophils during the peak of RSV disease, mice were treated with 5 μg rCXCL1 i.n. on days 4, 5, 6 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). However, again, exacerbating the influx of neutrophils even at the peak of disease did not drive increased weight loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Thus, neutrophils infiltrating the lungs during RSV infection are not contributing to the severity of disease.
