 </sup>). As the GFP signal has not been quantified in this work the mice are noted as wt throughout. All mice were bred and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions and were gender and age-matched (7–12 weeks). All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board (AWERB) within Imperial College London and approved by the UK Home Office in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the ARRIVE guidelines.
