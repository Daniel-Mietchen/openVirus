<p>The histopathological analysis showed vascular congestion of glomerular capillary and medullar region in all kidney tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,E,H). As expected, in the kidney of non-dengue patients, a regular structure of the glomerulus and normal structure with preserved distal and proximal convoluted tubules were observed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f001">Figure 1</xref>G,H) were present in case 1. In the proximal convoluted tubules (PCT), loss of the apical cell portion and cytoplasmic remains (star) in light were observed in cases 2 and 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f001">Figure 1</xref>D,F), and congestion of peritubular capillaries was found in cases 1, 2, and 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,E,H). Discrete focus of isolated hyalinosis was observed in case 1 and case 3, showing a prominent arteriolar hyalinosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). The glomeruli presented visceral epithelial cells and tubular cells at confluence (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f001">Figure 1</xref>F) in case 1. In addition to the changes described in the renal glomerulus, a focus of interstitial fibroedema and tubular atrophy with discrete mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, focal cell necrosis, granular material in the fibrous endarteritis lumen into the intertubular arteries, and focal hemorrhage were observed only in case 3 (
