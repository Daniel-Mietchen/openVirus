<p>Jessie et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] analyzed human tissues from DENV-1 infected patients and found viral antigens as discrete granular deposits within the tubule-lining cells, but found no viral RNA in the samples. Here, on the other hand, high viral titers in all DENV-4 cases were observed. Basilio-de-Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] demonstrated in a fatal elderly DENV-3 case, hemorrhage in the glomerular capillaries, and proximal convoluted tubules. Renal medullary tissue also presented a mononuclear infiltrate around the collection ducts, with pockets of hemorrhage, interstitial edema, and vascular congestion. Similarly, our cases presented more diffuse and focal infiltrates. Moreover, congestion, peritubular hemorrhage in case 3, and congestion in all cases, both in the medullary and in the cortical area, were identified.
