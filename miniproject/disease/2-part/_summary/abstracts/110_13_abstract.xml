 <p>We report influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in a captive giant panda in Hong Kong. The viral load peaked on day 1 and became undetectable on day 5, and an antibody response developed. Genome analysis showed 99.3%â€“99.9% nucleotide identity between the virus and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulating in Hong Kong.</p>
