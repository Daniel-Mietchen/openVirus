 <p>Immunocompromised individuals often become symptomatic with infections which are normally fairly asymptomatic in healthy individuals. The particular mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to coinfections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals are multifaceted. ZIKV and other flaviviruses are sensitive to neutralizing antibodies, whose production can be limited in HIV-infected individuals but are also sensitive to type I interferons, which are expressed at high levels in HIV-infected individuals. Data in this study highlight how individual components of the innate and adaptive immune responses which become perturbed in HIV-infected individuals influence ZIKV infection.</p>
