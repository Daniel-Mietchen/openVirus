 <p>Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B viruses are globally circulating in seasonal epidemics. Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are permissive for viral isolation and vaccine manufacture. Nevertheless, the interplay between influenza B viruses and host microRNAs has not been investigated in this cell line. Therefore, the present study aims at high-throughput analysis of canine microRNA profile upon infection of influenza B viruses. Briefly, MDCK cells were infected with Victoria or Yamagata lineage at MOI of 0.01. After being harvested at 6, 12 and 24 h post infection, microRNAs were subjected to high-throughput sequencing based on MiSeq platform (Illumina). The results demonstrated that five microRNAs including cfa-miR-197, cfa-miR-215, cfa-miR361, cfa-miR-1841, and cfa-miR-1842 were overexpressed in both Victoria and Yamagata lineage infections. Interestingly, computational prediction showed that karyopherin alpha 6 (KPNA6) was targeted by cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215. Moreover, the binding sites of both microRNAs were assessed by 3′-UTR reporter assay. The results showed that only cfa-miR-197 could bind to the target sites of KPNA6, leading to suppressing luciferase activity. Additionally, silencing of KPNA6 was confirmed by overexpression of cfa-miR-197. This study provides canine microRNA responses to seasonal influenza B viruses, suggesting that virus-mediated microRNAs might play crucial roles in host gene regulation.</p>
