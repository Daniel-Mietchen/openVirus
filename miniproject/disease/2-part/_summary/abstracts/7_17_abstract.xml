 <p>To date, documentation of two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) has been accepted as confirmation of measles immunity among healthcare workers (HCWs). However, we encountered measles in an HCW who had received two doses of MCV. A patient with measles was admitted to our hospital. Among 62 exposed HCWs, one nurse who had previously received two doses of MCV was shown to be negative for anti-measles immunoglobulin G (IgG), and was confirmed to have measles 14 days after exposure. Based on this experience, we suggest that all HCWs should be tested for anti-measles IgG to confirm their immunity to measles.</p>
