 <p>Lung inflammation to influenza A virus (IAV) infection can be fatal when the virus spreads to the alveolar space. We demonstrated that pathogenic inflammation to IAV is promoted by endosomally located NOX2 oxidase and that targeted inhibition of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by this enzyme suppressed this inflammation and improved viral clearance.
