 <p>Owned, free-roaming domestic cats are abundant in the Chilean countryside, having high probability of contact with wildlife and potentially participating as reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. In the present study, 131 cats from two remote study areas (Valdivia and Chiloe Island) in southern Chile were analyzed for infection/exposure to eight pathogens. Serum samples from 112 cats were tested for antigens against feline leukemia virus (FeLV antigen-ELISA) and antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV-ELISA) and canine distemper virus (CDV-serum neutralization), yielded occurrence of 8.9, 1.7 and 0.8% respectively. The presence of DNA of five vector-borne pathogens, piroplasmids, 
  <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> spp., 
  <italic>Anaplasma</italic> spp., 
  <italic>Rickettsia</italic> spp. and 
  <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. was investigated in thirty cats. Overall observed occurrence was 6.6
  <italic>%</italic> (2/30) for both 
  <italic>Anaplasma platys</italic>, and 
  <italic>B. henselae</italic>, and 3.3% (1/30) for both 
  <italic>Bartonella</italic> sp. and 
  <italic>Theileria equi</italic>. Observed occurrence for all vector-borne pathogens in Valdivia area was significantly higher than in Chiloe Island (5/15 vs 0/15; 
  <italic>P</italic>=0.04). Our results represent the first description of exposure to CDV and DNA detection of 
  <italic>T. equi</italic> and 
  <italic>A. platys</italic> in domestic cats in Chile. The results highlight the importance of performing pathogen screening in owned, free-roaming rural cats to evaluate their potential role as reservoirs of infection and vectors for disease transmission to wildlife.
