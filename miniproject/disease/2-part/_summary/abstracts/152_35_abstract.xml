 <p>Since it emerged in human populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) around 1920, HIV diversified in several virus lineages that spread across sub-Saharan Africa and beyond. While some lineages are rare and remain geographically confined to certain regions, e.g. subtypes H and J, others expanded rapidly across sub-Saharan Africa, e.g. subtype C. Here we conducted a spatial genetic analysis of the three main HIV-1 virus lineages, subtypes, A1, C and D, that co-circulate across 20 locations in central and East Africa, to investigate their spatial and temporal origins and their mode of spread across comparable geographic areas. We find that subtype C, currently the dominant lineage in sub-Saharan Africa, emerged in the southern DRC mining region, and spread 3-fold faster than other co-circulating lineages. Our study uncovers distinct patterns of spread of the main HIV-1 subtypes in a region that covers nearly half of all infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
