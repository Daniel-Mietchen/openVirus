 <p id="Par2">Avian influenza A virus (IAV) strains replicate poorly in mammalian hosts, but mechanisms underlying species restriction are incompletely understood. Here, Bogdanow 
  <italic>et al</italic>. show that avian and mammalian adapted IAV strains have evolved different RNA structure features for regulation of M segment RNA splicing.
