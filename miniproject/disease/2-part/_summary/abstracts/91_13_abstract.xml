 <p>Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) occurs as a pathological entity that may be classified into four different types: classic, endemic, epidemic, and iatrogenic. It can arise among HIV-positive subjects or within immunosuppression, yet exceptionally of tuberculous origin. We describe a new case report of an HIV-negative patient, manifesting Kaposi's disease in the course of tuberculosis, with the aim to assess this uncommon disorder and to outline this rare atypical association.</p>
