 <p>Viruses transmitted by arthropods (arboviruses) are the etiological agents of several human diseases with worldwide distribution; including dengue (DENV), zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses. These viruses are especially important in tropical and subtropical regions; where, ZIKV and CHIKV are involved in epidemics worldwide, while the DENV remains as the biggest problem in public health. Factors, such as, environmental conditions promote the distribution of vectors, deficiencies in health services, and lack of effective vaccines, guarantee the presence of these vector-borne diseases. Treatment against these viral diseases is only palliative since available therapies formulated lack to demonstrate specific antiviral activity and vaccine candidates fail to demonstrate enough effectiveness. The use of natural products, as therapeutic tools, is an ancestral practice in different cultures. According to WHO 80 % of the population of some countries from Africa and Asia depend on the use of traditional medicines to deal with some diseases. Molecular characteristics of these viruses are important in determining its cellular pathogenesis, emergence, and dispersion mechanisms, as well as for the development of new antivirals and vaccines to control strategies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular structure and replication mechanisms of selected arboviruses, as well as their mechanism of entry into host cells, and a brief overview about the potential targets accessed to inhibit these viruses
