 <p>Poliovirus has been eradicated in the US for 40 years. Its sequelae, poliomyelitis, a syndrome characterized by fever, meningitis, and flaccid paralysis, is a rare entity. Other viruses have been implicated in poliomyelitis-like syndromes since the elimination of poliovirus. West Nile virus (WNV), since its westward migration in 1999, has recently been found to be a causative agent of fever, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. We present the case of a male who presented to the hospital for fever and experienced a subsequent fall, without any symptoms of encephalitis, diagnosed with WNV infection.</p>
