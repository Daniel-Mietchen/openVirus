 <p>Viruses evolve rapidly and unpredictably, challenging the effectiveness of disease diagnostics. To help control outbreaks and understand their origins, the first step is often isolating viruses from infected samples for characterization. We demonstrate that multiple emerging virus strains can be simultaneously enriched and optically detected in only a few minutes without using any labels. A portable platform that captures viruses by their size, coupled to Raman spectroscopy, resulted in successful virus identification with 90% accuracy in real time directly from clinical samples. Furthermore, this viable enrichment process enables further culturing and characterization by electron microscopy and deep sequencing. This microplatform is an effective disease-monitoring system and broadens virus surveillance by enabling real-time virus identification.</p>
