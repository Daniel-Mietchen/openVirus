PMC6776365,2-part\_summary\abstracts\1_28_abstract.xml,   Seoul hantavirus (SEOV) has recently raised concern by causing geographic range expansion of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). SEOV infections in humans are significantly underestimated worldwide and epidemic dynamics of SEOV-related HFRS are poorly understood because of a lack of field data and empirically validated models. Here we use mathematical models to examine both intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of disease transmission from animal (the Norway rat) to humans in a SEOV-endemic area in China. We found that rat eradication schemes and vaccination campaigns but below the local elimination threshold could diminish the amplitude of the HFRS epidemic but did not modify its seasonality. Models demonstrate population dynamics of the rodent host were insensitive to climate variations in urban settings while relative humidity had a negative effect on the seasonality in transmission. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology of SEOV-related HFRS demonstrates asynchronies between rodent population dynamics and transmission rate and identifies potential drivers of the SEOV seasonality.  ,
PMC6776365,2-part\_summary\abstracts\2_29_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Seoul hantavirus (SEOV) infections are common in Europe and Asia where a considerably high seroprevalence among the population is found. However only relatively few hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases are reported. Comprehensive epidemiological data is necessary to study the patterns and drivers of this underestimated disease. Here we analyzed rodent host surveillance and seroprevalence data from 1998 to 2015 for disease outbreaks in Huludao City one of the typical SEOV-endemic areas for HFRS in China. Our mathematical models quantified the drivers on HFRS transmission and estimated the epidemiological parameters. Our study provides an understanding of its ecological process between intrinsic and extrinsic factors human-rodent interface and disease dynamics.  ,
PMC6776623,2-part\_summary\abstracts\3_13_abstract.xml,   Pork has become the number one meat consumed worldwide. Meeting the demand for pork has forced the revolution of swine production from traditional husbandry practices that involved a few pigs or small herds to intensive concentration of swine raised in multisite production systems. This dramatic change has made the production of pork very efficient but it has also changed the ecology of many swine diseases may encourage the emergence of new diseases and amplifies the economic impact of swine diseases. Sustained treatment of diseases in livestock production is not feasible making prevention of disease a priority. Prevention of livestock diseases involves eliminating exposure to pathogens and anti-viral strategies to prevent or reduce clinical disease. For some swine diseases efficacious vaccines can be made however for other diseases the host/pathogen relationship is more complex and efficacious vaccines are not available. Given the increasing demand for pork the development of new approaches to improve swine anti-viral immunity is critical. Rate-limiting steps to improving vaccines are understanding how the pathogen interacts with the host's immune system any immunopathology resulting from such interactions and how the host's immune system resolves the infection. Solving this puzzle will require sustained research and may require new technologies to battle contemporary diseases now wreaking havoc in swine production systems around the world. This Special Issue will focus on current swine viral diseases that are the most challenging to the global production of pork with contributions focusing on anti-viral immunity.  ,
PMC6777354,2-part\_summary\abstracts\4_35_abstract.xml,   Human norovirus (HuNoV) GII.P17-GII.17 (Kawasaki2014 variant) reportedly emerged in 2014 and caused gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. To clarify the evolution of both    VP1 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (   RdRp) regions of GII.P17-GII.17 we analyzed both global and novel Japanese strains detected during 2013–2017. Time-scaled phylogenetic trees revealed that the ancestral GII.17    VP1 region diverged around 1949 while the ancestral GII.P17    RdRp region diverged around 2010. The evolutionary rates of the    VP1 and    RdRp regions were estimated at ~2.7 × 10   −3 and ~2.3 × 10   −3 substitutions/site/year respectively. The phylogenetic distances of the    VP1 region exhibited no overlaps between intra-cluster and inter-cluster peaks in the GII.17 strains whereas those of the    RdRp region exhibited a unimodal distribution in the GII.P17 strains. Conformational epitope positions in the VP1 protein of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were similar although some substitutions insertions and deletions had occurred. Strains belonging to the same cluster also harbored substitutions around the binding sites for the histo-blood group antigens of the VP1 protein. Moreover some amino acid substitutions were estimated to be near the interface between monomers and the active site of the RdRp protein. These results suggest that the GII.P17-GII.17 virus has produced variants with the potential to alter viral antigenicity host-binding capability and replication property over the past 10 years.    ,
PMC6778435,2-part\_summary\abstracts\5_14_abstract.xml,   Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses (HPAIV) cause rapid systemic illness and death in susceptible animals leading to a disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Although vaccines and drugs are the best solution to prevent this threat a more effective treatment for H5 strains of influenza has yet to be developed. Therefore the development of therapeutics/drugs that combat H5N1 influenza virus infection is becoming increasingly important. Lycorine the major component of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids exhibits better protective effects against A/CK/GD/178/04 (H5N1) (GD178) viruses than the commercial neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor oseltamivir in our prior study. Lycorine demonstrates outstanding antiviral activity because of its inhibitory activity against the export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) from the nucleus. However how lycorine affects the proteome of AIV infected cells is unknown. Therefore we performed a comparative proteomic analysis to identify changes in protein expression in AIV-infected Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells treated with lycorine. Three groups were designed: mock infection group (M) virus infection group (V) and virus infection and lycorine-treated after virus infection group (L). The multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT) approach was employed to analyze protein level in this study. In total 5786 proteins were identified from the three groups of cells by using TMT proteomic analysis. In the V/M group 1101 proteins were identified of which 340 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were determined during HPAIV infection; among the 1059 proteins identified from the lycorine-treated group 258 proteins presented significant change. Here 71 proteins showed significant upregulation or downregulation of expression in the virus-infected/mock and virus-infected/lycorine-treated comparisons and the proteins in each fraction were functionally classified further. Interestingly lycorine treatment decreased the levels of the nuclear pore complex protein 93 (Nup93 E2RSV7) which is associated with nuclear–cytoplasmic transport. In addition Western blot experiments confirmed that the expression of Nup93 was significantly downregulated in lycorine treatment but induced after viral infection. Our results may provide new insights into how lycorine may trap vRNPs in the nucleus and suggest new potential therapeutic targets for influenza virus.  ,
PMC6779206,2-part\_summary\abstracts\6_18_abstract.xml,   Abstract.  The incidence of dengue is increasing in Guangdong China with the largest outbreak to date in 2014. Widespread awareness of epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the dengue virus (DENV) is required. In 2014 we isolated the virus from patients and sequenced its genome. The sequences of DENV isolated from Guangdong and other countries screened since 2005 were studied to establish molecular evolutionary databases along with epidemiological data to explore its epidemiological phylogenetic and molecular characteristics. Causes underlying the occurrence of the dengue epidemic included importation and localization of the virus. The number of indigenous cases significantly exceeded that of imported cases. Dengue virus 1 is the most important serotype and caused the long-term epidemic locally. Based on the data available since 2005 DENV1 was divided into three genotypes (I IV and V). Only genotypes I and V were detected in 2014. In 2014 an epidemic involving old lineages of DENV1 genotype V occurred after 2 years of silence. The genotype was previously detected from 2009 to 2011. Genotype I which caused recent epidemics demonstrated a continuation of new lineages and a predictive pattern of molecular evolution since 2005 among the four lineages was present. The DENV isolated from Guangdong was closely related to those causing large-scale epidemics in neighboring countries suggesting the possibility of its import from these countries. The lack of sufficient epidemiological data and evidence on the local mosquito-borne DENV emphasizes the importance of studying the molecular evolutionary features and establishing a well-established phylogenetic tree for dengue prevention and control in Guangdong.  ,
PMC6779578,2-part\_summary\abstracts\7_17_abstract.xml,   To date documentation of two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) has been accepted as confirmation of measles immunity among healthcare workers (HCWs). However we encountered measles in an HCW who had received two doses of MCV. A patient with measles was admitted to our hospital. Among 62 exposed HCWs one nurse who had previously received two doses of MCV was shown to be negative for anti-measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) and was confirmed to have measles 14 days after exposure. Based on this experience we suggest that all HCWs should be tested for anti-measles IgG to confirm their immunity to measles.  ,
PMC6779579,2-part\_summary\abstracts\8_17_abstract.xml,   Leptospirosis is a widespread worldwide zoonosis. Human leptospirosis was first identified in the Korea in 1984 as the cause of “epidemic pulmonary hemorrhagic fever of unknown etiology” that occurred sporadically or in outbreaks. The major outbreaks leading to some deaths mainly involved rice field farmers who worked in wet and muddy rice paddies following floods or heavy rainfalls. Leptospirosis was designated a nationally notifiable disease in 1987. The Korean government introduced a supplementary immunization program to control the disease from 1988 to 1997 which provided people at risk in endemic areas with the inactivated vaccine prepared from a local strain    Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai. In addition the continuous promotion of education and awareness in the media played a role in improving personal hygiene management. Since then the reported incidence of leptospirosis has been low. Leptospirosis is currently considered in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses occurring in fall. This study historically reviews clinical and epidemiological publications scientific reports and public health policies for recognition identification and infection control of human leptospirosis in the Korea.    ,
PMC6780294,2-part\_summary\abstracts\9_16_abstract.xml,      Objectives   Estimating influenza-associated mortality is important since seasonal influenza affects persons of all ages causing severe illness or death. This study aimed to estimate influenza-associated mortality considering both periodic changes and age-specific mortality by influenza subtypes.       Methods   Using the Microdata Integrated Service from Statistics Korea we collected weekly mortality data including cause of death. Laboratory surveillance data of respiratory viruses from 2009 to 2016 were obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After adjusting for the annual age-specific population size we used a negative binomial regression model by age group and influenza subtype.       Results   Overall 1 859 890 deaths were observed and the average rate of influenza virus positivity was 14.7% (standard deviation [SD] 5.8) with the following subtype distribution: A(H1N1) 5.0% (SD 5.8); A(H3N2) 4.4% (SD 3.4); and B 5.3% (SD 3.7). As a result among individuals under 65 years old 6774 (0.51%) all-cause deaths 2521 (3.05%) respiratory or circulatory deaths and 1048 (18.23%) influenza or pneumonia deaths were estimated. Among those 65 years of age or older 30 414 (2.27%) all-cause deaths 16 411 (3.42%) respiratory or circulatory deaths and 4906 (6.87%) influenza or pneumonia deaths were estimated. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was the major contributor to influenza-associated all-cause and respiratory or circulatory deaths in both age groups. However influenza A(H1N1) virus–associated influenza or pneumonia deaths were more common in those under 65 years old.       Conclusions   Influenza-associated mortality was substantial during this period especially in the elderly. By subtype influenza A(H3N2) virus made the largest contribution to influenza-associated mortality.    ,
PMC6780377,2-part\_summary\abstracts\10_17_abstract.xml,   Dengue virus (DENV) is an arboviral human pathogen transmitted through mosquito bite that infects an estimated ~400 million humans (~5% of the global population) annually. To date no specific therapeutics have been developed that can prevent or treat infections resulting from this pathogen. DENV utilizes numerous host molecules and factors for transcribing the single-stranded ~11 kb positive-sense RNA genome. For example the glycosylation machinery of the host is required for viral particles to assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum. Since a variety of host factors seem to be utilized by the pathogens targeting these factors may result in DENV inhibitors and will play an important role in attenuating the rapid emergence of other flaviviruses. Many experimental studies have yielded findings indicating that host factors facilitate infection indicating that the focus should be given to targeting the processes contributing to pathogenesis along with many other immune responses. Here we provide an extensive literature review in order to elucidate the progress made in the development of host-based approaches for DENV viral infections focusing on host cellular mechanisms and factors responsible for viral replication aiming to aid the potential development of host-dependent antiviral therapeutics.  ,
PMC6783925,2-part\_summary\abstracts\11_18_abstract.xml,   The clinical severity and observed case fatality ratio of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 in India particularly in 2015 and 2017 far exceeds current global estimates. Reasons for these frequent and severe epidemic waves remain unclear. We used Bayesian phylodynamic methods to uncover possible genetic explanations for this while also identifying the transmission dynamics of A/H1N1pdm09 between 2009 and 2017 to inform future public health interventions. We reveal a disproportionate selection at haemagglutinin residue positions associated with increased morbidity and mortality in India such as position 222 and clade 6B characteristic residues relative to equivalent isolates circulating globally. We also identify for the first time increased selection at position 186 as potentially explaining the severity of recent A/H1N1pdm09 epidemics in India. We reveal national routes of A/H1N1pdm09 transmission identifying Maharashtra as the most important state for the spread throughout India while quantifying climactic ecological and transport factors as drivers of within-country transmission. Together these results have important implications for future A/H1N1pdm09 surveillance and control within India but also for epidemic and pandemic risk prediction around the world.  ,
PMC6783926,2-part\_summary\abstracts\12_18_abstract.xml,   Influenza A virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality and novel antivirals are urgently needed. Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity has been acknowledged as a promising target for novel antivirals. In this study a phenotypic versus target-based screening strategy was established to identify the influenza A virus inhibitors targeting the virus RNA transcription/replication steps by sequentially using an RdRp-targeted screen and a replication-competent reporter virus-based approach using the same compounds. To demonstrate the utility of this approach a pilot screen of a library of 891 compounds derived from natural products was carried out. Quality control analysis indicates that the primary screen was robust for identification of influenza A virus inhibitors targeting RdRp activity. Finally two hit candidates were identified and one was validated as a putative RdRp inhibitor. This strategy can greatly reduce the number of false positives and improve the accuracy and efficacy of primary screening thereby providing a powerful tool for antiviral discovery.  ,
PMC6783930,2-part\_summary\abstracts\13_16_abstract.xml,   Flaviviruses are the most medically relevant group of arboviruses causing a wide range of diseases in humans and are associated with high mortality and morbidity as such posing a major health concern. Viruses belonging to this family can be endemic (e.g. dengue virus) but can also cause fulminant outbreaks (e.g. West Nile virus Japanese encephalitis virus and Zika virus). Intense research efforts in the past decades uncovered shared fundamental strategies used by flaviviruses to successfully replicate in their respective hosts. However the distinct features contributing to the specific host and tissue tropism as well as the pathological outcomes unique to each individual flavivirus are still largely elusive. The profound footprint of individual viruses on their respective hosts can be investigated using novel technologies in the field of proteomics that have rapidly developed over the last decade. An unprecedented sensitivity and throughput of mass spectrometers combined with the development of new sample preparation and bioinformatics analysis methods have made the systematic investigation of virus–host interactions possible. Furthermore the ability to assess dynamic alterations in protein abundances protein turnover rates and post-translational modifications occurring in infected cells now offer the unique possibility to unravel complex viral perturbations induced in the infected host. In this review we discuss the most recent contributions of mass spectrometry–based proteomic approaches in flavivirus biology with a special focus on Zika virus and their basic and translational potential and implications in understanding and characterizing host responses to arboviral infections.  ,
PMC6784050,2-part\_summary\abstracts\14_17_abstract.xml,   The unprecedented outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in the Americas from 2015 to 2017 prompted the publication of a large body of vector competence data in a relatively short period of time. Although differences in vector competence as a result of disparities in mosquito populations and viral strains are to be expected the limited competence of many populations of the urban mosquito vector    Aedes aegypti from the Americas (when its susceptibility is viewed relative to other circulating/reemerging mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue (DENV) yellow fever (YFV) and chikungunya viruses (CHIKV)) has proven a paradox for the field. This has been further complicated by the lack of standardization in the methodologies utilized in laboratory vector competence experiments precluding meta-analyses of this large data set. As the calls for the standardization of such studies continue to grow in number it is critical to examine the elements of vector competence experimental design. Herein we review the various techniques and considerations intrinsic to vector competence studies with respect to contemporary findings for ZIKV as well as historical findings for other arboviruses and discuss potential avenues of standardization going forward.    ,
PMC6784101,2-part\_summary\abstracts\15_18_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the family Togaviridae has recently emerged in the Americas from lineages from two continents: Asia and Africa. Historically CHIKV circulated as at least four lineages worldwide with both enzootic and epidemic transmission cycles. To understand the recent patterns of emergence and the current status of the CHIKV spread updated analyses of the viral genetic data and metadata are needed. Here we performed phylogenetic and comparative genomics screens of CHIKV genomes taking advantage of the public availability of many recently sequenced isolates. Based on these new data and analyses we derive a revised phylogeny from nucleotide sequences in coding regions. Using this phylogeny we uncover the presence of several distinct lineages in Africa that were previously considered a single one. In parallel we performed thermodynamic modeling of CHIKV untranslated regions (UTRs) which revealed evolutionarily conserved structured and unstructured RNA elements in the 3’UTR. We provide evidence for duplication events in recently emerged American isolates of the Asian CHIKV lineage and propose the existence of a flexible 3’UTR architecture among different CHIKV lineages.  ,
PMC6784384,2-part\_summary\abstracts\16_19_abstract.xml,   Licensure of a vaccine to protect against aerosolized Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) requires use of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule to assess vaccine efficacy as human studies are not feasible or ethical. An approach to selecting VEEV challenge strains for use under the Animal Rule was developed taking into account Department of Defense (DOD) vaccine requirements FDA Animal Rule guidelines strain availability and lessons learned from the generation of filovirus challenge agents within the Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group (FANG). Initial down-selection to VEEV IAB and IC epizootic varieties was based on the DOD objective for vaccine protection in a bioterrorism event. The subsequent down-selection of VEEV IAB and IC isolates was based on isolate availability origin virulence culture and animal passage history known disease progression in animal models relevancy to human disease and ability to generate sufficient challenge material. Methods for the propagation of viral stocks (use of uncloned (wild-type) plaque-cloned versus cDNA-cloned virus) to minimize variability in the potency of the resulting challenge materials were also reviewed. The presented processes for VEEV strain selection and the propagation of viral stocks may serve as a template for animal model development product testing under the Animal Rule to other viral vaccine programs. This manuscript is based on the culmination of work presented at the “Alphavirus Workshop” organized and hosted by the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) on 15 December 2014 at Fort Detrick Maryland USA.  ,
PMC6785879,2-part\_summary\abstracts\17_13_abstract.xml,   In Autumn 2011 nonspecific clinical signs of pyrexia diarrhoea and drop in milk yield were observed in dairy cattle near the German town of Schmallenberg at the Dutch/German border. Targeted veterinary diagnostic investigations for classical endemic and emerging viruses could not identify a causal agent. Blood samples were collected from animals with clinical signs and subjected to metagenomic analysis; a novel orthobunyavirus was identified and named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). In late 2011/early 2012 an epidemic of abortions and congenital malformations in calves lambs and goat kids characterised by arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly were reported in continental Europe. Subsequently SBV RNA was confirmed in both aborted and congenitally malformed foetuses and also in    Culicoides species biting midges. It soon became evident that SBV was an arthropod-borne teratogenic virus affecting domestic ruminants. SBV rapidly achieved a pan-European distribution with most countries confirming SBV infection within a year or two of the initial emergence. The first Irish case of SBV was confirmed in the south of the country in late 2012 in a bovine foetus.    Since SBV was first identified in 2011 a considerable body of scientific research has been conducted internationally describing this novel emerging virus. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive synopsis of the most up-to-date scientific literature regarding the origin of SBV and the spread of the Schmallenberg epidemic in addition to describing the species affected clinical signs pathogenesis transmission risk factors impact diagnostics surveillance methods and control measures. This review also highlights current knowledge gaps in the scientific literature regarding SBV most notably the requirement for further research to determine if and to what extent SBV circulation occurred in Europe and internationally during 2017 and 2018. Moreover recommendations are also made regarding future arbovirus surveillance in Europe specifically the establishment of a European-wide sentinel herd surveillance program which incorporates bovine serology and    Culicoides entomology and virology studies at national and international level to monitor for the emergence and re-emergence of arboviruses such as SBV bluetongue virus and other novel    Culicoides-borne arboviruses.    ,
PMC6787251,2-part\_summary\abstracts\18_13_abstract.xml,   The current leading Zika vaccine candidates in clinical testing are based on live or killed virus platforms which have safety issues especially in pregnant women. Zika subunit vaccines however have shown poor performance in preclinical studies most likely because the antigens tested do not display critical quaternary structure epitopes present on Zika E protein homodimers that cover the surface of the virus. Here we produce stable recombinant E protein homodimers that are recognized by strongly neutralizing Zika specific monoclonal antibodies. In mice the dimeric antigen stimulate strongly neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes that are similar to epitopes recognized by human antibodies following natural Zika virus infection. The monomer antigen stimulates low levels of E-domain III targeting neutralizing antibodies. In a Zika challenge model only E dimer antigen stimulates protective antibodies not the monomer. These results highlight the importance of mimicking the highly structured flavivirus surface when designing subunit vaccines.  ,

PMC6789482,2-part\_summary\abstracts\22_16_abstract.xml,   In the 1970s–1980s a striking increase in the number of disseminated human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections occurred in immunosuppressed patient populations. Autopsy findings documented the in vivo disseminated infection (besides fibroblasts) of epithelial cells endothelial cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. As a result multiple diagnostic assays such as quantification of HCMV antigenemia (pp65) viremia (infectious virus) and DNAemia (HCMV DNA) in patient blood were developed. In vitro experiments showed that only low passage or endothelial cell-passaged clinical isolates and not laboratory-adapted strains could reproduce both HCMV leuko- and endothelial cell-tropism which were found through genetic analysis to require the three viral genes UL128 UL130 and UL131 of the HCMV UL128 locus (UL128L). Products of this locus together with gH/gL were shown to form the gH/gL/pUL128L pentamer complex (PC) required for infection of epithelial cells/endothelial cells whereas gH/gL and gO form the gH/gL/gO trimer complex (TC) required for infection of all cell types. In 2016 following previous work a receptor for the TC that mediates entry into fibroblasts was identified as PDGFRα while in 2018 a receptor for the PC that mediates entry into endothelial/epithelial cells was identified as neuropilin2 (Nrp2). Furthermore the olfactory receptor family member OR14I1 was recently identified as a possible additional receptor for the PC in epithelial cells. Thus current data support two models of viral entry: (i) in fibroblasts following interaction of PDGFRα with TC the latter activates gB to fuse the virus envelope with the cell membrane whereas (ii) in epithelial cells/endothelial cells interaction of Nrp2 (and OR14I1) with PC promotes endocytosis of virus particles followed by gB activation by gH/gL/gO (or gH/gL) and final low-pH entry into the cell.  ,

In 2015 it was introduced in Brazil causing an important social and sanitary alarm due to its increased virulence and rapid dissemination. Importantly ZIKV infections have been associated with severe neurological complications such as Guillain–Barré syndrome and microcephaly in fetuses and newborns. Although enormous efforts were made by investigators in the development of effective countermeasures against ZIKV there is still no approved specific antiviral drug for the treatment of ZIKV infections.

Among the many roadblocks to achieve this goal the high antigenic diversity of the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) is one of the most important and challenging to overcome. The recent development of broadly neutralizing antibodies has considerably improved our knowledge on Env structure and its interplay with neutralizing antibodies. This review aims at highlighting how the genetic diversity of HIV-1 thwarts current and possibly future vaccine developments.

PMC6789677,2-part\_summary\abstracts\26_20_abstract.xml,   Current seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines are strain-specific and require annual reconstitution to accommodate the viral mutations. Mismatches between the vaccines and circulating strains often lead to high morbidity. Hence development of a universal influenza A vaccine targeting all IAV strains is urgently needed. In the present study the protective efficacy and immune responses induced by the extracellular domain of Matrix 2 protein (M2e) displayed on the virus-like particles of    Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (NvC-M2ex3) were investigated in BALB/c mice. NvC-M2ex3 was demonstrated to be highly immunogenic even in the absence of adjuvants. Higher anti-M2e antibody titers corresponded well with increased survival reduced immunopathology and morbidity of the infected BALB/c mice. The mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 exhibited lower H1N1 and H3N2 virus replication in the respiratory tract and the vaccine activated the production of different antiviral cytokines when they were challenged with H1N1 and H3N2. Collectively these results suggest that NvC-M2ex3 could be a potential universal influenza A vaccine.    ,
PMC6789833,2-part\_summary\abstracts\27_15_abstract.xml,   Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arthropod-borne virus of major public health concern. ZIKV infection is responsible for congenital Zika disease and other neurological defects. Antibody-mediated virus neutralization is an essential component of protective antiviral immunity against ZIKV. In the present study we assessed whether our GFP reporter ZIKV derived from African viral strain MR766 could be useful for the development of a flow cytometry neutralization test (FNT) as an alternative to the conventional plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). To improve the efficacy of GFP-expressing MR766 we selected virus variant MR766   GFP showing a high level of GFP signal in infected cells. A MR766   GFP-based FNT was assayed with immune sera from adult mice that received ZIKBeHMR-2. The chimeric ZIKV clone ZIKBeHMR-2 comprises the structural protein region of epidemic strain BeH819015 into MR766 backbone. We reported that adult mice inoculated with ZIKBeHMR-2 developed high levels of neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibodies. Comparative analysis between MR766   GFP-based FNT and conventional PRNT was performed using mouse anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera. Indistinguishable neutralization patterns were observed when compared with PRNT   50 and FNT   50.

ZIKV is usually transmitted by mosquitoes bites but may also be transmitted by blood transfusion via the maternal–foetal route and sexually. After 2015 when the most extensive outbreak of ZIKV had occurred in Brazil and subsequently spread throughout the rest of South America it became evident that ZIKV infection during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with microcephaly and other neurological complications in newborns. As a result the development of a vaccine against ZIKV became an urgent goal. A major issue with DENV vaccines and therefore likely also with ZIKV vaccines is the induction of antibodies that fail to neutralize the virus properly and cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the infection instead. It has previously been shown that antibodies against the third domain of the envelope protein (EDIII) induces optimally neutralizing antibodies with no evidence for ADE for other viral strains. Therefore we generated a ZIKV vaccine based on the EDIII domain displayed on the immunologically optimized    Cucumber mosaic virus (CuMVtt) derived virus-like particles (VLPs) formulated in dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (DOPS) as adjuvant. The vaccine induced high levels of specific IgG after a single injection. The antibodies were able to neutralise ZIKV without enhancing infection by DENV in vitro. Thus the here described vaccine based on EDIII displayed on VLPs was able to stimulate production of antibodies specifically neutralizing ZIKV without potentially enhancing disease caused by DENV.    ,

Recent modelling studies suggest that investing in the global elimination of viral hepatitis is feasible and cost‐effective. In 2016 all 194 member states of the World Health Organization endorsed the goal to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 but complex systemic and social realities hamper implementation efforts. This paper presents eight case studies from a diverse range of countries that have invested in responses to viral hepatitis and adopted innovative approaches to tackle their respective epidemics. Based on an investment framework developed to build a global investment case for the elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030 national activities and key enablers are highlighted that showcase the feasibility and impact of concerted hepatitis responses across a range of settings with different levels of available resources and infrastructural development. These case studies demonstrate the utility of taking a multipronged public health approach to: (a) evidence‐gathering and planning; (b) implementation; and (c) integration of viral hepatitis services into the Agenda for Sustainable Development. They provide models for planning investment and implementation strategies for other countries facing similar challenges and resource constraints.  ,
PMC6790760,2-part\_summary\abstracts\30_24_abstract.xml,   Variation in disease incidence in wildlife is often assumed to reflect environmental or demographic changes acting on an endemic pathogen. However apparent endemicity might instead arise from spatial processes that are challenging to identify from traditional data sources including time series and field studies. Here we analysed longitudinal sequence data collected from rabies virus outbreaks over 14 years in Costa Rica a Central American country that has recorded continuous vampire bat-transmitted rabies outbreaks in humans and livestock since 1985. We identified five phylogenetically distinct lineages which shared most recent common ancestors with viruses from North and South America. Bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions supported bidirectional viral dispersals involving countries to the north and south of Costa Rica at different time points. Within Costa Rica viruses showed little contemporaneous spatial overlap and no lineage was detected across all years of surveillance. Statistical models suggested that lineage disappearances were more likely to be explained by viral extinctions than undetected viral circulation. Our results highlight the importance of international viral dispersal for shaping the burden of rabies in Costa Rica suggest a Central American corridor of rabies virus invasions between continents and show that apparent disease endemicity may arise through recurrent pathogen extinctions and reinvasions which can be readily detected in relatively small datasets by joining phylodynamic and modelling approaches.  ,
PMC6792355,2-part\_summary\abstracts\31_16_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus that emerged in the Americas in 2013. Infection with CHIKV is symptomatic in most of the cases and patients can develop chronic arthralgia that lasts from months to years in over 40% of the cases. The East-Central-South Africa (ECSA) genotype was introduced in Brazil in 2014 in Bahia State. Here we report the circulation of the CHIKV ECSA genotype in Piaui State Northeast Brazil during the years 2016-2017. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a single introduction of this lineage probably in 2015 and its maintenance at least until 2017. This analysis has also demonstrated the proximity of this genotype with isolates from neighboring States and its partial nucleotide sequence of the viral E1 gene revealed a synapomorphy synonyms. This finding highlights the spread of the ECSA genotype in Brazil and supports its circulation in the Brazilian Northeast.  ,

Here we develop modelling methods that capture elements of each of these factors to predict the risk of Ebola virus disease (EVD) across time and space. Our modelling results match previously-observed outbreak patterns with high accuracy and suggest further outbreaks could occur across most of West and Central Africa. Trends in the underlying drivers of EVD risk suggest a 1.75 to 3.2-fold increase in the endemic rate of animal-human viral spill-overs in Africa by 2070 given current modes of healthcare intervention. Future global change scenarios with higher human population growth and lower rates of socio-economic development yield a 1.63-fold higher likelihood of epidemics occurring as a result of spill-over events. Our modelling framework can be used to target interventions designed to reduce epidemic risk for many zoonotic diseases.  ,

PMC6795694,2-part\_summary\abstracts\36_14_abstract.xml,   There is an unmet public health need for a universal influenza vaccine (UIV) to provide broad and durable protection from influenza virus infections. The identification of broadly protective antibodies and cross-reactive T cells directed to influenza viral targets present a promising prospect for the development of a UIV. Multiple targets for cross-protection have been identified in the stalk and head of hemagglutinin (HA) to develop a UIV. Recently neuraminidase (NA) has received significant attention as a critical component for increasing the breadth of protection. The HA stalk-based approaches have shown promising results of broader protection in animal studies and their feasibility in humans are being evaluated in clinical trials. Mucosal immune responses and cross-reactive T cell immunity across influenza A and B viruses intrinsic to live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) have emerged as essential features to be incorporated into a UIV. Complementing the weakness of the stand-alone approaches prime-boost vaccination combining HA stalk and LAIV is under clinical evaluation with the aim to increase the efficacy and broaden the spectrum of protection. Preexisting immunity in humans established by prior exposure to influenza viruses may affect the hierarchy and magnitude of immune responses elicited by an influenza vaccine limiting the interpretation of preclinical data based on naive animals necessitating human challenge studies. A consensus is yet to be achieved on the spectrum of protection efficacy target population and duration of protection to define a “universal” vaccine. This review discusses the recent advancements in the development of UIVs rationales behind cross-protection and vaccine designs and challenges faced in obtaining balanced protection potency a wide spectrum of protection and safety relevant to UIVs.  ,
PMC6797215,2-part\_summary\abstracts\37_25_abstract.xml,   The case-fatality rate of yellow fever virus (YFV) is one of the highest among arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Although historically the Asia-Pacific region has remained free of YFV the risk of introduction has never been higher due to the increasing influx of people from endemic regions and the recent outbreaks in Africa and South America. Singapore is a global hub for trade and tourism and therefore at high risk for YFV introduction. Effective control of the main domestic mosquito vector    Aedes aegypti in Singapore has failed to prevent re-emergence of dengue chikungunya and Zika viruses in the last two decades raising suspicions that peridomestic mosquito species untargeted by domestic vector control measures may contribute to arbovirus transmission. Here we provide empirical evidence that the peridomestic mosquito    Aedes malayensis found in Singapore can transmit YFV. Our laboratory mosquito colony recently derived from wild    Ae.    malayensis in Singapore was experimentally competent for YFV to a similar level as    Ae.    aegypti controls. In addition we captured    Ae.    malayensis females in one human-baited trap during three days of collection providing preliminary evidence that host-vector contact may occur in field conditions. Finally we detected    Ae.    malayensis eggs in traps deployed in high-rise building areas of Singapore. We conclude that    Ae.    malayensis is a competent vector of YFV and re-emphasize that vector control methods should be extended to target peridomestic vector species.    ,

Historically the Asia-Pacific region has remained free of yellow fever but the ever increasing influx of travelers puts places such as Singapore at unprecedented risk of yellow fever virus introduction. The present study characterized the potential contribution of a mosquito species called    Aedes malayensis to yellow fever virus transmission in Singapore.    Aedes malayensis breeds in urban parks of Singapore and is suspected to have participated in the resurgence of other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue because it is not targeted by current mosquito control measures. Not only was    Ae.    malayensis able to experimentally acquire and transmit yellow fever virus but it was also found to engage in contact with humans in a field situation. This empirical evidence indicates that    Ae.    malayensis is a competent vector of yellow fever virus and should be targeted by mosquito control programs.    ,

Sporadic human H5 and H7N9 virus infections are also reported in particular regions. To treat influenza patients effectively with antivirals sensitive and broad-reactive influenza rapid diagnostic tests (IRDTs) are required. Here we tested the sensitivity of 23 IRDTs during the 2018–2019 influenza season for their ability to detect H1N1pdm09 H3N2 H5N1 H5N6 H7N9 and Victoria- and Yamagata-lineage type B viruses. All IRDTs detected all influenza A and B viruses tested but with different sensitivities. Several IRDTs detected the H5 and H7 viruses and the seasonal viruses with similar sensitivity. Such IRDTs might be useful for diagnosing patients infected with H5 and H7 viruses.  ,

PMC6798124,2-part\_summary\abstracts\41_20_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Early interactions of influenza A virus (IAV) with respiratory epithelium might determine the outcome of infection. The study of global cellular innate immune responses often masks multiple aspects of the mechanisms by which populations of cells work as organized and heterogeneous systems to defeat virus infection and how the virus counteracts these systems. In this study we experimentally dissected the dynamics of IAV and human epithelial respiratory cell interaction during early infection at the single-cell level. We found that the number of viruses infecting a cell (multiplicity of infection [MOI]) influences the magnitude of virus antagonism of the host innate antiviral response. Infections performed at high MOIs resulted in increased viral gene expression per cell and stronger antagonist effect than infections at low MOIs. In addition single-cell patterns of expression of interferons (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) provided important insights into the contributions of the infected and bystander cells to the innate immune responses during infection. Specifically the expression of multiple ISGs was lower in infected than in bystander cells. In contrast with other IFNs IFN lambda 1 (IFNL1) showed a widespread pattern of expression suggesting a different cell-to-cell propagation mechanism more reliant on paracrine signaling. Finally we measured the dynamics of the antiviral response in primary human epithelial cells which highlighted the importance of early innate immune responses at inhibiting virus spread.     IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen of high importance to public health.

PMC6798183,2-part\_summary\abstracts\42_17_abstract.xml,   Influenza A virus (IAV) has developed elegant strategies to utilize cellular proteins and pathways to promote replication and evade the host antiviral response. Identification of these sabotaged host factors could increase the number of potential antiviral drug targets. Here IAV A/PR/8/34 (PR8)- and A/California/04/2009-infected A549 and 293T cells displayed differential virus replication. To determine the host cellular responses of A549 and 293T cells to IAV infection RNA-seq was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Our data revealed that IAV-infected A549 cells activated stronger virus-sensing signals and highly expressed cytokines which play significant roles in initiating the innate immune and inflammatory responses. In addition IAV-infected 293T cells displayed weak immune signaling and cytokine production. Remarkably IL-17A and associated genes were highly enriched in IAV-infected 293T cells. Furthermore IL-17A can partially facilitate A549 cell infection by the PR8 strain and PR8-infected IL-17A knock-out mice consistently exhibited decreased weight loss and reduced lung immunopathology as compared to controls. This work uncovered the differential responses of cells infected with two H1N1 IAV strains and the potential roles of IL-17A in modulating virus infection.  ,

HFMD outbreak can result in a substantial pediatric hospitalization and burden the healthcare services especially in less-developed countries. Since the initial epidemic of predominantly EV-A71 in California in 1969 the high prevalence of HFMD in the Asia-pacific region and elsewhere around the world represents a significant morbidity in this age group. With the advent of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools there has been a dramatic increase in the number of laboratory-confirmed EV-A71 infection over the past two decades. The population cultural and socioeconomic diversity among countries in the Asia-Pacific region all influence the transmission and morbidity associated with HFMD. This review summarizes the current state of epidemiology of EV-A71 in Asia-Pacific countries based on the most recent epidemiological data and available information on the prevalence and disease burden. This knowledge is important in guiding the prevention control and future research on vaccine development of this highly contagious disease of significant socioeconomic implications in public health.  ,

In addition to causing seasonal epidemics influenza viruses can cause pandemics at random intervals which are very hard to predict. Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing the spread of influenza infection. However seasonal vaccination is ineffective against pandemic influenza viruses because of antigenic differences and it takes approximately six months from isolation of a new virus to develop an effective vaccine. One of the possible ways to fight the emergence of pandemics may be by using a new type of vaccine with a long and broad spectrum of action. The extracellular domain of the M2 protein (M2e) of influenza A virus is a conservative region and an attractive target for a universal influenza vaccine. This review gives a historical overview of the study of M2 protein and summarizes the latest developments in the preparation of M2e-based universal influenza vaccines.  ,

PCR has been approved as the best standard method to diagnose viral conjunctivitis. This study was conducted to investigate epidemiological patterns of conjunctivitis in Hamadan west Iran. In addition the frequency of the most important cause of infectious conjunctivitis diagnosed by PCR and its seasonal variations and association with certain socioeconomic and health factors were studied.       Methods   In this cross-sectional study 125 patients with suspected viral conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis in Hamadan west Iran from July 2016 to June 2017 were examined for the presence of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) HSV2 varicella-zoster virus (VZV) adenovirus. and     Chlamydia trachomatis using multiplex real-time PCR.          Results   Adenoviruses were the most prevalent pathogens (94.4%). HSV1 was found in two (1.6%) patients. HSV2 VZV and     C. trachomatis were not seen in any patients. There was no difference in acquisition of conjunctivitis between men and women. A total of 55 (44%) patients attended the clinics in summer.          Conclusion   This study demonstrated that adenoviruses were a much more common viral cause of conjunctivitis in the studied region compared to findings in other regions. In addition the acquisition rate of eye infection is expected to decrease dramatically in this region through control of adenoviruses. Demographic variables ie age sex and income level were not significantly associated with acquisition of viral infection.    ,

Data on population susceptibility to emerging influenza virus strains during the interepidemic period can guide planning for resource allocation of an upcoming influenza season. This study sought to assess the population susceptibility to representative emerging influenza virus strains collected during the interepidemic period. The microneutralisation antibody titers (MN titers) of a human serum panel against representative emerging influenza strains collected during the interepidemic period before the 2018/2019 winter influenza season (H1N1-inter and H3N2-inter) were compared with those against influenza strains representative of previous epidemics (H1N1-pre and H3N2-pre). A multifaceted approach incorporating both genetic and antigenic data was used in selecting these representative influenza virus strains for the MN assay. A significantly higher proportion of individuals had a ⩾four-fold reduction in MN titers between H1N1-inter and H1N1-pre than that between H3N2-inter and H3N2-pre (28.5% (127/445)    vs. 4.9% (22/445)    P &lt; 0.001). The geometric mean titer (GMT) of H1N1-inter was significantly lower than that of H1N1-pre (381 (95% CI 339–428)    vs. 713 (95% CI 641–792)    P &lt; 0.001) while there was no significant difference in the GMT between H3N2-inter and H3N2-pre. Since A(H1N1) predominated the 2018–2019 winter influenza epidemic our results corroborated the epidemic subtype.    ,

We studied the epidemic characteristics of HCV in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Serum from 894 HIV-1 patients was collected together with basic information and biochemical features. All samples were infected with HIV through injecting drug users (IDUs) and sexual transmission (ST). The    NS5B gene was amplified and sequenced to affirm HCV genotype. In total 202 HIV patients were co-infected with HCV and most (81.19%) of co-infected patients were IDUs. Genotype 3b was predominant (37.62%) in these samples and its frequency was similar in patients with IDU and ST. The frequencies of genotypes 1a 1b 3a 6a 6n 2a and 6u were 3.96% 16.34% 23.76% 6.93% 10.40% 0.50% and 0.50% respectively. However genotype 3a showed significantly different frequency in HCV patients with IDU and ST (   P = 0.019). When HCV patients were divided into subgroups the haemoglobin (HGB) level was significantly higher in patients with genotype 3a than in patients with 3b (   P = 0.033) 6a (   P = 0.006) and 6n (   P = 0.007) respectively. Although no difference existed among HCV subgroups HIV-viral load was identified to be positively correlated with the HGB level and CD4   + cells when dividing HCV/HIV co-infected persons into male and female groups. In conclusion genotype 3b was the predominant HCV genotype in Yunnan HIV/HCV co-infected persons. The HGB level was higher in patients with genotype 3a than others. HIV-viral load was positively correlated with the HGB level and CD4   + cells in the male or female HCV-infected group.    ,
PMC6805938,2-part\_summary\abstracts\49_13_abstract.xml,   Pathogens can spread epidemically through populations. Beneficial contagions such as viruses that enhance host survival or technological innovations that improve quality of life also have the potential to spread epidemically. How do the dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics differ from those of detrimental epidemics? We investigate this question using a breadth-first modeling approach involving three distinct theoretical models. First in the context of population genetics we show that a horizontally-transmissible element that increases fitness such as viral DNA spreads superexponentially through a population more quickly than a beneficial mutation. Second in the context of behavioral epidemiology we show that infections that cause increased connectivity lead to superexponential fixation in the population. Third in the context of dynamic social networks we find that preferences for increased global infection accelerate spread and produce superexponential fixation but preferences for local assortativity halt epidemics by disconnecting the infected from the susceptible. We conclude that the dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics are characterized by the rapid spread of beneficial elements which is facilitated in biological systems by horizontal transmission and in social systems by active spreading behavior of infected individuals.  ,

Most infections are associated with flu-like symptoms but paralysis may develop in young children. It has been suggested that infection only with recent viral isolates can cause paralysis. To address the hypothesis that EV-D68 has recently acquired neurotropism murine organotypic brain slice cultures induced human motor neurons and astrocytes and mice lacking the alpha/beta interferon receptor were infected with multiple virus isolates. All EV-D68 isolates from 1962 to the present can infect neural cells astrocytes and neurons. Furthermore our results show that sialic acid binding does not play a role in EV-D68 neuropathogenesis. The study of EV-D68 infection in organotypic brain slice cultures induced motor neurons and astrocytes will allow for the elucidation of the mechanism by which the virus infection causes disease.  ,
PMC6805996,2-part\_summary\abstracts\51_17_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious illness of the nervous system specifically affecting the gray matter of the spinal cord motor-controlling regions of the brain and cranial nerves. Most cases of AFM are pathogen associated typically with poliovirus and enterovirus infections and occur in children under the age of 6 years. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was first isolated from children with pneumonia in 1962 but an association with AFM was not observed until the 2014 outbreak. Organotypic mouse brain slice cultures generated from postnatal day 1 to 10 mice and adult    ifnar knockout mice were used to determine if neurotropism of EV-D68 is shared among virus isolates. All isolates replicated in organotypic mouse brain slice cultures and three isolates replicated in primary murine astrocyte cultures. All four EV-D68 isolates examined caused paralysis and death in adult    ifnar knockout mice. In contrast no viral disease was observed after intracranial inoculation of wild-type mice. Six of the seven EV-D68 isolates including two from 1962 and four from the 2014 outbreak replicated in induced human neurons and all of the isolates replicated in induced human astrocytes. Furthermore a putative viral receptor sialic acid is not required for neurotropism of EV-D68 as viruses replicated within neurons and astrocytes independent of binding to sialic acid. These observations demonstrate that EV-D68 is neurotropic independent of its genetic lineage and can infect both neurons and astrocytes and that neurotropism is not a recently acquired characteristic as has been suggested. Furthermore the results show that in mice the innate immune response is critical for restricting EV-D68 disease.    ,

PMC6812269,2-part\_summary\abstracts\54_24_abstract.xml,   Emerging zoonoses caused by previously unknown agents are one of the most important challenges for human health because of their inherent inability to be predictable conversely to emergences caused by previously known agents that could be targeted by routine surveillance programs. Emerging zoonotic infections either originate from increasing contacts between wildlife and human populations or from the geographical expansion of hematophagous arthropods that act as vectors this latter being more capable to impact large-scale human populations. While characterizing the viral communities from candidate vectors in high-risk geographical areas is a necessary initial step the need to identify which viruses are able to spill over and those restricted to their hosts has recently emerged. We hypothesized that currently unknown tick-borne arboviruses could silently circulate in specific biotopes where mammals are highly exposed to tick bites and implemented a strategy that combined high-throughput sequencing with broad-range serological techniques to both identify novel arboviruses and tick-specific viruses in a ticks/mammals interface in Thailand. The virome of Thai ticks belonging to the    Rhipicephalus Amblyomma Dermacentor Hyalomma and    Haemaphysalis genera identified numerous viruses among which several viruses could be candidates for future emergence as regards to their phylogenetic relatedness with known tick-borne arboviruses. Luciferase immunoprecipitation system targeting external viral proteins of viruses identified among the    Orthomyxoviridae Phenuiviridae Flaviviridae Rhabdoviridae and    Chuviridae families was used to screen human and cattle Thai populations highly exposed to tick bites. Although no positive serum was detected for any of the six viruses selected suggesting that these viruses are not infecting these vertebrates or at very low prevalence (upper estimate 0.017% and 0.047% in humans and cattle respectively) the virome of Thai ticks presents an extremely rich viral diversity among which novel tick-borne arboviruses are probably hidden and could pose a public health concern if they emerge. The strategy developed in this pilot study starting from the inventory of viral communities of hematophagous arthropods to end by the identification of viruses able (or likely unable) to infect vertebrates is the first step in the prediction of putative new emergences and could easily be transposed to other reservoirs/vectors/susceptible hosts interfaces.    ,

Using nucleoprotein (NP) and extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (   M2e) genes from the influenza A virus A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2) we constructed four recombinant vaccinia virus-based influenza vaccines carrying NP fused with one or four copies of M2e genes in different orders. The recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to immunize BALB/C mice. Humoral and cellular responses were measured and then the immunized mice were challenged with the influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8). NP-specific humoral response was elicited in mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying full-length NP while robust M2e-specific humoral response was elicited only in the mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying multiple copies of M2e. All recombinant viruses elicited NP- and M2e-specific cellular immune responses in mice. Only immunization with RVJ-4M2eNP induced remarkably higher levels of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines specific to M2e. Furthermore RVJ-4M2eNP immunization provided the highest cross-protection in mice challenged with 20 MLD   50 of PR8. Therefore the cross-protection potentially correlates with both NP and M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by RVJ-4M2eNP which expresses a fusion antigen of full-length NP preceded by four M2e repeats. These results suggest that the rational fusion of NP and multiple M2e antigens is critical toward inducing protective immune responses and the 4M2eNP fusion antigen may be employed to develop a universal influenza vaccine.       Electronic supplementary material   The online version of this article (10.1007/s12250-019-00138-9) contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.    ,
PMC6815955,2-part\_summary\abstracts\56_21_abstract.xml,   Influenza poses a severe threat to human health in the world. However developing a universal anti-viral strategy has remained challenging due to the presence of diverse subtypes as well as its high mutation rate resulting in antigenic shift and drift. Here we developed an antiviral strategy using iron oxide nanozymes (IONzymes) to target the lipid envelope of the influenza virus.     Methods: We evaluated the antiviral activities of our IONzymes using a hemagglutination assay together with a 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID   50) method. Lipid peroxidation of the viral envelope was analyzed using a maleic dialdehyde (MDA) assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The neighboring viral proteins were detected by western blotting.       Results: We show that IONzymes induce envelope lipid peroxidation and destroy the integrity of neighboring proteins including hemagglutinin neuraminidase and matrix protein 1 causing the inactivation of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Furthermore we show that our IONzymes possess a broad-spectrum antiviral activity on 12 subtypes of IAVs (H1~H12). Lastly we demonstrate that applying IONzymes to a facemask improves the ability of virus protection against 3 important subtypes that pose a threat to human including H1N1 H5N1 and H7N9 subtype.       Conclusion: Together our results clearly demonstrate that IONzymes can catalyze lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope to inactivate enveloped viruses and provide protection from viral transmission and infection.    ,
PMC6816385,2-part\_summary\abstracts\57_14_abstract.xml,      Background   The classification of hepatitis viruses still predominantly relies on ad hoc criteria i.e. phenotypic traits and arbitrary genetic distance thresholds. Given the subjectivity of such practices coupled with the constant sequencing of samples and discovery of new strains this manual approach to virus classification becomes cumbersome and impossible to generalize.       Methods   Using two well-studied hepatitis virus datasets HBV and HCV we assess if computational methods for molecular species delimitation that are typically applied to barcoding biodiversity studies can also be successfully deployed for hepatitis virus classification. For comparison we also used ABGD a tool that in contrast to other distance methods attempts to automatically identify the barcoding gap using pairwise genetic distances for a set of aligned input sequences.       Results—Discussion   We found that the mPTP species delimitation tool identified even without adapting its default parameters taxonomic clusters that either correspond to the currently acknowledged genotypes or to known subdivision of genotypes (subtypes or subgenotypes). In the cases where the delimited cluster corresponded to subtype or subgenotype there were previous concerns that their status may be underestimated. The clusters obtained from the ABGD analysis differed depending on the parameters used. However under certain values the results were very similar to the taxonomy and mPTP which indicates the usefulness of distance based methods in virus taxonomy under appropriate parameter settings. The overlap of predicted clusters with taxonomically acknowledged genotypes implies that virus classification can be successfully automated.    ,
PMC6816401,2-part\_summary\abstracts\58_18_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  West Nile virus (WNV) is a widely spread human pathogenic arthropod-borne virus. It can lead to severe sometimes fatal neurological disease. Over the last two decades several vaccine candidates for the protection of humans from WNV have been developed. Some technologies were transferred into clinical testing but these approaches have not yet led to a licensed product. This review summarizes the current status of a human WNV vaccine and discusses reasons for the lack of clinically advanced product candidates. It also discusses the problem of immunological cross-reactivity between flaviviruses and how it can be addressed during vaccine development.  ,
PMC6816430,2-part\_summary\abstracts\59_18_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Being vigilant of the potential for an influenza pandemic the Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines (GAP) promoted the establishment and maintenance of local vaccine manufacturing capacity. In accordance with this the Thai government has developed its national strategic plan for influenza pandemic preparedness including the plan for manufacturing influenza vaccine in Thailand. With the support of WHO the Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) as the developed local production capacity of influenza vaccines. The H1N1 live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and H5N2 LAIV produced by GPO have been proven to be safe and immunogenic through clinical trials followed by Thai FDA licensure for pandemic use. The GPO-produced H5N2 LAIV has been proven to have priming effects on an inactivated subunit H5N1 booster vaccine. This Thai local manufacturer is now expanding its capacity to Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) aiming for sustainable influenza vaccine production for national coverage.  ,
PMC6818521,2-part\_summary\abstracts\60_23_abstract.xml,      Objectives   The common cold is the main cause of medical time loss in elite sport. Rapid diagnosis has been a challenge that may be amenable to molecular point-of-care testing (POCT).       Methods   We performed a prospective observational study of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. There were 44 elite athletes and 68 staff members. The chief physician recorded the symptoms of the common cold daily on a standardised form. Two nasal swabs were taken at the onset of symptoms. One swab was analysed within 45 min using a molecular POCT for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B viruses. After the Games the other swab was tested for 16 possible causative respiratory viruses using PCR in laboratory-based testing.       Results   20 out of 44 (45%) athletes and 22 out of 68 (32%) staff members experienced symptoms of the common cold during a median stay of 21 days. Eleven (26%) samples tested virus-positive using POCT. All subjects with influenza (n=6) and 32 close contacts were treated with oseltamivir. The aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 75% of the athletes and 68 % of the staff members. Seven virus clusters were identified. They were caused by coronaviruses 229E NL63 and OC43 influenza B virus respiratory syncytial virus A rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus. The virus infections spread readily within the team most commonly within the same sport discipline.       Conclusions   The cold was indeed a common illness in Team Finland during the Winter Olympic Games. POCT proved to be clinically valuable especially for influenza. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in most cases.    ,

PMC6821451,2-part\_summary\abstracts\62_21_abstract.xml,   Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus has been shown to inhibit the innate immune response by blocking the induction of interferon (IFN). In this study we isolated two single-stranded RNA aptamers specific to NS1 with    K       d    values of 1.62 ± 0.30 nM and 1.97 ± 0.27 nM respectively using a systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. The selected aptamers were able to inhibit the interaction of NS1 with tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) and suppression of NS1 enabled retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) to be ubiquitinated regularly by TRIM25. Additional luciferase reporter assay and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments demonstrated that suppression of NS1 by the selected aptamers induced IFN production. It is noted that viral replication was also inhibited through IFN induction in the presence of the selected aptamers. These results suggest that the isolated aptamers are strongly expected to be new therapeutic agents against influenza infection.    ,
PMC6822366,2-part\_summary\abstracts\63_13_abstract.xml,   Prior to the emergence of H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) and the latest avian-origin H3N2 CIV there was no evidence of a circulating canine-specific influenza virus. Molecular and epidemiological evidence suggest that H3N8 CIV emerged from H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV). This host-range shift of EIV from equine to canine hosts and its subsequent establishment as an enzootic CIV is unique because this host-range shift was from one mammalian host to another. To further understand this host-range shift we conducted a comprehensive phylodynamic analysis using all the available whole-genome sequences of H3N8 CIV. We found that (1) the emergence of H3N8 CIV from H3N8 EIV occurred in approximately 2002; (2) this interspecies transmission was by a reassortant virus of the circulating Florida-1 clade H3N8 EIV; (3) once in the canine species H3N8 CIV spread efficiently and remained an enzootic virus; (4) H3N8 CIV evolved and diverged into multiple clades or sublineages with intra and inter-lineage reassortment. Our results provide a framework to understand the molecular basis of host-range shifts of influenza viruses and that dogs are potential “mixing vessels” for the establishment of novel influenza viruses.  ,
PMC6822705,2-part\_summary\abstracts\64_22_abstract.xml,   It has been 20 years since West Nile virus first emerged in the Americas and since then little progress has been made to control outbreaks caused by this virus. After its first detection in New York in 1999 West Nile virus quickly spread across the continent causing an epidemic of human disease and massive bird die-offs. Now the virus has become endemic to the United States where an estimated 7 million human infections have occurred making it the leading mosquito-borne virus infection and the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the country. To bring new attention to one of the most important mosquito-borne viruses in the Americas we provide an interactive review using Nextstrain: a visualization tool for real-time tracking of pathogen evolution (   nextstrain.org/WNV/NA). Nextstrain utilizes a growing database of more than 2000 West Nile virus genomes and harnesses the power of phylogenetics for students educators public health workers and researchers to visualize key aspects of virus spread and evolution. Using Nextstrain we use virus genomics to investigate the emergence of West Nile virus in the U S followed by its rapid spread evolution in a new environment establishment of endemic transmission and subsequent international spread. For each figure we include a link to Nextstrain to allow the readers to directly interact with and explore the underlying data in new ways. We also provide a brief online narrative that parallels this review to further explain the data and highlight key epidemiological and evolutionary features (   nextstrain.org/narratives/twenty-years-of-WNV). Mirroring the dynamic nature of outbreaks the Nextstrain links provided within this paper are constantly updated as new West Nile virus genomes are shared publicly helping to stay current with the research. Overall our review showcases how genomics can track West Nile virus spread and evolution as well as potentially uncover novel targeted control measures to help alleviate its public health burden.    ,
PMC6823455,2-part\_summary\abstracts\65_13_abstract.xml,   Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in humans are considered to be mild or subclinical. However during the recent epidemics in the Pacific Islands and the Americas the infection was associated with Quillain-Barré syndrome and congenital infections with fetal brain abnormalities including microcephaly. Thus more detailed understanding of ZIKV-host cell interactions and regulation of innate immune responses by strains of differential evolutionary origin is required. Here we characterized the infection and immune responses triggered by two epidemic Asian/American lineage viruses including an isolate from fetal brains and a historical low passage 1947 African lineage virus in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. The epidemic Asian/American ZIKV replicated well and induced relatively good antiviral responses in human DCs whereas the African strain replicated less efficiently and induced weaker immune responses. In macrophages both the African and Asian strains showed limited replication and relatively weak cytokine gene expression. Interestingly in macrophages we observed host protein degradation especially IRF3 and STAT2 at early phases of infection with both lineage viruses suggesting an early proteasomal activation in phagocytic cells. Our data indicates that ZIKV evolution has led to significant phenotypic differences in the replication characteristics leading to differential regulation of host innate immune responses.  ,

The administration of the R. capsulatus PG lipopolysaccharide was shown to induce interferon-β synthesis both in healthy and influenza A virus-infected mice and to promote production of antiviral antibodies in the blood of the influenza-infected animals.   ,

In this study we describe the occurrence of myxomatosis; and RHD; on commercial rabbitries visited in Spain; between 1988 and 2018. Annual occurrence of myxomatosis decreased over 30 years. Cases of myxomatosis were detected most frequently between August and March; more cases occurring in September and fewer in June. Two important RHD epidemics occurred; the first in 1988–1989 due to classic RHD virus (RHDV) and the second from 2011 to 2013 due to new calicivirus (RHDVb/RHDV2). Monthly occurrence of RHD in 2011–2018 was higher from April to August. Despite seasonal variations of these diseases; we recommend that young breeders and adults should be protected by vaccination all year round; and on-farm hygiene measures implemented       Abstract   In this retrospective study we describe the relative occurrence of clinical myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) on 1714 commercial farms visited in Spain between 1988 and 2018. We determined the annual prevalence based on 817 visits to 394 farms affected by myxomatosis. Myxomatosis was more prevalent from August to March being lowest in June (3%) and highest in September (8.9%). With regard to RHD we assessed 253 visits to 156 affected farms. We analyzed mean annual and monthly incidence. Two important RHD epidemics occurred; the first in 1988–1989 due to RHDV GI.1 (also known as RHDV) and the second from 2011 to 2013 due to RHDV GI.2 (RHDV2 or RHDVb). These epidemics occurred at times when effective vaccination had not been carried out. Relative monthly incidence in 2011–2018 was higher from April to August (    p &lt; 0.001). The results we obtained from 1404 necropsies on 102 farms did not clearly relate serosanguinous nasal discharge in rabbits with disease caused by GI.2 infection. We also assessed vaccination schedules used on 200 doe farms visited from the end of 2014 to 2018; 95.5% vaccinated against myxomatosis and 97.5% against RHD. Both diseases remain prevalent; however effective vaccination has produced a steady decline in myxomatosis and RHDV GI.1 and GI.2 on-farm detection. The maintenance of high hygienic standards will be needed to continue and improve this control. However further studies are required to investigate the causes of sustained virus presence and vaccine breaks.       ,

PMC6832137,2-part\_summary\abstracts\69_16_abstract.xml,   Several notable human diseases are caused by enveloped RNA viruses: Influenza AIDS hepatitis C dengue hemorrhagic fever microcephaly and Guillain–Barré Syndrome. Being enveloped the life cycle of this group of viruses is critically dependent on host lipid biosynthesis. Viral binding and entry involve interactions between viral envelope glycoproteins and cellular receptors localized to lipid-rich regions of the plasma membrane. Subsequent infection by these viruses leads to reorganization of cellular membranes and lipid metabolism to support the production of new viral particles. Recent work has focused on defining the involvement of specific lipid classes in the entry genome replication assembly and viral particle formation of these viruses in hopes of identifying potential therapeutic targets for the treatment or prevention of disease. In this review we will highlight the role of host sphingolipids in the lifecycle of several medically important enveloped RNA viruses.  ,
PMC6832241,2-part\_summary\abstracts\70_19_abstract.xml,   Influenza viruses cause annual seasonal infection across the globe. Vaccination represents the most effective strategy to prevent such infections and/or to reduce viral disease. Two major types of influenza vaccines are approved for human use: inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs). Two Master Donor Virus (MDV) backbones have been used to create LAIVs against influenza A virus (IAV): the United States (US) A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (AA) and the Russian A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (Len) H2N2 viruses. The mutations responsible for the temperature sensitive (   ts) cold-adapted (   ca) and attenuated (   att) phenotypes of the two MDVs have been previously identified and genetically mapped. However a direct comparison of the contribution of these residues to viral attenuation immunogenicity and protection efficacy has not been conducted. Here we compared the In vitro and in vivo phenotype of recombinant influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) viruses containing the    ts ca and    att mutations of the US (PR8/AA) and the Russian (PR8/Len) MDVs. Our results show that PR8/Len is more attenuated in vivo than PR8/AA although both viruses induced similar levels of humoral and cellular responses and protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our findings support the feasibility of using a different virus backbone as MDV for the development of improved LAIVs for the prevention of IAV infections.    ,
PMC6832525,2-part\_summary\abstracts\71_19_abstract.xml,   Yellow fever virus (YFV) represents a re-emerging zoonotic pathogen transmitted by mosquito vectors to humans from primate reservoirs. Sporadic outbreaks of YFV occur in endemic tropical regions causing a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) associated with high mortality rates. Despite a highly effective vaccine no antiviral treatments currently exist. Therefore YFV represents a neglected tropical disease and is chronically understudied with many aspects of YFV biology incompletely defined including host range host–virus interactions and correlates of host immunity and pathogenicity. In this article we review the current state of YFV research focusing on the viral lifecycle host responses to infection species tropism and the success and associated limitations of the YFV-17D vaccine. In addition we highlight the current lack of available treatments and use publicly available sequence and structural data to assess global patterns of YFV sequence diversity and identify potential drug targets. Finally we discuss how technological advances including real-time epidemiological monitoring of outbreaks using next-generation sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 modification of vector species could be utilized in future battles against this re-emerging pathogen which continues to cause devastating disease.  ,
PMC6832697,2-part\_summary\abstracts\72_16_abstract.xml,   For the first 60 years following its isolation Zika virus (ZIKV) remained a relatively poorly described member of the    Flaviviridae family. However since 2007 it has caused a series of increasingly severe outbreaks and is now associated with neurological symptoms such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). A number of reports have improved our understanding of rare complications that may be associated with ZIKV infection in adults the areas of the body to which it spreads and viral persistence in various tissues. Likewise studies on the effect of ZIKV infection during pregnancy have identified risk factors for CZS and the impact this syndrome has on early childhood. Understanding these outcomes and the factors that drive ZIKV pathogenesis are key to developing vaccination and therapeutic approaches to avoid these severe and potentially debilitating symptoms.     ,
PMC6832754,2-part\_summary\abstracts\73_19_abstract.xml,   Human parechovirus (HPeV) particularly type 3 (HPeV3) is an important cause of sepsis-/meningitis-like illness in young infants. Laboratory records identified a total of ten HPeV-positive cases in Southeastern Australia between January and July 2019. The HPeV present in these cases were typed by Sanger sequencing of the partial viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) region and selected cases were further characterised by additional Sanger or Ion Torrent near-full length virus sequencing. In seven of the ten cases an HPeV type 5 (HPeV5) was identified and in the remaining three cases an HPeV type 1 was identified. The HPeV5-positive cases were infants under the age of 3 months admitted to hospital with fever rash lethargy and/or sepsis-like clinical signs. Near full-length virus sequencing revealed that the HPeV5 was most likely a recombinant virus with structural genes most similar to an HPeV5 from Belarus in 2018 and a polymerase gene most similar to an HPeV3 from Australia in 2013/14. While HPeV5 is not typically associated with severe clinical signs the HPeV5 identified here may have been able to cause more severe disease in young infants through the acquisition of genes from a more virulent HPeV.  ,

PMC6833027,2-part\_summary\abstracts\75_18_abstract.xml,   Canine distemper virus (CDV) and phocine distemper (PDV) are closely-related members of the    Paramyxoviridae family genus    morbillivirus in the order    Mononegavirales. CDV has a broad host range among carnivores. PDV is thought to be derived from CDV through contact between terrestrial carnivores and seals. PDV has caused extensive mortality in Atlantic seals and other marine mammals and more recently has spread to the North Pacific Ocean. CDV also infects marine carnivores and there is evidence of    morbillivirus infection of seals and other species in Antarctica. Recently CDV has spread to felines and other wildlife species in the Serengeti and South Africa. Some CDV vaccines may also have caused wildlife disease. Changes in the virus haemagglutinin (H) protein particularly the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) receptor binding site correlate with adaptation to non-canine hosts. Differences in the phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences between disease and non-disease causing CDV strains may relate to pathogenicity in domestic dogs and wildlife. Of most concern are reports of CDV infection and disease in non-human primates raising the possibility of zoonosis. In this article we review the global occurrence of CDV and PDV and present both historical and genetic information relating to these viruses crossing species barriers.    ,

The involvement of an earlier age group the subacute course and the stabilization or improvement of the clinical condition during the treatment are most important. There is still no evidence of an association between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like syndrome and chikungunya (CHK) infection in the literature. This report was intended to review this syndrome and present a case that occurred after the epidemic of CHK in Pernambuco in 2016. CHK is a fast-onset febrile illness characterized by intense asthenia arthralgia myalgia headache and skin rash. Reports range from encephalitis optic neuritis myeloradiculitis to Guillain-Barré syndrome generating drastic sequelae such as mental deficiency blindness and persistent paralysis. This is the first case report of a possible association of ALS-like syndrome and chikungunya infection. CHK infection may cause ALS-like syndrome.

PMC6834195,2-part\_summary\abstracts\77_20_abstract.xml,   Enteroviruses (EVs) are responsible for extremely large-scale periodic epidemics in pediatric cohorts particularly in East and Southeast Asia. Clinical presentation includes a diverse disease spectrum including hand-foot and mouth disease (HFMD) aseptic meningitis encephalitis acute flaccid paralysis and acute flaccid myelitis. HFMD is predominantly attributable to EV-A types including the major pathogen EV-A71 and coxsackieviruses particularly CV-A6 CV-A16 and CV-A10. There have been multiple EV-A71 outbreaks associated with a profound burden of neurological disease and fatal outcomes in Asia since the early 1980s. Efficacious vaccines against EV-A71 have been developed in China but widespread pediatric vaccination programs have not been introduced in other countries. Encephalitis as a consequence of complications arising from HFMD infection leads to damage to the thalamus and medulla oblongata. Studies in Vietnam suggest that myoclonus is a significant indicator of central nervous system (CNS) complications in EV-A71-associated HFMD cases. Rapid response in HFMD cases in children is imperative to prevent the progression to a CNS infection; however prophylactic and therapeutic agents have not been well established internationally therefore surveillance and functional studies including development of antivirals and multivalent vaccines is critically important to reduce disease burden in pediatric populations.  ,
PMC6834551,2-part\_summary\abstracts\78_19_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections can cause severe and debilitating joint and muscular pain that can be long lasting. Current CHIKV vaccines under development rely on the generation of neutralizing antibodies for protection; however the role of T cells in controlling CHIKV infection and disease is still unclear. Using an overlapping peptide library we identified the CHIKV-specific T cell receptor epitopes recognized in C57BL/6 infected mice at 7 and 14 days post-infection. A fusion protein containing peptides 451 416 a small region of nsP4 peptide 47 and an HA tag (CHKVf5) was expressed using adenovirus and cytomegalovirus-vectored vaccines. Mice vaccinated with CHKVf5 elicited robust T cell responses to higher levels than normally observed following CHIKV infection but the vaccine vectors did not elicit neutralizing antibodies. CHKVf5-vaccinated mice had significantly reduced infectious viral load when challenged by intramuscular CHIKV injection. Depletion of both CD4   + and CD8   + T cells in vaccinated mice rendered them fully susceptible to intramuscular CHIKV challenge. Depletion of CD8   + T cells alone reduced vaccine efficacy albeit to a lesser extent but depletion of only CD4   + T cells did not reverse the protective phenotype. These data demonstrated a protective role for CD8   + T cells in CHIKV infection. However CHKVf5-vaccinated mice that were challenged by footpad inoculation demonstrated equal viral loads and increased footpad swelling at 3 dpi which we attributed to the presence of CD4 T cell receptor epitopes present in the vaccine. Indeed vaccination of mice with vectors expressing only CHIKV-specific CD8   + T cell epitopes followed by CHIKV challenge in the footpad prevented footpad swelling and reduced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines associated with disease indicating that CHIKV-specific CD8   + T cells prevent CHIKV disease. These results also indicate that a T cell-biased prophylactic vaccination approach is effective against CHIKV challenge and reduces CHIKV-induced disease in mice.    ,
PMC6838024,2-part\_summary\abstracts\79_14_abstract.xml,   Host-pathogen interactions are crucial for the successful propagation of pathogens inside the host cell. Knowledge of interactions between host proteins and viral proteins or viral RNA may provide clues for developing novel antiviral strategies. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) a water-borne pathogen that causes acute hepatitis in humans is responsible for epidemics in developing countries. HEV pathology and molecular biology have been poorly explored due to the lack of efficient culture systems. A contemporary approach to better understand the viral infection cycle at the molecular level is the use of system biology tools depicting virus-host interactions. To determine the host proteins which participate in the regulation of HEV replication we indentified liver cell proteins interacting with HEV RNA at its putative promoter region and those interacting with HEV polymerase (RdRp) protein. We employed affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) to identify the interacting host proteins. Protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) were plotted and analyzed using web-based tools. Topological analysis of the network revealed that the constructed network is potentially significant and relevant for viral replication. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that HEV RNA promoter- and polymerase-interacting host proteins belong to different cellular pathways such as RNA splicing RNA metabolism protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response innate immune pathways secretory vesicle pathway and glucose metabolism. We showed that hnRNPK and hnRNPA2B1 interact with both HEV putative promoters and HEV RdRp which suggest that they may have crucial roles in HEV replication. We demonstrated    in vitro binding of hnRNPK and hnRNPA2B1 proteins with the HEV targets in the study assuring the authenticity of the interactions obtained through mass spectrometry. Thus our study highlights the ability of viruses such as HEV to maneuver host systems to create favorable cellular environments for virus propagation.

We find that multiple alphaviruses including chikungunya (CHIKV) Ross River (RRV) and o’nyong ‘nyong (ONNV) viruses are cleared from the circulation of mice by liver Kupffer cells impeding viral dissemination. Clearance from the circulation was independent of natural antibodies or complement factor C3 and instead relied on scavenger receptor SR-A6 (MARCO). Remarkably lysine to arginine substitutions at distinct residues within the E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV and ONNV (E2 K200R) as well as RRV (E2 K251R) allowed for escape from clearance and enhanced viremia and dissemination. Mutational analysis revealed that viral clearance from the circulation is strictly dependent on the presence of lysine at these positions. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized innate immune pathway that controls alphavirus viremia and dissemination in vertebrate hosts ultimately influencing disease severity and likely transmission efficiency.  ,
PMC6839921,2-part\_summary\abstracts\81_16_abstract.xml,   eLife digest  Viruses transmitted by blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes and ticks cause serious human diseases. In recent years these viruses (also known as arboviruses) have re-emerged at an unprecedented scale leading to global outbreaks of diseases such as Zika or chikungunya fever. The severity of these diseases and how easily they can be transmitted depends in part on the level of virus in the host’s bloodstream following infection. The more viral particles present in the blood the easier it is for other insects that bite the host to become infected and help spread the disease. Yet the mechanisms that hosts use to control the amount of virus present in the blood and how long it persists are poorly understood.  To investigate this further Carpentier et al. used a combination of molecular and genetic techniques to study how mice clear particles of arbovirus from their bloodstream. Surgically removing the spleen from infected mice revealed that this organ which filters out unwanted or damaged materials from blood is not required to clear some arbovirus particles. Carpentier et al. found that removing these arboviruses from the blood instead required Kupffer cells a type of immune cell found in the liver.  Genetically manipulating mice so they no longer produced a protein on the surface of Kupffer cells known as MARCO revealed that this receptor is needed to clear chikungunya viral particles. When MARCO was genetically deleted this led to an increase in the number of viral particles in the mice’s bloodstream and allowed the virus to spread more rapidly throughout the bodies of the mice. Further experiments on three different types of arboviruses showed that in order to be cleared by MARCO each of these viruses needed a lysine residue – one of the building blocks that makes up proteins – at defined positions within their protein sequence.  These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism for how hosts remove arbovirus particles from their bloodstream. Future studies could use this information to identify new ways to control the transmission and reduce the severity of these viral diseases.  ,
PMC6841724,2-part\_summary\abstracts\82_13_abstract.xml,   The Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that belongs to the    Flaviviridae family. The ZIKV infection is usually asymptomatic or is associated with mild clinical manifestations; however increased numbers of cases of microcephaly and birth defects have been recently reported. To date neither a vaccine nor an antiviral treatment has become available to control ZIKV replication. Among the natural compounds recognized for their medical properties flavonoids which can be found in fruits and vegetables have been found to possess biological activity against a variety of viruses. Here we demonstrate that the citrus flavanone naringenin (NAR) prevented ZIKV infection in human A549 cells in a concentration-dependent and ZIKV-lineage independent manner. NAR antiviral activity was also observed when primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells were infected by ZIKV. NAR displayed its antiviral activity when the cells were treated after infection suggesting that NAR acts on the viral replication or assembly of viral particles. Moreover a molecular docking analysis suggests a potential interaction between NAR and the protease domain of the NS2B-NS3 protein of ZIKV which could explain the anti-ZIKV activity of NAR. Finally the results support the potential of NAR as a suitable candidate molecule for developing anti-ZIKV treatments.    ,
PMC6842947,2-part\_summary\abstracts\83_21_abstract.xml,   Innate immunity is critical in the early containment of influenza A virus (IAV) infection and surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays a crucial role in innate defense against IAV in the lungs. Multivalent lectin-mediated interactions of SP-D with IAVs result in viral aggregation reduced epithelial infection and enhanced IAV clearance by phagocytic cells. Previous studies showed that porcine SP-D (pSP-D) exhibits distinct antiviral activity against IAV as compared to human SP-D (hSP-D) mainly due to key residues in the lectin domain of pSP-D that contribute to its profound neutralizing activity. These observations provided the basis for the design of a full-length recombinant mutant form of hSP-D designated as “improved SP-D” (iSP-D). Inspired by pSP-D the lectin domain of iSP-D has 5 amino acids replaced (Asp324Asn Asp330Asn Val251Glu Lys287Gln Glu289Lys) and 3 amino acids inserted (326Gly-Ser-Ser). Characterization of iSP-D revealed no major differences in protein assembly and saccharide binding selectivity as compared to hSP-D. However hemagglutination inhibition measurements showed that iSP-D expressed strongly enhanced activity compared to hSP-D against 31 different IAV strains tested including (pandemic) IAVs that were resistant for neutralization by hSP-D. Furthermore iSP-D showed increased viral aggregation and enhanced protection of MDCK cells against infection by IAV. Importantly prophylactic or therapeutic application of iSP-D decreased weight loss and reduced viral lung titers in a murine model of IAV infection using a clinical isolate of H1N1pdm09 virus. These studies demonstrate the potential of iSP-D as a novel human-based antiviral inhalation drug that may provide immediate protection against or recovery from respiratory (pandemic) IAV infections in humans.  ,
PMC6843141,2-part\_summary\abstracts\84_18_abstract.xml,   Poultry farmers face a dual risk when mutant avian influenza (AI) virus exhibits zoonotic characteristics. A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 are two principal strains of the AI virus that have captured public attention in recent years as they have both been reported and can infect poultry and humans respectively. Previous studies have focused either on poultry farmers’ risk perception and biosecurity preventive behaviors (BPBs) against A/H5N1 infection with poultry or on their risk perception and personal protective behaviors (PPBs) against human infection with A/H7N9 even though these two strains often appear simultaneously. To bridge this research gap a survey (   N = 426) was conducted in the Chinese provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui to assess risk perception and coping behaviors adopted by poultry farmers facing the dual risk of these two viral strains. Paired sample    t-tests revealed that farmers’ perceived risk of poultry infection with A/H5N1 was significantly higher than their perceived risk of human infection with A/H7N9 and that their reported frequency of BPBs against A/H5N1 was significantly higher than the frequency of PPBs against A/H7N9. Moreover farmers were less familiar with AI infection in human beings compared to that in poultry but they felt a higher sense of control regarding human AI infection. Multivariate regression analyses showed that farm size and perceived risks of both human and poultry infection with AI were positively associated with BPBs and PPBs. The findings of this research suggest that a campaign to spread knowledge about human AI infection among poultry farmers is needed and that a policy incentive to encourage large-scale poultry farming could be effective in improving implementation of BPBs and PPBs.    ,
PMC6849232,2-part\_summary\abstracts\85_13_abstract.xml,      Background   N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most prevalent internal modification of eukaryotic mRNA modulating gene expression. m6A modification is a dynamic reversible process regulated by three protein groups: methyltransferases (writers) demethylases (erasers) and m6A-binding proteins (readers). m6A modification is involved in all phases of RNA metabolism including RNA folding stability splicing nuclear exporting translational modulation and degradation.       Main body   In recent years numerous studies have reported that abnormal m6A modification causes aberrant expression of important viral genes. Herein we review the role of m6A in viral lifecycle and its contribution to the pathogenesis of human diseases. Particularly we focus on the viruses associated with human diseases such as HIV-1 IAV HBV HCV EBV and many others.       Conclusions   A better understanding of m6A-virus relationship would provide new insights into the viral replication process and pathogenesis of human diseases caused by viruses. In addition exploration of the role of m6A in disease-causing viruses will reveal novel approaches for the treatment of such diseases.    ,
PMC6853075,2-part\_summary\abstracts\86_14_abstract.xml,   A progressive increase in the circulation of arboviruses in tropical countries has been observed accounting for 700000 yearly deaths in the world. The main objective of this article was to identify the presence of Zika (ZIKV) dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses in immature stages of    Aedes aegypti and    Ae. albopictus. Household collections of immature phases of the vectors were carried out in the years 2015 and 2016. A total of 2902 dwellings were visited and the rate of infestation with larvae and pupae of    Aedes mosquitoes was 283/1462 (19.4%) in March 2015 and 55/1440 (3.8%) in June 2015. In March 2015 907 larvae/pupae were collected (583 or 64.3% of    Ae. aegypti and 324 or 35.7% of    Ae. albopictus) while in June 2015 there was a reduction in the number of immature forms found: 197 larvae/pupae (121 or 61.4% of    Ae. aegypti and 76 or 38.6% of    Ae. albopictus). This reduction was accompanied by a decrease in suspected human ZIKV cases from March to June 2015. The RT-qPCR performed in 18 pools identified that three (two of    Ae. aegypti and one of    Ae. albopictus) were positive for ZIKV and none were positive for DENV or CHIKV. Our findings demonstrated that ZIKV was present in immature stages of insect vectors in the study region at least five months prior to the peak of ZIKV associated cases. Xenomonitoring of immature phases of the vectors may prove useful for predicting outbreaks.    ,
PMC6854480,2-part\_summary\abstracts\87_18_abstract.xml,   One of the major factors contributing to plant virus long-distance dispersal is the global trade of seeds. This is because more than 25% of plant viruses can infect seeds which are the main mode of germplasm exchange/storage and start new epidemics in areas where they were not previously present. Despite the relevance of this process for virus epidemiology and disease emergence the infection traits associated with the efficiency of virus seed transmission are largely unknown. Using turnip mosaic and cucumber mosaic viruses and their natural host    Arabidopsis thaliana as model systems we have identified the within-host speed of virus colonization and multiplication in the reproductive structures as the main determinants of the efficiency of seed transmission.

PMC6854480,2-part\_summary\abstracts\88_19_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Although vertical transmission from parents to offspring through seeds is an important fitness component of many plant viruses very little is known about the factors affecting this process. Viruses reach the seed by direct invasion of the embryo and/or by infection of the ovules or the pollen. Thus it can be expected that the efficiency of seed transmission would be determined by (i) virus within-host multiplication and movement (ii) the ability of the virus to invade gametic tissues (iii) plant seed production upon infection and (iv) seed survival in the presence of the virus. However these predictions have seldom been experimentally tested. To address this question we challenged 18    Arabidopsis thaliana accessions with    Turnip mosaic virus and    Cucumber mosaic virus. Using these plant-virus interactions we analyzed the relationship between the effect of virus infection on rosette and inflorescence weights; short- medium- and long-term seed survival; virulence; the number of seeds produced per plant; virus within-host speed of movement; virus accumulation in the rosette and inflorescence; and efficiency of seed transmission measured as a percentage and as the total number of infected seeds. Our results indicate that the best estimators of percent seed transmission are the within-host speed of movement and multiplication in the inflorescence. Together with these two infection traits virulence and the number of seeds produced per infected plant were also associated with the number of infected seeds. Our results provide support for theoretical predictions and contribute to an understanding of the determinants of a process central to plant-virus interactions.       IMPORTANCE One of the major factors contributing to plant virus long-distance dispersal is the global trade of seeds. This is because more than 25% of plant viruses can infect seeds which are the main mode of germplasm exchange/storage and start new epidemics in areas where they were not previously present.

PMC6854512,2-part\_summary\abstracts\90_20_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of a fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans. The glycoprotein (GP) of LASV mediates viral entry into host cells and correct processing and modification of GP by host factors is a prerequisite for virus replication. Here using an affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy 591 host proteins were identified as interactors of LASV GP. Gene ontology analysis was performed to functionally annotate these proteins and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex was highly enriched. Functional studies conducted by using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts showed that STT3A and STT3B the two catalytically active isoforms of the OST complex are essential for the propagation of the recombinant arenavirus rLCMV/LASV glycoprotein precursor mainly via affecting virus infectivity. Knockout of    STT3B but not    STT3A caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP indicating a preferential requirement of LASV for the STT3B-OST isoform. Furthermore double knockout of magnesium transporter 1 (   MAGT1) and tumor suppressor candidate 3 (   TUSC3) two specific subunits of STT3B-OST also caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP and affected virus propagation. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 is essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP. NGI-1 a small-molecule OST inhibitor can effectively reduce virus infectivity without affecting cell viability. The STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation of GP is conserved among other arenaviruses including both the Old World and New World groups. Our study provided a systematic view of LASV GP-host interactions and revealed the preferential requirement of STT3B for LASV GP N-glycosylation.       IMPORTANCE Glycoproteins play vital roles in the arenavirus life cycle by facilitating virus entry and participating in the virus budding process.

PMC6855448,2-part\_summary\abstracts\92_24_abstract.xml,   Dengue fever is a major worldwide public health problem that as estimated by the WHO causes epidemics in over 100 countries resulting in hundreds of millions of dengue virus (DENV) infections every year. In China dengue fever mainly occurs in coastal areas. Recurring dengue outbreaks were reported by Guangdong Province almost every year since the first epidemic in 1978. DENV infections persisted in Guangzhou in consecutive years since 2000 with the dengue epidemic reaching a historical peak in 2014. Because Guangzhou is one of the largest cities for opening up in China understanding the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever in the city can hopefully provide a significant basis for developing effective dengue prevention strategies. In this study a total of 34 DENV strains including 29 DENV-1 strains and 5 DENV-2 strains were isolated from a blood samples drawn from patients who were diagnosed with dengue fever by hospitals in Guangzhou during 2018. To explore the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever the envelope (E) gene obtained from the isolates was amplified for phylogenetic analysis. The results from the phylogenetic analysis showed that DENV in Guangzhou was mainly imported from Southeast Asian countries. Additionally propagation paths based on phylogeographical analysis suggested potential local dengue transmission in Guangzhou.  ,

Defining which syndromes to monitor in order to maximize detection performance has been recently identified as one of the research priorities in Syndromic surveillance. Estimating the minimum size of an epidemic that could potentially be detected in a specific syndrome could be used as a criteria for comparing the performance of different syndrome time series and could provide some guidance for syndrome selection. The aim of our study was to estimate the potential value of different time series for building a national syndromic surveillance system for cattle in Switzerland. Simulations were used to produce outbreaks of different size and shape and to estimate the ability of each time series and aberration detection algorithm to detect them with high sensitivity specificity and timeliness. Two temporal aberration detection algorithms were also compared: Holt–Winters generalized exponential smoothing (HW) and Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). Our results indicated that a specific aberration detection algorithm should be used for each time series. In addition time series with high counts per unit of time had good overall detection performance but poor detection performance for small epidemics making them of limited use for an early detection system. Estimating the minimum size of simulated epidemics that could potentially be detected in syndrome TS-event detection pairs can help surveillance system designers choosing the most appropriate syndrome TS to include in their early epidemic surveillance system.  ,

In this research we study the interplay between human mobility and dengue outbreaks in the complex urban environment of the city-state of Singapore. We integrate both stylized and mobile phone data-driven mobility patterns in an agent-based transmission model in which humans and mosquitoes are represented as agents that go through the epidemic states of dengue. We monitor with numerical simulations the system-level response to the epidemic by comparing our results with the observed cases reported during the 2013 and 2014 outbreaks. Our results show that human mobility is a major factor in the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue even on the short scale corresponding to intra-city distances. We finally discuss the advantages and the limits of mobile phone data and potential alternatives for assessing valuable mobility patterns for modeling vector-borne diseases outbreaks in cities.  ,

We collected 11398 respiratory samples from hospitalized pediatric patients with acute respiratory illness between July 2009 and June 2016 in Guangzhou. The samples were tested simultaneously for 18 respiratory pathogens using real-time PCR. Local meteorological data were also collected for correlation analysis. Of 11398 patients tested 5606 (49.2%) patients tested positive for one or more pathogens; RSV PIV and HMPV were the first sixth and ninth most frequently detected pathogens in 1690 (14.8%) 502 (4.4%) and 321 (2.8%) patients respectively. A total 17.9% (4605/5606) of patients with positive results had coinfection with other pathogens. Significant differences were found in the prevalence of RSV PIV and HMPV among all age groups (   p &lt; 0.001). RSV and HMPV had similar seasonal patterns with two prevalence peaks every year. PIV appeared alternatively with RSV and HMPV. Multiple linear regression models were established for RSV PIV and HMPV prevalence and meteorological factors (   p &lt; 0.05). RSV and PIV incidence was negatively correlated with monthly mean relative humidity; RSV and HMPV incidence was negatively correlated with sunshine duration; PIV incidence was positively correlated with mean temperature. We described the features of paramyxovirus infection in a subtropical region of China and highlighted the correlation with meteorological factors. These findings will assist public health authorities and clinicians in improving strategies for controlling paramyxovirus infection.    ,
PMC6862093,2-part\_summary\abstracts\97_17_abstract.xml,   Seasonal influenza epidemics occur each winter season in temperate zones involving up to 650000 deaths each year globally. A published study demonstrated that the circulation of one influenza virus type during early influenza season in the United States interferes with the activity of other influenza virus types. However this finding has yet to be validated in other settings. In the present work we investigated the interaction among seasonal influenza viruses (A/H1N1 A/H3N2 and B) in Japan. Sentinel and virus surveillance data were used to estimate the type-specific incidence from 2010 to 2019 and statistical correlations among the type-specific incidence were investigated. We identified significant negative correlations between incidence of the dominant virus and the complementary incidence. When correlation was identified during the course of an epidemic a linear regression model accurately predicted the epidemic size of a particular virus type before the epidemic peak. The peak of influenza type B took place later in the season than that of influenza A although the epidemic peaks of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 nearly coincided. Given the interaction among different influenza viruses underlying mechanisms including age and spatial dependence should be explored in future.  ,
PMC6862117,2-part\_summary\abstracts\98_16_abstract.xml,   Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and their differentiation into a variety of cells and organoids have allowed setting up versatile non-invasive ethically sustainable and patient-specific models for the investigation of the mechanisms of human diseases including viral infections and host–pathogen interactions. In this study we investigated and compared the infectivity and replication kinetics in hiPSCs hiPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and undifferentiated neurons and the effect of viral infection on host innate antiviral responses of representative flaviviruses associated with diverse neurological diseases i.e. Zika virus (ZIKV) West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV). In addition we exploited hiPSCs to model ZIKV infection in the embryo and during neurogenesis. The results of this study confirmed the tropism of ZIKV for NSCs but showed that WNV replicated in these cells with much higher efficiency than ZIKV and DENV inducing massive cell death. Although with lower efficiency all flaviviruses could also infect pluripotent stem cells and neurons inducing similar patterns of antiviral innate immune response gene expression. While showing the usefulness of hiPSC-based infection models these findings suggest that additional virus-specific mechanisms beyond neural tropism are responsible for the peculiarities of disease phenotype in humans.  ,
PMC6862669,2-part\_summary\abstracts\99_18_abstract.xml,   Influenza viruses are among the most common human pathogens and are responsible for causing extensive seasonal morbidity and mortality. To investigate the immunological factors associated with severe influenza infection the immune responses in mice infected with nonlethal (LD0) doses of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus were compared with those of mice infected with a lethal dose (LD100) of the virus. The virus titer and activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptor signaling pathways were similar in the mice infected with LD0 and LD100 at 2 days post-infection; however mice infected with LD100 exhibited a greater abundance of cytokines and a more diverse cytokine profile. Infection with LD100 induced the expression of the following factors: Interleukins (ILs) IL-4 IL-7 IL-10 IL-11 IL-12p40 IL-13 and IL-15; inflammatory chemokines C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)2 CCL3/4 CCL12 CCL17 CCL19; and lung injury-associated cytokines leptin leukaemia inhibitory factor macrophage colony stimulating factor pentraxin (PTX)2 and PTX3 WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 1 matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2 MMP-3 proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain. Switching in macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 was evidenced by the increase in M2 markers including arginase-1 (Arg1) and early growth response protein 2 (Egr2) in the lungs of mice infected with LD100. Since IL-12 and interferon-γ are the major T helper (Th)1 cytokines increased expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 IL-4 IL-10 and IL-13 promoted the differentiation of naïve CD4   + T cells into Th2 cells. In conclusion the present study identified key cytokines involved in the pathogenicity of influenza infection and demonstrated that lethal influenza virus infection induces a mixed Th1/Th2 response.    ,
PMC6863562,2-part\_summary\abstracts\100_20_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in Colombia in 2014 into a population presumed fully susceptible. This resulted in a quick and intense spread across Colombia resulting in an epidemic that affected an estimated 450000 people. The reported Colombian cases accounted for over 49% of all the cases reported to the PAHO. Eco-environmental factors are known to be associated with the spread of arboviruses such as CHIKV and likely contribute to the differences in transmission profiles that were observed across several municipalities. To determine the association of eco-environmental factors and CHIKV the basic reproduction number (   R   0) in 85 municipalities which accounted for 65.6% of reported CHIKV cases in Colombia was estimated. Estimates of    R   0 ranged from 1 to 9 where over 76% of municipalities had    R   0 values between 1 and 2. When we looked at the distribution of    R   0 the cumulative proportions were 20% with    R   0&gt;2 14% with    R   0&gt;3 and 9% with    R   0&gt;4. Next we determined that there were different patterns of correlation between environmental and/or ecological variables and    R   0 when we considered different    R   0 lower-thresholds. Broadly we found that temperature-related variables are significantly and positively correlated to    R   0 regardless of the lower threshold while other variables like duration of outbreak and size of the urban area are inversely related to    R   0. Specifically we conclude that high values of temperature-related variables where    R   0 &gt; 1 will result in a fast growth of cases in a shorter time period (with faster cessation of outbreak transmission) but will result overall in a fewer total cases compared to outbreak areas (   R   0 &gt; 1 but classified as lower). Thus in the absence of vector control a less explosive outbreak may be more advantageous for the virus in terms of transmission.    ,
PMC6863562,2-part\_summary\abstracts\101_21_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Chikungunya virus emerged in Colombia in 2014 into a presumed fully susceptible population and rapidly spread in the country. Numerous municipalities were differently affected by this virus across the country. The main purpose of this work was understanding why those differences were produced and in turn what are the variables addressing such differences. For this purpose we estimated for 85 municipalities the basic reproduction number (   R   0) a crucial parameter to understand epidemics that is expressed as the number of secondary cases produced by a primary case. Such parameter was correlated with numerous variables resulting evident a crucial role of temperature in the increase of    R   0. Interestingly other variables like size of the urban area and cases showed to be negatively correlated with    R   0. Results shows that high temperatures produce high    R   0 but those municipalities that showed high    R   0 showed an explosive epidemic with faster increase of cases that ceased equally fast so the duration of epidemic is short producing small amount of cases. In this way more cases are expected with municipalities with lower values of    R   0 which is suitably explained by the tortoise-hare model where the less explosive outbreak results to be more advantageous for the virus.    ,

To incorporate the impact of the seasonality of weather on the spread of Zika we apply a nonautonomous model with time-dependent mosquito birth rate and biting rate which allows us to explain the differing outcome of the epidemic in different countries of South America: using Latin Hypercube Sampling for fitting we were able to reproduce the different outcomes of the disease in various countries. Sensitivity analysis shows that although the most important factors in Zika transmission are the birth rate of mosquitoes and the transmission rate from mosquitoes to humans spread through sexual contacts also highly contributes to the transmission of Zika virus: our study suggests that the practice of safe sex among those who have possibly contracted the disease can significantly reduce the number of Zika cases.  ,

For the first time we were able to produce haemagglutinin from both seasonal influenza A and B strains. This ciliate derived material was immunogenic inducing an antibody response in both mice and non-human primates. Mice immunized with ciliate derived haemagglutinin were protected against challenge with homologous influenza A or B viruses. The antigen could also be combined with submicron particles containing a Nod2 ligand significantly boosting the immune response and reducing the dose of antigen required. Thus we show that    Tetrahymena can be used as a manufacturing platform for viral vaccine antigens.    ,
PMC6868920,2-part\_summary\abstracts\104_20_abstract.xml,   Viruses transmitted by arthropods (arboviruses) are the etiological agents of several human diseases with worldwide distribution; including dengue (DENV) zika (ZIKV) yellow fever (YFV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses. These viruses are especially important in tropical and subtropical regions; where ZIKV and CHIKV are involved in epidemics worldwide while the DENV remains as the biggest problem in public health. Factors such as environmental conditions promote the distribution of vectors deficiencies in health services and lack of effective vaccines guarantee the presence of these vector-borne diseases. Treatment against these viral diseases is only palliative since available therapies formulated lack to demonstrate specific antiviral activity and vaccine candidates fail to demonstrate enough effectiveness. The use of natural products as therapeutic tools is an ancestral practice in different cultures. According to WHO 80 % of the population of some countries from Africa and Asia depend on the use of traditional medicines to deal with some diseases. Molecular characteristics of these viruses are important in determining its cellular pathogenesis emergence and dispersion mechanisms as well as for the development of new antivirals and vaccines to control strategies. In this review we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular structure and replication mechanisms of selected arboviruses as well as their mechanism of entry into host cells and a brief overview about the potential targets accessed to inhibit these viruses    in vitro and a summary about their treatment with natural extracts from plants.    ,
PMC6872174,2-part\_summary\abstracts\105_23_abstract.xml,   Malnourishment specifically overweight/obesity and undernourishment affects more than 2.5 billion people worldwide with the number affected ever-increasing. Concurrently emerging viral diseases particularly those that are mosquito-borne have spread dramatically in the past several decades culminating in outbreaks of several viruses worldwide. Both forms of malnourishment are known to lead to an aberrant immune response which can worsen disease outcomes and reduce vaccination efficacy for viral pathogens such as influenza and measles. Given the increasing rates of malnutrition and spread of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) there is an urgent need to understand the role of host nutrition on the infection virulence and transmission of these viruses. To address this gap in knowledge we infected lean obese and undernourished mice with arthritogenic arboviruses from the genus Alphavirus and assessed morbidity virus replication transmission and evolution. Obesity and undernourishment did not consistently influence virus replication in the blood of infected animals except for reductions in virus in obese mice late in infection. However morbidity was increased in obese mice under all conditions. Using Mayaro virus (MAYV) as a model arthritogenic alphavirus we determined that both obese and undernourished mice transmit virus less efficiently to mosquitoes than control (lean) mice. In addition viral genetic diversity and replicative fitness were reduced in virus isolated from obese compared to lean controls. Taken together nutrition appears to alter the course of alphavirus infection and should be considered as a critical environmental factor during outbreaks.  ,
PMC6872174,2-part\_summary\abstracts\106_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Over- and undernutrition collectively known as malnutrition affect over 2.5 billion people worldwide. Associations between malnutrition and mosquito-borne virus infection and resulting disease have been identified in epidemiological studies but have not been explored in controlled studies. Here we infect obese or undernourished mice with different arthritis inducing viruses in the genus    Alphavirus and measure disease symptoms viral replication transmission and evolution. We found that markers of disease namely weight loss and footpad swelling were increased in obese mice. We also found that replication differences between mice fed different diets were minimal except late in infection for obese mice when levels of virus dropped significantly. When mosquitoes were allowed to feed on mice fed different diets we observed reduced infection and transmission rates depending on the diet. Finally we found reduced genetic diversity and replicative fitness of virus isolated from obese mice. This study provides insights into the influence of nutrition on alphavirus pathogenesis and evolution.    ,

PMC6872792,2-part\_summary\abstracts\108_17_abstract.xml,   Human viral hepatitis a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide is caused by highly diverse viruses with different genetic ecological and pathogenetic features. Technological advances that allow throughput sequencing of viral genomes as well as the development of computational tools to analyze such genome data have largely expanded our knowledge on the host range and evolutionary history of human hepatitis viruses. Thus with the exclusion of hepatitis D virus close or distant relatives of these human pathogens were identified in a number of domestic and wild mammals. Also sequences of human viral strains isolated from different geographic locations and over different time-spans have allowed the application of phylogeographic and molecular dating approaches to large viral phylogenies. In this review we summarize the most recent insights into our understanding of the evolutionary events and ecological contexts that determined the origin and spread of human hepatitis viruses.  ,
PMC6874066,2-part\_summary\abstracts\109_21_abstract.xml,   Since the role of wild rodents/small mammals in hepatitis E virus (HEV) epidemiology has been a subject of considerable debate this study was conducted to investigate the potential presence of HEV RNA in small rodents collected within their natural habitats and to detect if they can be potential reservoirs of the virus. A total of 483 small rodents were captured using snap traps placed at 11 regions in Croatia. Sampling was undertaken in 2008 and repeated from 2010 to 2014. Liver samples were tested for the presence of HEV RNA. HEV RNA was detected in only one liver sample (0.21%) originated from    Apodemus flavicollis from the location Medvednica nearby Zagreb collected in 2014. According to the sequence analysis the isolate has shown to be a member of    Orthohepevirus A species genotype HEV-3. The genotyping results confirmed grouping into subtype 3a general cluster 3abchij.The detected HEV strain showed to be genetically highly related to strains found in humans and/or domestic pigs and wild boars from Croatia. Our finding indicates that wild small mammals could play a role in the epidemiology of HEV-3 infection and therefore should be taken under consideration as potential reservoirs or/and transmitters of the disease. However further investigation is needed to recognize their potential for maintaining the infection in natural conditions.    ,

PMC6874249,2-part\_summary\abstracts\111_13_abstract.xml,   To determine the seroprevalence and seroconversion of avian influenza virus (AIV) antibodies in poultry workers we conducted a seroepidemiologic study in 7 areas of China during December 2014–April 2016. We used viral isolation and reverse transcription PCR to detect AIVs in specimens from live poultry markets. We analyzed 2124 serum samples obtained from 1407 poultry workers by using hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. We noted seroprevalence of AIV antibodies for subtypes H9N2 H7N9 H6N1 H5N1-SC29 H5N6 H5N1-SH199 and H6N6. In serum from participants with longitudinal samples we noted seroconversion with    &gt;4-fold rise in titers for H9N2 H7N9 H6N1 H5N1-SC29 H6N6 H5N6 and H5N1-SH199 subtypes. We found no evidence of H10N8 subtype. The distribution of AIV antibodies provided evidence of asymptomatic infection. We found that AIV antibody prevalence in live poultry markets correlated with increased risk for H7N9 and H9N2 infection among poultry workers.    ,
PMC6876883,2-part\_summary\abstracts\112_19_abstract.xml,   To identify countries that have seasonal patterns similar to the time series of influenza surveillance data in the United States and other countries and to forecast the 2018–2019 seasonal influenza outbreak in the U.S. we collected the surveillance data of 164 countries using the FluNet database search queries from Google Trends and temperature from 2010 to 2018. Data for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the U.S. were collected from the Fluview database. We identified the time lag between two time-series which were weekly surveillances for ILI total influenza (Total INF) influenza A (INF A) and influenza B (INF B) viruses between two countries using cross-correlation analysis. In order to forecast ILI Total INF INF A and INF B of next season (after 26 weeks) in the U.S. we developed prediction models using linear regression auto regressive integrated moving average and an artificial neural network (ANN). As a result of cross-correlation analysis between the countries located in northern and southern hemisphere the seasonal influenza patterns in Australia and Chile showed a high correlation with those of the U.S. 22 weeks and 28 weeks earlier respectively. The    R   2 score of ANN models for ILI for validation set in 2015–2019 was 0.758 despite how hard it is to forecast 26 weeks ahead. Our prediction models forecast that the ILI for the U.S. in 2018–2019 may be later and less severe than those in 2017–2018 judging from the influenza activity for Australia and Chile in 2018. It allows to estimate peak timing peak intensity and type-specific influenza activities for next season at 40   th week. The correlation between seasonal influenza patterns in the U.S. Australia and Chile could be used to forecast the next seasonal influenza pattern which can help to determine influenza vaccine strategy approximately six months ahead in the U.S.    ,
PMC6877935,2-part\_summary\abstracts\113_16_abstract.xml,      Purpose    The clinical features and laboratory results of dengue-infected adult patients admitted to the hospital during the 2017 outbreak were analyzed in this study.        Method    This is a cross-sectional study. 2922 patients aged 18 years or more with dengue fever in National Hospital for Tropical Diseases (NHTD) in the North and Hospital for Tropical Disease (HTD) in the South of Vietnam were recruited in this study.        Result    Patients were admitted in the hospital around the year and concentrated from August to December in 53/63 (84.0%) provinces in Vietnam and patients in all ages were affected. The number of patients with dengue fever was 1675 (57.3%) dengue with warning signs 914 (31.3%) and severe dengue 333 (11.4%) respectively. Among patients with severe dengue severe plasma leakage and dengue shock account for 238 (8.1%) severe organ impairment 73 (2.5%) and severe bleeding 22 (0.75%). The rate of mortality was 0.8% and the outcome of dengue patients is worse in the elderly and people with underlying diseases.        Conclusion    The 2017 dengue outbreak occurred in a larger scale than in the previous years in terms of time location and number of patients. More elderly patients were infected by dengue in this outbreak and this may contribute to the mortality rate. Clinical manifestations of dengue patients in Southern Vietnam are more typical than the northern but the rate of severe dengue is not different. The mortality risk and underlying conditions associated with dengue-infected elderly patients are worthy of further investigations in the future.    ,
PMC6881000,2-part\_summary\abstracts\114_25_abstract.xml,      Background   Dengue fever is the most widespread infectious disease of humans transmitted by     Aedes mosquitoes. It is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children in the Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions. We analyzed surveillance records from health centers in Vietnam collected between 2001–2012 to determine seasonal trends develop risk maps and an incidence forecasting model.          Methods   The data were analyzed using a hierarchical spatial Bayesian model that approximates its posterior parameter distributions using the integrated Laplace approximation algorithm (INLA). Meteorological altitude and land cover (LC) data were used as predictors. The data were grouped by province (n = 63) and month (n = 144) and divided into training (2001–2009) and validation (2010–2012) sets. Thirteen meteorological variables 7 land cover data and altitude were considered as predictors. Only significant predictors were kept in the final multivariable model. Eleven dummy variables representing month were also fitted to account for seasonal effects. Spatial and temporal effects were accounted for using     Besag-York-Mollie (BYM) and autoregressive (1) models. Their levels of significance were analyzed using deviance information criterion (DIC). The model was validated based on the Theil’s coefficient which compared predicted and observed incidence estimated using the validation data. Dengue incidence predictions for 2010–2012 were also used to generate risk maps.          Results   The mean monthly dengue incidence during the period was 6.94 cases (SD 14.49) per 100000 people. Analyses on the temporal trends of the disease showed regular seasonal epidemics that were interrupted every 3 years (specifically in July 2004 July 2007 and September 2010) by major fluctuations in incidence. Monthly mean minimum temperature rainfall area under urban settlement/build-up areas and altitude were significant in the final model. Minimum temperature and rainfall had non-linear effects and lagging them by two months provided a better fitting model compared to using unlagged variables. Forecasts for the validation period closely mirrored the observed data and accurately captured the troughs and peaks of dengue incidence trajectories. A favorable Theil’s coefficient of inequality of 0.22 was generated.       Conclusions   The study identified temperature rainfall altitude and area under urban settlement as being significant predictors of dengue incidence. The statistical model fitted the data well based on Theil’s coefficient of inequality and risk maps generated from its predictions identified most of the high-risk provinces throughout the country.    ,
PMC6881067,2-part\_summary\abstracts\115_22_abstract.xml,   Dengue fever is endemic in Malaysia contributing to significant economic and health burden in the country.    Aedes aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus are the main vectors of the dengue virus (DENV) which circulates in sylvatic and human transmission cycles and has been present in Malaysia for decades. The study investigated the presence and distribution of DENV in urban localities in the Klang Valley Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 364    Ae.    aegypti and 1025    Ae.    albopictus larvae and 10    Ae.    aegypti and 42    Ae.    albopictus adult mosquitoes were screened for the presence of DENV. In total 31 (2.2%) samples were positive of which 2    Ae.    albopictus larvae were co-infected with two serotypes one with DENV-2 and DENV-3 and the other with DENV-3 and DENV-4. Phylogenetic analysis determined that the isolates belonged to DENV-1 genotype I (1    Ae.    aegypti adult) DENV-2 (1    Ae.    albopictus larva) DENV-3 genotype V (3    Ae.    aegypti larvae and 10    Ae.    albopictus larvae) and DENV-4 genotype IV (6    Ae.    aegypti larvae and 12    Ae.    albopictus larvae) a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 which was most closely related with sylvatic strains isolated from arboreal mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys in Peninsular Malaysia in the 1970s. All four DENV serotypes were co-circulating throughout the study period. The detection of a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 in    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus mosquitoes in urban areas in Peninsular Malaysia highlights the susceptibility of these vectors to infection with sylvatic DENV. The infectivity and vector competence of these urban mosquitoes to this strain of the virus needs further investigation as well as the possibility of the emergence of sylvatic virus into the human transmission cycle.    ,
PMC6881067,2-part\_summary\abstracts\116_23_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has re-emerged as a major public health problem in the 21   st Century. The four serotypes of dengue virus are capable of infecting humans with a range of symptoms and clinical outcomes with the change in predominating serotypes often responsible for new dengue outbreaks. In this study we surveyed urban sites in the Klang Valley Malaysia for    Aedes aegypti and    Aedes albopictus mosquito vectors and confirmed the presence of all four serotypes of the virus. We detected the presence of genotype V of dengue serotype 3 which has previously not been reported in the country as well as a sylvatic strain of dengue serotype 4 that was closely related to strains obtained from forest-dwelling mosquito vectors and sentinel monkeys in Malaysia. The detection of a sylvatic strain of dengue virus in urban vectors raises questions over the risk of virus transmission to humans especially with recent reports of severe clinical cases as a result of infection with sylvatic dengue virus serotypes. Further studies will be needed to determine the source and origins of these strains as well as the severity of dengue disease upon infection especially with the development of new dengue vaccines.    ,
PMC6881073,2-part\_summary\abstracts\117_23_abstract.xml,   Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes hand foot and mouth disease epidemics with neurological complications and fatalities. However the neuropathogenesis of EV-A71 remains poorly understood. In mice adaptation and virulence determinants have been mapped to mutations at VP2-149 VP1-145 and VP1-244. We investigate how these amino acids alter heparin-binding phenotype and shapes EV-A71 virulence in one-day old mice. We constructed six viruses with varying residues at VP1-98 VP1-145 (which are both heparin-binding determinants) and VP2-149 (based on the wild type 149K/98E/145Q termed KEQ) to generate KKQ KKE KEE IEE and IEQ variants. We demonstrated that the weak heparin-binder IEE was highly lethal in mice. The initially strong heparin-binding IEQ variant acquired an additional mutation VP1-K244E which confers weak heparin-binding phenotype resulting in elevated viremia and increased virus antigens in mice brain with subsequent high virulence. IEE and IEQ-244E variants inoculated into mice disseminated efficiently and displayed high viremia. Increasing polymerase fidelity and impairing recombination of IEQ attenuated the virulence suggesting the importance of population diversity in EV-A71 pathogenesis    in vivo. Combining    in silico docking and deep sequencing approaches we inferred that virus population diversity is shaped by electrostatic interactions at the five-fold axis of the virus surface. Electrostatic surface charges facilitate virus adaptation by generating poor heparin-binding variants for better    in vivo dissemination in mice likely due to reduced adsorption to heparin-rich peripheral tissues which ultimately results in increased neurovirulence. The dynamic switching between heparin-binding and weak heparin-binding phenotype    in vivo explained the neurovirulence of EV-A71.    ,
PMC6881073,2-part\_summary\abstracts\118_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the primary cause of hand foot and mouth disease and it can also infect the central nervous system and cause fatal outbreaks in young children. EV-A71 pathogenesis remains elusive. In this study we demonstrated that EV-A71 variants with strong affinity to heparan sulfate (heparin) have a growth advantage in cell culture but are disadvantaged    in vivo. When inoculated into one-day old mice strong heparin-binding virus variants are more likely to be adsorbed to peripheral tissues resulting in impaired ability to disseminate and are cleared from the bloodstream rapidly. The lower viremia level resulted in no neuroinvasion. In contrast weak heparin-binding variants show greater levels of viremia dissemination and subsequent neurovirulence in mice. We also provide evidence that the EV-A71 heparin-binding pattern is mediated by electrostatic surface charges on the virus capsid surface. In mice EV-A71 undergoes adaptive mutation to acquire greater negative surface charges thus generating new virulent variants with weak heparin-binding ability which allows greater viral spread. Our study underlines the importance of electrostatic surface charges in shaping EV-A71 virulence.    ,
PMC6881638,2-part\_summary\abstracts\119_17_abstract.xml,   We previously showed that the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype V (GV) strain Muar exhibits significantly higher virulence in mice than the genotype I (GI) JEV strain Mie/41/2002. In this study we attempted to identify the region responsible for the increased virulence of GV JEV using recombinant intertypic and single mutant JEVs. Intertypic viruses containing the GV E region in the Mie/41/2002 backbone showed increased pathogenicity in mice. The amino acid at position 123 in the E protein (E123) of the Mie/41/2002 and GV JEVs was serine and histidine respectively. A serine-to-histidine substitution at E123 of the Mie/41/2002 increased its virulence. However histidine-to-serine changes at E123 in the intertypic mutants with the GV E region remained highly virulent. GV Muar prM-bearing mutants were also highly pathogenic in mice. Our results suggest that the E and prM proteins of GV JEV are responsible for the highly virulent characteristics of GV JEV.  ,

PMC6882728,2-part\_summary\abstracts\121_14_abstract.xml,   Zika virus a member of    Flaviviridae is the etiology of Zika or Zika fever or Zika virus (ZIKV) disease characterized by mild symptoms similar to very mild form of Dengue or Chikungunya. The virus transmits through    Aedes mosquitoes particularly by    Aedes aegypti. The most dangerous effect of ZIKV infection is the ability of the virus to cause microcephaly and congenital malformation to the newborn baby if the mother is infected. The neurological disorders including Guillain-Barré syndrome might be associated with adults and children due to ZIKV infections. Zika has emerged as a serious global public health problem as it has been found in 87 countries particularly in Africa America and Asia and has no vaccine and treatment so far. Bangladesh is at a high risk of ZIKV infection and we consider ZIKV as a possible emerging threat for Bangladesh. This short review summarizes the insights of ZIKV infection present status of the disease in Bangladesh and its neighboring countries and recommendations for necessary preparations and strategies to be taken for effective controlling of the ZIKV infection in Bangladesh before getting any havoc.    ,

In 2017 more than three hundred of CHIKV autochthonous cases were reported in Italy highlighting the urgent need for a risk assessment of arboviral diseases in European countries. In this study the vector competence for three major arboviruses were analyzed in eight    Ae.    albopictus populations from Europe. Here we show that Southern European    Ae.    albopictus were susceptible to CHIKV DENV-1 and ZIKV with the highest vector competence for CHIKV. Based on vector competence data and vector distribution a prediction risk map for CHIKV was generated stressing the fear of CHIKV and to a lesser extent of other arboviruses for Europe calling us for new public health strategies.    ,
PMC6883514,2-part\_summary\abstracts\123_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Aseptic meningitis epidemics may pose various health care challenges.       Methods   We describe the German enterovirus meningitis epidemics in the university hospital centers of Düsseldorf Cologne and Berlin between January 1st and December 31st 2013 in order to scrutinize clinical differences from other aseptic meningitis cases.       Results   A total of 72 enterovirus (EV-positive) meningitis cases were detected in our multicenter cohort corresponding to 5.8% of all EV-positive cases which were voluntarily reported within the National Enterovirus surveillance (EVSurv based on investigation of patients with suspected aseptic meningitis/encephalitis and/or acute flaccid paralysis) by physicians within this period of time. Among these 72 patients 38 (52.8%) were enterovirus positive and typed as echovirus (18 pediatric and 20 adult cases median age 18.5 years; echovirus 18 (1) echovirus 2 (1) echovirus 30 (31) echovirus 33 (1) echovirus 9 (4)). At the same time 45 aseptic meningitis cases in our cohort were excluded to be due to enteroviral infection (EV-negative). Three EV-negative patients were tested positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and 1 EV-negative patient for herpes simplex virus 2. Hospitalization was significantly longer in EV-negative cases. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not reveal significant differences between the two groups. After discharge EV-meningitis resulted in significant burden of sick leave in our pediatric cohort as parents had to care for the children at home.       Conclusions   Voluntary syndromic surveillance such as provided by the EVSurv in our study may be a valuable tool for epidemiological research. Our analyses suggest that EV-positive meningitis predominantly affects younger patients and may be associated with a rather benign clinical course compared to EV-negative cases.    ,

Regardless immunoglobulin profile all OROV fever patients presented higher levels of CXCL8 and IFN-α and lower levels of TNF and IL-10 at baseline as compared to healthy donors (HD). Lower levels of CCL2 CXCL10 and IFN-γ and higher levels of CCL2 CXCL10 IL-6 and IL-17A were detected in early and late seroconverters respectively as compared to HD. While early seroconverters presented the increasing levels of CCL2 along the timeline late seroconverters displayed decreasing levels of CCL2 CXCL10 and IL-6 following days of disease onset. Noteworthy was that IFN-α was revealed as universal biomarker of human OROV fever while CXCL8 &amp; IL-5 and CXCL10 &amp; IL-17 were consistently observed in early and late seroconverters respectively. Thus our results suggest that the production of IFN-α CXCL10 and IL-17 precede the seroconversion bringing novel insights on the immunological events triggered by the OROV disease.  ,
PMC6884537,2-part\_summary\abstracts\125_13_abstract.xml,   Respiratory viral infections contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality worldwide but representative data from sub-Saharan Africa are needed to inform vaccination strategies. We conducted population-based surveillance in rural Gambia using standardized criteria to identify and investigate children with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). Naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were collected. Each month from February through December 2015 specimens from 50 children aged 2–23 months were randomly selected to test for respiratory syncytial (RSV) parainfluenza (PIV) and influenza viruses. The expected number of viral-associated ALRI cases in the population was estimated using statistical simulation that accounted for the sampling design. RSV G and F proteins and influenza hemagglutinin genes were sequenced. 2385 children with ALRI were enrolled 519 were randomly selected for viral testing. One or more viruses were detected in 303/519 children (58.4%). RSV-A was detected in 237 and RSV-B in seven. The expected incidence of ALRI associated with RSV PIV or influenza was 140 cases (95% CI 131–149) per 1000 person-years; RSV incidence was 112 cases (95% CI 102–122) per 1000 person-years. Multiple strains of RSV and influenza circulated during the year. RSV circulated throughout most of the year and was associated with eight times the number of ALRI cases compared to PIV or IV. Gambian RSV viruses were closely related to viruses detected in other continents. An effective RSV vaccination strategy could have a major impact on the burden of ALRI in this setting.  ,
PMC6884810,2-part\_summary\abstracts\126_13_abstract.xml,   Arboviruses are (re-) emerging viruses that cause significant morbidity globally. Clinical manifestations usually consist of a non-specific febrile illness that may be accompanied by rash arthralgia and arthritis and/or with neurological or hemorrhagic syndromes. The broad range of differential diagnoses of other infectious and non-infectious etiologies presents a challenge for clinicians. While knowledge of the geographic distribution of pathogens and the current epidemiological situation incubation periods exposure risk factors and vaccination history can help guide the diagnostic approach the non-specific and variable clinical presentation can delay final diagnosis. This case report summarizes the laboratory-based findings of three travel-related cases of arbovirus infections in Uganda. These include a patient from Bangladesh with chikungunya virus infection and two cases of dengue fever from Ethiopia. Early detection of travel-imported cases by public health laboratories is important to reduce the risk of localized outbreaks of arboviruses such as dengue virus and chikungunya virus. Because of the global public health importance and the continued risk of (re-) emerging arbovirus infections specific recommendations following diagnosis by clinicians should include obtaining travel histories from persons with arbovirus-compatible illness and include differential diagnoses when appropriate.  ,
PMC6886976,2-part\_summary\abstracts\127_21_abstract.xml,      Introduction   This protocol will guide and explain the working process of a systematic scoping review on vulnerability assessment tools in the field of infectious disease outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crises. The scoping review will appraise existing tools or methodologies to identify local level vulnerabilities in the context of infectious disease outbreaks and AMR. Due to this focus on infectious threats and AMR the review also considers articles using a ‘One Health’ approach to assess the vulnerability of individuals groups and practices in human–animal–environment interactions. Given the broad nature of vulnerability we aim to allocate studies discerning the process of identifying vulnerable or at-risk groups during a crisis instead of studies taking vulnerability only as a starting point. Because considerable research has been conducted on vulnerability disasters and climate change we will also assemble tools developed from these fields. To our knowledge this is the first planned systematic scoping review of vulnerability assessment tools for disease outbreaks and AMR taking into account practices at the human–animal–environment interface that can lead to increased risk of exposure of individuals to infections pathogen spillovers or epidemics.       Methods and analysis   To develop the protocol we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols checklist (PRISMA-P 2015) in compliance with the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews Explanation and Elaboration. With the assistance of an experienced research librarian we developed the search strategy which targeted the following databases: Medline Global Health database Web of Science and Embase. A second strategy was developed for Epistemonikos African Journals Online and Global Index Medicus because these databases do not provide the infrastructure for an advanced search. We consider studies published between 1978 and 2019 and include articles book chapters websites and grey literature from selected non-governmental organisations and non-profit organisations working in the health field. We contact them directly regarding whether they are working with or have developed a vulnerability assessment tool. To address the dynamic nature of our investigation we develop a flow diagram which we continually update to reflect the selection process. Two reviewers (MJ and LL) independently screen the literature and resolve conflicts through discussion rounds. Data extraction will be conducted by four researchers (MJ LL EJ and RK) through inductive and deductive coding.

PMC6889554,2-part\_summary\abstracts\128_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Currently norovirus (NoV) is associated with one-fifth of all acute gastroenteritis (AGE) cases worldwide. The NoV GII.17_2014 variant has been associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in several Asian countries replacing the previously dominant Sydney 2012 variant. There is limited data about circulation of this new strain in Brazil. This study aimed to describe the phylogenetic and evolutionary characteristics of the GII.17_2014 strains in the Northern region of Brazil.       Methods   NoV was detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in 645 stool samples of AGE cases that were reported in Pará and Amazonas states during 2015–2016. All positive samples were tested for NoV GI and GII by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the amplicons were subjected to genome sequencing. The GII.17-positive samples were retested by PCR using different sets of designed primers which target a highly conserved capsid gene region. Next the amplicons were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed using Bayesian inferences.       Results   Of the 645 samples tested 208 (32.2%) tested were positive for NoV by EIA among which 95 (45.7%) were genotyped. Among the genotyped samples 12 (12.6%) were characterized as GII.17_2014 with the first case detected in November 2015 (1/30 3.3%) and the others in 2016 (11/65 16.9%). All strains found in our study were clustered in clade D (epidemic strain). The uncorrelated log-normal model estimations calculated the rate of evolution for GII-17 strains as 1.95 × 10    − 3 (1.28 × 10    − 3–2.63 × 10    − 3). In total 36 nucleotide changes were observed after analyzing the VP1 sequence among which 28 occurred in the P2 region.          Conclusions   These data demonstrate the evolutionary dynamics in NoV GII.17_2014 strains which indicated high mutation rates with nucleotide substitutions and indels that are related to the elevated levels of antigenic diversity. This partly explains the increase in viral prevalence.    ,
PMC6890994,2-part\_summary\abstracts\129_16_abstract.xml,   Immunocompromised individuals often become symptomatic with infections which are normally fairly asymptomatic in healthy individuals. The particular mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to coinfections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals are multifaceted. ZIKV and other flaviviruses are sensitive to neutralizing antibodies whose production can be limited in HIV-infected individuals but are also sensitive to type I interferons which are expressed at high levels in HIV-infected individuals. Data in this study highlight how individual components of the innate and adaptive immune responses which become perturbed in HIV-infected individuals influence ZIKV infection.  ,
PMC6890994,2-part\_summary\abstracts\130_17_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Flaviviruses are controlled by adaptive immune responses but are exquisitely sensitive to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). How coinfections particularly simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) that induce robust ISG signatures influence flavivirus clearance and pathogenesis is unclear. Here we studied how Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is modulated in SIV-infected nonhuman primates. We measured ZIKV replication cellular ZIKV RNA levels and immune responses in non-SIV-infected and SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) which we infected with ZIKV. Coinfected animals had a 1- to 2-day delay in peak ZIKV viremia which was 30% of that in non-SIV-infected animals. However ZIKV viremia was significantly prolonged in SIV-positive (SIV   +) RMs. ISG levels at the time of ZIKV infection were predictive for lower ZIKV viremia in the SIV   + RMs while prolonged ZIKV viremia was associated with muted and delayed adaptive responses in SIV   + RMs.    ,
PMC6892364,2-part\_summary\abstracts\131_16_abstract.xml,   Infectious disease is still a major threat in the world today. Five decades ago it was considered soon to be eradicated but the adaptation of pathogens to environmental pressure such as antimicrobials encouraged the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. The fight with infectious disease starts with prevention diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis can be upheld by observing the cause of disease under the microscope or detecting the presence of nucleic acid and proteins of the pathogens. The molecular techniques span from classical polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to sequencing the nucleic acid composition. Here we are reviewing the works have been undertaken to utilize a portable sequencer MinION in various aspects of infectious disease management.  ,
PMC6892805,2-part\_summary\abstracts\132_13_abstract.xml,   A key question for infectious disease dynamics is the impact of the climate on future burden. Here we evaluate the climate drivers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) an important determinant of disease in young children. We combine a dataset of county-level observations from the US with state-level observations from Mexico spanning much of the global range of climatological conditions. Using a combination of nonlinear epidemic models with statistical techniques we find consistent patterns of climate drivers at a continental scale explaining latitudinal differences in the dynamics and timing of local epidemics. Strikingly estimated effects of precipitation and humidity on transmission mirror prior results for influenza. We couple our model with projections for future climate to show that temperature-driven increases to humidity may lead to a northward shift in the dynamic patterns observed and that the likelihood of severe outbreaks of RSV hinges on projections for extreme rainfall.  ,

PMC6892822,2-part\_summary\abstracts\134_13_abstract.xml,   Pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) outbreaks occur when strains from animal reservoirs acquire the ability to infect and spread among humans. The molecular basis of this species barrier is incompletely understood. Here we combine metabolic pulse labeling and quantitative proteomics to monitor protein synthesis upon infection of human cells with a human- and a bird-adapted IAV strain and observe striking differences in viral protein synthesis. Most importantly the matrix protein M1 is inefficiently produced by the bird-adapted strain. We show that impaired production of M1 from bird-adapted strains is caused by increased splicing of the M segment RNA to alternative isoforms. Strain-specific M segment splicing is controlled by the 3′ splice site and functionally important for permissive infection.    In silico and biochemical evidence shows that avian-adapted M segments have evolved different conserved RNA structure features than human-adapted sequences. Thus we identify M segment RNA splicing as a viral host range determinant.    ,

PMC6893414,2-part\_summary\abstracts\136_15_abstract.xml,   Recently Zika virus (ZIKV) has attracted much attention in consideration of its association with severe neurological complications including fetal microcephaly. However there are currently no prophylactic vaccines or therapeutic drugs approved for clinical treatments of ZIKV infection. To determine the potential anti-ZIKV inhibitors we screened a library of clinical drugs with good safety profiles. Erythromycin estolate (Ery-Est) one of the macrolide antibiotics was found to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection in different cell types and significantly protect A129 mice from ZIKV-associated neurological signs and mortality. Through further investigation Ery-Est was verified to inhibit ZIKV entry by disrupting the integrity of the viral membrane which resulted in the loss of ZIKV infectivity. Furthermore Ery-Est also showed inhibitory activity against dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Thus Ery-Est may be a promising drug for patients with ZIKV infection particularly pregnant women.  ,
PMC6893437,2-part\_summary\abstracts\137_18_abstract.xml,   Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important animal and human emerging and re-emerging pathogens that are responsible for yearly seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. IAVs cause a wide range of clinical illnesses from relatively mild infections by seasonal strains to acute respiratory distress during infections with highly pathogenic avian IAVs (HPAI). For this study we infected A549 human lung cells with lab prototype A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) a seasonal H1N1 (RV733) the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm09) or with two avian strains an H5N1 HPAI strain or an H7N9 strain that has low pathogenicity in birds but high pathogenicity in humans. We used a newly-developed aptamer-based multiplexed technique (SOMAscan   ®) to examine &gt;1300 human lung cell proteins affected by the different IAV strains and identified more than 500 significantly dysregulated cellular proteins. Our analyses indicated that the avian strains induced more profound changes in the A549 global proteome compared to all tested low-pathogenicity H1N1 strains. The PR8 strain induced a general activation primarily by upregulating many immune molecules the seasonal RV733 and pdm09 strains had minimal effect upon assayed molecules and the avian strains induced significant downregulation primarily in antimicrobial response cardiovascular and post-translational modification systems.    ,
PMC6893470,2-part\_summary\abstracts\138_17_abstract.xml,   We reviewed the literature on the role of temperature in transmission of zoonotic arboviruses. Vector competence is affected by both direct and indirect effects of temperature and generally increases with increasing temperature but results may vary by vector species population and viral strain. Temperature additionally has a significant influence on life history traits of vectors at both immature and adult life stages and for important behaviors such as blood-feeding and mating. Similar to vector competence temperature effects on life history traits can vary by species and population. Vector host and viral distributions are all affected by temperature and are generally expected to change with increased temperatures predicted under climate change. Arboviruses are generally expected to shift poleward and to higher elevations under climate change yet significant variability on fine geographic scales is likely. Temperature effects are generally unimodal with increases in abundance up to an optimum and then decreases at high temperatures. Improved vector distribution information could facilitate future distribution modeling. A wide variety of approaches have been used to model viral distributions although most research has focused on the West Nile virus. Direct temperature effects are frequently observed as are indirect effects such as through droughts where temperature interacts with rainfall. Thermal biology approaches hold much promise for syntheses across viruses vectors and hosts yet future studies must consider the specificity of interactions and the dynamic nature of evolving biological systems.  ,
PMC6893508,2-part\_summary\abstracts\139_16_abstract.xml,   First appearing in 2011 in Northern Europe Schmallenberg virus (SBV) an    Orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup is associated with clinical disease mainly in ruminants such as cattle sheep and goats. The clinical signs are characterized by abortion and congenital deformities in newborns. The virus is transmitted by Culicoides midges of the Obsoletus complex. SBV infection induces a solid protective immunity that persists for at least 4 or 6 years in sheep and cattle respectively. SBV infection can be diagnosed directly by real-time RT-qPCR and virus isolation or indirectly by serological assays. Three vaccines are commercially available in Europe. This article provides a comprehensive literature review on this emerging disease regarding pathogenesis transmission diagnosis control and prevention. This review also highlights that although much has been learned since SBV’s first emergence there are still areas that require further study to devise better mitigation strategies.    ,
PMC6893532,2-part\_summary\abstracts\140_17_abstract.xml,   A novel avian influenza virus (A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018) (H2N9) was isolated from wild birds in South Korea in 2018 and phylogenetic and molecular analyses were conducted on complete gene sequences obtained by next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) virus belonged to the Eurasian countries whereas other internal genes (polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) PB2 nucleoprotein (NP) polymerase acidic protein (PA) matrix protein (M) and non-structural protein (NS)) belonged to the East Asian countries. A monobasic amino acid (PQIEPR/GLF) at the HA cleavage site E627 in the PB2 gene and no deletion of the stalk region in the NA gene indicated that the A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) isolate was a typical low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI). Nucleotide sequence similarity analysis of HA revealed that the highest homology (98.34%) is to that of A/duck/Mongolia/482/2015 (H2N3) and amino acid sequence of NA was closely related to that of A/duck/Bangladesh/8987/2010 (H10N9) (96.45%). In contrast internal genes showed homology higher than 98% compared to those of other isolates derived from duck and wild birds of China or Japan in 2016–2018. The newly isolated A/wild duck/Korea/K102/2018 (H2N9) strain is the first reported avian influenza virus in Korea and may have evolved from multiple genotypes in wild birds and ducks in Mongolia China and Japan.  ,
PMC6893686,2-part\_summary\abstracts\141_19_abstract.xml,   Background: The intensification of trade and travel is linked to the growing number of imported cases of dengue chikungunya or Zika viruses into continental Europe and to the expansion of invasive mosquito species such as    Aedes albopictus and    Aedes japonicus. Local outbreaks have already occurred in several European countries. Very little information exists on the vector competence of native mosquitoes for arboviruses. As such the vectorial status of the nine mosquito species largely established in North-Western Europe (   Aedes cinereus and    Aedes geminus    Aedes cantans    Aedes punctor    Aedes rusticus    Anopheles claviger s.s.    Anopheles plumbeus    Coquillettidia richiardii    Culex pipiens s.l. and    Culiseta annulata) remains mostly unknown. Objectives: To review the vector competence of both invasive and native mosquito populations found in North-Western Europe (i.e. France Belgium Germany United Kingdom Ireland The Netherlands Luxembourg and Switzerland) for dengue chikungunya Zika West Nile and Usutu viruses. Methods: A bibliographical search with research strings addressing mosquito vector competence for considered countries was performed. Results: Out of 6357 results 119 references were related to the vector competence of mosquitoes in Western Europe. Eight species appear to be competent for at least one virus. Conclusions:    Aedes albopictus is responsible for the current outbreaks. The spread of    Aedes albopictus and    Aedes japonicus increases the risk of the autochthonous transmission of these viruses. Although native species could contribute to their transmission more studies are still needed to assess that risk.    ,
PMC6893747,2-part\_summary\abstracts\142_19_abstract.xml,   Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B viruses are globally circulating in seasonal epidemics. Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are permissive for viral isolation and vaccine manufacture. Nevertheless the interplay between influenza B viruses and host microRNAs has not been investigated in this cell line. Therefore the present study aims at high-throughput analysis of canine microRNA profile upon infection of influenza B viruses. Briefly MDCK cells were infected with Victoria or Yamagata lineage at MOI of 0.01. After being harvested at 6 12 and 24 h post infection microRNAs were subjected to high-throughput sequencing based on MiSeq platform (Illumina). The results demonstrated that five microRNAs including cfa-miR-197 cfa-miR-215 cfa-miR361 cfa-miR-1841 and cfa-miR-1842 were overexpressed in both Victoria and Yamagata lineage infections. Interestingly computational prediction showed that karyopherin alpha 6 (KPNA6) was targeted by cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215. Moreover the binding sites of both microRNAs were assessed by 3′-UTR reporter assay. The results showed that only cfa-miR-197 could bind to the target sites of KPNA6 leading to suppressing luciferase activity. Additionally silencing of KPNA6 was confirmed by overexpression of cfa-miR-197. This study provides canine microRNA responses to seasonal influenza B viruses suggesting that virus-mediated microRNAs might play crucial roles in host gene regulation.  ,

PMC6893791,2-part\_summary\abstracts\144_15_abstract.xml,   Measles remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide among vaccine preventable diseases. Recent decline in vaccination coverage resulted in re-emergence of measles outbreaks. Measles virus (MeV) infection causes an acute systemic disease associated in certain cases with central nervous system (CNS) infection leading to lethal neurological disease. Early following MeV infection some patients develop acute post-infectious measles encephalitis (APME) which is not associated with direct infection of the brain. MeV can also infect the CNS and cause sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in immunocompetent people or measles inclusion-body encephalitis (MIBE) in immunocompromised patients. To date cellular and molecular mechanisms governing CNS invasion are still poorly understood. Moreover the known MeV entry receptors are not expressed in the CNS and how MeV enters and spreads in the brain is not fully understood. Different antiviral treatments have been tested and validated in vitro ex vivo and in vivo mainly in small animal models. Most treatments have high efficacy at preventing infection but their effectiveness after CNS manifestations remains to be evaluated. This review describes MeV neural infection and current most advanced therapeutic approaches potentially applicable to treat MeV CNS infection.  ,
PMC6893968,2-part\_summary\abstracts\145_14_abstract.xml,          Antiviral therapy is crucial for the circumvention of viral epidemics. The unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV. In the present investigation in silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (   5a–   f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out. nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding pocket of the macrodomain. The 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO) of CHIKV. Compounds    5c and    5d showed docking scores of −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol   –1 respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm their (   5a–   f) antiviral potential against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and was found to be &lt;100 μM. The compounds    5c and    5d showed their inhibitory potential for CHIKV which was determined through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay which show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 μM concentration of the compounds respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of    5c and    5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 μM concentration of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration respectively in cells with CHIKV infection. Further the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants leading to remedial management to preclude CHIKV infection.    ,
PMC6894787,2-part\_summary\abstracts\146_21_abstract.xml,      Background   Dengue fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas especially Southeast Asia. International air travel facilitates the spread of dengue across and within borders. To date no predictive factors have been established for assessing risk of dengue among febrile travelers.       Methods   Since 2006 Taiwan has operated a program of infrared thermometer–based non-contact active surveillance at Taoyuan International Airport (TPE). All inbound passengers from dengue-endemic countries who are febrile (tympanic temperature ≥38°C) undergo routine laboratory testing for dengue. We analyzed clinical and epidemiological characteristics of all tested passengers entering Taiwan via TPE in 2011 to identify the predictive factors of dengue infection.       Results   In 2011 of the 3719 febrile passengers from dengue-endemic countries 74 (2.0%) had laboratory-confirmed dengue infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that those who were aged ≥60 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6–29.6) and had self-reported fever (aOR 2.5; 95% CI 1.5–4.1) skin rashes (aOR 11.0; 95% CI 3.4–35.1) or a tympanic temperature ≥39°C (aOR 2.9; 95% CI 1.7–4.9) were significantly more likely to have dengue (all     p values &lt; 0.05). Compared with travelers who stayed in dengue-endemic countries for ≤7 days those who traveled 8–14 15–21 22–28 and ≥29 days were also more likely to be infected (aORs of 10.2 14.9 39.0 and 12.0 respectively).          Conclusion   These clinical and epidemiological features can facilitate timely recognition and diagnosis of imported dengue in febrile inbound passengers and therefore help prevent domestic transmission of dengue virus.    ,
PMC6895170,2-part\_summary\abstracts\147_13_abstract.xml,   At the sequence level it is hard to describe the complexity of viruses which allows them to challenge host immune system some for a few weeks and others up to a complete compromise. Paradoxically viral genomes are both complex and simple. Complex because amino acid mutation rates are very high and yet viruses remain functional. Simple because they have barely around 10 types of proteins so viral protein-protein interaction networks are not insightful. In this work we use fine-grained amino acid level information and their evolutionary characteristics obtained from large-scale genomic data to develop a statistical panel towards the goal of developing quantitative descriptors for the biological complexity of viruses. Networks were constructed from pairwise covariation of amino acids and were statistically analyzed. Three differentiating factors arise: predominantly intra- vs inter-protein covariance relations the nature of the node degree distribution and network density. Interestingly the covariance relations were primarily intra-protein in avian influenza and inter-protein in HIV. The degree distributions showed two universality classes: a power-law with exponent −1 in HIV and avian-influenza random behavior in human flu and dengue. The calculated covariance network density correlates well with the mortality strengths of viruses on the viral-Richter scale. These observations suggest the potential utility of the statistical metrics for describing the covariance patterns in viruses. Our host-virus interaction analysis point to the possibility that host proteins which can interact with multiple viral proteins may be responsible for shaping the inter-protein covariance relations. With the available data it appears that network density might be a surrogate for the virus Richter scale however the hypothesis needs a re-examination when large scale complete genome data for more viruses becomes available.  ,
PMC6896411,2-part\_summary\abstracts\148_15_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Prevailing agro-ecological conditions and intermingling of human and animals in intensive farms in urban and peri-urban areas in Africa favour cross species transmission of pathogens at the human-animal interface. However molecular epidemiology studies of zoonotic swine influenza viruses in this region are limited. In this study isolates of pandemic influenza virus (H1N1pdm09) obtained from pigs in Nigeria were fully sequenced. BLAST of swine influenza virus genes from Nigeria was carried out in GenBank and gene alignment was done using MEGA version 7. Maximum likelihood method (PhyML program) was used to determine gene evolutionary relationships with other viruses and phylogenetic trees were constructed to infer genomic clusters and relationship. Swine influenza viruses isolated and sequenced in this study were monophyletic and 99% congenetic with human isolates from Nigeria Cameroon Ghana and USA suggesting reverse zoonotic transmission from humans to pigs in intensive husbandry. A Q240R and S31N substitution among others were detected in the haemagglutinin and matrix genes respectively indicating potentials for mutations during interspecies co-mingling and transmission. The A/H1N1pdm09 viruses circulating in pigs that are also exposed to avian influenza in the same epidemiological zones could engender emergence of novel viruses with zoonotic or pandemic potential requiring enhanced surveillance and monitoring.  ,
PMC6896758,2-part\_summary\abstracts\149_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Diarrhoea is a major cause of death in neonate pigs and most of the viruses that cause it are RNA viruses. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) deeply characterize the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level. The diversity of RNA viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms plus 4 samples from non-diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by NGS. Samples were selected among the cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the     Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Barcelona Spain) and     Universidad de León (León Spain).          Results   The analyses identified the presence of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of RNA viruses. Most samples were co-infected by several viruses.     Kobuvirus and     Rotavirus were more commonly reported with     Sapovirus     Astrovirus 3 4 and 5     Enterovirus G     Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus Pasivirus and     Posavirus being less frequently detected. Most sequences showed a low identity with the sequences deposited in GenBank allowing us to propose several new VP4 and VP7 genotypes for     Rotavirus B and     Rotavirus C.          Conclusions   Among the cases analysed Rotaviruses were the main aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonate pigs. Besides in a small number of cases     Kobuvirus and     Sapovirus may also have an aetiological role. Even most animals were co-infected in early life the association with enteric disease among the other examined viruses was unclear. The NGS method applied successfully characterized the RNA virome present in faeces and detected a high level of unreported intraspecific diversity.       ,
PMC6896812,2-part\_summary\abstracts\150_18_abstract.xml,      Objective:   to analyze predictors of inconsistent condom use among HIV-positive people with sexual immunodeficiency virus serodifferent sexual partnership.       Method:   cross-sectional analytical study with a consecutive non-probabilistic sample consisting of people living with the human immunodeficiency virus with serodifferent sexual partnership and who were in outpatient clinical follow-up. Data were collected through individual interviews guided by a semi-structured questionnaire and subsequently analyzed with bivariate analysis and logistic regression.       Results:   Seven variables were independently associated with inconsistent condom use. Schooling less than 11 years of schooling (4.9 [2.4-10.1]) having multiple partnerships (5.0 [1.3-19.6]) using alcohol (2.1 [1.1 -4.4]) or other drugs (2.8 [1.2-6.3]) do not receive advice from a healthcare professional (2.0 [1.1-3.9]) have no knowledge of treatment as prevention (3.0 [12-69]) and not knowing that undetectable viral load reduces the risk of human immunodeficiency virus transmission (3.8 [11-137]) were predictors for inconsistent condom use.       Conclusion:   The study showed that psychosocial factors interfere with consistent condom use between serodifferent partnerships. Thus it is highlighted that there is a need for comprehensive interventions that include the integration of clinical and psychosocial care.     ,
PMC6897401,2-part\_summary\abstracts\151_34_abstract.xml,   Since the ignition of the HIV-1 group M pandemic in the beginning of the 20th century group M lineages have spread heterogeneously throughout the world. Subtype C spread rapidly through sub-Saharan Africa and is currently the dominant HIV lineage worldwide. Yet the epidemiological and evolutionary circumstances that contributed to its epidemiological expansion remain poorly understood. Here we analyse 346 novel    pol sequences from the DRC to compare the evolutionary dynamics of the main HIV-1 lineages subtypes A1 C and D. Our results place the origins of subtype C in the 1950s in Mbuji-Mayi the mining city of southern DRC while subtypes A1 and D emerged in the capital city of Kinshasa and subtypes H and J in the less accessible port city of Matadi. Following a 15-year period of local transmission in southern DRC we find that subtype C spread at least three-fold faster than other subtypes circulating in Central and East Africa. In conclusion our results shed light on the origins of HIV-1 main lineages and suggest that socio-historical rather than evolutionary factors may have determined the epidemiological fate of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa.    ,
PMC6897401,2-part\_summary\abstracts\152_35_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Since it emerged in human populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) around 1920 HIV diversified in several virus lineages that spread across sub-Saharan Africa and beyond. While some lineages are rare and remain geographically confined to certain regions e.g. subtypes H and J others expanded rapidly across sub-Saharan Africa e.g. subtype C. Here we conducted a spatial genetic analysis of the three main HIV-1 virus lineages subtypes A1 C and D that co-circulate across 20 locations in central and East Africa to investigate their spatial and temporal origins and their mode of spread across comparable geographic areas. We find that subtype C currently the dominant lineage in sub-Saharan Africa emerged in the southern DRC mining region and spread 3-fold faster than other co-circulating lineages. Our study uncovers distinct patterns of spread of the main HIV-1 subtypes in a region that covers nearly half of all infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa.  ,
PMC6902501,2-part\_summary\abstracts\153_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a leading cause of childhood viral encephalitis both at global level and in China. Vaccination is recommended as a key strategy to control JE. In China most JE cases have been reported in southwest provinces which include Yunnan. In this study we quantify the epidemiological shift of JE in Yunnan Province from 2005 to 2017 covering before and after the introduction of JE vaccination into routine Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 2007.       Methods   We used routinely collected data in the case-based JE surveillance system from 2005 through 2017 in Yunnan. Cases were reported from hospital and county-level Centers for Disease Control in line with the National JE Surveillance Guideline. Epidemiological data were extracted analysed and presented in appropriate ways. Immunization coverage was estimated from actual JE doses administered and new births for each year.       Results   A total 4780 JE cases (3077 laboratory-confirmed 1266 clinical and 437 suspected) were reported in the study period. Incidence of JE (per 100 000 population) increased from 0.95 in 2005 to 1.69 in 2007. With increase in vaccination coverage incidence rates decreased steadily from 1.16 in 2009 to 0.17 in 2017. However seasonality remained similar across the years peaking in June–September. Banna (bordering Myanmar and Laos) Dehong (bordering Myanmar) and Zhaotong (an inland prefecture) had the highest incidence rates of 2.3 1.9 and 1.6 respectively. 97% of all cases were among local residents. As vaccination coverage increased (and incidence decreased) proportion of JE cases among children &lt; 10 years old decreased from 70% in 2005 to 32% in 2017 while that among adults ≥20 years old increased from 12 to 48%. There were a large number of JE cases with unknown treatment outcomes especially in the earlier years of the surveillance system.       Conclusions   The 13-year JE surveillance data in Yunnan Province showed dramatic decrease of total incidence and a shift from children to adults. Improving vaccination coverage including access to adults at risk and strengthening the JE surveillance system is needed to further control or eliminate JE in the province.    ,
PMC6904267,2-part\_summary\abstracts\154_13_abstract.xml,   B1-type human adenoviruses (HAdVs) HAdV-3 HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 have caused epidemics in North America Asia and Europe. However to date no adenovirus vaccines or antiviral drugs have been approved for general use. In the present work a scFv-phage immune library was constructed and mouse monoclonal antibody (MMAb) 10G12 was obtained through selection. 10G12 is specific for HAdV-7 and binds the hexon loop1 and loop2 (LP12) resulting in strong neutralization activity against HAdV-7. Additionally it is stable in serum and buffer at various pH values. The findings provide insight into adenovirus and antibody responses and may facilitate the design and development of adenovirus vaccines and antiviral drugs.  ,
PMC6905541,2-part\_summary\abstracts\155_20_abstract.xml,   The Asian/American genotype of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) has been introduced in Brazil through the state of Rio de Janeiro around 1990 and since then it has been spreading and evolving leading to several waves of dengue epidemics throughout the country that cause a major public health problem. Of particular interest has been the epidemic of 2008 whose highest impact was evidenced in the state of Rio de Janeiro with a higher number of severe cases and mortality rate compared to previous outbreaks. Interestingly no circulation of DENV-2 was witnessed in this region during the preceding 9-year period. By early 2010 phylogenetic analysis of the 2008 epidemic strain revealed that the outbreak was caused by a new viral lineage of the Asian/American genotype which was pointed as responsible for the outbreak severity as well. The same scenario is repeating in 2019 in this state; however only a few cases have been detected yet. To provide information that helps to the understanding of DENV-2 dynamics in the state of Rio de Janeiro and thereafter contribute to public health control and prevention actions we employed phylogenetic studies combined with temporal and dynamics geographical features to determine the origin of the current viral strain. To this effect we analyzed a region of 1626 nucleotides entailing the Envelope/NS1 viral genes. Our study reveals that the current strain belongs to the same lineage that caused the 2008 outbreak however it is phylogenetically distant from any Brazilian strain identified so far. Indeed it seemed to be originated in Puerto Rico around 2002 and has been introduced into the state in late 2018. Taking into account that no DENV-2 case was reported over the last decade in the state (representing a whole susceptible children generation) and the fact that a new viral strain may be causing current dengue infections these results will be influential in strengthening dengue surveillance and disease control mitigating the potential epidemiological consequences of virus spread.  ,

PMC6906739,2-part\_summary\abstracts\157_18_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Due to the limitations of effective treatments avian influenza A H5N1 virus is the most lethal influenza virus strain that causes severe acute lung injury (ALI). To develop effective drugs ameliorating H5N1-induced ALI we explore an RNA interference (RNAi) screening method to monitor changes in cell death induced by H5N1 infection. We performed RNAi screening on 19424 genes in A549 lung epithelial cells and examined cell death induced by H5N1 infection. These screens identified 1137 host genes for which knockdown altered cell viability by over 20%. DrugBank searches of these 1137 host genes identified 146 validated druggable target genes with 372 drug candidates. We obtained 104 commercially available drugs with 65 validated target genes and examined their improvement of cell viability following H5N1 infection. We identified 28 drugs that could significantly recover cell viability following H5N1 infection and tested 10 in an H5N1-induced-ALI mouse model. The neurological drug ifenprodil and the anticancer drug flavopiridol markedly decreased leukocyte infiltration and lung injury scores in infected mouse lungs significantly ameliorated edema in infected mouse lung tissues and significantly improved the survival of H5N1-infected mice. Ifenprodil is an antagonist of the N-methyl-   d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor which is linked to inflammation and lung injury. Flavopiridol is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) which is linked to leukocyte migration and lung injury. These results suggest that ifenprodil and flavopiridol represent novel remedies against potential H5N1 epidemics in addition to their proven indications. Furthermore our strategy for identifying repurposable drugs could be a general approach for other diseases.       IMPORTANCE Drug repurposing is a quick and economical strategy for developing new therapies with approved drugs.

PMC6906816,2-part\_summary\abstracts\158_15_abstract.xml,   The external environment directly influences human health. However what happens inside? This work deals with the effect that the interior thermal variables have on the propagation of respiratory diseases and focused on the relation of the temperature and relative humidity inside social housing in the 1040 parishes of Ecuador and the transmission of influenza. On the one hand historical weather-related variables were used to simulate and estimate the interior conditions and thresholds on temperature and humidity were determined. On the other hand the health-related variable was determined by analyzing the statistics corresponding to the influenza and viral pneumonia in 2009 since that year was critical for these diseases; the data were divided by month for each parish. Finally the correlation of these variables determines the relative importance of the interior conditions on the respiratory health of its inhabitants. The preliminary results indicate that the places with the lowest temperatures and relative humidity could favor the virus transmission. Also the analysis indicated that respiratory diseases increase in August and October. In this way it is clear that social housing projects in Ecuador require a study which guarantees not only energy efficiency and sustainability related issues but also the well-being of their inhabitants.  ,
PMC6908683,2-part\_summary\abstracts\159_13_abstract.xml,   An important goal of the Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine is to prevent a congenital syndrome in fetuses of pregnant women but studies directly evaluating maternal vaccination for ZIKV are lacking. Here we report maternal vaccination using a live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine (3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV) in a pregnant mouse model. Maternal immunization with 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV does not cause any adverse effects on pregnancy fetal development or offspring behavior. One maternal immunization fully protects dams against ZIKV infection and in utero transmission. Although neutralizing antibody alone is sufficient to prevent in utero transmission a higher neutralizing titer is required to protect pregnant mice against in utero transmission than that required to protect non-pregnant mice against viral infection. The immunized dams transfer maternal antibodies to pups which protect neonates against ZIKV infection. Notably pregnancy weakens maternal T cell response to 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV vaccination. Our results suggest that besides vaccinating non-pregnant individuals 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV may also be considered for maternal vaccination.  ,

Others such as Murray Valley encephalitis (MVEV) and Kunjin (KUNV) virus infections may be diagnosed by specialist reference laboratories. Although Alfuy (ALFV) Edge Hill (EHV) Kokobera (KOKV) Sindbis (SINV) and Stratford (STRV) viruses are known to infect humans in Australia all are considered ‘neglected.’ The aetiologies of approximately half of all cases of undifferentiated febrile illnesses (UFI) in Australia are unknown and it is possible that some of these are caused by the neglected arboviruses. The aims of this study were to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against several neglected Australian arboviruses among residents of Queensland north-east Australia and to ascertain whether any are associated with UFI. One hundred age- and sex-stratified human plasma samples from blood donors in Queensland were tested to determine the prevalence of neutralising antibodies against ALFV BFV EHV KOKV KUNV MVEV RRV SINV and STRV. The seroconversion rates for RRV and BFV infections were 1.3 and 0.3% per annum respectively. The prevalence of antibodies against ALFV was too low to enable estimates of annual infection rates to be determined but the values obtained for other neglected viruses EHV (0.1%) KOKV (0.05%) and STRV (0.05%) indicated that the numbers of clinical infections occurring with these agents are likely to be extremely small. This was borne out by the observation that only 5.7% of a panel of 492 acute phase sera from UFI patients contained IgM against any of these arboviruses as detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. While none of these neglected arboviruses appear to be a cause of a significant number of UFIs in Australia at this time each has the potential to emerge as a significant human pathogen if there are changes to their ecological niches.    ,
PMC6912104,2-part\_summary\abstracts\162_19_abstract.xml,   Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause seasonal epidemics which result in an important health and economic burden. Wild aquatic birds are the natural host of IAV. However IAV can infect diverse hosts including humans domestic poultry pigs and others. IAVs circulating in animals occasionally cross the species barrier infecting humans which results in mild to very severe disease. In some cases these viruses can acquire the ability to be transmitted among humans and initiate a pandemic. The nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein of IAV is an important antagonist of the innate immune response.

PMC6912104,2-part\_summary\abstracts\163_20_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  The influenza A virus (IAV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) contributes to disease pathogenesis through the inhibition of host innate immune responses. Dendritic cells (DCs) release interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines and promote adaptive immunity upon viral infection. In order to characterize the strain-specific effects of IAV NS1 on human DC activation we infected human DCs with a panel of recombinant viruses with the same backbone (A/Puerto Rico/08/1934) expressing different NS1 proteins from human and avian origin. We found that these viruses induced a clearly distinct phenotype in DCs. Specifically viruses expressing NS1 from human IAV (either H1N1 or H3N2) induced higher levels of expression of type I (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III (IFN-λ1 to IFNλ3) IFNs than viruses expressing avian IAV NS1 proteins (H5N1 H7N9 and H7N2) but the differences observed in the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) were not significant. In addition using imaging flow cytometry we found that human and avian NS1 proteins segregate based on their subcellular trafficking dynamics which might be associated with the different innate immune profile induced in DCs by viruses expressing those NS1 proteins. Innate immune responses induced by our panel of IAV recombinant viruses were also characterized in normal human bronchial epithelial cells and the results were consistent with those in DCs. Altogether our results reveal an increased ability of NS1 from avian viruses to antagonize innate immune responses in human primary cells compared to the ability of NS1 from human viruses which could contribute to the severe disease induced by avian IAV in humans.     IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause seasonal epidemics which result in an important health and economic burden.

PMC6912272,2-part\_summary\abstracts\164_15_abstract.xml,   Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging human mosquito-transmitted pathogen of global concern known to be associated with complications such as congenital defects and neurological disorders in adults. ZIKV infection is associated with induction of cell death. However previous studies suggest that the virally induced apoptosis occurs at a slower rate compared to the course of viral production. In this present study we investigated the capacity of ZIKV to delay host cell apoptosis. We provide evidence that ZIKV has the ability to interfere with apoptosis whether it is intrinsically or extrinsically induced. In cells expressing viral replicon-type constructions we show that this control is achieved through replication. Finally our work highlights an important role for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein in the ability of ZIKV to control apoptotic pathways avoiding premature cell death and thereby promoting virus replication in the host-cell.  ,
PMC6912530,2-part\_summary\abstracts\165_19_abstract.xml,   Emerging infections of mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) pose an increasing threat to human health as documented over the recent years in South Pacific islands and the Americas in recent years. To better understand molecular mechanisms underlying the increase in human cases with severe pathologies we recently demonstrated the functional roles of structural proteins capsid (C) pre-membrane (prM) and envelop (E) of ZIKV epidemic strains with the initiation of viral infection in human cells. Specifically we found that the C-prM region contributes to permissiveness of human host cells to ZIKV infection and ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects whereas the E protein is associated with viral attachment and early infection. In the present study we further characterize ZIKV E proteins by investigating the roles of residues isoleucine 152 (Ile152) threonine 156 (Thr156) and histidine 158 (His158) (i.e. the E-152/156/158 residues) which surround a unique    N-glycosylation site (E-154) in permissiveness of human host cells to epidemic ZIKV infection. For comparison purpose we generated mutant molecular clones of epidemic BeH819015 (BR15) and historical MR766-NIID (MR766) strains that carry each other’s E-152/156/158 residues respectively. We observed that the BR15 mutant containing the E-152/156/158 residues from MR766 was less infectious in A549-Dual™ cells than parental virus. In contrast the MR766 mutant containing E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 displayed increased infectivity. The observed differences in infectivity were however not correlated with changes in viral binding onto host-cells or cellular responses to viral infection. Instead the E-152/156/158 residues from BR15 were associated with an increased efficiency of viral membrane fusion inside infected cells due to conformational changes of E protein that enhance exposure of the fusion loop. Our data highlight an important contribution of E-152/156/158 residues to the early steps of ZIKV infection in human cells.    ,

Kampo medicine is a traditional medicine that is used clinically for treatment of various diseases in Japan and other East Asian countries. We evaluated the effects of the Kampo drugs maoto kakkonto senkyuchachosan jinkokato and bakumondoto which are prescribed for treatment of respiratory symptoms including symptoms caused by influenza on influenza virus replication in cultured cells. Culture media of influenza virus-infected MDCK(+) cells were tested for hemagglutination and infectivity at 24 h after the addition of Kampo drugs at various concentrations and four of the five Kampo drugs were found to inhibit virus release to the culture media. These drugs inactivated virus infectivity not by acting on virus particles but by acting on virus-infected cells. In addition when six crude drugs (   Atractylodis lanceae rhizome    Citri unshiu pericarpium    Cnidii rhizome    Glycyrrhizae radix    Rehmanniae radix and    Saposhnikoviae radix) that constitute the effective Kampo drugs were examined the strongest activity was found for    Glycyrrhizae radix (IC   50 = 0.27 mg/ml) which selectively suppressed viral protein synthesis. Since    Glycyrrhizae radix is contained in many Kampo drugs it may give anti-influenza virus activity to a broad range of Kampo drugs.    ,

Cases of Sindbis fever occur in the north while the flaviviruses are reported from southern Europe. In this study 7933    Culex pipiens/torrentium mosquitoes from southern Sweden were screened by RTqPCR for these viruses. None of the mosquitoes were positive for viral RNA. The importance of mosquito species composition is discussed as a potential explanation to the lack of detection of mosquito-borne viruses in southern Sweden. However continued surveillance of mosquitoes for Flaviviruses would be valuable as an early warning for public health awareness.    ,
PMC6913923,2-part\_summary\abstracts\168_20_abstract.xml,      Background   Orthohantavirus infection is a neglected global health problem affecting approximately 200000 people/year spread by rodent hosts and associated to fatal human diseases such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and orthohantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Circulation of HFRS-associated orthohantaviruses such as Seoul Gou Amur Dobrava and Hantaan are supposed to be restricted to Eurasian countries even though their hosts can be a worldwide distribution. Few confirmed HFRS orthohantavirus infections in humans have been reported in American countries but due to lower medical awareness of the symptoms of this zoonosis it could be associated to viral underreporting or to misdiagnosis with several tropical hemorrhagic diseases. Serological evidence of orthohantavirus infections using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of immunoglobulin M and G against recombinant nucleoprotein protein remains as an essential assay for viral surveillance. In this study we aimed to identify     in silico immunogenic B-cell linear epitopes present on orthohantavirus nucleoprotein that are exclusive to HFRS-related species.          Methodology/Principal findings       In silico analysis were performed using     Seoul orthohantavirus nucleoprotein (SHNP) sequence as a model. Linear B-cell-epitopes on SHNP and its immunogenicity were predicted by BepiPred-2.0 and Vaxijen algorithms respectively. The conservancy of predicted epitopes was compared with the most clinically relevant HFRS or HCPS-associated orthohantavirus aiming to identify specific sequences from HFRS-orthohantavirus. Peptide validation was carried out by ELISA using Balb/c mice sera immunized with purified recombinant rSHNP. Peptides cross-reactivity against HCPS orthohantavirus were evaluated using immunized sera from mice injected with recombinant Juquitiba orthohantavirus nucleoprotein (rJHNP).          Conclusion/Significance       In silico analysis revealed nine potential immunogenic linear B-cell epitopes from SHNP; among them SHNP    (G72-D110) and SHNP    (P251-D264) showed a high degree of sequence conservation among HFRS-related orthohantavirus and were experimentally validated against rSHNP-IMS and negatively validated against rJHNP-IMS. Taken together we identified and validated two potential antigenic B-cell epitopes on SHNP which were conserved among HFRS-associated orthohantavirus and could be applied to the development of novel immunodiagnostic tools for orthohantavirus surveillance.       ,
PMC6913923,2-part\_summary\abstracts\169_21_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Orthohantaviruses are the etiological agents of serious rodent-borne neglected human diseases named as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and orthohantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These distinct clinical manifestations of disease are related to specific orthohantavirus species and it is believed that HFRS-associated orthohantavirus mainly circulate into Old World (Asia and Europe) whereas HCPS-associated orthohantaviruses are predominant into New World countries (Americas). However since    Seoul orthohantavirus associated with HFRS was isolated in America and its natural host (   Rattus norvegicus) are widely distributed around the world it raised the question if the viral underreporting is associated to lower medical awareness of the symptoms or if it is associated to misdiagnosis with other tropical hemorrhagic diseases (leptospirosis yellow fever). In this context considering that the HFRS are clinically indistinguishable from order hemorrhagic diseases and that serological tests are predominantly based on serology tests against nucleoprotein a highly conserved protein among different orthohantavirus we hypothesize that current available tests do not detect all HFRS-associated orthohantavirus. In this sense; we aimed to identify B-cell linear epitopes exclusively conserved on HFRS-associated orthohantavirus nucleoprotein using a combination of    in silico and experimental approaches to identify targets that could be applied in the development of novel immunodiagnostic tools able to identify different HFRS orthohantavirus species.    ,
PMC6914775,2-part\_summary\abstracts\170_13_abstract.xml,   The basic reproductive number (   R   0) is a fundamental measure used to quantify the transmission potential of an epidemic in public health practice. However    R   0 cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. A time-varying effective reproductive number    R       t    can provide more information because it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission. However since it neglects individual-level geographical variations in exposure risk    R       t    may smooth out interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential obscure high-risk spreaders and hence hamper the effectiveness of control measures in spatial dimension. Therefore this study proposes a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted (time-varying) reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals. This new method estimates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (   R       j   ) and a summarized indicator for population-level time-varying reproductive number (   R       t   ). Data from the five most severe dengue outbreaks in southern Taiwan from 1998–2015 were used to demonstrate the ability of the method to highlight early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission. Our results show spatial heterogeneity in the transmission potential of dengue among individuals and identify the spreaders with the highest    R       j    during the epidemic period. The results also reveal that super-spreaders are usually early spreaders that locate at the edges of the epidemic foci which means that these cases could be the drivers of the expansion of the outbreak. Therefore our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges of the epidemic foci which could be weak spots in disease control and prevention.    ,

These viruses are of the same family share a vector and may interact competitively or synergistically through human immune responses. We examine dengue incidence from Brazil and Colombia before during and after the Zika epidemic. We find evidence that dengue incidence was atypically low in 2017 in both countries. We investigate whether subnational Zika incidence is associated with changes in dengue incidence and find mixed results. Using simulations with multiple assumptions of interactions between DENV and ZIKV we find cross-protection suppresses incidence of dengue following Zika outbreaks and low periods of dengue incidence are followed by resurgence. Our simulations suggest correlations in DENV and ZIKV reproduction numbers could complicate associations between ZIKV incidence and post-ZIKV DENV incidence and that periods of low dengue incidence are followed by large increases in dengue incidence.  ,

PMC6917806,2-part\_summary\abstracts\173_13_abstract.xml,   The history of influenza H1 virus was re-evaluated by applying a new methodology to sequencing data; this objective method enables comparisons among viral types. The approach led to the segregation of all segments of swine and human viruses into three distinct groups: two of them included the pandemic 1977 and 2009 human viruses and the remaining group may be new in humans. These three groups might have originated from avian viruses and drifted out independently. Genome shifts occurred occasionally among swine viruses; however distances between avian and swine/human viruses negated the existence of direct shifts from avian viruses. In humans only one or two viruses appeared each year which suggests the presence of competition among viruses that migrated freely. All segments drifted continuously under certain rules and constant velocity. Viruses that had caused an outbreak did not appear again over subsequent decades which may mean populations had become immune to such viruses. In contrast the viruses in livestock were rather conserved and maintained unique strains in small separate areas. Such collections of swine strains included human segments which could become an epidemic in the future.  ,

Currently there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for human use to combat    CHIKV infections. In this study we explored the feasibility of using an anti‐   CHIKV monoclonal antibody (   mAb) produced in wild‐type (   WT) and glycoengineered (∆   XFT)    Nicotiana benthamiana plants in treating    CHIKV infection in a mouse model.    CHIKV mAb was efficiently expressed and assembled in plant leaves and enriched to homogeneity by a simple purification scheme. While    mAb produced in ∆   XFT carried a single N‐glycan species at the Fc domain namely GnGn structures    WT produced    mAb exhibited a mixture of N‐glycans including the typical plant GnGn   XF   3 glycans accompanied by incompletely processed and oligomannosidic structures. Both    WT and ∆   XFT plant‐produced    mAbs demonstrated potent    in vitro neutralization activity against    CHIKV. Notably both    mAb glycoforms showed    in vivo efficacy in a mouse model with a slight increased efficacy by the ∆   XFT‐produced    mAbs. This is the first report of the efficacy of plant‐produced    mAbs against    CHIKV which demonstrates the ability of using plants as an effective platform for production of functionally active    CHIKV mAbs and implies optimization of    in vivo activity by controlling Fc glycosylation.    ,
PMC6919333,2-part\_summary\abstracts\175_22_abstract.xml,      Objectives   Severe lower respiratory tract infection caused by adenovirus is well described in immunocompromised hosts and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. We compare and contrast the clinical presentation radiological and virological features of two rare cases in immunocompetent adults admitted to an intensive care unit in a large teaching hospital in North West England. We then provide a concise comprehensive literature review.       Methods   The first case was a 35-year old female asthmatic who presented with respiratory distress and pneumonitis during peak influenza season and recovered after a prolonged hospital stay. The second case was a 73-year old male who presented with diarrhoea vomiting and general malaise outside of influenza season developed respiratory compromise and died. Adenovirus type 7 was identified in bronchoalveolar lavages and plasma samples of both patients each of whom received cidofovir. No other infectious aetiology was identified.       Results   Clinical and radiological features of severe lower respiratory tract adenoviral infection are similar to other infectious causes of pneumonia and ARDS including severe influenza. This can create diagnostic uncertainty especially during influenza season. Positive adenovirus polymerase chain reaction results can support a diagnosis of severe lower respiratory tract adenovirus infection in patients with a clinically compatible syndrome and no other identified aetiology with higher viral loads being associated with worse prognosis. Although treatment is predominantly supportive early use of cidofovir may improve outcomes.       Conclusions   These rare cases highlight that severe lower respiratory tract adenoviral infection should be considered in the differential diagnoses of immunocompetent patients presenting with pneumonia and ARDS.    ,

PMC6920831,2-part\_summary\abstracts\177_15_abstract.xml,   Obesity is now a prevalent disease worldwide and has a multi-factorial etiology. Several viruses or virus-like agents including members of adenoviridae herpesviridae slow virus (prion) and hepatitides have been associated with obesity; meanwhile obese patients are shown to be more susceptible to viral infections such as during influenza and dengue epidemics. We examined the co-factorial role of viral infections particularly of the persistent cases in synergy with high-fat diet in induction of obesity. Antiviral interferons (IFNs) as key immune regulators against viral infections and in autoimmunity emerge to be a pivotal player in the regulation of adipogenesis. In this review we examine the recent evidence indicating that gut microbiota uphold intrinsic IFN signaling which is extensively involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. However the prolonged IFN responses during persistent viral infections and obesogenesis comprise reciprocal causality between virus susceptibility and obesity. Furthermore some IFN subtypes have shown therapeutic potency in their anti-inflammation and anti-obesity activity.  ,
PMC6921433,2-part\_summary\abstracts\178_14_abstract.xml,   Human challenge trials (HCTs) deliberately infect participants in order to test vaccines and treatments in a controlled setting rather than enrolling individuals with natural exposure to a disease. HCTs are therefore potentially powerful tools to prepare for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Yet when an infectious disease is emerging there is often substantial risk and uncertainty about its complications and few available interventions making an HCT ethically complex. In light of the need to consider ethical issues proactively as a part of epidemic preparedness we use the case of a Zika virus HCT to explore whether and when HCTs might be ethically justified to combat emerging infectious diseases. We conclude that emerging infectious diseases could be appropriate candidates for HCTs and we identify relevant considerations and provide a case example to illustrate when they might be ethically acceptable.  ,
PMC6923192,2-part\_summary\abstracts\179_15_abstract.xml,   Early detection of emerging foreign animal diseases is critical to pathogen surveillance and control programs. Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and African swine fever virus (ASFV) represent three taxonomically and ecologically diverse vector-borne viruses with the potential to be introduced to the United States. To promote preparedness for such an event we reviewed the current surveillance strategies and diagnostic tools in practice around the world for these emerging viruses and summarized key points pertaining to the availability of existing guidelines and strategic approaches for early detection surveillance and disease management activities. We compare and contrast the surveillance and management approaches of these three diverse agents of disease as case studies to emphasize the importance of the ecological context and biology of vectors and vertebrate hosts. The information presented in this review will inform stakeholders of the current state of surveillance approaches against these transboundary foreign animal disease which threaten the United States.  ,
PMC6923871,2-part\_summary\abstracts\180_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Live-cell imaging is a powerful tool for visualization of the spatio-temporal dynamics of moving signals in living cells. Although this technique can be utilized to visualize nucleocapsid transport in Marburg virus (MARV)- or Ebola virus-infected cells the experiments require biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) laboratories which are restricted to trained and authorized individuals.       Methods   To overcome this limitation we developed a live-cell imaging system to visualize MARV nucleocapsid-like structures using fluorescence-conjugated viral proteins which can be conducted outside BSL-4 laboratories.       Results   Our experiments revealed that nucleocapsid-like structures have similar transport characteristics to those of nucleocapsids observed in MARV-infected cells both of which are mediated by actin polymerization.       Conclusions   We developed a non-infectious live cell imaging system to visualize intracellular transport of MARV nucleocapsid-like structures. This system provides a safe platform to evaluate antiviral drugs that inhibit MARV nucleocapsid transport.    ,

PMC6925274,2-part\_summary\abstracts\182_13_abstract.xml,   Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) can cause severe respiratory disease yet a licensed vaccine is not available. We determined the immunogenicity of two homologous and one heterologous intramuscular prime-boost vaccination regimens using replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors of human serotype 26 and 35 (Ad26 and Ad35) expressing a prototype antigen based on the wild-type fusion (F) protein of RSV strain A2 in adult RSV-naive cynomolgus macaques. All regimens induced substantial boostable antibody responses that recognized the F protein in pre- and postfusion conformation neutralized multiple strains of RSV and persisted for at least 80 weeks. Vaccination induced durable systemic RSV-F-specific T-cell responses characterized mainly by CD4+ T cells expressing Th1-type cytokines as well as RSV-F-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells IgG and IgA in the respiratory tract. Intramuscular immunization with Ad26 and 35 vectors thus is a promising approach for the development of an optimized RSV vaccine expected to induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses that distribute systemically and to mucosal sites.  ,
PMC6925897,2-part\_summary\abstracts\183_13_abstract.xml,   RNA secondary structures play a key role in splicing gene expression microRNA biogenesis RNA editing and other biological processes. The importance of RNA structures has been demonstrated in the life cycle of RNA-containing viruses including the influenza virus. At least two regions of conserved secondary structure in NS segment (+) RNA are predicted to vary among influenza virus strains with respect to thermodynamic stability; both fall in the NS1 open reading frame. The NS1 protein is involved in multiple virus-host interaction processes and its main function is to inhibit the cellular immune response to viral infection. Using a reverse genetics approach four influenza virus strains were constructed featuring mutations that have different effects on RNA secondary structure. Growth curve experiments and ELISA data show that at least in the first viral replication cycle mutations G123A and A132G affecting RNA structure in the (82–148) NS RNA region influence NS1 protein expression.  ,

The first sample was collected at 2-3 days of fever onset and the second sample was collected at 24–36 h after the first sample was collected and followed up cases and correlated serum neopterin levels.       Results   Among the 77 patients enrolled 19 were diagnosed with severe dengue 15 patients as having dengue with warning signs and 43 patients as having dengue fever.       Conclusion   In this study we found that the serum neopterin levels were significantly higher in the severe dengue category (mean: 58.75(±4.91) nmol/l) than in the non-severe dengue category (mean: 48.11(±8.80) nmol/l). Furthermore a positive correlation was observed between neopterin concentration and duration of fever hence higher serum neopterin levels may indicate dengue severity. The determination of serum neopterin concentration may be used for the early assessment of severe dengue.    ,
PMC6927920,2-part\_summary\abstracts\185_20_abstract.xml,   Influenza viruses are important pathogens that affect multiple animal species including humans. There are four types of influenza viruses: A B C and D (IAV IBV ICV and IDV respectively). IAV and IBV are currently circulating in humans and are responsible of seasonal epidemics (IAV and IBV) and occasional pandemics (IAV). ICV is known to cause mild infections in humans and pigs while the recently identified IDV primarily affect cattle and pigs. Influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein encoded by the NS segment in all influenza types. The main function of NS1 is to counteract the host antiviral defense including the production of interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and therefore is considered an important viral pathogenic factor. Despite of homologous functions the NS1 protein from the diverse influenza types share little amino acid sequence identity suggesting possible differences in their mechanism(s) of action interaction(s) with host factors and contribution to viral replication and/or pathogenesis. In addition although the NS1 protein of IAV IBV and to some extent ICV have been previously studied it is unclear if IDV NS1 has similar properties. Using an approach that allow us to express NS1 independently of the nuclear export protein from the viral NS segment we have generated recombinant IAV expressing IAV IBV ICV and IDV NS1 proteins. Although recombinant viruses expressing heterotypic (IBV ICV and IDV) NS1 proteins were able to replicate similarly in canine MDCK cells their viral fitness was impaired in human A549 cells and they were highly attenuated    in vivo. Our data suggest that despite the similarities to effectively counteract innate immune responses    in vitro the NS1 proteins of IBV ICV or IDV do not fully complement the functions of IAV NS1 resulting in deficient viral replication and pathogenesis    in vivo.    ,
PMC6928032,2-part\_summary\abstracts\186_19_abstract.xml,   Abstract  The threat of novel influenza infections has sparked research efforts to develop subunit vaccines that can induce a more broadly protective immunity by targeting selected regions of the virus. In general subunit vaccines are safer but may be less immunogenic than whole cell inactivated or live attenuated vaccines. Hence novel adjuvants that boost immunogenicity are increasingly needed as we move toward the era of modern vaccines. In addition targeting delivery and display of the selected antigens on the surface of professional antigen‐presenting cells are also important in vaccine design and development. The use of nanosized particles can be one of the strategies to enhance immunogenicity as they can be efficiently recognized by antigen‐presenting cells. They can act as both immunopotentiators and delivery system for the selected antigens. This review will discuss on the applications advantages limitations and types of nanoparticles (NPs) used in the preparation of influenza subunit vaccine candidates to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses.  ,
PMC6928059,2-part\_summary\abstracts\187_25_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Introduction   There are limited data on risk of severe disease or outcomes in patients with influenza and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) co‐infection compared to those with single infection.       Methods   We conducted a systematic review of published literature on the interaction of influenza viruses and PTB. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they presented data on prevalence disease association presentation or severity of laboratory‐confirmed influenza among clinically diagnosed or laboratory‐confirmed PTB cases. We searched eight databases from inception until December 2018. Summary characteristics of each study were extracted and a narrative summary was presented. Cohort or case‐control studies were assessed for potential bias using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale.       Results   We assessed 5154 abstracts reviewed 146 manuscripts and included 19 studies fulfilling selection criteria (13 human and six animal). Of seven studies reporting on the possible effect of the underlying PTB disease in patients with influenza three of four analytical studies reported no association with disease severity of influenza infection in those with PTB whilst one study reported PTB as a risk factor for influenza‐associated hospitalization.   An association between influenza infection and PTB disease was found in three of five analytical studies; whereas the two other studies reported a high frequency of PTB disease progression and complications among patients with seasonal influenza co‐infection.       Conclusion   Human analytical studies of an association between co‐infection and severe influenza‐ or PTB‐associated disease or increased prevalence of influenza co‐infection in individuals' hospitalized for PTB were not conclusive. Data are limited from large high‐quality analytical epidemiological studies with laboratory‐confirmed endpoints.    ,
PMC6928875,2-part\_summary\abstracts\188_21_abstract.xml,   Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are the most common causes of hand foot and mouth disease. Severe EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections may be associated with life-threatening complications. However the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these severe clinical and pathological features remain incompletely understood. Lipids are known to play critical roles in multiple stages of the virus replication cycle. The specific lipid profile induced upon virus infection is required for optimal virus replication. The perturbations in the host cell lipidomic profiles upon enterovirus infection have not been fully characterized. To this end we performed ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–quadrupole–time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS)-based lipidomics to characterize the change in host lipidome upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections. Our results revealed that 47 lipids within 11 lipid classes were significantly perturbed after EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection. Four polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) namely arachidonic acid (AA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were consistently upregulated upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection. Importantly exogenously supplying three of these four PUFAs including AA DHA and EPA in cell cultures significantly reduced EV-A71 and CV-A16 replication. Taken together our results suggested that enteroviruses might specifically modulate the host lipid pathways for optimal virus replication. Excessive exogenous addition of lipids that disrupted this delicate homeostatic state could prevent efficient viral replication. Precise manipulation of the host lipid profile might be a potential host-targeting antiviral strategy for enterovirus infection.  ,
PMC6929465,2-part\_summary\abstracts\189_14_abstract.xml,      Background   Influenza A virus (IAV) poses threats to human health and life. Many individual studies have been carried out in mice to uncover the viral factors responsible for the virulence of IAV infections. Nonetheless a single study may not provide enough confident about virulence factors hence combining several studies for a meta-analysis is desired to provide better views. For this we documented more than 500 records of IAV infections in mice whose viral proteins could be retrieved and the mouse lethal dose 50 or alternatively weight loss and/or survival data was/were available for virulence classification.       Results   IAV virulence models were learned from various datasets containing aligned IAV proteins and the corresponding two virulence classes (avirulent and virulent) or three virulence classes (low intermediate and high virulence). Three proven rule-based learning approaches i.e. OneR JRip and PART and additionally random forest were used for modelling. PART models achieved the best performance with moderate average model accuracies ranged from 65.0 to 84.4% and from 54.0 to 66.6% for the two-class and three-class problems respectively. PART models were comparable to or even better than random forest models and should be preferred based on the Occam’s razor principle. Interestingly the average accuracy of the models was improved when host information was taken into account. For model interpretation we observed that although many sites in HA were highly correlated with virulence PART models based on sites in PB2 could compete against and were often better than PART models based on sites in HA. Moreover PART had a high preference to include sites in PB2 when models were learned from datasets containing the concatenated alignments of all IAV proteins. Several sites with a known contribution to virulence were found as the top protein sites and site pairs that may synergistically influence virulence were also uncovered.       Conclusion   Modelling IAV virulence is a challenging problem. Rule-based models generated using viral proteins are useful for its advantage in interpretation but only achieve moderate performance. Development of more advanced approaches that learn models from features extracted from both viral and host proteins shall be considered for future works.    ,

PMC6935926,2-part\_summary\abstracts\191_20_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Influenza is a major global public health threat as a result of its highly pathogenic variants large zoonotic reservoir and pandemic potential. Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential for a diagnostic test for influenza virus which also provides insights on transmission evolution and drug resistance and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing method to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza virus reads down to a limit of detection of 10   2 to 10   3 genome copies/ml in pooled samples observing a strong relationship between the viral titer and the proportion of influenza virus reads (   P = 4.7 × 10   −5). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs we generated influenza virus reads for 27/27 samples with mid-to-high viral titers (cycle threshold [   C    T   ] values &lt;30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titers (   C    T    values 30 to 40). No false-positive reads were generated from 10 influenza virus-negative samples. Thus Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 67 to 93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI 69 to 100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full-length virus was dependent on sample composition being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However at high influenza virus titers we were able to reconstruct &gt;99% complete sequences for all eight gene segments. We also detected a human coronavirus coinfection in one clinical sample. While further optimization is required to improve sensitivity this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.    ,
PMC6936527,2-part\_summary\abstracts\192_16_abstract.xml,   Significance  Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging viral pathogen discovered in 2009. The virus is present in countries of East Asia and is transmitted through the bite of an infected    Haemaphysalis longicornis tick. SFTSV disease is associated with high morbidity and is often fatal. Despite the incidence of disease no antiviral therapy or vaccine has been approved for use. Here we report and assess 2 live attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates in our recently described ferret model of infection. We show that the viruses caused no clinical disease or mortality in healthy animals. Immunized animals mounted a robust humoral immune response to a single dose of virus and this response protected the animals from a lethal challenge.    ,
PMC6936527,2-part\_summary\abstracts\193_17_abstract.xml,   Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne virus classified within the    Banyangvirus genus. SFTS disease has been reported throughout East Asia since 2009 and is characterized by high fever thrombocytopenia and leukopenia and has a 12 to 30% case fatality rate. Due to the recent emergence of SFTSV there has been little time to conduct research into preventative measures aimed at combatting the virus. SFTSV is listed as one of the World Health Organization’s Prioritized Pathogens for research into antiviral therapeutics and vaccine development. Here we report 2 attenuated recombinant SFTS viruses that induce a humoral immune response in immunized ferrets and confer complete cross-genotype protection to lethal challenge. Animals infected with rHB29NSsP   102A or rHB2912aaNSs (both genotype D) had a reduced viral load in both serum and tissues and presented without high fever thrombocytopenia or mortality associated with infection. rHB29NSsP   102A- or rHB2912aaNSs-immunized animals developed a robust anti-SFTSV immune response against cross-genotype isolates of SFTSV. This immune response was capable of neutralizing live virus in a focus-reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and was 100% protective against a cross-genotype lethal challenge with the CB1/2014 strain of SFTSV (genotype B). Thus using our midsized aged ferret infection model we demonstrate 2 live attenuated vaccine candidates against the emerging pathogen SFTSV.    ,
PMC6936719,2-part\_summary\abstracts\194_16_abstract.xml,   Significance  When multiple pathogens cocirculate this can lead to competitive or cooperative forms of pathogen–pathogen interactions. It is believed that such interactions occur among cold and flu viruses perhaps through broad-acting immunity resulting in interlinked epidemiological patterns of infection. However to date quantitative evidence has been limited. We analyzed a large collection of diagnostic reports collected over multiple years for 11 respiratory viruses. Our analyses provide strong statistical support for the existence of interactions among respiratory viruses. Using computer simulations we found that very short-lived interferences may explain why common cold infections are less frequent during flu seasons. Improved understanding of how the epidemiology of viral infections is interlinked can help improve disease forecasting and evaluation of disease control interventions.  ,
PMC6936719,2-part\_summary\abstracts\195_17_abstract.xml,   The human respiratory tract hosts a diverse community of cocirculating viruses that are responsible for acute respiratory infections. This shared niche provides the opportunity for virus–virus interactions which have the potential to affect individual infection risks and in turn influence dynamics of infection at population scales. However quantitative evidence for interactions has lacked suitable data and appropriate analytical tools. Here we expose and quantify interactions among respiratory viruses using bespoke analyses of infection time series at the population scale and coinfections at the individual host scale. We analyzed diagnostic data from 44230 cases of respiratory illness that were tested for 11 taxonomically broad groups of respiratory viruses over 9 y. Key to our analyses was accounting for alternative drivers of correlated infection frequency such as age and seasonal dependencies in infection risk allowing us to obtain strong support for the existence of negative interactions between influenza and noninfluenza viruses and positive interactions among noninfluenza viruses. In mathematical simulations that mimic 2-pathogen dynamics we show that transient immune-mediated interference can cause a relatively ubiquitous common cold-like virus to diminish during peak activity of a seasonal virus supporting the potential role of innate immunity in driving the asynchronous circulation of influenza A and rhinovirus. These findings have important implications for understanding the linked epidemiological dynamics of viral respiratory infections an important step towards improved accuracy of disease forecasting models and evaluation of disease control interventions.  ,
PMC6936826,2-part\_summary\abstracts\196_20_abstract.xml,      Background and aims   Using mathematical modeling to illustrate and predict how different heroin source-forms: “black tar” (BTH) and powder heroin (PH) can affect HIV transmission in the context of contrasting injecting practices. By quantifying HIV risk by these two heroin source-types we show how each affects the incidence and prevalence of HIV over time. From 1997 to 2010 PH reaching the United States was manufactured overwhelmingly by Colombian suppliers and distributed in the eastern states of the United States. Recently Mexican cartels that supply the western U.S. states have started to produce PH too replacing Colombian distribution to the east. This raises the possibility that BTH in the western U.S. may be replaced by PH in the future.       Design   We used an agent-based model to evaluate the impact of use of different heroin formulations in high- and low-risk populations of persons who inject drugs (PWID) who use different types of syringes (high vs. low dead space) and injecting practices. We obtained model parameters from peer-reviewed publications and ethnographic research.       Results   Heating of BTH additional syringe rinsing and subcutaneous injection can substantially decrease the risk of HIV transmission. Simulation analysis shows that HIV transmission risk may be strongly affected by the type of heroin used. We reproduced historic differences in HIV prevalence and incidence. The protective effect of BTH is much stronger in high-risk compared with low-risk populations. Simulation of future outbreaks show that when PH replaces BTH we expect a long-term overall increase in HIV prevalence. In a population of PWID with mixed low- and high-risk clusters we find that local HIV outbreaks can occur even when the overall prevalence and incidence are low. The results are dependent on evidence-supported assumptions.       Conclusions   The results support harm-reduction measures focused on a reduction in syringe sharing and promoting protective measures of syringe rinsing and drug solution heating.    ,
PMC6937093,2-part\_summary\abstracts\197_20_abstract.xml,      Background   Influenza infections often remain undiagnosed in patients admitted to hospital due to lack of routine testing. When tested for the diagnosis and treatment of influenza are often delayed due to the slow turnaround times of centralised laboratory PCR testing. Newer molecular systems have comparable accuracy to laboratory PCR testing and can generate a result in under 1 hour making them potentially deployable as point-of-care tests (POCTs). High-quality evidence for the impact of routine POCT for influenza on clinical outcomes is however currently lacking. This large pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial aims to address this evidence gap.       Methods and analysis   The FluPOC trial is a pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial evaluating adults admitted to a large teaching hospital and a district general hospital with an acute respiratory illness during influenza season and defined by Public Health England. Up to 840 patients will be recruited over up to three influenza seasons and randomised (1:1) to receive either POCT using the FilmArray respiratory panel or routine clinical care. Clinical and infection control teams will be informed of the results in real time and where influenza is detected clinical teams will be encouraged to offer neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment in accordance with national guidelines. Those allocated to standard clinical care will have a swab taken for later analysis to allow assessment of missed diagnoses. The outcomes assessment will be by retrospective case note analysis. The outcome measures include the proportion of influenza-positive patients detected and appropriately treated with NAIs isolation facility use antibiotic use length of hospital stay complications and mortality.       Ethics and dissemination   Prior to commencing the study approval was obtained from the South Central Hampshire A Ethics Committee (reference 17/SC/0368 granted 7 September 2017). Results generated from this protocol will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at national and international conferences.       Trial registration number       ISRCTN17197293       ,

The emergence of drug-resistant viruses requires the development of new antiviral chemicals. Our study applied a cell-based approach to evaluate the antiviral activity of a series of newly synthesized benzoic acid derivatives and 4-(22-Bis(hydroxymethyl)-5-oxopyrrolidin-l-yl)-3-(5-cyclohexyl-4H-124-triazol-3-yl)amino). benzoic acid termed NC-5 was found to possess antiviral activity. NC-5 inhibited influenza A viruses A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) A/Beijing/32/92 (H3N2) and oseltamivir-resistant mutant A/FM/1/47-H275Y (H1N1-H275Y) in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% effective concentrations (EC   50) for H1N1 and H1N1-H275Y were 33.6 μM and 32.8 μM respectively which showed that NC-5 had a great advantage over oseltamivir in drug-resistant virus infections. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC   50) of NC-5 was greater than 640 μM. Orally administered NC-5 protected mice infected with H1N1 and H1N1-H275Y conferring 80% and 60% survival at 100 mg/kg/d reducing body weight loss and alleviating virus-induced lung injury. NC-5 could suppress NP and M1 protein expression levels during the late stages of viral biosynthesis and inhibit NA activity which may influence virus release. Our study proved that NC-5 has potent anti-influenza activity in vivo and in vitro meaning that it could be regarded as a promising drug candidate to treat infection with influenza viruses including oseltamivir-resistant viruses.    ,
PMC6941257,2-part\_summary\abstracts\199_13_abstract.xml,   Today the treatment of bacterial infections is a major challenge due to growing rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria complication of treatment and increased healthcare costs. Moreover new treatments for bacterial infections are limited. Oligonucleotide aptamers are single stranded DNAs or RNAs with target-selective high-affinity feature which considered as nucleic acid-based affinity ligands replacing monoclonal antibodies. The aptamer-based systems have been found to be talented tools in the treatment of microbial infections regarding their promising anti-biofilm and antimicrobial activities; they can reduce or inhibit the effects of bacterial toxins and inhibit pathogen invasion to immune cell as well as they can be used in drug delivery systems. The focus of this review is on the therapeutic applications of aptamers in infections. In this regard an introduction of infections and related challenges were presented first. Then aptamer definition and selection with a brief history of aptamers development against various pathogens and toxins were reviewed. Diverse strategies of aptamer application in drug delivery as well as the effect of aptamers on the immune system as the main natural agents of human defense against pathogens were also discussed. Finally the future trends in clinical applications of this technology were discussed.  ,

In the present study 131 cats from two remote study areas (Valdivia and Chiloe Island) in southern Chile were analyzed for infection/exposure to eight pathogens. Serum samples from 112 cats were tested for antigens against feline leukemia virus (FeLV antigen-ELISA) and antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV-ELISA) and canine distemper virus (CDV-serum neutralization) yielded occurrence of 8.9 1.7 and 0.8% respectively. The presence of DNA of five vector-borne pathogens piroplasmids    Ehrlichia spp.    Anaplasma spp.    Rickettsia spp. and    Bartonella spp. was investigated in thirty cats.

Among eight viral RNA segments the multiple functions of nucleoprotein (NP) play important roles in viral replication and transcription.       Methods   To understand how NP contributes to the virus evolution we analyzed the NP gene of H3N2 viruses in Taiwan and 14220 NP sequences collected from Influenza Research Database. The identified genetic variations were further analyzed by mini-genome assay virus growth assay viral RNA and protein expression as well as ferret model to analyze their impacts on viral replication properties.       Results   The NP genetic analysis by Taiwan and global sequences showed similar evolution pattern that the NP backbones changed through time accompanied with specific residue substitutions from 1999 to 2018. Other than the conserved residues fifteen sporadic substitutions were observed in which the 31R 377G and 450S showed higher frequency. We found 31R and 450S decreased polymerase activity while the dominant residues (31 K and 450G) had higher activity. The 31 K and 450G showed better viral translation and replication in vitro and in vivo.       Conclusions   These findings indicated variations identified in evolution have roles in modulating viral replication in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that the interaction between variations of NP during virus evolution deserves future attention.    ,

Following that a large number of CHIKV cases have been notified in FS which is the second-most populous city in Bahia state northeastern Brazil and plays an important role on the spread to other Brazilian states due to climate conditions and the abundance of competent vectors. To better understand CHIKV dynamics in Bahia state we generated 5 complete genome sequences from a local outbreak raised in    Serraria Brasil a neighbourhood in FS by next-generation sequencing using Illumina approach. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that the new FS genomes belongs to the ECSA genotype and falls within a single strongly supported monophyletic clade that includes other older CHIKV sequences from the same location suggesting the persistence of the virus during distinct epidemic seasons. We also performed minor variants analysis and found a small number of SNPs per sample (b_29L and e_45SR = 16 SNPs c_29SR = 29 and d_45PL and f_45FL = 21 SNPs). Out of the 93 SNPs found 71 are synonymous 21 are non-synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Although those mutations are not related to the increase of virus replication and/or infectivity some SNPs were found in non-structural proteins which may have an effect on viral evasion from the mammal immunological system. These findings reinforce the needing of further studies on those variants and of continued genomic surveillance strategies to track viral adaptations and to monitor CHIKV epidemics for improved public health control.    ,
PMC6948816,2-part\_summary\abstracts\203_20_abstract.xml,   The 2015–2017 epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas caused widespread infection followed by protective immunity. The timing and burden of the next Zika virus outbreak remains unclear. We used an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of age-specific immunity to ZIKV and predict the future age-specific risk using data from Managua Nicaragua. We also investigated the potential impact of a ZIKV vaccine. Assuming lifelong immunity the risk of a ZIKV outbreak will remain low until 2035 and rise above 50% in 2047. The imbalance in age-specific immunity implies that people in the 15–29 age range will be at highest risk of infection during the next ZIKV outbreak increasing the expected number of congenital abnormalities. ZIKV vaccine development and licensure are urgent to attain the maximum benefit in reducing the population-level risk of infection and the risk of adverse congenital outcomes. This urgency increases if immunity is not lifelong.  ,
PMC6948816,2-part\_summary\abstracts\204_21_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Zika virus (ZIKV) caused a major outbreak in the Americas between 2015–2017. It remains unclear if immunity after infection offers life-long protection at an individual level and how long herd immunity can protect a population against a new ZIKV outbreak. Data from Managua Nicaragua showed an imbalance in protective immunity after ZIKV infection across different age-strata. We used this data to parameterize an individual based mathematical model to predict the future risk of a new ZIKV outbreak and to evaluate the effect of loss of immunity and the introduction of vaccination. We found that the 15–29 age range will be at highest risk of infection during the next ZIKV outbreak increasing the expected number of congenital abnormalities. We show that vaccination could curb the risk of infection and could extend the herd immunity but introduction within the next decade is crucial to provide the most benefit.  ,
PMC6948821,2-part\_summary\abstracts\205_21_abstract.xml,      Background   Detecting and monitoring the transmission of arboviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) dengue virus and chikungunya virus is critical for prevention and control activities. Previous work has compared the ability of different human-focused surveillance strategies to detect ZIKV transmission in U.S. counties where no known transmission had occurred but whether virological surveillance in mosquitoes could represent an effective surveillance system is unclear.       Objectives   We leveraged a unique set of data from human and virological surveillance in     Ae.     aegypti during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic in Caguas Puerto Rico to compare alternative strategies for detecting and monitoring ZIKV activity.          Methods   We developed a simulation model for mosquito and human surveillance strategies and simulated different transmission scenarios with varying infection rates and mosquito trap densities. We then calculated the expected weekly number of detected infections the probability of detecting transmission and the number of tests needed and compared the simulations with observed data from Caguas.       Results   In simulated high transmission scenarios (1 infection per 1000 people per week) the models demonstrated that both approaches had estimated probabilities of detection of greater than 78%. In simulated low incidence scenarios vector surveillance had higher sensitivity than human surveillance and sensitivity increased with more traps more trapping effort and testing. In contrast the actual data from Caguas indicated that human virological surveillance was more sensitive than vector virological surveillance during periods of both high and low transmission.       Conclusion   In scenarios where human surveillance is not possible or when transmission intensity is very low virological surveillance in     Ae.     aegypti may be able to detect and monitor ZIKV epidemic activity. However surveillance for humans seeking care for Zika-like symptoms likely provides an equivalent or more sensitive indicator of transmission intensity in most circumstances.       ,
PMC6948821,2-part\_summary\abstracts\206_22_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Control of Zika virus and other mosquito-borne viruses is dependent on timely and accurate detection of viral activity. A previous assessment of surveillance strategies for U.S. counties where no known transmission had occurred found that testing people seeking medical care with signs of Zika virus was a more effective strategy than testing blood donors or pregnant women. An alternative strategy to testing humans is to test the mosquitoes directly for viruses. In this study we used data from human and mosquito surveillances during the Zika epidemic of 2016 in Caguas Puerto Rico to compare these strategies for detecting and monitoring Zika virus activity. Using simulation models for human and mosquito surveillance strategies we examined different transmission scenarios with varying Zika virus infection rates. The results suggest that in high Zika virus transmission scenarios both approaches effectively identified transmission. In low transmission scenarios routine mosquito surveillance had the potential for increased sensitivity compared to human-based surveillance. However resource availability may also be an important factor when considering the most effective approach.  ,
PMC6949906,2-part\_summary\abstracts\207_20_abstract.xml,   Dengue fever chikungunya and Zika are diseases caused by viruses transmitted by    Aedes aegypti and    Aedes albopictus. In Brazil the number of human infections is high but few studies are performed in mosquito vectors. This study aimed to investigate the presence of Zika Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in    Ae. aegypti and    Ae. albopictus from the municipalities of Alto Alegre Caxias Codó and São Mateus do Maranhão located in the state of Maranhão Northeast Brazil. The mosquitoes were collected with a mechanical aspirator identified triturated and then submitted to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. The positive samples were confirmed by virus isolation and genome sequencing. Three hundred and forty-eight    Ae. aegypti (176 males and 172 females) and 12    Ae. albopictus (eight males and four females) were collected and tested.    Ae. aegypti was the only vector positive in two municipalities—Codó with detection of    Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belonging to the East-Central-South African genotype and in Caxias with detection of    Dengue virus (DENV)-2 belonging to the Asian/American genotype. The detection of CHIKV and DENV-2 is evidence that those viruses are maintained in arthropod vectors and shows the epidemiological risk in the area for chikungunya cases and a possible increase of severe dengue cases associated with the occurrence of dengue hemorrhagic fever.    ,

One of them is by increasing the vulnerability of human health induced by various climate change impacts which pose an additional burden to the already distressed health systems in the region. This paper explores the associations between climate change and human health on the one hand and outlines some of the health care challenges posed by a changing climate on the other. In particular it describes the links between climate variations and the emergence of climate-sensitive infectious diseases such as the mosquito-borne diseases dengue chikungunya and Zika.

PMC6950424,2-part\_summary\abstracts\209_16_abstract.xml,   Interferon-mediated host factors myxovirus (Mx) proteins are key features in regulating influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Viral polymerases are essential for viral replication. The Mx1 protein has been known to interact with viral nucleoprotein (NP) and PB2 resulting in the influence of polymerase activity and providing interspecies restriction. The equine influenza virus has evolved as an independent lineage to influenza viruses from other species. We estimated the differences in antiviral activities between human MxA (huMxA) and equine Mx1 (eqMx1) against a broad range of IAV strains. We found that huMxA has antiviral potential against IAV strains from non-human species whereas eqMx1 could only inhibit the polymerase activity of non-equine species. Here we demonstrated that NP is the main target of eqMx1. Subsequently we found adaptive mutations in the NP of strains A/equine/Jilin/1/1989 (H3N8   JL89) and A/chicken/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013 (H7N9   ZJ13) that confer eqMx1 resistance and sensitivity respectively. A substantial reduction in Mx1 resistance was observed for the two mutations G34S and H52N in H3N8   JL89 NP. Thus eqMx1 is an important dynamic force in IAV nucleoprotein evolution. We therefore suggest that the amino acids responsible for Mx1 resistance should be regarded as a robust indicator for the pandemic potential of lately evolving IAVs.    ,

PMC6955097,2-part\_summary\abstracts\212_22_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Emerging viral outbreaks resulting from host switching is an area of continued scientific interest. Such events can result in disease epidemics or in some cases clinically silent outcomes. These occurrences are likely relatively common and can serve as tools to better understand disease dynamics and may result in changes in behavior fecundity and ultimately survival of the host. Feline foamy virus (FFV) is a common retrovirus infecting domestic cats globally which has also been documented in the North American puma (   Puma concolor). The prevalent nature of FFV in domestic cats and its ability to infect wild felids including puma provides an ideal system to study cross-species transmission across trophic levels (positions in the food chain) and evolution of pathogens transmitted between individuals following direct contact. Here we present findings from an extensive molecular analysis of FFV in pumas focused on two locations in Colorado and in relation to FFV recovered from domestic cats in this and previous studies. Prevalence of FFV in puma was high across the two regions ∼77 per cent (urban interface site) and ∼48 per cent (rural site). Comparison of FFV from pumas living across three states; Colorado Florida and California indicates FFV is widely distributed across North America. FFV isolated from domestic cats and pumas was not distinguishable at the host level with FFV sequences sharing &gt;93 per cent nucleotide similarity. Phylogenetic Bayesian and recombination analyses of FFV across the two species supports frequent cross-species spillover from domestic cat to puma during the last century as well as frequent puma-to-puma intraspecific transmission in Colorado USA. Two FFV variants distinguished by significant difference in the surface unit of the envelope protein were commonly found in both hosts. This trait is also shared by simian foamy virus and may represent variation in cell tropism or a unique immune evasion mechanism. This study elucidates evolutionary and cross-species transmission dynamics of a highly prevalent multi-host adapted virus a system which can further be applied to model spillover and transmission of pathogenic viruses resulting in widespread infection in the new host.    ,

However the underlying mechanisms of how IAV is internalized into host cells remain poorly understood emphasizing the need to elucidate the role of host factors in IAV entry into cells. In this study we identified FFAR2 as an important host factor for the efficient replication of both low-pathogenic and highly pathogenic IAV. We revealed that FFAR2 facilitates the internalization of IAV into target cells during the early stage of infection. Upon further characterization of the role of FFAR2-associated proteins in virus replication we found that the FFAR2–β-arrestin1–AP2B1 signaling cascade is important for the efficient endocytosis of IAV.

PMC6955252,2-part\_summary\abstracts\214_19_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Influenza A virus (IAV) coopts numerous host factors to complete its replication cycle. Here we identify free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) as a cofactor for IAV entry into host cells. We found that downregulation of FFAR2 or Ffar2 expression significantly reduced the replication of IAV in A549 or RAW 264.7 cells. The treatment of A549 cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting    FFAR2 or the FFAR2 pathway agonists 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-   N-(thiazol-2-yl)butanamide (4-CMTB) and compound 58 (Cmp58) [(   S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-33-dimethyl-   N-(5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)butanamide] dramatically inhibited the nuclear accumulation of viral nucleoprotein (NP) at early time points postinfection indicating that FFAR2 functions in the early stage of the IAV replication cycle. FFAR2 downregulation had no effect on the expression of sialic acid (SA) receptors on the cell membrane the attachment of IAV to the SA receptors or the activity of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. Rather the amount of internalized IAVs was significantly reduced in FFAR2-knocked-down or 4-CMTB- or Cmp58-treated A549 cells. Further studies showed that FFAR2 associated with β-arrestin1 and that β-arrestin1 interacted with the β2-subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP2B1) the essential adaptor of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Notably siRNA knockdown of either β-arrestin1 or AP2B1 dramatically impaired IAV replication and AP2B1 knockdown or treatment with Barbadin an inhibitor targeting the β-arrestin1/AP2B1 complex remarkably decreased the amount of internalized IAVs. Moreover we found that FFAR2 interacted with three G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (i.e. GRK2 GRK5 and GRK6) whose downregulation inhibited IAV replication. Together our findings demonstrate that the FFAR2 signaling cascade is important for the efficient endocytosis of IAV into host cells.       IMPORTANCE To complete its replication cycle IAV hijacks the host endocytosis machinery to invade cells. However the underlying mechanisms of how IAV is internalized into host cells remain poorly understood emphasizing the need to elucidate the role of host factors in IAV entry into cells.

The genetic diversity of RRV and its evolutionary history have so far only been studied using partial E2 gene analysis with a limited number of isolates. Robust whole-genome analysis has not yet been conducted.

PMC6955267,2-part\_summary\abstracts\216_19_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Ross River virus (RRV) an alphavirus of the    Togaviridae family is the most medically significant mosquito-borne virus of Australia. Past RRV phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses have been based on partial genome analyses only. Three geographically distinct RRV lineages the Eastern the Western and the supposedly extinct North-Eastern lineage were classified previously. We sought to expand on past phylogenies through robust genome-scale phylogeny to better understand RRV genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics. We analyzed 106 RRV complete coding sequences which included 13 genomes available on NCBI and 94 novel sequences derived for this study sampled throughout Western Australia (1977–2014) and during the substantial Pacific Islands RRV epidemic (1979–1980). Our final data set comprised isolates sampled over 59 years (1959–2018) from a range of locations. Four distinct genotypes were defined with the newly described genotype 4 (G4) found to be the contemporary lineage circulating in Western Australia. The prior geographical classification of RRV lineages was not supported by our findings with evidence of geographical and temporal cocirculation of distinct genetic groups. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis revealed that RRV lineages diverged from a common ancestor approximately 94 years ago with distinct lineages emerging roughly every 10 years over the past 50 years in periodic bursts of genetic diversity. Our study has enabled a more robust analysis of RRV evolutionary history and resolved greater genetic diversity that had been previously defined by partial E2 gene analysis.       IMPORTANCE Ross River virus (RRV) causes the most common mosquito-borne infection in Australia and causes a significant burden of suffering to infected individuals as well as being a large burden to the Australian economy. The genetic diversity of RRV and its evolutionary history have so far only been studied using partial E2 gene analysis with a limited number of isolates. Robust whole-genome analysis has not yet been conducted.

PMC6955377,2-part\_summary\abstracts\217_17_abstract.xml,   Significance  Two influenza B viruses (Victoria and Yamagata) cocirculate in humans and contribute to the estimated 290000–650000 annual influenza-attributed deaths. Here we analysed influenza B genomic data to understand the causes of a recent surge in human influenza B infections. We found that evolution is acting differently on Yamagata and Victoria viruses and that this has led to the cocirculation of a diverse group of influenza B viruses. If this phenomenon continues we could potentially witness the emergence of 3 or more distinct influenza B viruses that could require their own vaccine component thereby complicating influenza vaccine formulation and highlighting the urgency of developing universal influenza vaccines.  ,
PMC6955377,2-part\_summary\abstracts\218_18_abstract.xml,   Influenza B viruses have circulated in humans for over 80 y causing a significant disease burden. Two antigenically distinct lineages (“B/Victoria/2/87-like” and “B/Yamagata/16/88-like” termed Victoria and Yamagata) emerged in the 1970s and have cocirculated since 2001. Since 2015 both lineages have shown unusually high levels of epidemic activity the reasons for which are unclear. By analyzing over 12000 influenza B virus genomes we describe the processes enabling the long-term success and recent resurgence of epidemics due to influenza B virus. We show that following prolonged diversification both lineages underwent selective sweeps across the genome and have subsequently taken alternate evolutionary trajectories to exhibit epidemic dominance with no reassortment between lineages. Hemagglutinin deletion variants emerged concomitantly in multiple Victoria virus clades and persisted through epistatic mutations and interclade reassortment—a phenomenon previously only observed in the 1970s when Victoria and Yamagata lineages emerged. For Yamagata viruses antigenic drift of neuraminidase was a major driver of epidemic activity indicating that neuraminidase-based vaccines and cross-reactivity assays should be employed to monitor and develop robust protection against influenza B morbidity and mortality. Overall we show that long-term diversification and infrequent selective sweeps coupled with the reemergence of hemagglutinin deletion variants and antigenic drift of neuraminidase are factors that contributed to successful circulation of diverse influenza B clades. Further divergence of hemagglutinin variants with poor cross-reactivity could potentially lead to circulation of 3 or more distinct influenza B viruses further complicating influenza vaccine formulation and highlighting the urgent need for universal influenza vaccines.  ,

In this study we examined whether the association exists between the field prevalence of a virus and the intercolonial aggression of its ant host using the yellow crazy ant (   Anoplolepis gracilipes) and its natural viral pathogen (TR44839 virus) as a model system. We delimitated the colony boundary and composition of    A.    gracilipes in a total of 12 study sites in Japan (Okinawa) Taiwan and Malaysia (Penang) through intercolonial aggression assay. The spatial distribution and prevalence level of the virus was then mapped for each site. The virus occurred at a high prevalence in the surveyed colonies of Okinawa and Taiwan (100% infection rate across all sites) whereas virus prevalence was variable (30%–100%) or none (0%) at the sites in Penang. Coincidentally colonies in Okinawa and Taiwan displayed a weak intercolonial boundary as aggression between colonies is generally low or moderate. Contrastingly sites in Penang were found to harbor a high proportion of mutually aggressive colonies a pattern potentially indicative of complex colony composition. Our statistical analyses further confirmed the observed correlation implying that intercolonial interactions likely contribute as one of the effective facilitators of/barriers to virus prevalence in the field population of this ant species.    ,

Our aim was (i) to develop and evaluate an RT-qPCR assay combining primers and probes derived from two reference assays targeting different genomic regions; (ii) to study whether sensitivity and specificity of this dual-target assay were at least equal or better to the parental assays; (iii) to implement this dual-target assay onto the Cepheid GeneXpert open cartridge as a proof of principle for technological transfer aiming at bedsite testing locally. To do so three home-made published RT-qPCR assays were selected to be compared with the RealStar   ® Filovirus Screen RT-PCR kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics Hamburg Germany) a technique that was largely deployed during the 2014–2015 West African EVD outbreak. Primers and probes sequences of the custom-made assays were analyzed in silico against a multiple sequence alignment including &gt;250 complete sequences corresponding to strains that have caused EVD epidemics in the past. Genomic RNA purified from the Mekambo strain of    Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) was used to study the sensitivity of the five methods. Based on these results two in-house methods were selected and adapted to design the dual-target assay which performances were compared to those of the parental assays using a synthetic RNA control. The dual-target assay showed better sensitivity and limit of detection (LoD   95 at 0.4 copies/µL) than the parental methods (1.7 and 2.2 copies/µL). Ultimately the dual-target assay was transferred onto the GeneXpert Flex-03 open cartridge demonstrating a LoD   95 at 0.75 copies/µL. Together these results indicate that EBOV dual-target assay has the potential to be used during EVD outbreak in the laboratory having performed molecular testing during the recent outbreaks.    ,
PMC6958409,2-part\_summary\abstracts\221_19_abstract.xml,   Ninety years after the discovery of the virus causing the influenza disease this malady remains one of the biggest public health threats to mankind. Currently available drugs and vaccines only partially reduce deaths and hospitalizations. Some of the reasons for this disturbing situation stem from the sophistication of the viral machinery but another reason is the lack of a complete understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of viral infections and host–pathogen interactions. Even the functions of the influenza proteins their mechanisms of action and interaction with host proteins have not been fully revealed. These questions have traditionally been studied in mammalian animal models mainly ferrets and mice (as well as pigs and non-human primates) and in cell lines. Although obviously relevant as models to humans these experimental systems are very complex and are not conveniently accessible to various genetic molecular and biochemical approaches. The fact that influenza remains an unsolved problem in combination with the limitations of the conventional experimental models motivated increasing attempts to use the power of other models such as low eukaryotes including invertebrate and primary cell cultures. In this review we summarized the efforts to study influenza in yeast    Drosophila zebrafish and primary human tissue cultures and the major contributions these studies have made toward a better understanding of the disease. We feel that these models are still under-utilized and we highlight the unique potential each model has for better comprehending virus–host interactions and viral protein function.    ,

The recent outbreak of the Zika virus (ZIKV) is one such menace that shook the global public health community abruptly. Modern technologies including computational tools as well as experimental approaches need to be harnessed fast and effectively in a coordinated manner in order to properly address such challenges. In this paper based on our earlier research we have proposed a four-pronged approach to tackle the emerging pathogens like ZIKV: (a) Epidemiological modelling of spread mechanisms of ZIKV; (b) assessment of the public health risk of newly emerging strains of the pathogens by comparing them with existing strains/pathogens using fast computational sequence comparison methods; (c) implementation of vaccine design methods in order to produce a set of probable peptide vaccine candidates for quick synthesis/production and testing in the laboratory; and (d) designing of novel therapeutic molecules and their laboratory testing as well as validation of new drugs or repurposing of drugs for use against ZIKV. For each of these stages we provide an extensive review of the technical challenges and current state-of-the-art. Further we outline the future areas of research and discuss how they can work together to proactively combat ZIKV or future emerging pathogens.  ,

We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from children aged &lt; 5 years hospitalized with a community-acquired single respiratory viral infection of influenza adenovirus or RSV during 2 recent consecutive influenza seasons. Remnant respiratory specimens were used for bacterial PCR targeting    Moraxella catarrhalis Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae and    Staphylococcus aureus.    A total of 102 children were included; median age was 0.8 years and 44.1% had underlying comorbidities. Overall 6.8% (7/102) of cases were classified as severe diseases requiring intensive care unit admission and/or mechanical ventilation and ranged from 8.8% for a patient with RSV and 7.6% for those with adenovirus to 0% for those with influenza viruses. The overall viral–bacterial codetection rate was 59.8% (61/102);    M catarrhalis was the most frequent (33.3%) followed by    H influenzae (31.4%). Influenza cases showed higher bacterial codetection rates (80.0%; 8/10) compared with those with adenoviruses (69.2%; 9/13) and RSV (55.7%; 44/79).    S pneumoniae and    H influenzae codetections were associated with reduced severity (aOR 0.24; 95% CI 0.07–0.89) and reduced risk of wheezing (aOR 0.36; 95% CI 0.13–0.98) respectively.    We observed the interactions between respiratory viruses and bacteria and the clinical significance of viral–bacterial coexistence in upper airway on disease severity. Future study will be necessary to elucidate the active interactions between different viruses and bacteria and give clues to risk stratified strategy in the management of respiratory infections among young children.  ,

This study builds on prior research by estimating the extent to which HIV testing occurs during physician office and emergency department (ED) post 2006 CDC recommendations.  We performed an unweighted and weighted cross-sectional analysis using pooled data from 2 nationally representative surveys namely National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2009 to 2014. We assessed routine HIV testing trends and predictive factors in physician offices and ED using multi-stage statistical survey procedures in SAS 9.4.  HIV testing rates in physician offices increased by 105% (5.6–11.5 per 1000) over the study period. A steeper increase was observed in ED with a 191% (2.3–6.7 per 1000) increase. Odds ratio (OR) for HIV testing in physician offices were highest among ages 20 to 29 ([OR] 7.20 99% confidence interval [CI: 4.37–11.85]) males (OR 1.34 [CI: 0.91–0.93]) African-Americans (OR 2.97 [CI: 2.05–4.31]) Hispanics (OR 1.80 [CI: 1.17–2.78]) and among visits occurring in the South (OR 2.06 [CI: 1.23–3.44]). In the ED similar trends of higher testing odds persisted for African Americans (OR 3.44 99% CI 2.50–4.73) Hispanics (OR 2.23 99% CI 1.65–3.01) and Northeast (OR 2.24 99% CI 1.10–4.54).  While progress has been made in screening HIV testing rates remains sub-optimal for ED visits. Populations visiting the ED for routine care may suffer missed opportunities for HIV testing which delays their entry into HIV medical care. To end the epidemic new approaches for increasing targeted routine HIV testing for populations attending health care settings is recommended.  ,

Renal involvement in dengue can be potentially related to an increased mortality. Aiming to better understand the role of DENV in renal injury observed in human fatal cases post-mortem investigations were performed in four DENV-4 renal autopsies during dengue epidemics in Brazil. Tissues were submitted to histopathology immunohistochemistry viral quantification and characterization of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Probably due the high viral load several lesions were observed in the renal tissue such as diffuse mononuclear infiltration around the glomerulus in the cortical region and in the medullary vessels hyalinosis arteriolar lymphocytic infiltrate increased capsular fibrosis proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) damage edema PCT debris formation and thickening of the basal vessel membrane. These changes were associated with DENV-4 infection as confirmed by the presence of DENV-specific NS3 protein indicative of viral replication. The exacerbated presence of mononuclear cells at several renal tissue sites culminated in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Moreover it can be suggested that the renal tissue injury observed here may have been due to the combination of both high viral load and exacerbated host immune response.  ,

This trend has increased the level of concern about the disease and the potential for importation to areas in Asia with ecological conditions that can sustain yellow fever virus transmission. In this article we provide a broad overview of yellow fever burden of disease natural history treatment vaccine prevention and control initiatives and vaccine and therapeutic agent development efforts.  ,
PMC6963304,2-part\_summary\abstracts\228_15_abstract.xml,   Pseudorabies virus (PRV) a member of the    Herpesviridae is the causative agent of an acute infectious disease in a variety of animals. The emergence of a novel variant strain brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccine strains were not completely effective against variant strains. Therefore the development of new anti-pseudorabies virus drugs and vaccines is of great significance for the treatment and prevention of pseudorabies. In this study we found that germacrone one of the major components of the essential oils extracted from Rhizoma Curcuma was able to effectively inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Germacrone showed antiviral activity against PRV in the early phase of the viral replication cycle. Moreover we found that germacrone does not directly kill the virus nor does it affect the expression of the PRV receptor protein nectin-1 nectin-2 and CD155. Our results suggest germacrone could be used as an efficient microbicide or immunomodulatory agent in the control of the emerging variant PRV.    ,

They can lead to complications super-infection respiratory failure and even compromised respiratory function in adulthood. For some of the responsible pathogens vaccines are available. This review reports current issues about vaccines against the main respiratory pathogens to highlight the available strategies to reduce the burden of paediatric respiratory disease. The optimal use of influenza pneumococcal pertussis and measles vaccines is required in order to reduce ARI burden. Vaccination coverage rates must be improved to achieve the full benefits of these vaccines. Recently advances in the knowledge of respiratory syncytial virus structural biology and immunology as well as the development of new techniques to generate vaccine candidates have increased the number of promising vaccines even against this harmful pathogen.  ,
PMC6963570,2-part\_summary\abstracts\230_17_abstract.xml,   Despite efforts to improve surveillance and vaccination coverage measles virus (MeV) continues to cause outbreaks also in high-income countries. As the reference laboratory of the Veneto Region Italy we analyzed changes in population immunity described measles outbreaks investigated MeV genetic diversity and evaluated cross-protection of measles vaccination against MeV epidemic strains. Like most European areas the Veneto Region has suboptimal measles vaccination coverage and is facing a growing public mistrust of vaccination. A progressive decline of measles vaccine uptake was observed during the last decade in the Veneto Region leading to immunity gaps in children and young adults. Measles outbreaks were caused by the same MeV genotype B3 D4 and D8 strains that were circulating in other European countries. Eleven cases of measles were observed in immunized subjects. These cases were not associated with particular MeV genotypes nor with mutations in epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Accordingly sera from fully vaccinated subjects cross-neutralized epidemic MeV strains including the genotypes B3 D4 and D8 with the same high efficiency demonstrated against the vaccine strain. In fully vaccinated subjects high MeV IgG antibody titers persisted up to 30 years following vaccination. These results support the use of the current measles-containing vaccines and strategies to strengthen vaccination.  ,

There are however no treatments available and the only licensed vaccine shows limited efficacy and is able to enhance the disease in some cases.

With increasing data suggesting both a protective and detrimental effect for antibodies and CD8 T-cells whilst having complex environmental dynamics. This review discusses the roles of genomic and immunological aspects of DENV infection providing both a historical interpretation and fresh discussion on how this information can be used for the next generation of dengue interventions.  ,

Despite active research there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. We have previously reported the development of various adenoviral vectored vaccine candidates (ChAdOx1 ZIKV) with the ability to stimulate effective immunity in mice and provide protection upon a ZIKV challenge model using a non-adjuvanted single vaccination approach. In this study we constructed various modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viruses to express the ZIKV Envelope (E) with modifications on the precursor membrane (prM) or on the C-terminus envelope transmembrane domain (TM) similar to our ChAdOx1 vaccine candidates. MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates were evaluated as a non-adjuvanted single vaccination regimen against a ZIKV Brazilian isolate using viraemia as the correlate of protection. Here we report the induction of a modest level of anti-ZIKV E antibodies by all MVA vectored vaccines and sub-optimal efficacy in a ZIKV challenge model. Our results indicate the requirement of additional strategies when using MVA-ZIKV vaccines to afford sterile protection upon a non-adjuvanted and single vaccination regime.  ,
PMC6963926,2-part\_summary\abstracts\234_16_abstract.xml,   A large number of human genes associated with viral infections contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which represent a genetic variation caused by the change of a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence. SNPs are located in coding or non-coding genomic regions and can affect gene expression or protein function by different mechanisms. Furthermore they have been linked to multiple human diseases highlighting their medical relevance. Therefore the identification and analysis of this kind of polymorphisms in the human genome has gained high importance in the research community and an increasing number of studies have been published during the last years. As a consequence of this exhaustive exploration an association between the presence of some specific SNPs and the susceptibility or severity of many infectious diseases in some risk population groups has been found. In this review we discuss the relevance of SNPs that are important to understand the pathology derived from influenza A virus (IAV) infections in humans and the susceptibility of some individuals to suffer more severe symptoms. We also discuss the importance of SNPs for IAV vaccine effectiveness.  ,
PMC6963929,2-part\_summary\abstracts\235_17_abstract.xml,   Vaccination for foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease remains low in parts of Africa despite the existence of vaccines. In East Africa the presence of multiple virus serotypes and sub-types makes matching a vaccine with the circulating virus type in the field or providing a high potency vaccine a challenge. In this paper we use game theory to show that the resulting vaccine uncertainty associated with these vaccination conditions in an endemic setting help explain the low vaccine uptake. We evaluate vaccination for FMD in the context of East Africa due to FMD being endemic in the region the diversity of FMD virus types and barriers to implementing other disease control measures such as controlled movements. We incorporate these conditions into a vaccination game setting and compare the payoffs to those of a traditional vaccination game for seasonal influenza and commercial livestock vaccination in a developed country context. In showing that vaccination provides households with a lower payoff than not vaccinating our simple game theoretical explanation supports existing evidence calling for improved vaccine quality and efforts to enhance surveillance to provide early information on disease status.  ,
PMC6964091,2-part\_summary\abstracts\236_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Emerging and re-emerging diseases with pandemic potential continue to challenge fragile health systems in Africa creating enormous human and economic toll. To provide evidence for the investment case for public health emergency preparedness we analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of epidemics disasters and other potential public health emergencies in the WHO African region between 2016 and 2018.       Methods   We abstracted data from several sources including: the WHO African Region’s weekly bulletins on epidemics and emergencies the WHO-Disease Outbreak News (DON) and the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). Other sources were: the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) and the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). We included information on the time and location of the event the number of cases and deaths and counter-checked the different data sources.       Data analysis   We used bubble plots for temporal analysis and generated graphs and maps showing the frequency and distribution of each event. Based on the frequency of events we categorised countries into three: Tier 1 10 or more events Tier 2 5–9 events and Tier 3 less than 5 or no event. Finally we compared the event frequencies to a summary International Health Regulations (IHR) index generated from the IHR technical area scores of the 2018 annual reports.       Results   Over 260 events were identified between 2016 and 2018. Forty-one countries (87%) had at least one epidemic between 2016 and 2018 and 21 of them (45%) had at least one epidemic annually. Twenty-two countries (47%) had disasters/humanitarian crises. Seven countries (the epicentres) experienced over 10 events and all of them had limited or developing IHR capacities. The top five causes of epidemics were: Cholera Measles Viral Haemorrhagic Diseases Malaria and Meningitis.       Conclusions   The frequent and widespread occurrence of epidemics and disasters in Africa is a clarion call for investing in preparedness. While strengthening preparedness should be guided by global frameworks it is the responsibility of each government to finance country specific needs. We call upon all African countries to establish governance and predictable financing mechanisms for IHR implementation and to build resilient health systems everywhere.    ,
PMC6964813,2-part\_summary\abstracts\237_26_abstract.xml,   With dengue virus (DENV) becoming endemic in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide there is a pressing global demand for effective strategies to control the mosquitoes that spread this disease. Recent advances in genetic engineering technologies have made it possible to create mosquitoes with reduced vector competence limiting their ability to acquire and transmit pathogens. Here we describe the development of    Aedes aegypti mosquitoes synthetically engineered to impede vector competence to DENV. These mosquitoes express a gene encoding an engineered single-chain variable fragment derived from a broadly neutralizing DENV human monoclonal antibody and have significantly reduced viral infection dissemination and transmission rates for all four major antigenically distinct DENV serotypes. Importantly this is the first engineered approach that targets all DENV serotypes which is crucial for effective disease suppression. These results provide a compelling route for developing effective genetic-based DENV control strategies which could be extended to curtail other arboviruses.    ,
PMC6964813,2-part\_summary\abstracts\238_27_abstract.xml,   Author summary  With limited success of traditional vector control methods to curb dengue infections and more than half of the world’s population still at risk there is a need for novel strategies to reduce its impact on public health. Recent advances in genetic technologies has allowed for precise modifications of mosquito genome to make them resistant to infections thus breaking the transmission cycle. Here we generated engineered    Ae.    aegypti mosquitoes efficiently expressing a DENV-targeting single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a previously characterized broadly neutralizing human antibody which blocked infection and transmission in these mosquitoes. To our knowledge this is the first example of an engineered transgene capable of rendering    Ae.    aegypti mosquitoes 100% refractory to all four serotypes of DENV. The engineered mosquitoes in future could easily be paired with a gene drive capable of spreading the transgene throughout wild disease-transmitting mosquito populations and preventing further DENV transmission. Since a number of diverse and well-characterized antibodies exist against other arboviruses (eg chikungunya and Zika this work also provides a proof-of-concept principle for developing similar genetic strategies for reducing the impact of these arboviruses.    ,

Mean temperatures are projected to increase globally likely resulting in alterations of the transmission potential of mosquito-borne pathogens. To understand the effect of diurnal temperature range on the vectorial capacity of    Ae. aegypti and    Ae. albopictus for ZIKV longevity blood-feeding and vector competence were assessed at two temperature regimes following feeding on infectious blood meals. Higher temperatures resulted in decreased longevity of    Ae. aegypti [Log-rank test χ2 df 35.66 5    P &lt; 0.001] and a decrease in blood-feeding rates of    Ae. albopictus [Fisher's exact test    P &lt; 0.001]. Temperature had a population and species-specific impact on ZIKV infection rates. Overall    Ae. albopictus reared at the lowest temperature regime demonstrated the highest vectorial capacity (0.53) and the highest transmission efficiency (57%). Increased temperature decreased vectorial capacity across groups yet more significant effects were measured with    Ae. aegypti relative to    Ae. albopictus. The results of this study suggest that future increases in temperature in the Americas could significantly impact vector competence blood-feeding and longevity and potentially decrease the overall vectorial capacity of    Aedes mosquitoes in the Americas.    ,
PMC6968431,2-part\_summary\abstracts\240_16_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Between June 2017 and August 2018 several municipalities located in Bahia state (Brazil) reported a large increase in the number of patients presenting with febrile illness similar to that of arboviral infections. Using a combination of portable whole genome sequencing molecular clock and epidemiological analyses we revealed the return of the CHIKV-ECSA genotype into Bahia. Our results show local persistence of lineages in some municipalities and the re-introduction of new epidemiological strains from different Brazilian regions highlighting a complex dynamic of transmission between epidemic seasons and sampled locations. Estimated climate-driven transmission potential of CHIKV remained at similar levels throughout the years such that large reductions in the total number of confirmed cases suggests a slow but gradual accumulation of herd-immunity over the 4 years of the epidemic in Bahia after its introduction in 2014. Bahia remains a reservoir of the genetic diversity of CHIKV in the Americas and genomic surveillance strategies are essential to assist in monitoring and understanding arboviral transmission and persistence both locally and over large distances.  ,
PMC6968645,2-part\_summary\abstracts\241_17_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Infection with a novel H10N8 influenza virus in humans was first described in China in December 2013 which raised concerns related to public health. This novel virus was subsequently confirmed to have originated from a live poultry market. However whether this virus can infect other mammals remains unclear. In the present study antibody specific for H10N8 influenza virus was detected in swine herds in southern China during serological monitoring for swine influenza virus. The pathogenicity and transmissibility of this H10N8 influenza virus to swine was examined. The results showed that swine are susceptible to infection with human-origin H10N8 influenza virus which causes viral shedding severe tissue lesions and seroconversion while infection with avian-origin H10N8 influenza virus causes only seroconversion and no viral shedding. Importantly human-origin H10N8 influenza virus can inefficiently be transmitted between swine and cause seroconversion through direct contact. This study provides a new perspective regarding the ecology of H10N8 influenza virus and highlights the importance of epidemiological monitoring of the H10N8 influenza virus in different animal species which will be helpful for preventing and controlling future infections by this virus.  ,
PMC6968865,2-part\_summary\abstracts\242_19_abstract.xml,      Background   The family flaviviridae and alphaviridae contain a diverse group of pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Diagnosis of the virus responsible for disease is essential to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical management. Very few real-time RT-PCR based assays are able to detect the presence of all members of these families using a single primer and probe set. We have developed a novel chemistry 3base which simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification.       Methodology/Principal finding   Synthetic constructs viral nucleic acids intact viral particles and characterised reference materials were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. Synthetic constructs demonstrated the sensitivities of the pan-flavivirus detection component were in the range of 13 copies per PCR. The pan-alphavirus assay had a sensitivity range of 10–25 copies per reaction depending on the viral strain. Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1–2 copies per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains. Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as if not better than other assays used in laboratories worldwide. After initial assay validation the pan-viral assays were then tested during the 2016–2017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. Positive results were detected in 116 positives from a total of 187 suspected dengue samples.       Conclusions/Significance   The pan-viral screening assays described here utilise a novel 3base technology and are shown to provide a sensitive and specific method to screen and thereafter speciate flavi- and/or alpha- viruses in clinical samples. The assays performed well in an outbreak situation and can be used to detect positive clinical samples containing any flavivirus or alphavirus in approximately 3 hours 30 minutes.    ,
PMC6969489,2-part\_summary\abstracts\243_17_abstract.xml,   Significance  Viruses evolve rapidly and unpredictably challenging the effectiveness of disease diagnostics. To help control outbreaks and understand their origins the first step is often isolating viruses from infected samples for characterization. We demonstrate that multiple emerging virus strains can be simultaneously enriched and optically detected in only a few minutes without using any labels. A portable platform that captures viruses by their size coupled to Raman spectroscopy resulted in successful virus identification with 90% accuracy in real time directly from clinical samples. Furthermore this viable enrichment process enables further culturing and characterization by electron microscopy and deep sequencing. This microplatform is an effective disease-monitoring system and broadens virus surveillance by enabling real-time virus identification.  ,
PMC6969489,2-part\_summary\abstracts\244_18_abstract.xml,   Emerging and reemerging viruses are responsible for a number of recent epidemic outbreaks. A crucial step in predicting and controlling outbreaks is the timely and accurate characterization of emerging virus strains. We present a portable microfluidic platform containing carbon nanotube arrays with differential filtration porosity for the rapid enrichment and optical identification of viruses. Different emerging strains (or unknown viruses) can be enriched and identified in real time through a multivirus capture component in conjunction with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. More importantly after viral capture and detection on a chip viruses remain viable and get purified in a microdevice that permits subsequent in-depth characterizations by various conventional methods. We validated this platform using different subtypes of avian influenza A viruses and human samples with respiratory infections. This technology successfully enriched rhinovirus influenza virus and parainfluenza viruses and maintained the stoichiometric viral proportions when the samples contained more than one type of virus thus emulating coinfection. Viral capture and detection took only a few minutes with a 70-fold enrichment enhancement; detection could be achieved with as little as 10   2 EID   50/mL (50% egg infective dose per microliter) with a virus specificity of 90%. After enrichment using the device we demonstrated by sequencing that the abundance of viral-specific reads significantly increased from 4.1 to 31.8% for parainfluenza and from 0.08 to 0.44% for influenza virus. This enrichment method coupled to Raman virus identification constitutes an innovative system that could be used to quickly track and monitor viral outbreaks in real time.    ,
PMC6971842,2-part\_summary\abstracts\245_13_abstract.xml,      Introduction: Yellow fever is endemic in specific regions of sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas with recent epidemics occurring on both continents. The yellow fever vaccine is effective affordable and safe providing life-long immunity following a single dose vaccination. However the vaccine production process is slow and cannot be readily scaled up during epidemics. This has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend the use of fractional doses as a dose-sparing strategy during epidemics but there are no randomized controlled trials of fractional yellow fever vaccine doses in Africa.       Methods and analysis: We will recruit healthy adult volunteers adults living with HIV and children to a series of randomized controlled trials aiming to determine the immunogenicity and safety of fractional vaccine doses in comparison to the standard vaccine dose. The trials will be conducted across two sites; Kilifi Kenya and Mbarara Uganda. Recruited participants will be randomized to receive fractional or standard doses of yellow fever vaccine. Scheduled visits will include blood collection for serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before vaccination and on various days – up to 2 years – post-vaccination. The primary outcome is the rate of seroconversion as measured by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT    50) at 28 days post-vaccination. Secondary outcomes include antibody titre changes longevity of the immune response safety assessment using clinical data the nature and magnitude of the cellular immune response and post-vaccination control of viremia by vaccine dose.       Ethics and dissemination: The clinical trial protocols have received approval from the relevant institutional ethics and regulatory review committees in Kenya and Uganda and the WHO Ethics Review Committee. The research findings will be disseminated through open-access publications and presented at relevant conferences and workshops.       Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov    NCT02991495 (registered on 13 December 2016) and    NCT04059471 (registered on 15 August 2019).    ,
PMC6971860,2-part\_summary\abstracts\246_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Dengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes. In the 2017 a dengue epidemic occurred in Hanoi in a short time interval and many cases were serious with associated mortality. This was the largest and unusual dengue fever outbreak in the North of Vietnam over the past 20 years. The objective of the present study was to understand the genetic characteristics of the DENV-1 strain in the 2017 epidemic and its relationship with previous viruses in Vietnam and the rest of the world.       Methods   Complete genomes of 72 DENV-1 from patients in the 2017 epidemic were sequenced using NGS. The full genome sequences were then analyzed to find out the genetic variants in the groups of 72 strains followed by their comparison with other strains that caused disease in Vietnam previously and several other regions of the world revealing a genetic relationship between them.       Results   The complete genome sequence of 72 DENV-1 strains comprised 10697 nucleotides with an open reading frame coding for 3392 amino acids. The genomic analysis revealed different amino acid substitutions in all genes especially varying at position S75 (Capsid) M125 (PrM) D54 (E) T147 V180 (NS1) G45 Y126 I154 (NS2A) A94 (NS2B) M298 (NS3) K47 V68 (NS4A) I29 (NS4B) and R166 E536 G614 T821 (NS5). The genetic analysis suggested that the viruses were most closely related to the causative virus of the dengue outbreak in Vietnam and Cambodia from 2006 to 2008. These results indicated that DENV-1 from the dengue epidemic 2017 in Northern Vietnam originated from the virus that caused the dengue outbreak during the 2007 to 2008 period in Vietnam.       Conclusion   The present study is the first of its kind to describe complete genome sequence as well as genetic variants and phylogenetic analysis of DENV-1 associated with the unusual dengue epidemic of 2017 in northern Vietnam. These results provide detailed evidence to elucidate the origin circulation and genetic evolution of DENV in Vietnam.    ,
PMC6972593,2-part\_summary\abstracts\247_24_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT     Background and objective   Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause respiratory tract infections that can be fatal when the virus spreads to the alveolar space (i.e. alveolitis) and this is mainly observed with highly pathogenic strains. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the NOX2 NADPH oxidase in endosomes has been directly implicated in IAV pathology. Recently we demonstrated that treatment with a novel endosome‐targeted NOX2 oxidase inhibitor cholestanol‐conjugated gp91dsTAT (Cgp91ds‐TAT) attenuated airway inflammation and viral replication to infection with a low pathogenic influenza A viral strain. Here we determined whether suppression of endosome NOX2 oxidase prevents the lung inflammation following infection with a highly pathogenic IAV strain.       Methods   C57Bl/6 mice were intranasally treated with either DMSO vehicle (2%) or Cgp91ds‐TAT (0.2 mg/kg/day) 1 day prior to infection with the high pathogenicity PR8 IAV strain (500 PFU/mouse). At Day 3 post‐infection mice were culled for the evaluation of airway and lung inflammation viral titres and ROS generation.       Results   PR8 infection resulted in a marked degree of airway inflammation epithelial denudation alveolitis and inflammatory cell ROS production. Cgp91ds‐TAT treatment significantly attenuated airway inflammation including neutrophil influx the degree of alveolitis and inflammatory cell ROS generation. Importantly the anti‐inflammatory phenotype affected by Cgp91ds‐TAT significantly enhanced the clearance of lung viral mRNA following PR8 infection.       Conclusion   Endosomal NOX2 oxidase promotes pathogenic lung inflammation to IAV infection. The localized delivery of endosomal NOX2 oxidase inhibitors is a novel therapeutic strategy against IAV which has the potential to limit the pathogenesis caused during epidemics and pandemics.    ,

PMC6976597,2-part\_summary\abstracts\249_13_abstract.xml,   Alphaviral infections are foremost in causing debilitating clinical outcomes in humans characterized by rheumatic arthritis like conditions. Though the presence of virus in joints and associated inflammation has been implicated as one of the reasons for the acute and chronic polyarthritis post alphaviral infections the basis for rheumatic like outcomes is not clear. Through an    in silico analysis we have investigated the possibility of an autoimmune process mediated through molecular mimicry in alphaviral infection induced pathogenicity. Interestingly sequence alignment of the structural polyproteins belonging to arthritogenic alphaviruses revealed conserved regions which share homology with human proteins implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These conserved regions were predicted to exhibit binding to HLA class II alleles showcasing their potential to incite T cell help. Molecular docking of the viral peptide and the corresponding homologous region in the human protein onto HLA-DRB1 revealed strong similarities in their binding patterns. Linear and conformational B cell epitope prediction analyses showed that these potential mimics have high propensity to elicit an efficient B cell response. We thus propose that the origin of polyarthritis post-arthritogenic alphaviral infections may also be mediated through a hitherto unknown autoimmune response due to the presence of cross-reactive epitopes between viral and human proteins.    ,

Evaluation of the humoral response to vaccine administration is a key aspect of the characterization of the effectiveness of influenza vaccines. In the development of new broad-spectrum influenza vaccines it is important to study the mechanisms of action of various antibodies including non-neutralizing ones as well as to be in the possession of methods for quantifying these antibodies after immunization with new vaccines against influenza. In this review we focused on the mechanisms of anti-influenza action of non-neutralizing antibodies such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The influenza virus antigens that trigger these reactions are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) as well as highly conserved antigens such as M2 (ion channel) M1 (matrix protein) and NP (nucleoprotein). In addition the mechanisms of action and methods for detecting antibodies to neuraminidase (NA) and to the stem domain of hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus are considered.   ,
PMC6979359,2-part\_summary\abstracts\252_13_abstract.xml,   Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral disease affecting humans and non-human primates (NHP) caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV). Despite the existence of a safe vaccine YF continues to cause morbidity and mortality in thousands of people in Africa and South America. Since 2016 massive YF outbreaks have taken place in Brazil reaching YF–free zones causing thousands of deaths of humans and NHP. Here we reviewed the main epidemiological aspects new clinical findings in humans and issues regarding YFV infection in vectors and NHP in Brazil. The 2016–2019 YF epidemics have been considered the most significant outbreaks of the last 70 years in the country and the number of human cases was 2.8 times higher than total cases in the previous 36 years. A new YFV lineage was associated with the recent outbreaks with persistent circulation in Southeast Brazil until 2019. Due to the high number of infected patients it was possible to evaluate severity and death predictors and new clinical features of YF.    Haemagogus janthinomys and    Haemagogus leucocelaenus were considered the primary vectors during the outbreaks and no human case suggested the occurrence of the urban transmission cycle. YFV was detected in a variety of NHP specimens presenting viscerotropic disease similar to that described experimentally. Further studies regarding NHP sensitivity to YFV YF pathogenesis and the duration of the immune response in NHP could contribute to YF surveillance control and future strategies for NHP conservation.    ,
PMC6981203,2-part\_summary\abstracts\253_13_abstract.xml,   Lung and airway neutrophils are a hallmark of severe disease in infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced lower respiratory tract infections. Despite their abundance in the lungs during RSV infection of both mice and man the role of neutrophils in viral control and in immune pathology is not clear. Here antibody mediated neutrophil depletion was used to investigate the degree to which neutrophils impact the lung immune environment the control of viral replication and the peak severity of disease after RSV infection of mice. Neutrophil depletion did not substantially affect the levels of inflammatory mediators such as type I interferons IL-6 TNF-α or IL-1β in response to RSV. In addition the lack of neutrophils did not change the viral load during RSV infection. Neither neutrophil depletion nor the enhancement of lung neutrophils by administration of the chemoattractant CXCL1 during RSV infection affected disease severity as measured by weight loss. Therefore in this model of RSV infection lung neutrophils do not offer obvious benefits to the host in terms of increasing anti-viral inflammatory responses or restricting viral replication and neutrophils do not contribute to disease severity.  ,
PMC6983437,2-part\_summary\abstracts\254_16_abstract.xml,   This study was conducted to evaluate the regulation mechanism of influenza virus replication following treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with the soy isoflavone daidzein. We performed comparative qualitative and quantitative analyses of lipid peroxide between mock-infected and virus-infected cells treated with or without daidzein as it had been reported that daidzein was an antioxidant and lipid peroxide levels increased upon virus infection. Contrary to our belief lipid peroxides were not elevated in virus-infected cells and no decrease in lipid peroxides was observed in daidzein-treated cells. In daidzein-treated cells 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid the 5-lipoxygenase product derived from arachidonate was significantly elevated compared to other lipid peroxides. Zileuton (5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) and 5-lipoxygenase knockdown reduced the daidzein-induced antiviral effect. Moreover virus replication was regulated by treatment with 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid a precursor of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 5-lipoxygenase primary product. These results suggest that daidzein regulates virus replication via signal transduction through 5-lipoxygenase products.  ,
PMC6986714,2-part\_summary\abstracts\255_24_abstract.xml,   Mosquito-borne diseases have become a significant health issue in many regions around the world. For tropical countries diseases such as Dengue Zika and Chikungunya became epidemic in the last decades. Health surveillance reports during this period were crucial in providing scientific-based information to guide decision making and resources allocation to control outbreaks. In this work we perform data analysis of the last Chikungunya epidemics in the city of Rio de Janeiro by applying a compartmental mathematical model. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to describe the contribution of each parameter to the outbreak incidence. We estimate the “basic reproduction number” for those outbreaks and predict the potential epidemic outbreak of the Mayaro virus. We also simulated several scenarios with different public interventions to decrease the number of infected people. Such scenarios should provide insights about possible strategies to control future outbreaks.  ,

PMC6987159,2-part\_summary\abstracts\257_13_abstract.xml,   Previous work showed that the thymus can be infected by RNA viruses as HIV and HTLV-1. We thus hypothesized that the thymus might also be infected by the Zika virus (ZIKV). Herein we provide compelling evidence that ZIKV targets human thymic epithelial cells (TEC)    in vivo and    in vitro. ZIKV-infection enhances keratinization of TEC with a decrease in proliferation and increase in cell death. Moreover ZIKV modulates a high amount of coding RNAs with upregulation of genes related to cell adhesion and migration as well as non-coding genes including miRNAs circRNAs and lncRNAs. Moreover we observed enhanced attachment of lymphoblastic T-cells to infected TEC as well as virus transfer to those cells. Lastly alterations in thymuses from babies congenitally infected were seen with the presence of viral envelope protein in TEC. Taken together our data reveals that the thymus particularly the thymic epithelium is a target for the ZIKV with changes in the expression of molecules that are relevant for interactions with developing thymocytes.    ,

Diagnosis remains a cornerstone to the Peste des petits ruminants Global Control and Eradication Strategy an initiative of the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The present review presents the peste des petits ruminants diagnostic landscape including the practicality of commercially available diagnostic tools prototype tests and opportunities for new technologies. The most common peste des petits ruminants diagnostic tools include; agar gel immunodiffusion counter-immunoelectrophoresis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction either gel-based or real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays immunochromatographic lateral flow devices luciferase immunoprecipitation system and pseudotype-based assays. These tests vary in their technical demands but all require a laboratory with exception of immunochromatographic lateral flow and possibly reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays. Thus we are proposing an efficient integration of diagnostic tests for rapid and correct identification of peste des petits ruminants in endemic zones and to rapidly confirm outbreaks. Deployment of pen-side tests will improve diagnostic capacity in extremely remote settings and susceptible wildlife ecosystems where transportation of clinical samples in the optimum cold chain is unreliable.    ,

We developed a new protocol combining 31 parallel PCR assays with Illumina/MinION-based sequencing allowing generic ebolavirus genomic surveillance validated using cell culture-derived Ebola Reston Sudan and Taï Forest virus at concentrations compatible with patient viral loads. Our approach enables pre-emptive genomic surveillance of ongoing and future ebolavirus outbreaks irrespective of variant divergence.  ,
PMC6989424,2-part\_summary\abstracts\260_19_abstract.xml,   West Nile (WN) virus infection of humans is frequently asymptomatic but can also lead to WN fever or neuroinvasive disease. CD4 T cells and B cells are critical in the defense against WN virus and neutralizing antibodies which are directed against the viral glycoprotein E are an accepted correlate of protection. For the efficient production of these antibodies B cells interact directly with CD4 helper T cells that recognize peptides from E or the two other structural proteins (capsid-C and membrane-prM/M) of the virus. However the specific protein sites yielding such helper epitopes remain unknown. Here we explored the CD4 T cell response in humans after WN virus infection using a comprehensive library of overlapping peptides covering all three structural proteins. By measuring T cell responses in 29 individuals with either WN virus disease or asymptomatic infection we showed that CD4 T cells focus on peptides in specific structural elements of C and at the exposed surface of the pre- and postfusion forms of the E protein. Our data indicate that these immunodominant epitopes are recognized in the context of multiple different HLA molecules. Furthermore we observed that immunodominant antigen regions are structurally conserved and similarly targeted in other mosquito-borne flaviviruses including dengue yellow fever and Zika viruses. Together these findings indicate a strong impact of virion protein structure on epitope selection and antigenicity which is an important issue to consider in future vaccine design.  ,
PMC6991954,2-part\_summary\abstracts\261_24_abstract.xml,   In the past two decades there has been a significant expansion in the number of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are approved by regulators. The discovery of these new medicines has been driven primarily by new approaches in inflammatory diseases and oncology especially in immuno-oncology. Other recent successes have included new antibodies for use in viral diseases including HIV. The perception of very high costs associated with mAbs has led to the assumption that they play no role in prophylaxis for diseases of poverty. However improvements in antibody-expression yields and manufacturing processes indicate this is a cost-effective option for providing protection from many types of infection that should be revisited. Recent technology developments also indicate that several months of protection could be achieved with a single dose. Moreover new methods in B cell sorting now enable the systematic identification of high-quality antibodies from humanized mice or patients. This Review discusses the potential for passive immunization against schistosomiasis fungal infections dengue and other neglected diseases.  ,
PMC6992227,2-part\_summary\abstracts\262_23_abstract.xml,   Hemorrhagic fever outbreaks are difficult to diagnose and control in part because of a lack of low-cost and easily accessible diagnostic structures in countries where etiologic agents are present. Furthermore initial clinical symptoms are common and shared with other endemic diseases such as malaria or typhoid fever. Current molecular diagnostic methods such as polymerase chain reaction require trained personnel and laboratory infrastructure hindering diagnostics at the point of need particularly in outbreak settings. Therefore rapid diagnostic tests such as lateral flow can be broadly deployed and are typically well-suited to rapidly diagnose hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola virus. Early detection and control of Ebola outbreaks require simple easy-to-use assays that can detect very low amount of virus in blood. Here we developed and characterized an immunoassay test based on immunochromatography coupled to silver amplification technology to detect the secreted glycoprotein of EBOV. The glycoprotein is among the first viral proteins to be detected in blood. This strategy aims at identifying infected patients early following onset of symptoms by detecting low amount of sGP protein in blood samples. The limit of detection achieved by this sGP-targeted kit is 2.2 x 10   4 genome copies/ml in plasma as assayed in a monkey analytical cohort. Clinical performance evaluation showed a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 85.7% when evaluated with plasma samples from healthy controls and patients infected with Zaire Ebola virus from Macenta Guinea. This rapid and accurate diagnostic test could therefore be used in endemic countries for early detection of infected individuals in point of care settings. Moreover it could also support efficient clinical triage in hospitals or clinical centers and thus reducing transmission rates to prevent and better manage future severe outbreaks.    ,
PMC6992227,2-part\_summary\abstracts\263_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Ebola virus disease is a severe disease caused by Ebola virus a member of the filovirus family which occurs in humans and other primates. Ebola is believed to be zoonotic however the natural reservoir is unknown. Overlapping symptoms with other endemic diseases such as malaria and cholera make accurate diagnostic challenging. Outbreaks of Ebola have been widespread as the consequence of the absence of available rapid sensitive specific robust and affordable licensed diagnostic test in remote areas where outbreaks usually start. Here we have established and validated a rapid diagnostic test which is fast sensitive specific efficient affordable and user-friendly. Its analytical characteristics make it suitable for clinical management during Ebola virus outbreaks in remote areas. Of interest this rapid diagnostic test detects the presence of an early viral antigen the secreted glycoprotein found in blood of patients shortly after infection suggesting that it could be used to identify infected patients shortly after onset of symptoms.  ,
PMC6993346,2-part\_summary\abstracts\264_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to pose serious threats to public health. The current prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions for IAV requires frequent changes due to the continuous antigenic drift and antigenic shift of IAV. Emerging evidence indicates that the host microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. Cellular miRNAs may directly target virus to inhibit its infection and be developed as potential anti-virus drugs.       Methods   In this study we established a broad-spectrum anti-IAV miRNA screening method using miRanda software. The screened miRNAs were further verified by luciferase assay viral protein expression assay and virus replication assay.       Results   Five cellular miRNAs (miR-188-3p miR-345-5p miR-3183 miR-15-3p and miR-769-3p) targeting 99.96 95.31 92.9 94.58 and 97.24% of human IAV strains recorded in NCBI respectively were chosen for further experimental verification. Finally we found that miR-188-3p downregulated PB2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeted the predicted sites on     PB2 and effectively inhibited the replication of IAV (H1N1 H5N6 and H7N9) in A549 cells.          Conclusions   This is the first report screening cellular miRNAs that broad-spectrum inhibiting IAV infection. These findings suggested that cellular miR-188-3p could be used for RNAi-mediated anti-IAV therapeutic strategies.    ,
PMC6993835,2-part\_summary\abstracts\265_13_abstract.xml,   Encephalitis is an important cause of morbidity mortality and permanent neurologic sequelae  globally. Causes are diverse and include viral and non-viral infections of the brain as well as autoimmune processes. In the West the autoimmune encephalitides are now more common than any single infectious cause but in Asia infectious causes are still more common. In 2006 the World Health Organization coined the term “acute encephalitis syndrome” which simply means acute onset of fever with convulsions or altered consciousness or both. In 2013 the International Encephalitis Consortium set criteria for diagnosis of encephalitis on basis of clinical and laboratory features.   The most important infectious cause in the West is herpes simplex virus but globally Japanese encephalitis (JE) remains the single largest cause. Etiologic diagnosis is difficult because of the large number of agents that can cause encephalitis. Also the responsible virus may be detectable only in the brain and is either absent or transiently found in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Virological diagnosis is complex expensive and time-consuming. Different centres could make their own algorithms for investigation in accordance with the local etiologic scenarios. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography are specific for few agents. Clinically severity may vary widely. A severe case may manifest with fever convulsions coma neurologic deficits and death.   Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE)  includes two major categories: (i) classic paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (LE) with autoantibodies against intracellular neuronal antigens (Eg: Hu and Ma2) and (ii) new-type AIE with autoantibodies to neuronal surface or synaptic antigens (Eg: anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor). AIE has prominent psychiatric manifestations: psychosis aggression mutism memory loss euphoria or fear. Seizures cognitive decline coma and abnormal movements are common. Symptoms may fluctuate rapidly.   Treatment is largely supportive. Specific treatment is available for herpesvirus group and non-viral infections. Various forms of immunotherapy are used for AIE.  ,
PMC6994196,2-part\_summary\abstracts\266_20_abstract.xml,      Background   Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus of the order     Bunyavirales that causes severe disease in ruminants and humans. Outbreaks in sheep herds are characterised by newborn fatalities and abortion storms. The association of RVFV infections with abortions of ovines and other ruminants is well recognized whereas the pathology resulting in abortion has remained undescribed. Accumulating evidence suggests that RVFV is abortogenic in humans as well warranting more research on the interaction of RVFV with the ruminant and human placenta.          Methodology/Principal findings   Pregnant ewes were inoculated with a highly virulent strain of RVFV and necropsied at different days post infection. Tissues were collected and analysed by PCR virus isolation and immunohistochemistry. The results show that RVFV replicates efficiently in maternal placental epithelial cells before the virus infects foetal trophoblasts. Moreover the virus was shown to bypass the maternal epithelial cell layer by directly targeting foetal trophoblasts in the haemophagous zone a region of the ovine placenta where maternal blood is in direct contact with foetal cells. Abortion was associated with widespread necrosis of placental tissues accompanied with severe haemorrhages. Experiments with human placental explants revealed that the same virus strain replicates efficiently in both cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts.       Conclusions/Significance   This study demonstrates that RVFV targets the foetal-maternal interface in both ovine and human placentas. The virus was shown to cross the ovine placental barrier via two distinct routes ultimately resulting in placental and foetal demise followed by abortion. Our finding that RVFV replicates efficiently in human trophoblasts underscores the risk of RVFV infection for human pregnancy.    ,
PMC6994196,2-part\_summary\abstracts\267_21_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes severe disease in ruminants wildlife and humans in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Outbreaks are characterised by high mortality rates among newborn lambs and abortion storms in sheep herds. The severe outcome of RVFV infection during pregnancy in livestock is well documented whereas the pathological changes that result in abortion have not yet been described. To investigate how RVFV crosses the placenta and how infection results in abortion pregnant ewes were infected with RVFV and target cells in maternal and foetal tissues were identified at different time points after inoculation. We show that epithelial cells of the ovine placenta and foetal trophoblasts are primary target cells of RVFV and that placental demise is the primary cause of abortion. The same RVFV strain was shown to replicate efficiently in human placental explants targeting both cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts.  ,
PMC6994851,2-part\_summary\abstracts\268_18_abstract.xml,      Background   Influenza is a highly contagious viral respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses whose epidemic and pandemic have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The annual epidemic of influenza results in an estimated 3–5 million cases of severe illness and about 290000–650000 deaths globally. The vaccination program has been successful to control the epidemic however it further needs improvement. This study was aimed to investigate the types of influenza viruses prevailing in Nepal during 2016 and to match the recommended vaccine for use during the same season.       Methods   A descriptive cross sectional study was carried out at National Public Health Laboratory Kathmandu Nepal for the period of one year (Jan–Dec 2016). A total of 1683 throat swab specimen was collected from patients of different age group referred to NPHL for influenza testing. The specimen was primarily stored at 4 °C and processed using ABI 7500 RT PCR system for the identification of influenza viruses.       Results   Of the total 1683 patients suspected of having influenza infection influenza viruses were isolated from 614 (36.5%) patients with male predominance. The highest number of infection was caused by influenza A/H3 strain (51.0%) followed by influenza B (40.4%) and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (8.6%). Two peaks of infection were observed during the year 2016. The widely available trivalent vaccine during the season did not match the prevailing strain because of the dominance of B/Yamagata lineage over B/Victoria lineage.       Conclusion   We concluded that Nepal experiences semiannual cycle of influenza infection firstly during the month of January–February and secondly during the month of July–August. The vaccine to be introduced in Nepal need to be decided by national authority based on prevailing influenza types to confer effective immunization.    ,

PMC6995028,2-part\_summary\abstracts\270_17_abstract.xml,   Significance  There is a pressing need for new antiinfluenza therapeutic agents. We show that a molecularly engineered banana lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein) has broad-spectrum activity against all influenza strains tested including drug-resistant and currently circulating strains; is safe upon repeated administration in mice; and moreover is efficacious at treating lethal influenza infection via clinically pertinent routes of administration. We demonstrate that the lectin binds to the viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein and exerts its primary antiviral effect via inhibition of an early stage of the viral life cycle viral membrane fusion to the host endosomal membrane. Our findings indicate that this engineered lectin which has a mechanism of action quite distinct from the presently available agents has potential as an antiinfluenza agent.  ,
PMC6995028,2-part\_summary\abstracts\271_18_abstract.xml,   There is a strong need for a new broad-spectrum antiinfluenza therapeutic as vaccination and existing treatments are only moderately effective. We previously engineered a lectin H84T banana lectin (H84T) to retain broad-spectrum activity against multiple influenza strains including pandemic and avian while largely eliminating the potentially harmful mitogenicity of the parent compound. The amino acid mutation at position 84 from histidine to threonine minimizes the mitogenicity of the wild-type lectin while maintaining antiinfluenza activity in vitro. We now report that in a lethal mouse model H84T is indeed nonmitogenic and both early and delayed therapeutic administration of H84T intraperitoneally are highly protective as is H84T administered subcutaneously. Mechanistically attachment which we anticipated to be inhibited by H84T was only somewhat decreased by the lectin. Instead H84T is internalized into the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment and inhibits virus–endosome fusion. These studies reveal that H84T is efficacious against influenza virus in vivo and that the loss of mitogenicity seen previously in tissue culture is also seen in vivo underscoring the potential utility of H84T as a broad-spectrum antiinfluenza agent.  ,
PMC6995199,2-part\_summary\abstracts\272_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Viruses are the most numerous entities on Earth and have also been central to many episodes in the history of humankind. As the study of viruses progresses further and further there are several limitations in transferring this knowledge to undergraduate and high school students. This deficiency is due to the difficulty in designing hands-on lessons that allow students to better absorb content given limited financial resources and facilities as well as the difficulty of exploiting viral particles due to their small dimensions. The development of tools for teaching virology is important to encourage educators to expand on the covered topics and connect them to recent findings. Discoveries such as giant DNA viruses have provided an opportunity to explore aspects of viral particles in ways never seen before. Coupling these novel findings with techniques already explored by classical virology including visualization of cytopathic effects on permissive cells may represent a new way for teaching virology. This work aimed to develop a slide microscope kit that explores giant virus particles and some aspects of animal virus interaction with cell lines with the goal of providing an innovative approach to virology teaching.       Methods   Slides were produced by staining with crystal violet purified giant viruses and BSC-40 and Vero cells infected with viruses of the genera     Orthopoxvirus     Flavivirus and     Alphavirus. Slides with amoebae infected with different species of giant viruses and stained with hemacolor reagents were also produced.          Results   Staining of the giant viruses allowed better visualization of the viral particles and this technique highlights the diversity in morphology and sizes among them. Hemacolor staining enabled visualization of viral factories in amoebae and the staining of infected BSC-40 and Vero cell monolayers with crystal violet highlights plaque-forming units.       Conclusions   This kit was used in practical virology classes for the Biological Sciences course (UFMG Brazil) and it will soon be made available at a low-cost for elementary school teachers in institutions that have microscopes. We hope this tool will foster an inspiring learning environment.    ,

Both patients showed chest imaging findings of bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations. We initially suspected these patients of having influenza-associated pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia respectively and performed bronchoalveolar lavage but only human parainfluenza virus-1 infection was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing. These findings suggest that pneumonia due to human parainfluenza virus-1 should be included in the differential diagnosis of such cases.   ,
PMC6996800,2-part\_summary\abstracts\274_25_abstract.xml,   The co-circulation of different arboviruses in the same time and space poses a significant threat to public health given their rapid geographic dispersion and serious health social and economic impact. Therefore it is crucial to have high quality of case registration to estimate the real impact of each arboviruses in the population. In this work a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was developed to investigate the interrelationships between discarded and confirmed cases of dengue chikungunya and Zika in Brazil. We used data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from 2010 to 2017. There were three peaks in the series of dengue notification in this period occurring in 2013 2015 and in 2016. The series of reported cases of both Zika and chikungunya reached their peak in late 2015 and early 2016. The VAR model shows that the Zika series have a significant impact on the dengue series and vice versa suggesting that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue could actually have been cases of Zika. The model also suggests that the series of confirmed and discarded chikungunya cases are almost independent of the cases of Zika however affecting the series of dengue. In conclusion co-circulation of arboviruses with similar symptoms could have lead to misdiagnosed diseases in the surveillance system. We argue that the routinely use of mathematical and statistical models in association with traditional symptom-surveillance could help to decrease such errors and to provide early indication of possible future outbreaks. These findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and shed new light on how to handle reported cases based only in clinical-epidemiological criteria when multiples arboviruses co-circulate in the same population.  ,
PMC6996850,2-part\_summary\abstracts\275_18_abstract.xml,   Hepatitis E is an enteric disease highly prevalent in the developing countries. The basis for high mortality among pregnant hepatitis E patients remains unclear. Importantly a large proportion of infected pregnant women present with subclinical infection as well. In order to understand the possible mechanisms influencing clinical presentation of hepatitis E in pregnant women we explored a system biology approach. For this PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR 2   nd and 3   rd trimesters acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes.    In contrast to exclusive up-regulation of nonspecific early immune response transcripts in the NPR patients the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection. Induction of IFNγ gene was not detected during the acute phase irrespective of pregnancy. Association of response to vitamin D transcripts related to NK/NKT and regulatory T cells during subclinical infection are noteworthy.  The data obtained here could be correlated with several studies reported earlier in hepatitis E patients suggesting utility of PBMCs as an alternate specimen. The extensive informative data provided here for the first time should form basis for future studies that will help in understanding pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis E.  ,

In a mouse model FluAd also elicited an earlier and larger induction of HA stem antibodies with increased germinal centre responses and upregulation and long‐term expression of B‐cell switch transcription factors. Long‐term cross‐reactive memory responses were sustained by FluAd following lethal heterosubtypic influenza challenge with reduced lung damage and viral loads coinciding with increased T‐ and B‐cell recall. Advantages were also noted for the high‐dose FluZone vaccine in both humans and mice.       Conclusion   The early broadly reactive and long‐lived antibody response of FluAd indicates a potential advantage of this vaccine particularly in years when there is a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain of influenza viruses.    ,

PMC7000767,2-part\_summary\abstracts\278_13_abstract.xml,   Despite all the research done on the first Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemics it was only after the Brazilian epidemic that the Congenital Zika Syndrome was described. This was made possible due to the large number of babies born with microcephaly in the Northeast region (NE) in a narrow time. We hypothesize that the fivefold difference in the rate of microcephalic neonates between the NE and other regions is partially an effect of the population prior immunity against Dengue viruses (DENV) that cross-react with ZIKV. In this ecological study we analysed the interaction between dengue fever epidemics from 2001 to 2014 and the 2015/2016 microcephaly epidemic in 400 microregions in Brazil using random-effects models under a Bayesian approach. The estimated effect of the time lag between the most recent large dengue epidemic (&gt;400/100000 inhabitants) and the microcephaly epidemic ranged from protection (up to 6 years prior) to an increased risk (from 7 to 12 years). This sustained window of protection larger than described in previous longitudinal studies is possibly an effect of herd immunity and of multiple exposures to DENV that could boost immunity.  ,
PMC7001263,2-part\_summary\abstracts\279_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Tanzania has witnessed a significant decrease in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral hepatitis in the general population attributed to several interventional measures. It is uncertain whether this decline has also occurred among people who inject drugs (PWID). This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of HIV Hepatitis B and C viruses infection among PWID recruited from their hotspot sites in Dar es Salaam Tanzania.       Methods   A cross-sectional study conducted between June and September 2017 recruited PWID from pre-identified hotspot sites using a snowball referral sampling technique. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding socio-demographic characteristics behaviour and drug use. Blood was tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Data were entered in the computer using excel software and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.       Results   A total of 219 PWID were recruited the majority of whom were males (74.9%) unmarried (60.7%) had low education (62.6%) and low income (57.1%). The median age was 39 years with an inter-quartile range of 35–43. Approximately 32.0% had a history of drug injection for more than 3 years 79.9% were injecting drugs more than 3 times per day and 47.5% were sharing needles. The overall prevalence of HIV HBsAg and HCV was 33.8 7.8 and 50.2% respectively. There was serologic evidence of at least one infection for 68.9% while 22.4% had two or more infections. HIV infection was independently associated with being married while HCV was associated with injecting drugs for more than 3 years and unprotected sex.       Conclusion   Over two-third of PWID had serologic evidence of infection with at least one virus while 22.4% having at least two infections. The high prevalence of HIV and viral hepatitis infections among PWID may hamper initiatives of ending HIV and viral hepatitis epidemics in Tanzania.    ,

PMC7002134,2-part\_summary\abstracts\281_15_abstract.xml,   Mosquito-borne flaviviruses infect both mammals and mosquitoes. RNA interference (RNAi) has been demonstrated as an anti-flavivirus mechanism in mosquitoes; however whether and how flaviviruses induce and antagonize RNAi-mediated antiviral immunity in mammals remains unknown. We show that the nonstructural protein NS2A of dengue virus-2 (DENV2) act as a viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR). When NS2A-mediated RNAi suppression was disabled the resulting mutant DENV2 induced Dicer-dependent production of abundant DENV2-derived siRNAs in differentiated mammalian cells. VSR-disabled DENV2 showed severe replication defects in mosquito and mammalian cells and in mice that were rescued by RNAi deficiency. Moreover NS2As of multiple flaviviruses act as VSRs in vitro and during viral infection in both organisms. Overall our findings demonstrate that antiviral RNAi can be induced by flavivirus while flavivirus uses NS2A as a bona fide VSR to evade RNAi in mammals and mosquitoes highlighting the importance of RNAi in flaviviral vector-host life cycles.  ,
PMC7002310,2-part\_summary\abstracts\282_17_abstract.xml,   Swine are influenza virus reservoirs that have caused outbreaks and pandemics. Genomic characterization of these viruses enables pandemic risk assessment and vaccine comparisons though this typically occurs after a novel swine virus jumps into humans. The greatest risk occurs where large groups of swine and humans comingle. At a large swine exhibition we used Nanopore sequencing and on-site analytics to interpret 13 swine influenza virus genomes and identified an influenza virus cluster that was genetically highly varied to currently available vaccines. As part of the National Strategy for Pandemic Preparedness exercises the sequences were emailed to colleagues at the CDC who initiated the development of a synthetically derived vaccine designed to match the viruses at the exhibition. Subsequently this virus caused 14 infections in humans and was the dominant U.S. variant virus in 2018.  ,
PMC7002310,2-part\_summary\abstracts\283_18_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  While working overnight at a swine exhibition we identified an influenza A virus (IAV) outbreak in swine Nanopore sequenced 13 IAV genomes from samples we collected and predicted in real time that these viruses posed a novel risk to humans due to genetic mismatches between the viruses and current prepandemic candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). We developed and used a portable IAV sequencing and analysis platform called    Mia (Mobile Influenza Analysis) to complete and characterize full-length consensus genomes approximately 18 h after unpacking the mobile lab. Exhibition swine are a known source for zoonotic transmission of IAV to humans and pose a potential pandemic risk. Genomic analyses of IAV in swine are critical to understanding this risk the types of viruses circulating in swine and whether current vaccines developed for use in humans would be predicted to provide immune protection. Nanopore sequencing technology has enabled genome sequencing in the field at the source of viral outbreaks or at the bedside or pen-side of infected humans and animals. The acquired data however have not yet demonstrated real-time actionable public health responses. The    Mia system rapidly identified three genetically distinct swine IAV lineages from three subtypes A(H1N1) A(H3N2) and A(H1N2). Analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of the A(H1N2) viruses identified &gt;30 amino acid differences between the HA1 of these viruses and the most closely related CVV. As an exercise in pandemic preparedness all sequences were emailed to CDC collaborators who initiated the development of a synthetically derived CVV.       IMPORTANCE Swine are influenza virus reservoirs that have caused outbreaks and pandemics.

PMC7002824,2-part\_summary\abstracts\284_17_abstract.xml,   Viral infections are responsible for many illnesses and recent outbreaks have raised public health concerns. Despite the availability of many antiviral drugs they are often unsuccessful due to the generation of viral mutants and less effective against their target virus. Identifying novel antiviral drugs is therefore of critical importance and natural products are an excellent source for such discoveries. Coumarin is one such natural compound that is a potential drug candidate owing to its properties of stability solubility and low toxicity. There are numerous evidences showing its inhibitory role against infection of various viruses such as HIV Influenza Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). The mechanisms involve either inhibition of proteins essential for viral entry replication and infection or regulation of cellular pathways such as Akt-Mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and anti-oxidative pathway including NrF-2 (The nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2). This review summarizes the present state of understanding with a focus on coumarin's antiviral effect and their possible molecular mechanisms against Influenza virus HIV Hepatitis virus Dengue virus and Chikungunya virus.  ,

PMC7003685,2-part\_summary\abstracts\286_14_abstract.xml,      Background   The study of disease transmission of dengue fever (DF) is perplexing in the Indian subcontinent as all the four serotypes are circling. Also there is no efficient epidemiological examination done on dengue cases in Manipur a north-eastern territory of India.       Method   We utilized the dengue information extricated from the lab register of Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) from 2016 to 2018. All presumed outpatient and inpatients dengue cases from open and private health-care facilities are incorporated into the VRDL database whose informed consent were gotten.       Results   A sum of 1689 instances of associated patients with dengue infection was tried for dengue ELISA test and 272 (16.10%) samples were seen as seropositive. The month-wise conveyance of dengue cases is very intriguing as the three years of study demonstrates a variation design in perception. In all the three years dengue seropositive cases were seen higher in the male populace. Be that as it may there is no noteworthy incentive to the inspiration of dengue seropositive towards male than female.       Conclusion   Our examination exhibits a comparative epidemiological investigation on seroprevelance of dengue in the province of Manipur for three years. This is an endeavour to show epidemiological dengue seroprevelance in the territory of Manipur which in future would be a reference from general wellbeing worries for making up essential move intend to shorten the spread of dengue.    ,
PMC7004335,2-part\_summary\abstracts\287_26_abstract.xml,      Background   Three arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) causing human disease have been the focus of a large number of studies in the Americas since 2013 due to their global spread and epidemiological impacts: Zika dengue and chikungunya viruses. A large proportion of infections by these viruses are asymptomatic. However all three viruses are associated with moderate to severe health consequences in a small proportion of cases. Two mosquito species     Aedes aegypti and     Aedes albopictus are among the world’s most prominent arboviral vectors and are known vectors for all three viruses in the Americas.          Objectives   This review summarizes the state of the entomological literature surrounding the mosquito vectors of Zika dengue and chikungunya viruses and factors affecting virus transmission. The rationale of the review was to identify and characterize entomological studies that have been conducted in the Americas since the introduction of chikungunya virus in 2013 encompassing a period of arbovirus co-circulation and guide future research based on identified knowledge gaps.       Methods   The preliminary search for this review was conducted on PubMed (National Library of Health Bethesda MD United States). The search included the terms ‘zika’ OR ‘dengue’ OR ‘chikungunya’ AND ‘vector’ OR ‘Aedes aegypti’ OR ‘Aedes albopictus’. The search was conducted on March 1    st of 2018 and included all studies since January 1    st of 2013.          Results   A total of 96 studies were included in the scoping review after initial screening and subsequent exclusion of out-of-scope studies secondary data publications and studies unavailable in English language.       Key findings   We observed a steady increase in number of publications from 2013 to 2018 with half of all studies published from January 2017 to March 2018. Interestingly information on Zika virus vector species composition was abundant but sparse on Zika virus transmission dynamics. Few studies examined natural infection rates of Zika virus vertical transmission or co-infection with other viruses. This is in contrast to the wealth of research available on natural infection and co-infection for dengue and chikungunya viruses although vertical transmission research was sparse for all three viruses.    ,
PMC7004624,2-part\_summary\abstracts\288_21_abstract.xml,   Abstract  This paper reviews the current epidemics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in China particularly the globally available prevention strategies developed and implemented. This review focuses on HIV prevention measures in general such as education testing and counseling and in specific responses to transmission modes such as blood safety harm reduction for people who inject drugs and condom promotion to reduce sexual transmission. We also assess newly developed prevention measures such as prevention treatment pre-exposure prophylaxis post-exposure prophylaxis male circumcision and promising potential future preventions including microbicides and vaccines. Based on this assessment we provide recommendations for their implementation in China. We conclude that there is no magic bullet for HIV prevention particularly sexual transmission of the disease but only a combination of these prevention strategies can control the HIV epidemic.  ,
