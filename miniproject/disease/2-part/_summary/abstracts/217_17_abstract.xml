 <title>Significance</title>
 <p>Two influenza B viruses (Victoria and Yamagata) cocirculate in humans and contribute to the estimated 290,000â€“650,000 annual influenza-attributed deaths. Here, we analysed influenza B genomic data to understand the causes of a recent surge in human influenza B infections. We found that evolution is acting differently on Yamagata and Victoria viruses and that this has led to the cocirculation of a diverse group of influenza B viruses. If this phenomenon continues, we could potentially witness the emergence of 3 or more distinct influenza B viruses that could require their own vaccine component, thereby complicating influenza vaccine formulation and highlighting the urgency of developing universal influenza vaccines.</p>
