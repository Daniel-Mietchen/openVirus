  <title>Background</title>
  <p>This study aimed to determine the role of neopterin in the early assessment of dengue severity in children of age one month to 18 years admitted for fever and confirmed by dengue serology.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Method</title>
  <p>Two sets of samples were collected from 77 confirmed dengue patients aged one month to 18 years for serum neopterin determination. The first sample was collected at 2-3 days of fever onset, and the second sample was collected at 24–36 h after the first sample was collected and followed up cases and correlated serum neopterin levels.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Among the 77 patients enrolled, 19 were diagnosed with severe dengue, 15 patients as having dengue with warning signs, and 43 patients as having dengue fever.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>In this study, we found that the serum neopterin levels were significantly higher in the severe dengue category (mean: 58.75(±4.91) nmol/l) than in the non-severe dengue category (mean: 48.11(±8.80) nmol/l). Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between neopterin concentration and duration of fever hence, higher serum neopterin levels may indicate dengue severity. The determination of serum neopterin concentration may be used for the early assessment of severe dengue.</p>
