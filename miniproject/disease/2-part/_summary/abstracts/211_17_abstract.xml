 <p>We sequenced the genomes of two chikungunya virus isolates obtained from viremic patients who had traveled to Australia. The first patient acquired the infection in Bangladesh in 2017, and the second was infected in Thailand in 2019. Phylogenetic sequence analysis demonstrated that both isolates belonged to the East/Central/South African genotype.</p>
