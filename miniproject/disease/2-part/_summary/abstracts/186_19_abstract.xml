 <p>The threat of novel influenza infections has sparked research efforts to develop subunit vaccines that can induce a more broadly protective immunity by targeting selected regions of the virus. In general, subunit vaccines are safer but may be less immunogenic than whole cell inactivated or live attenuated vaccines. Hence, novel adjuvants that boost immunogenicity are increasingly needed as we move toward the era of modern vaccines. In addition, targeting, delivery, and display of the selected antigens on the surface of professional antigen‐presenting cells are also important in vaccine design and development. The use of nanosized particles can be one of the strategies to enhance immunogenicity as they can be efficiently recognized by antigen‐presenting cells. They can act as both immunopotentiators and delivery system for the selected antigens. This review will discuss on the applications, advantages, limitations, and types of nanoparticles (NPs) used in the preparation of influenza subunit vaccine candidates to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses.</p>
