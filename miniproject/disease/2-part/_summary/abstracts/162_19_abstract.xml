 <p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause seasonal epidemics which result in an important health and economic burden. Wild aquatic birds are the natural host of IAV. However, IAV can infect diverse hosts, including humans, domestic poultry, pigs, and others. IAVs circulating in animals occasionally cross the species barrier, infecting humans, which results in mild to very severe disease. In some cases, these viruses can acquire the ability to be transmitted among humans and initiate a pandemic. The nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein of IAV is an important antagonist of the innate immune response. In this study, using recombinant viruses and primary human cells, we show that NS1 proteins from human and avian hosts show intrinsic differences in the modulation of the innate immunity in human dendritic cells and epithelial cells, as well as different cellular localization dynamics in infected cells.</p>
