 <p>First appearing in 2011 in Northern Europe, Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an 
  <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic> of the Simbu serogroup, is associated with clinical disease mainly in ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats. The clinical signs are characterized by abortion and congenital deformities in newborns. The virus is transmitted by Culicoides midges of the Obsoletus complex. SBV infection induces a solid protective immunity that persists for at least 4 or 6 years in sheep and cattle, respectively. SBV infection can be diagnosed directly by real-time RT-qPCR and virus isolation or indirectly by serological assays. Three vaccines are commercially available in Europe. This article provides a comprehensive literature review on this emerging disease regarding pathogenesis, transmission, diagnosis, control and prevention. This review also highlights that although much has been learned since SBVâ€™s first emergence, there are still areas that require further study to devise better mitigation strategies.
