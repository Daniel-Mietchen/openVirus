 <p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has re-emerged as a major public health problem in the 21
  <sup>st</sup> Century. The four serotypes of dengue virus are capable of infecting humans with a range of symptoms and clinical outcomes, with the change in predominating serotypes often responsible for new dengue outbreaks. In this study, we surveyed urban sites in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, for 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito vectors and confirmed the presence of all four serotypes of the virus. We detected the presence of genotype V of dengue serotype 3, which has previously not been reported in the country, as well as a sylvatic strain of dengue serotype 4 that was closely related to strains obtained from forest-dwelling mosquito vectors and sentinel monkeys in Malaysia. The detection of a sylvatic strain of dengue virus in urban vectors raises questions over the risk of virus transmission to humans, especially with recent reports of severe clinical cases as a result of infection with sylvatic dengue virus serotypes. Further studies will be needed to determine the source and origins of these strains as well as the severity of dengue disease upon infection, especially with the development of new dengue vaccines.
