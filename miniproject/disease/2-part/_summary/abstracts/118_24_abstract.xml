 <p>Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the primary cause of hand, foot and mouth disease, and it can also infect the central nervous system and cause fatal outbreaks in young children. EV-A71 pathogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that EV-A71 variants with strong affinity to heparan sulfate (heparin) have a growth advantage in cell culture, but are disadvantaged 
  <italic>in vivo</italic>. When inoculated into one-day old mice, strong heparin-binding virus variants are more likely to be adsorbed to peripheral tissues, resulting in impaired ability to disseminate, and are cleared from the bloodstream rapidly. The lower viremia level resulted in no neuroinvasion. In contrast, weak heparin-binding variants show greater levels of viremia, dissemination and subsequent neurovirulence in mice. We also provide evidence that the EV-A71 heparin-binding pattern is mediated by electrostatic surface charges on the virus capsid surface. In mice, EV-A71 undergoes adaptive mutation to acquire greater negative surface charges, thus generating new virulent variants with weak heparin-binding ability which allows greater viral spread. Our study underlines the importance of electrostatic surface charges in shaping EV-A71 virulence.
