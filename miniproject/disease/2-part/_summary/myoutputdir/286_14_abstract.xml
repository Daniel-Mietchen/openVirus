  <title>Background</title>
  <p>The study of disease transmission of dengue fever (DF) is perplexing in the Indian subcontinent as all the four serotypes are circling. Also, there is no efficient epidemiological examination done on dengue cases in Manipur, a north-eastern territory of India.</p>

  <title>Method</title>
  <p>We utilized the dengue information extricated from the lab register of Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) from 2016 to 2018. All presumed outpatient and inpatients dengue cases from open and private health-care facilities are incorporated into the VRDL database whose informed consent were gotten.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>A sum of 1689 instances of associated patients with dengue infection was tried for dengue ELISA test and 272 (16.10%) samples were seen as seropositive. The month-wise conveyance of dengue cases is very intriguing as the three years of study demonstrates a variation design in perception. In all the three years dengue seropositive cases were seen higher in the male populace. Be that as it may, there is no noteworthy incentive to the inspiration of dengue seropositive towards male than female.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Our examination exhibits a comparative epidemiological investigation on seroprevelance of dengue in the province of Manipur for three years. This is an endeavour to show epidemiological dengue seroprevelance in the territory of Manipur which in future would be a reference from general wellbeing worries for making up essential move intend to shorten the spread of dengue.</p>
