 <title>Significance</title>
 <p>There is a pressing need for new antiinfluenza therapeutic agents. We show that a molecularly engineered banana lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein) has broad-spectrum activity against all influenza strains tested, including drug-resistant and currently circulating strains; is safe upon repeated administration in mice; and, moreover, is efficacious at treating lethal influenza infection via clinically pertinent routes of administration. We demonstrate that the lectin binds to the viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein and exerts its primary antiviral effect via inhibition of an early stage of the viral life cycle, viral membrane fusion to the host endosomal membrane. Our findings indicate that this engineered lectin, which has a mechanism of action quite distinct from the presently available agents, has potential as an antiinfluenza agent.</p>
