  <p>Verification of DEGs by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results showed the same relative regulation of DEGs as the RNA-seq data. qRT-PCR analysis of the expression profiles of selected genes in CA04- and PR8-infected A549 or 293T cells relative to uninfected controls 
   <bold>(A, C, E G)</bold>, A549 cells were infected with CA04 virus. 
   <bold>B, D, F, H</bold>, 293T cells were infected with PR8 virus). The fold difference was determined using the 2
   <sup>–DDCt</sup> method and RNA levels were normalized to β-actin. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) (
