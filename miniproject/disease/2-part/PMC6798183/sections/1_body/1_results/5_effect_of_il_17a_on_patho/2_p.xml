<p>An IL-17A knock-out mouse model was employed to further determine the function of IL-17A during influenza virus infection, and we utilized an IL-17A knock-out mouse model. BALB/c IL-17A knock-out or wild-type (WT) mice were infected with 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of PR8 influenza virus and then followed-up for 14 days to evaluate weight loss and survival. The PR8 virus elicited slightly decreased weight loss in IL-17A knock-out mice on early time points compared to WT animals. However, the KO mice recovered quickly and there were no deaths. Notably, none of the mice died during this experiment (

Since IAV primarily infects the mouse lung, lung samples were collected from infected animals to determine the viral titers at the indicated time points. Interestingly, as compared to the WT mice, H1N1 titers were significantly decreased in the lung tissues of IL-17A knock-out mice at 5 and 7 dpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Lung samples were also harvested from IL-17A knock-out and WT mice following infection with the PR8 virus to assess histological changes resulting from infection. The WT mice displayed slight pulmonary damage after infection with PR8 influenza virus at 7 dpi, presenting with moderate thickening of the alveolar walls and prominent infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lung homogenates were measured at 5 dpi. Interestingly, the expression levels of all genes were dramatically decreased in the IL-17A knock-out mice, as compared to the WT mice, after PR8 infection. Importantly, there was also a significant decrease in IL-17F (
