<p>Total RNA was extracted from IAV-infected or mock-infected cells using the RNeasy Mini kit. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). qPCR was performed using Brilliant SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Agilent Technology) with specific primers. The relative expression of mRNA was normalized to Î²-actin expression. Primers are listed in
