<p>In the present study, stimulation of A549 cells by IL-17A partially enhanced replication of PR8 virus. IL-17A can promote the release of IL-15, and most interestingly, can significantly suppress IL-13 expression. Previous reports indicate that IL-13 production leads to impaired antiviral immune responses, resulting in a more severe influenza virus infection (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2011</xref>). We speculate that IL-17A stimulation during H1N1 infection in A549 cells may limit the inflammatory response by regulating IL-13 expression. Consistent with previous research, we observed that IL-17A knock-out mice achieved higher survival rates and the lungs of PR8-infected IL-17A knock-out mice had lower viral titers than those of WT animals. Tissue-specific micro-environmental factors may respond to these differential reactions
