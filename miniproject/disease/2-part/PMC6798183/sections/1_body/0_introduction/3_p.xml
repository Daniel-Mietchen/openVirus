<p>Transcriptome analysis of host cellular responses to virus infection can be used to identify potential cellular factors directly or indirectly involved in viral infection (

High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, a recently developed transcriptome profiling approach, combined with bioinformatics has emerged as an important tool to extract detailed information concerning cellular signaling mechanisms (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). RNA-seq technology has the potential to reveal dynamic alterations in the pathogen genome itself and the systemic changes in host gene expression profiles during the process of infection by pathogens, which could help clarify the pathogenesis of viral infection and interactive mechanisms of pathogens. RNA-seq has been applied to study various viral infections and diseases, although previous studies have primarily focused on influenza virus infection of mouse models (
