<p>In the present study, the abilities of mouse-adapted (A/PR/08/34) and non-adapted (A/CA/04/2009) H1N1 strains of IAV to induce differential defense responses in human cells were investigated. Although both PR8 and CA04 belong to H1N1 IAV, they have distinct origins (

The results of this study provide a global view of virus type-specific and cell-specific mRNA profiles, illustrating the role, and mechanism of host/virus cellular responses during IAV infection. The differential infectivity of H1N1 IAV in A549 and 293T cells uncovered potential candidate genes that may contribute to the observed resilience of mammalian cells to pandemic IAV infection.
