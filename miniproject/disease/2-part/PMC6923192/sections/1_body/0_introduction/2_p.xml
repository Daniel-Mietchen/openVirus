<p>The risk of introduction and establishment for RVFV, JEV, and ASFV to the US have all been investigated. The emergence of RVFV on the Arabian Peninsula (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and recent reports of RVFV-infected travelers returning to France and China from areas of active RVFV transmission (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) demonstrate the feasibility of pathogen importation via air travel. Considering five potential pathways of entry, Golnar et al. predicted the most likely introduction would be through an infected human traveler, but invasion of infected mosquitoes by plane or ship also carried quantifiable risk (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and maintenance of the virus in mosquito populations by vertical transmission is possible (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Deer have recently been shown to be a susceptible amplifying host (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) with viremias capable of infecting blood-feeding mosquitoes, which significantly increases the probability of enzootic establishment (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Intensive livestock production in the US also creates a vulnerable environment for virus transmission among human and livestock communities by opportunistic mosquito vectors adapted to agricultural environments (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Barker et al. modeled the potential for RVFV transmission in California considering local vectors, hosts and environmental conditions, but understanding the long-term persistence of RVFV depended on the parameterization of the models with data that were not available at the time this model was developed (
