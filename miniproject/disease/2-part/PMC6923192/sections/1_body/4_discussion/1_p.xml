<p>While all three of these pathogens are arthropod-borne viruses, the unique biology of these three systems demonstrates that there is no single approach for the surveillance and diagnostics. Vector, animal, and public health infrastructure needs to sustain broad capacity to rapidly detect and respond to these three viruses and more. The NVSL system, including the over 60 NAHNL labs and the FADDL will play a critical role in the diagnostic testing and confirmation of these disease agents. Currently, many NAHLN laboratories are already approved for ASFV testing (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the first indicators of an introduction event of any of these diseases would likely be through recognition of sick wildlife or domestic animals or pathogen detection from carcasses. The USDA foreign animal diseases preparedness plans for each of these transboundary viruses includes a component of animal culling for biocontainment purposes, together with vector control and vaccination, if possible (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). With this in mind, capacity for passive surveillance focused on the recognition of disease symptoms in domestic and wild animals by appropriate professionals (i.e., producers, veterinarians, wildlife professionals), particularly those near high risk ports of entry and in first-responding agencies, should be prioritized in order to detect and diagnose these cases early. Rapid response and containment will minimize the spread of the disease, and broader impacts on producers. Aspects of these diseases that have been exploited as predictors of virus transmission in other parts of the world may also be effective surveillance tools in the US, including outbreak forecasting using climate models for RVF. Vector surveillance activities will likely be most informative and important immediately after initial pathogen detection in animals or humans. Vector surveillance will help to incriminate particular vector species, determine vector abundance and infection rates, genotype circulating virus strains, and evaluate the efficacy of control strategies on vector populations and pathogen infection rates. National or international guidelines on surveillance and diagnosis also exist for each of these three agents (
