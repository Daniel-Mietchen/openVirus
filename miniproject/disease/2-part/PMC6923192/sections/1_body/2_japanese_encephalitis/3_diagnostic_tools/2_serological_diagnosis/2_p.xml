<p>Currently, the recommended method for JE diagnosis of human infections is the JEV-specific IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) in CSF and serum (

These kits offer a standardized testing method for widespread use, however sensitivity and specificity issues complicate interpretation of results and may mis-inform stakeholders due to false negatives or antigen-reactivity. The “JEV MAC-ELISA” has been used since 2006 for laboratory-based surveillance of JE by the WHO Japanese encephalitis (JE) laboratory network (

Of the available MAC ELISA kits available, comparative testing determined that the “Panbio JE-Dengue IgM combo ELISA” (Inverness Medical Innovations Inc., Queensland, Australia) had a higher specificity than either the “InBios JE Detect™ MAC-ELISA (JE Detect)” (InBios International Inc., Seattle, WA) or the JEV CheX (XCyton Diagnostics Ltd., Bangalore, India) kits, however the PanBio kit has not been commercially produced since 2013 (
