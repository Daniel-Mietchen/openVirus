<p>Recognizing the problem of serological cross-reactivity among flaviviruses and its impact on surveillance and diagnosis, Cleton et al. used sera from naturally and experimentally-infected horses to develop a protein microarray to differentiate flaviviral infections in horses by NS1-antigen (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Differentiation among flaviviral infections in horses using this method was possible, however some cross-reactivity was still noted, and differentiation between vaccinated and infected horses was not possible. Still, this type of platform could be a tool for screening serum samples of symptomatic individuals for multiple flaviviruses at once (
