<p>The WHO publication, the “Manual for the Laboratory Diagnosis of Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection” (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), covers JEV epidemiology, the role of the laboratory in JEV surveillance, prevention, and control, coordination of laboratory activities at local and national scales, specimen collection and handling, laboratory diagnosis procedures, testing algorithms/workflow, and data management (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, the WHO publication, “WHO-recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases” (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) provides surveillance guidelines for a number of diseases including JE. Information included in this report include the accepted case definition, laboratory criteria for confirmation, and recommended types of surveillance (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Comprehensive syndromic surveillance for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is recommended for JEV (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). These resources will provide some initial guidance in establishing a public health laboratory surveillance network and testing algorithm for JEV in the US that is consistent with global recommendations.
