<p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) share the same serocomplex (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). There is existing field and laboratory surveillance infrastructure for these other flaviviruses in the US. Operationally, collection and testing of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and sentinel surveillance programs in place for WNV could simultaneously also support vector surveillance for JEV through expansion of the testing panel, and funding should allow for supplementary surveillance activities.
