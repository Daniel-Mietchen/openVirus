<p>Several gaps and priorities have been identified relative to ASFV control and surveillance: “(
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) raise awareness among hunters, farmers and veterinarians, (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) ensure farm locations are far from suitable wild boar areas, and in affected areas, promote confinement, (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) prepare early warning systems, contingency plans, and control measures, (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) implementation of surveillance activities based on the risk of potential exposure, introduction, and spread” (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). Strict sanitation and early detection of ASFV in new areas are paramount, because no vaccine is currently available (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). Educational campaigns will be instrumental in raising awareness among key stakeholders to ensure rapid detection and response (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). Rapid disease recognition in the field and on farms is critical, followed by laboratory confirmation. Awareness of hunters, farmers, and veterinarians to the signs and symptoms of ASF, further understanding of ASFV epidemiology in areas of introduction, and preparedness with appropriate diagnostic capabilities are all critical next steps to the detection and mitigation of an introduction of ASFV into the US. The USDA-APHIS Veterinary Services (VS) recently proposed an integrated active surveillance plan for ASF and classical swine fever targeting higher-risk populations, sick pigs, and mortality events. Currently, detection of ASF will rely on passive disease reporting. The approval of tonsil and spleen tissues as additional valid tissue types for diagnostic testing in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) presents an opportunity to integrate ASF surveillance with current CSF surveillance efforts as an active surveillance plan for swine diseases (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). USDA APHIS has also posted a disease response strategy for ASF (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). A subset of NAHLN laboratories has trained and proficiency tested analysts ready to participate in foreign animal disease investigations or surge capacity testing as needed (
