<p>Bird et al. developed a robust pan-RVF virus quantitative RT-PCR assay (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Primers and a probe were designed from the genome alignments of 40 virus isolates derived from representative vector and vertebrate hosts over time. This assay was successfully validated on human RVF clinical samples, and has clinical diagnostic capabilities out to at least 10 days post-symptom-onset. The assay developed by Wilson et al. amplifies the L and M segments as confirmatory targets, and includes a third target gene, NSs, which is deleted in multiple vaccine candidates (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). This approach will be tremendously advantageous for simultaneously monitoring vaccine coverage vs. virus spread.
