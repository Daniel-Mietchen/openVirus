<p>Recently, isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods have gained popularity for their ability to more rapidly detect pathogen nucleic acids directly in a clinical or field sample, and not necessarily require RNA extraction. Eular et al. developed an “isothermal ‘recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)' assay” on an “ESEquant tubescanner device.” While lacking in sensitivity compared to qRT-PCR, the portability of this system could be a potential tool for field, pen side or bedside diagnostics (
