<p>The select agent status of RVFV limits the tests and control material that can be handled by veterinary diagnostic laboratories that operate at BSL-2. Therefore, Drolet et al. “modified an existing one-step real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for quick virus inactivation and use in BSL-2 laboratories” (
