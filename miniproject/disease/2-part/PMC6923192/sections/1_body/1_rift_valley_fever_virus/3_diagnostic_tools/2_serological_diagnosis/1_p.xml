<p>VanVuren and Paweska developed an ELISA based on the capture of the nucleocapsid protein (NP) (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Alternatively, a monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA developed by Kim et al. for the detected antibodies against RVFV in goats and cattle with a sensitivity/specificity of 94.7/99.7% between 9 and 11 days post-inoculation (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). A multiplex fluorescence microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) also detected cattle and sheep IgM and IgG antibodies to the RVFV glycoprotein, non-structural proteins, and nucleoprotein (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). They also reported that the “N protein was the best target for early detection of infection” (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). A novel lateral flow strip test has recently been developed based on detection of the N protein, for use as a pen side diagnostic (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Importantly, McElroy et al. developed an ELISA that can be used to differentiate infected from those that had been vaccinated a ΔNSm/ΔNSs double-mutant vaccine (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).
