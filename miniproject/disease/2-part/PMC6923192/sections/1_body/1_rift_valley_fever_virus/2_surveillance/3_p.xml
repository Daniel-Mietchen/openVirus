<p>Of particular relevance to a potential introduction of RVFV to the US, the AU-IBAR SMP document lists recommendations for surveillance approaches in areas which have not yet reported RVFV activity, in order to promote early detection and rapid response to a virus introduction. Among these recommendations are a combination of passive (continuous) and active surveillance (as needed, according to perceived risk) (

Passive surveillance would involve the distribution of educational materials to veterinary personnel, and syndromic surveillance conducted by veterinarians, livestock handlers, and wildlife agencies. A specific reporting network is outlined for when suspicious cases are identified. Active surveillance would include serosurveillance, syndromic surveillance, and the regular monitoring of RVFV antibody levels in sentinel herds or flocks. Enhanced vector surveillance is recommended during interepidemic activities, to monitor for increased virus infection rates in mosquito populations. Supporting these surveillance activities should be administrative preparations, such as capacity building and training, and development of a policy framework to support surveillance activities (
