<p>In 2014, the African Union-InterAfrican Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) published a framework to support consistency and coordination of disease control activities, referred to as the “Standard Methods and Procedures (SMPs) for control of RVF in the Greater Horn of Africa” (

The overall approach concerning the development of these SMPs relies on the coordination of disease prevention and control activities in each participating region (i.e., Greater Horn of Africa) to a set of regional minimum standards and procedures that align with the OIE standards (

This SMP document provides valuable information on surveillance and epidemiology, diagnosis and laboratory detection, disease control, disease reporting and information management, RVF and trade, and risk analysis and risk mapping, and is supported by specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for each subject area in accordance with the structure and capabilities of each nation.
