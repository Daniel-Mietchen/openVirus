<p>The ability to predict likely times when an outbreak may occur would provide incredible power toward the timely mobilization of intervention and control measures. For RVF outbreaks in East Africa, a close association between epizootic activity and the occurrence of El Niño has been documented (

In particular, NASA has developed an outbreak risk mapping system for RVFV that inputs a variety of satellite measurements to produce a dynamic map of areas at potential risk of virus transmission. This “

In 2008, the WHO convened a joint meeting of experts with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to share experiences and discuss the predictability of forecasting models for RVF, and develop guidelines for improving prediction and response capabilities to RVF outbreaks (
