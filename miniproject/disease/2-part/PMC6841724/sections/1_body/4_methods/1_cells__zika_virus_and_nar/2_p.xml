<p id="Par26">Zika viruses were isolated from serum of infected patients in Northeast (2015) (ZV BR 2015/15261; ZV BR 2015/15098) and South Brazil (2016) (ZV BR 2016/16288). Since our laboratory is a Reference Center for the Diagnosis of Emerging Viruses of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we obtained the waiver from the Brazilian National Ethics Committee of Human Experimentation for the written informed consent to work with these samples. However, the study with human serum samples was approved by Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz) and the Brazilian National Ethics Committee of Human Experimentation under the number CAAE: 42481115.7.0000.5248. Finally, the study is in compliance with all the ethical principles of the Brazilian National Ethics Committee of Human Experimentation. Additionally, the laboratory-adapted ZIKV strains ZIKV PE243
