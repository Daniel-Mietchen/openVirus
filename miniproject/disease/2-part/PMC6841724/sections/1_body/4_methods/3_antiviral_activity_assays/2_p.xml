<p id="Par30">For the immunofluorescence assay, the A549 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well plates) were infected with MOI 0.1. After 90 minutes, the cells were washed and treated with NAR (125 μM) in DMEM-F12. After 48 hours, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol:acetone (v/v) and the cell infection was analyzed after being labeled with 4G2 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, New York, USA). Digital images were taken from 4 different fields (20x magnification). The infection percentage was quantified in an Operetta High-Content Imaging System using Harmony High Content Imaging and Analysis software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
