 </sup>, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-ZIKV activity of NAR was assessed in cell lines potentially involved in ZIKV-pathogenesis, like human glioblastoma cell line (A172) and human embryonic stem cell line (NKX2-5
 <sup>eGFP/w</sup>hESC). Thus, using ZIKV strains from Asian- and African-lineage and two different techniques (FACS and foci-forming immunodetection assay) it was shown that NAR was able to reduce the infection in glioblastoma cell line (A172) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9B</xref>), while no effect was observed in human embryonic stem cell line (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). In spite of the fact that no effect was observed in human embryonic stem cell line, the anti-ZIKV activity of NAR was confirmed using other human cell line, Huh7.5, from the hepatic origin (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9D</xref>).
