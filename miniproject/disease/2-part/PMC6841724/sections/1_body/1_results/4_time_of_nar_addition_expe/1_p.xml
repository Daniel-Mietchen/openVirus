 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). The results indicate that NAR treatment simultaneous to the addition of ZIKV-inoculum and after inoculum removal (during + after infection) or only after inoculum removal (after infection) seems to impact the ZIKV infected-A549 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B–E</xref>). Also, a slightly anti-ZIKV effect was observed if A549 cells were pretreated with NAR for long periods of time (18 h) before infection, compared to 1.5 h used in the experiment (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Additionally, to confirm the efficiency of NAR treatment, we added NAR to the cell cultures at different time points after infection establishment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A–D</xref>). The results showed the reduction of viral titers in A549 cells even when cells were treated 24 hpi. However, when the NAR treatment was postponed to 24 hpi, we observe increased viral titers in cell culture supernatant when compared to those observed in A549 cells treated up to 6 hpi. Otherwise, IFN-α 2A showed similar results for the reduction of infected cells, but it was not as efficient at reducing the viable virus particles in the cell culture supernatant as NAR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that NAR might act on the replication, maturation or assembly of viral particles.
