<p id="Par24">Here, we used different techniques to show that NAR presents anti-ZIKV activity. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> NAR was effective against distinct ZIKV lineages (Asian and African) and seems to act during the late phase of the viral life cycle, probably as a non-competitive inhibitor of NS2B-NS3 protease. NAR keeps its antiviral activity even when it is added several hours post-infection, supporting the idea that NAR can target virus replication. Altogether, the results demonstrated that NAR could be a suitable candidate for ZIKV therapy. Finally, further studies should be undertaken to improve the understanding of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity of NAR and to establish whether it is effective 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
