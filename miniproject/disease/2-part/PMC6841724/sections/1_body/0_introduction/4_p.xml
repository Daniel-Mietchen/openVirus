<p id="Par5">Here, NAR was shown to present 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-ZIKV activity against four different strains of recent clinical isolates of the Asian lineage and one classical African lineage. Additionally, the antiviral activity of NAR seems to occur in the late steps of virus life cycle. A promising characteristic of NAR is that the antiviral effect is observed even when it is added to cultures 24â€‰hours after the establishment of the infection. Finally, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> docking analysis suggests a close interaction between NAR and the protease domain of ZIKV, strengthening the data from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.
