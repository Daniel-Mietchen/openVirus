<p id="Par4">In Brazil, between December 2015 and March 2018 more than 230,000 cases of ZIKV-infection were reported
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, 3,100 cases of children with ZIKV-associated congenital and neurological syndrome were confirmed
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. At present, neither a vaccine nor an antiviral drug is available to prevent or treat the ZIKV infection. Despite recent advances in drug discovery against ZIKV, no antiviral compound has been authorized at the phase I clinical trial level
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are present in a wide range of fruits and vegetables as low-molecular weight secondary metabolites
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Flavonoids are known to have antiviral activity against HIV-1, herpes simplex 1 and 2, influenza, dengue and yellow fever
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, it was demonstrated that several flavonoids could inhibit Zika virus infection

 <italic>in vivo</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. The antiviral effect of flavonoids seems to occur through interactions between the phenol rings of flavonoids and viral proteins and/or RNA, or via its capacity to interfere in host cell defense by regulating MAP kinase signaling

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Naringenin (NAR) (4, 5, 7-trihydroxyflavanone), a natural flavonoid aglycone of naringin, is widely distributed in citrus fruits, tomatoes, cherries, grapefruits and cocoa
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. NAR was shown to present a wide range of activities, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, NAR was recently shown to have anti-dengue virus activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>, and the similarities between these flaviviruses prompted us to test NAR against ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>.
