  <p>Toxicity of NAR to A549 cells. A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of NAR (2,000 to 62.5 μM) for 48 hours. DMSO (1%) was used as a control and vehicle for the preparation of NAR stock. The cell viability was analyzed through Annexin-V and 7-AAD staining by flow cytometry. (

   <bold>C</bold>) The NAR concentration that promoted a 50% reduction in cell viability (CC
   <sub>50</sub>) was obtained by using nonlinear regression, a sigmoidal concentration-response curve and a variable slope (GraphPad Prism; La Jolla, CA.USA). (
   <bold>D</bold>) The average number of cells (cell nuclei count after counterstained with DRAQ5) presented in culture in each experimental condition determined by Operetta high-content imaging system. Analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey´s Multiple Comparison Test (*
