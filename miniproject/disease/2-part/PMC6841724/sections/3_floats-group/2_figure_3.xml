  <p>NAR impairs the A549 infection by Zika virus. A549 cells were infected with ZIKV (ZV BR 2015/15261; MOI 0.1) and treated with NAR (125 µM) or IFN-α 2A (200 IU/mL) after inoculum removal or uninfected (MOCK-control). After 48 hours, the numbers of infected A549 cells were quantified using a high-content imaging assay (20X magnification; Operetta High-Content Imaging System from PerkinElmer). (
