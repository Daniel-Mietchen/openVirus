<p>Although there have now been many papers documenting various portions of the Chikungunya virus outbreak in Brazil, this manuscript benefits from the fact that no genomic data have been generated in 2016 in Bahia state, contributing to add knowledge regarding the persistence as well as the transmission dynamics of these virus in Brazil. This manuscript does not provide a large conceptual advance in our understanding of the Chikungunya virus outbreak in the Americas, but it does tell a nice story. With some minor changes, I think it would be suitable for publication in Plos One.</p>
