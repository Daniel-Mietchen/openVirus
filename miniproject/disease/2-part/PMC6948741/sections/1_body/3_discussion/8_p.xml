<p>CHIKV infection in FS was characterized by two distinct epidemic waves (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0226098.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), the first one took place 3 months after the virus introduction by a returning traveller in 2014 and the second wave occurred in 2015 between 4
 <sup>th</sup> and 11
 <sup>th</sup> epidemiological weeks. Climate conditions and the HI related factors may have contributed for this epidemiological behaviour of CHIKV in FS. When the virus was introduced in July 2014, the climate conditions did not favor the reproduction and dispersion of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (vector), although the population was immunologically susceptible [

On the other hand, a second epidemic wave occurred in a rain-intermittent period that contributes to urban and dwelling water accumulation and may have favored vector proliferation and expansion of infection. Also, the sub-notification of CHIKV cases by health care services may have masked the real range of the epidemy between the two waves [
