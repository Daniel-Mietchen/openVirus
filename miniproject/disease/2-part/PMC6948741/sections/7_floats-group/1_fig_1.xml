  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of chikungunya virus human samples from Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil.</title>
  <p>The municipality of Feira de Santana (FS) is located at a confluence of national highways. In A, federal highways BR-116 and BR-324 are shown in FS area. The BR-116 is the second longest highway in Brazil, it comprises 4,490 kilometers (2,790 mi) connecting Fortaleza (Ceará), one of the largest Northeast Brazil metropolises, to the southern city of Jaguarão, (Rio Grande do Sul), in the border with Uruguay. The BR-324 begins in Balsas (Maranhão) and ends in Salvador, where it plays an important role in connecting the road junction in FS to the capital, making it one of the main highways in the state. In B, new generated sequences belong to CHIKV-ECSA genotype and is clustered in a single strongly supported monophyletic clade that includes older FS sequences (bootstrap support = 98%) (orange).</p>
