  <title>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis.</title>
  <p>Proportion of reads that supports each reference (blue) or SNP (red) variant. SNPs names denotes the position along the KP164568 reference genome following by the reference and variant nucleotide. Green, grey and brow SNPs names are non-synonymous, synonymous and stop codons SNPs. b_29L and c_29SR are blood from patient 1 (plasma and serum respectively); d_45PL correspond to plasma, e_45SR to serum and f_45FL to saliva from patient 2.</p>
