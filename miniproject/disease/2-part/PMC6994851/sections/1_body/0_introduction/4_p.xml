<p id="p0020">Studies suggest that influenza virus has an annual or semi-annual cycle based on geography and climatic conditions. Generally, annual cycle occurs in temperate region with a peak in winter. Tropics/subtropics region may involve annual, semi-annual or year-round activity [

This may results in epidemic or pandemic that can alter the intervention action concerning vaccination program and other preventive measures of a country [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous records also show that pandemic in the past was either due to antigenic shift with strains from the avian reservoir or by direct introduction of an avian strain into the human population [
