<p id="p0090">The findings from this study also suggest that influenza prevalence was higher in Kathmandu and nearby districts. These districts are densely populated according to the report of Central Bureau of Statistics [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Because the transmission of influenza virus mainly occur by aerosol inhalation and spread more rapidly in crowded areas, these districts had higher prevalence of influenza in comparison to other districts of Nepal [

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As higher temperature enhances defense mechanism and decreases replication of influenza virus, Kathmandu valley having lower temperature favors influenza virus replication which might also be the reason for higher prevalence rate [
