<p id="p0095">Our study suggests that 2016 influenza season was dominated by influenza A/H3 strain. Besides that, influenza B infection was also found in higher number of cases among which B/Yamagata lineage was more prevalent than B/Victoria lineage. According to the report, WHO had recommended both trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine to be used in countries in northern hemisphere during 2016â€“2017 season [

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In Nepal, influenza vaccine was not provided to the public at government level and also we did not find any guidelines made by national authorities in Nepal regarding influenza vaccine use. However, clinician preferred to use trivalent vaccine and, was widely available in Nepal during the season. The trivalent vaccine consisted of: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. The antigenic and genetic characteristics of B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus was closely related to most B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses.
