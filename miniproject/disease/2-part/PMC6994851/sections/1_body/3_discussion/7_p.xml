<p id="p0100">But, since we found B/Yamagata lineage dominant in Nepal over B/Victoria lineage in year 2016, we noticed a mismatch between prevailing strain and available vaccine in 2016–2017 seasons. An implication of these findings is the potential for improvement in vaccination program in the country. The previously published researches suggest that B/Victoria lineage was dominant in most of the south Asian countries which we found different in our study [

For this reason the vaccine to be introduced in Nepal should be decided by national authority in Nepal based on prevailing strain to confer effective immunization. Furthermore, when we consider the timing for influenza vaccination, the vaccine needs to be introduced within 4 months prior to peak season and twice a year as this study observed two peaks in year 2016; first during winter in the month of January–February and second after rainy season in the month of July–August. Because we observe only 2016 influenza season, the recommendation for vaccination twice a year should be further conformed by a longitudinal study in the country.
