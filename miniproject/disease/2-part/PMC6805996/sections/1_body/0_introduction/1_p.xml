<p>The picornavirus enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) recently reemerged as an infectious cause of severe respiratory distress in young children (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), few cases of EV-D68 infection were reported (

However, a 1962 virus isolate not within the B clade was found to be neurovirulent in suckling mice (
