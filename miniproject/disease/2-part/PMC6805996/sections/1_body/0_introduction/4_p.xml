<p>We used multiple approaches to determine if EV-D68 isolates from 1962 to 2014 are neurotropic, by determining whether they replicate within astrocytes and neurons, using murine organotypic brain slice cultures, which allow for the separation of neurotropism and neuroinvasion; primary murine astrocytes; human induced neurons and astrocytes; and 
 <italic>ifnar</italic> knockout mice. As sialic acid binding varies among these isolates, it was also possible to assess the role of this sugar in neurotropism.
