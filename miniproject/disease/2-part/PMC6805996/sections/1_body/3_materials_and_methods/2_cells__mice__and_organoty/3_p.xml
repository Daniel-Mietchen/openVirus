<p>At the appropriate time postbirth, C57/BL6 mice were euthanized per animal study protocol and brains from were dissected into ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisting of 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, and 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4, 310 mosmol
 <sup>−1</sup>. Brains were embedded in 4% low-melting-point agarose dissolved in ACSF and sliced into 300-μm coronal sections using a vibratome (Zeiss). Slices were maintained on 0.4-μm, 30-mm-diameter Millicell-CM inserts (Millipore) in cortical culture medium (CCM) containing 25% Hanks balanced salt solution, 47% neurabasal MEM, 25% normal horse serum, 1× penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine, and 30% glucose. Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with constant 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> supply.
