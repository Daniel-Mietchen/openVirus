<p>RD cells were seeded on 60-mm plates for approximately 70% confluence at the time of plaquing. Next, 100-μl portions of serial 10-fold virus dilutions were incubated with cells for 1 h at 37°C. Two overlays were added to the infected cells. The first overlay consisted of 2 ml of DMEM, 0.8% Noble agar, 40 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 10% bovine calf serum. After solidification, a second liquid overlay was added that was composed of 1 DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 40 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.2% glucose, 2 mM pyruvate, 4 mM glutamine, and 4 mM oxaloacetic acid. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 to 6 days and developed by using 10% trichloroacetic acid and crystal violet.
