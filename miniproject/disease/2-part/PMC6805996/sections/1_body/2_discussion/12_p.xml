<p>The identity of the receptors for EV-D68 remains poorly defined. ICAM-5 has been suggested to function as a proteinaceous receptor for EV-D68 in the brain (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, production of ICAM-5 is restricted to the telencephalon, the most rostral segment of the brain region; consequently, it is not present on the surface of cells within the brain stem or spinal cord, two sites where lesions are found in radiological images of EV-D68-infected children (

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Furthermore, ICAM-5 is not found on the surface of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, the primary site of EV-D68 infection (

The cells that we use to propagate EV-D68, including RD cells, N2A cells, MEFs, and induced human neurons and astrocytes, do not produce cell surface ICAM-5 as determined by flow cytometry, nor do they produce ICAM-5 mRNA (data not shown). The absence of ICAM-5 on the surface of induced human neurons has also been confirmed by others (
