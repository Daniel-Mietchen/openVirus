<p>An important question is why EV-D68 did not induce paralysis after intracranial inoculation of virus into 10-day-old wild-type mice, but replication was observed in organotypic brain slice cultures derived from mice of the same age. One possible explanation for these observations is that paralysis is immune mediated, dependent upon immune cells which infiltrate the CNS from the periphery. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that children infected with EV-D68 develop paralytic disease 8 to 10â€‰days after diagnosis of the respiratory disease.</p>
