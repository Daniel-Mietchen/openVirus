<p>The role of sialic acid in EV-D68 infection is also unclear. Certain isolates of the virus can hemagglutinate red blood cells and can replicate in cells treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid (

 <sub>14</sub> fatty acid from a hydrophobic pocket, allowing for the partial collapse of the canyon (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). However, VP4 density was still observed in the structure of the EV-D68â€“sialic acid complex. Moreover, no change in the size of the virion was observed in the presence of sialylated receptor analogues at room temperature (data not shown), suggesting that sialic acid may only initiate the first step of the entry process, attachment to the cell surface, and is not involved in conformational changes related to uncoating (

 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid synthase in cells, which is required for synthesis of sialic acids, impairs replication of some, but not all, isolates of EV-D68 (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, it was not demonstrated that lack of sialic acid impairs virus binding to cells. Disruption of sialic acid production not only affects protein glycosylation but also impairs synthesis of glycolipids. The formation and function of intracellular vesicles and proper fusion between these vesicles are dependent upon glycolipids. Such vesicles are critical for the entry and RNA synthesis of enteroviruses. Our results confirm that removal of sialic acid from the cell surface with neuraminidase impairs infection with specific isolates of EV-D68, but it is important to note that such treatment only allows for the function of extracellular sialic acid to be assessed. We also find that the ability of EV-D68 to hemagglutinate guinea pig red blood cells varies according to isolate, and no isolate that we examined hemagglutinated human red blood cells. Nevertheless, all of the EV-D68 isolates replicate in organotypic brain slices from mice. We conclude that binding to sialic acid is not essential for infection of the brain. These data have been confirmed by others (
