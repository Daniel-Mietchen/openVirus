<p>Based on the observations made in organotypic brain slice cultures, we conclude that EV-D68 is neurotropic independently of its genetic lineage and that neurotropism is not a recently acquired phenotype as has been suggested elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Instead, our data align with recent phylogenetic analysis demonstrating that EV-D68 sequences from AFM patients do not form a monophyletic group but are interspersed among the clades (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Furthermore, the observation that 6% of 1-day-old mice intracranially inoculated with the Rhyne isolate of EV-D68 did develop paralysis adds additional support for our hypothesis that neurotropism of the virus is not a newly acquired phenotype (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It is possible that recent changes in the genome of EV-D68 allow invasion of the virus into the central nervous system from the periphery. This hypothesis seems unlikely because a major selective force for viral evolution is transmission to a new host. Once a virus enters the central nervous system, it cannot be transmitted to another host. Therefore, unless the evolution of neurovirulence was an accidental consequence of other selective forces, selection for neuroinvasion seems highly unlikely.
