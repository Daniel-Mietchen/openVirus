<p>Several reports, including the initial description of the virus, have shown that,

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Furthermore, the crystal structure of sialic acid bound to EV-D68 revealed that sialic acid binds within the canyon located at the 5-fold axis of symmetry (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). To determine if sialic acid interacts with multiple isolates, hemagglutination assays were performed using red blood cells (RBCs) from both guinea pigs and humans. Nine different batches of human RBCs comprising 3 donors per batch were used. Fermon and three isolates from 2014 (947, 949, and 956) agglutinated guinea pig RBCs; no isolate agglutinated human RBCs (
