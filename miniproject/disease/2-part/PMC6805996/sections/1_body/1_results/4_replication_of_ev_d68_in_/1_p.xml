<p>To determine if EV-D68 can productively infect cells of the human CNS, cortical neuron and astrocyte cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were infected with multiple virus isolates. Sensory, inhibitory, and excitatory neurons along with motor neurons can be found within cortical neuron cultures. Culture medium was collected at various times postinfection, and virus production was assessed by plaque assay. Replication of all isolates except 952 was observed in cultures of induced neurons (
