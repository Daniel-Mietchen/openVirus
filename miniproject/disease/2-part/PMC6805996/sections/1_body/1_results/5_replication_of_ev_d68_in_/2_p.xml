<p>The effect of EV-D68 infection on organotypic brain slices was determined using cultures generated from P2, P4, and P10 mice. Virus replication was assessed by plaque assay at various times postinfection. All EV-D68 isolates productively infected brain slice cultures from P2, P4, and P10 mice (

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes VP1 of EV-D68, as well as NeuroTrace Nissl stain, a dye that selectively binds Nissl substance found within in the cytoplasm of neurons within the brain and spinal cord, revealed that all EV-D68 isolates infected Nissl-stained neurons (

To determine if murine astrocytes can be infected with EV-D68, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes were isolated from brains of P1 and P3 postnatal mice and infected with all isolates. Three of seven EV-D68 isolates (NY, Fermon, and 947) productively infected these cells (
