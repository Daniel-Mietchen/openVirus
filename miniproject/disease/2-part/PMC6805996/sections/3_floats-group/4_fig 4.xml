  <p>Replication of EV-D68 isolates in organotypic brain slice cultures generated from postnatal day 2, 4, and 10 mice. Time course of replication of multiple isolates of EV-D68 in organotypic brain slice cultures produced from postnatal day 2 (P2), 4 (P4), and 10 (P10) mice. Cultures were infected with 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of virus and incubated at 33°C. At indicated times, cultures were harvested and assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. Results are representative of three independent experiments.
