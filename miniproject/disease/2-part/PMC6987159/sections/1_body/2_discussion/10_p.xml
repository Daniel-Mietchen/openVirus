<p id="Par35">Studies involving lncRNA associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis and cell adhesion have been already described. We hypothesize that upregulation of PICART1 may also suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in ZIKV-infected human TEC, as shown by other authors that this lncRNA impairing proliferation

 </sup>. Accordingly, the upregulation of SENCR may be involved in regulating the enhancement of cell adhesion seen in ZIKV-infected TEC. The transcriptome and miRNA sequencing also revealed that genes associated with adhesion and ECM molecules were activated by infection by ZIKV, including coding and non-coding genes. Overall, our findings highlight a high complexity in the intracellular circuitry controlling ZIKV replication within human TEC.
