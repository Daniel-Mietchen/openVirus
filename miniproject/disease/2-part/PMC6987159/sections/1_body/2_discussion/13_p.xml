<p id="Par38">Rather surprisingly however, the virus genome was detected, by using qRT-PCR, only in one case. This can be explained by the fact the material applied was the bulk of thymic tissues whereas the immunohistochemical data revealed detectable amounts of the virus only in some microenvironmental cells (most of them epithelial). Moreover, in this particular case we did not see 4G2
 <sup>+</sup> cells in the thymus sections we examined. One conceivable explanation for the fact that the only thymic extract positive for qRT-PCR was negative for immunolabeling with the 4G2 monoclonal antibody is that in this particular case, the presence of the virus was restricted to one part of the thymus that was not evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
