<p id="Par34">We also identified several cirRNAs which can serve as miRNA sponges and are crucial regulators of gene expression

 </sup>. The major class of non-coding lncRNAs also shows antiviral activity and involvement in cell proliferation and apoptosis. The LUARIS lncRNA expression level was decreased, indicating that it may be suppressed by IFNB1, which, in turn, was highly induced in ZIKV-infected human TEC. The expression of some interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and chemokines showed altered levels of transcripts, indicating that LUARIS could act in antiviral immunity. The same regulation pattern of ISGs and chemokines was found in infection by other human viruses such as HBV, HCV, and EMCV

 </sup>. Following ZIKV infection in TEC, we also detected an upregulation of the lncRNA EGOT, which is also induced after HCV infection, increasing viral replication
