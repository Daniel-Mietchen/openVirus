<p id="Par45">TEC were plated and 24 h later incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> with culture media containing 10 µg/mL of goat anti-AXL polyclonal antibody (R&amp;D Systems). Identical concentrations of IgG from normal goat serum were used as control. IgG amounts present in normal goat serum were quantified in Nanodrop™ 2000/2000c Spectrophotometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then infected as described previously in the presence of anti-AXL. Our experiments on the role of the AXL receptor in ZIKV entry in TECs were based on the paper of Hamel and co-workers, showing that exposure of the human skin fibroblast cell line HFF1 to ZIKV (and to Dengue virus, used as a positive control) resulted in comparable numbers of infected cells that were inhibited 70% and 50%, respectively, in the presence of the same neutralizing anti-AXL antibody
