<p id="Par41">The ZIKV strain used in this study was RIO-U1, which was isolated in 2016 from urine of a patient from Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil (GenBank Accession number: KU926309), as described elsewhere
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. Viral stocks of ZIKV Rio-U1 were prepared by infecting Vero cell monolayers. The titer (PFU/ml) and the genome integrity were determined as described elsewhere
