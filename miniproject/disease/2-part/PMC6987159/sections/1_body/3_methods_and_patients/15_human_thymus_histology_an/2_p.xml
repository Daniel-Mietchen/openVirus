<p id="Par64">In brief, paraffin-embedded thymus sections (4 µm) were maintained at 65 °C overnight. The slides were deparaffinized in two passages in xylene and three passages in absolute alcohol for two min each. Samples were hydrated in distilled water and the peroxidase blockade was performed. The slides were washed with PBS and antigenic recovery was performed in water bath at 96 °C with 10% Trilogy solution for 40 min. After cooling for 20 min, the slides were washed with PBS and blocked with 2% BSA for 40 min. Thereafter, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-cytokeratin and 4G2 antibody. The slides were washed twice with permeabilization buffer and incubated for 30 min with secondary antibodies for 30 min. After being washed twice with permeabilization buffer, samples were incubated for 10 min with DAPI and washed again. Immunostained samples were analyzed by the Leica TSC SP8 Confocal device using LAS-X Software.</p>
