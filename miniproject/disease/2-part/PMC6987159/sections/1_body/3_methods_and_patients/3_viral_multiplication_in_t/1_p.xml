<p id="Par44">An aliquot of supernatant was collected every 24 h after infection for three days and frozen at −80 °C. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in a 24-well plate (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup>), 24 h before inoculation. Serial dilutions of the supernatant were used to infect cell monolayers. After 1 h incubation at 37 °C, the supernatant was replaced by 2.4% CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) in Earle’s 199 complete medium supplemented with 5% FBS, followed by incubation for 7 days at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde, washed, and dyed with 0.4% crystal violet. Viral titer was determined from the numbers of plaques visualized.
