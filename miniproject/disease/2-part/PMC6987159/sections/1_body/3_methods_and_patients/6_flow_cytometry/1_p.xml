<p id="Par47">Intracellular staining of viral protein was performed with True-Nuclear™ transcriptional factor buffer set (Biolegend). Cells were incubated with 1x Fix Concentrate buffer for 40 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with normal human serum for 20 min at 4 °C. Then, cells were stained with 4G2 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and stained with secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. After, cells were washed with 1x Perm buffer, as well as between each incubation. Subsequently, cells were fixed with formaldehyde 2% and evaluated by flow cytometry.</p>
