<p id="Par12">The enrichment analysis of DEGs in ZIKV-infected TEC allowed to identify upregulated pathways involved with interleukin and interferon signaling, extracellular matrix organization, integrin cell surface interactions, NCAM1 interactions, NCAM signaling and ECM proteoglycans in Reactome enrichment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>, Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The GO enrichment analysis revealed categories also associated with extracellular matrix, response to virus and bacteria, cytokine production, defense response to virus (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In addition, we found genes with enhanced expression by ZIKV-infected TEC such as CCL4, CCL5, CCL20, CXCL10, GBP2, GBP4, GBP5, GBP6, IFNB1, IFNL1, 2 and 3, IL12B, IL18RAP, MX1, MX2, NOS2, NOD2, OAS2, OASL, RSAD2, and TNF. Other upregulated antiviral genes were found, including IFIH1 and DDX58, which act as cytoplasmic sensors of viral nucleic acids, and DHX58, which mediates antiviral signaling and induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines (Supplemental Tables
