<p id="Par13">The Enrichment Analysis of Reactome also revealed upregulated genes included in extracellular matrix organization, and recognized as adhesion molecules, such as ADAMTS4, ACAM, ICAM1, ICAM4, VCAM1, ITGAM, PECAM1, CEACAM1, JAM2, MMP8, ITGA9, LAMA2 LAMA3, LAMA4, LAMC3, COL2A1, COL20A1, and COL26A1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Interestingly, the GO enrichment revealed the category named as collagen fibril organization enriched, containing upregulated collagen fibril forming genes (COL2A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2 COL5A3, COL11A1, and COL11A2), as shown Fig.
