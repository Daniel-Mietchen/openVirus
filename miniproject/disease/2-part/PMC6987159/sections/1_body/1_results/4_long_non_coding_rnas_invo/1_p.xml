<p id="Par16">The DGE analysis also identified 655 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), with 629 upregulated and 26 downregulated in ZIKV-infected TEC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Comprising among others, three upregulated lncRNAs, previously related with antiviral response (LUARIS, EGOT, TNFRSF14-AS1), two associated with regulation of apoptosis (PANDAR, MBNL1-AS1), two associated with both apoptosis and proliferation (UCA1, ZEB2-AS1), four with cell proliferation (MDC1-AS1, HOXB-AS3, TFAP2A-AS1, PICART1), one with cell cycle arrest (BDNF-AS) and one with cell adhesion (SENCR). Those lncRNAs showed log2 Fold Change ranging from 1.05 to 5.40 (Fig.
