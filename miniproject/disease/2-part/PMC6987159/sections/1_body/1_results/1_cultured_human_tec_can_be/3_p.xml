<p id="Par8">We also showed that infection of growing TEC resulted in the generation and release of viral infectious particles in the culture supernatants. Following 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection, the obtained viral titers from TEC cultures were 4.29 ± 0.16, 6.03 ± 0.25, and 6.96 ± 0.11 log10 PFU/mL, as ascertained in Vero cell cultures (Fig.
