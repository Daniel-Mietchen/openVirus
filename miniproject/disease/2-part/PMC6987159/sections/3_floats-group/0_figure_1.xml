  <p>Human TEC can be infected 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> by the Zika virus. (
   <bold>a</bold>) TEC were infected with ZIKV (MOI = 0.1 or 1) and the relative expression of 4G2
   <sup>+</sup> cells was detected 24, 28 and 72 hours post-infection (hpi) by flow cytometry. Each time point represents the mean ± standard error. Asterisks represent statistical significance between MOCK and MOI = 1 (24, 48 and 72 h) and between MOCK and MOI = 0.1 (72 h). Hash marks represent statistical significance between MOI = 0.1 and MOI = 1. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Representative histograms of the relative expression of 4G2
   <sup>+</sup> cells 24 and 72 hpi with MOI = 1. Orange curves represent isotype controls, blue curves represent MOCK and red curves represent ZIKV (n = 3). TEC were infected with ZIKV (MOI = 1) and (
   <bold>c</bold>) the percentage of 4G2
   <sup>+</sup> cells were detected 72 hpi by immunofluorescence. Results are represented by the mean percentage of infection of the three replicates of each independent experiment. Representative images of immunofluorescence for 4G2 (viral protein, in red), cytokeratin (CK, in green) and DAPI (nuclei, in blue) (
   <bold>d</bold>) in lower and (
   <bold>e</bold>) higher magnifications (n = 3, in triplicates). (
   <bold>f</bold>) Representative images of TEC culture 72 hpi (n = 3). (
   <bold>g</bold>) ZIKV growth curve in TEC culture. Supernatant of ZIKV-infected TEC culture was harvested, and the presence of infective viral particles was verified in Vero cells. Results are shown as plaque-forming units and each time point represents the mean ± SD, of at least 5 wells (n ≥ 5). (
   <bold>h</bold>) Relative expression of 4G2 
   <sup>+</sup> cells detected by flow cytometry in TEC culture 72 hpi with 1 mL of supernatant from MOCK or ZIKV-infected TEC cultures (n = 3). (
   <bold>i</bold>) Relative expression of AXL, TIM1, TIM4 e TYRO3 receptors detected by flow cytometry in TEC (n = 3). (
   <bold>j</bold>) Relative expression and (
   <bold>k</bold>) Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of 4G2
   <sup>+</sup> cells detected by flow cytometry 72 hpi (MOI = 1) after treatment with anti-AXL polyclonal antibody (10 µg/mL) (n = 3). *or p &lt; 0.05, **or p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, ****or p &lt; 0.0001, (unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey multiple comparison test).
