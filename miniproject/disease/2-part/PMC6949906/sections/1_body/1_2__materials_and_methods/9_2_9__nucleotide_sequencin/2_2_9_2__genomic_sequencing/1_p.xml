<p>The CHIKV and DENV genomes were recovered by synthesizing the first and second cDNA strands constructed directly from the ssRNA. The synthesis was performed using the cDNA Synthesis System kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and 400 μM of Roche random primer. Subsequently, the products were purified using magnetic beads (Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and three washes with 800 µL of 70% ethanol. The cDNA was eluted in 16 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The cDNA library was prepared and sequenced using the protocol described in the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit on a MiniSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). </p>
