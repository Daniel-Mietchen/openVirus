<p>For DENV detection, a multiplex assay for identification of the four serotypes was used. The reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of mix (2 ×), 2.2 μL of nuclease-free water, 1 μL of primer forward and reverse (F/R) DENV-1 and DENV-3 and 0.5 μL of primer F/R DENV-2 and DENV-4, 0.45 μL of probe of each serotype, 0.5 μL of SuperScript III Platinum Taq enzyme mix, and 5 μL of extracted RNA. For ZIKV and CHIKV detection, singleplex assays were performed and the reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of mix (2 ×), 5.5 μL of nuclease-free water, 1.0 μL of primer F/R, 0.5 μL of probe, 0.5 μL of SuperScript III platinum Taq enzyme mix, and 5 μL of extracted RNA. The thermo cycling conditions consisted of an initial step of RT at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by a step of denaturation for 2 min at 95 °C and by 45 cycles of 15 sec at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. Positive (RNA extracted from DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV infected mouse brains) and negative (nuclease-free water) controls were used to validate the test. Samples were analyzed in duplicates and considered positive with a cycle threshold (CT) average value lower than 37.</p>
