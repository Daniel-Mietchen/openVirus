<p>The IIF test was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] with adaptations, in order to confirm the cell infection and to identify the infecting virus after isolation in cell culture. Inoculated cells were harvested and fixed in acetone on immunofluorescence slides for ten minutes at −20 °C. Subsequently, 10 µL of polyclonal antibodies for the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> antigenic groups, diluted 1:20 in phosphate saline (PBS) pH 7.4, were added to each slide hole. Slides were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, washed in PBS pH 7.4 for ten minutes, and rinsed in distilled water. After drying, 10 μL of anti-mouse conjugate (Cappel) diluted 1:900 was added in each hole, incubated, and washed as described previously. After drying, the slides were assembled with a coverslip in buffered glycerol, observed in a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, UPlanFL N 20X/0.5 objective and WB and U-25nd filters) and photographed at 40 × magnification using a Canon PowerShot G6 camera (Canon, Tokyo, Japan).
