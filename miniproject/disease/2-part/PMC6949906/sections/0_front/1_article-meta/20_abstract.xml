 <p>Dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika are diseases caused by viruses transmitted by 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. In Brazil, the number of human infections is high, but few studies are performed in mosquito vectors. This study aimed to investigate the presence of Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from the municipalities of Alto Alegre, Caxias, Codó, and São Mateus do Maranhão, located in the state of Maranhão, Northeast Brazil. The mosquitoes were collected with a mechanical aspirator, identified, triturated, and then submitted to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. The positive samples were confirmed by virus isolation and genome sequencing. Three hundred and forty-eight 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (176 males and 172 females) and 12 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (eight males and four females) were collected and tested. 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was the only vector positive in two municipalities—Codó, with detection of 
  <italic>Chikungunya virus</italic> (CHIKV) belonging to the East-Central-South African genotype, and in Caxias, with detection of 
  <italic>Dengue virus</italic> (DENV)-2 belonging to the Asian/American genotype. The detection of CHIKV and DENV-2 is evidence that those viruses are maintained in arthropod vectors, and shows the epidemiological risk in the area for chikungunya cases and a possible increase of severe dengue cases, associated with the occurrence of dengue hemorrhagic fever.
