  <p>IFN-stimulated IP-10 gene levels are predictive of peak ZIKV plasma viremia. (A) Association between ZIKV plasma viremia (log
   <sub>10</sub> GE/ml) at day 3 and SIV plasma viremia at day 0 of ZIKV infection (7 RMs in the SIV/ZIKV cohort). VL, viral load. (B) IP-10 (picograms per milliliter) measured by ELISA in longitudinal plasma samples pre- and post-ZIKV infection. Mean IP-10 levels with standard deviation error bars are represented for the ZIKV cohort (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) in blue squares and for the SIV/ZIKV cohort in red circles. 
   <italic>P</italic> values represent repeated-measures one-way ANOVA. AUCs were calculated from day 2 to day 21 post-ZIKV infection, followed by Mann-Whitney comparisons between groups. (C to D) Associations between IP-10 plasma levels (picograms per milliliter) at day 0 of ZIKV infection and ZIKV plasma viremia (log
   <sub>10</sub> GE/ml) at day 3 (C) and day 7 (D) post-ZIKV-infection. SIV/ZIKV RM data points are shown as red circles, and ZIKV RM data points are shown as blue squares. Spearman correlations with linear regression were utilized to determine statistical significance for associations in panels A, C, and D.
