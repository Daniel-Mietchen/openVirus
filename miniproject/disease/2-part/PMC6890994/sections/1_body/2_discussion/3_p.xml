<p>Consistently with previous reports, our data clearly demonstrate that SIV infection leads to a robust production of ISGs (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). While infection with ZIKV was sufficient to induce expression of ISGs, the response generated in acute SIV infection far exceeded that induced by ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The differences in ISG induction may be due to distinct differences between the duration of viremia and magnitude of ZIKV infection, which is typically cleared from plasma within 7 days, and those of HIV/SIV, which is persistent in plasma at a typical set point viral load of 1 million copies per milliliter of plasma. Although we further demonstrate that the level of IP-10/CXCL10 at the time of ZIKV infection predicts subsequent ZIKV replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">D</xref>), the SIV-generated IFN response was insufficient to completely prevent ZIKV replication. Moreover, recent work suggests that particular ISGs may competitively bind to flavivirus receptors (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), which may explain the delayed ZIKV viremia that we observed in SIV
 <sup>+</sup> animals. Paradoxically, this may result from the interferon-responsive genes themselves, in that reduced antigenemia may lead to decreased B cell stimulation and in turn limit the anti-ZIKV antibody responses (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>), as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>. The delayed antibody responses, in turn, may lead to moderately prolonged ZIKV viremia in SIV
 <sup>+</sup> animals. Interestingly, levels of IP-10 have also been shown to differentiate between patients with and without neurological complications after ZIKV infection in Brazil and between infants with and without congenital deformities born to ZIKV-infected mothers, consistent with the idea that IFN signaling is associated with ZIKV pathogenesis (
