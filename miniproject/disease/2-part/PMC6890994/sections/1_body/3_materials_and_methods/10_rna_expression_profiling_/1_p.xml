<p>RNA was isolated from 3 million PBMCs for each animal at day 0 and day 3 post-ZIKV infection using the MagMAX-96 total RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each RNA sample was normalized to 50 ng/μl. Preparation, hybridization, and detection of RNA samples were carried out by following the NanoString manufacturer’s instructions (NanoString Technologies). Subsequent analyses were performed using the nCounter analysis system (NanoString Technologies) and TM4 MeV microarray software suite (

Principal-component analysis was performed with the R package FactoMineR at default settings. Reads from NanoString were normalized to internal positive and negative controls and housekeeping genes. For ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), log
 <sub>2</sub> fold change values (SIV

 <sup>–</sup> day 0) were uploaded to the IPA software (Qiagen) to determine potential upstream regulators.
