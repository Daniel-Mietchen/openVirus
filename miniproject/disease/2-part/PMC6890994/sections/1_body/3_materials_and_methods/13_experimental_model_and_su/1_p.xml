<p>Nineteen healthy RMs (

 <sup>4</sup> PFU (SIV/ZIKV cohort); 12 RMs were infected with the Zika virus isolate Nicaragua/2016 alone (ZIKV cohort) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This ZIKV challenge virus was chosen due to its relatively high viral replication in RMs. The original isolate (UCB 7420) was from patient serum collected at the University of California, Berkley (kindly provided by Eva Harris, GenBank accession number

The cohort sizes were based on previous studies of experimental manipulations of SIV progression in Asian macaques (
