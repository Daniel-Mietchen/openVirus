<p>Stained LN sections were imaged on an inverted SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems), and images were analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane). Three-dimensional (3D) surfaces were constructed according to an absolute intensity threshold for fluorescent channels detecting either CD20 (B cell follicle), DAPI (all tissue), or the RNA-FISH probe (ZIKV/SIV RNA). Summed volumes of constructed 3D surfaces were then calculated. 3D surface volume overlap was determined manually. ZIKV/SIV RNA quantifications were normalized as a function of their total tissue volume (e.g., cubic micrometers of the RNA-FISH probe per cubic micrometer of DAPI).</p>
