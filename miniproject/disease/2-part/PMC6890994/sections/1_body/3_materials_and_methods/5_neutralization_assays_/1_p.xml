<p>For neutralization studies, ZIKV RVPs were mixed with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated macaque plasma for 1 h at 37°C, followed by infection of Raji-DCSIGNR cells in duplicate technical replicates. Infections were carried out at 37°C, and GFP-positive infected cells were quantified by flow cytometry 2 days later. Results were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis to estimate the concentration of plasma required to inhibit 50% of infection (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). For neutralization assays, all plasma samples were initially tested at a starting dilution of 1:60 (based on the final volume of cells, virus, and plasma per well), which was designated the limit of detection.
