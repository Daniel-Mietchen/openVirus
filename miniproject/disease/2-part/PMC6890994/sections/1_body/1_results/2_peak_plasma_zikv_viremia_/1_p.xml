<p>We next measured plasma ZIKV viremia between animals that were and were not SIV infected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Consistently with the results of previous reports, in non-SIV-infected RMs, ZIKV RNA was detectable in plasma by 2 days postinfection (dpi), peaked to approximately 500,000 copies/ml at 2 to 3 dpi, and then declined to undetectable levels by 7 dpi (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material). Peak ZIKV RNA in SIV-infected animals occurred at approximately 4 days postinfection and was 30% of that in non-SIV-infected animals. Furthermore, the SIV-infected RMs had significantly lower ZIKV plasma RNA at both day 2 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>) (
 <italic> P</italic> = 0.0023) post-ZIKV infection. Likely as a consequence of this delayed peak, ZIKV RNA levels were higher in SIV
 <sup>+</sup> animals than in SIV-negative animals at day 7 after ZIKV infection, a time when ZIKV had been cleared from most non-SIV-infected RMs (
