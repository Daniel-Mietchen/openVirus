<p>Using flow cytometric analysis, we next measured innate and adaptive immunological responses during ZIKV infection of the animals in our cohort (the flow cytometric gating strategy is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). We found that RMs mounted robust proliferative responses to SIV and ZIKV infections in several cellular populations as measured by Ki67 expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). The SIV-infected animals mounted NK cell proliferative responses to both SIV infection and ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, the NK cell proliferative response during ZIKV replication among the SIV
 <sup>+</sup> animals was restricted compared to that of the non-SIV-infected animals, showing a delayed, dampened, and shorter duration of proliferation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) (area under the curve [AUC], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05). We also measured the proliferation of memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>), and memory B cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>) in our longitudinal peripheral blood samples. These proliferative responses tended to peak around day 11 post-ZIKV infection, with a significant response for both cohorts in the Ki67
 <sup>+</sup> memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0368 in the ZIKV cohort and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0009 in the SIV/ZIKV cohort). We did not observe any proliferative response to ZIKV among B cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). SIV infection was also associated with robust proliferative responses from NK cells, T cells, and B cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Proliferative responses of T and B cells to ZIKV infection among SIV
 <sup>+</sup> animals were, thus, less clear given their already-heightened proliferation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref>).
