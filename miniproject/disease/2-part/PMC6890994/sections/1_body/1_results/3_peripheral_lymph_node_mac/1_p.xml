<p>To understand ZIKV tropism in our coinfection model, we used flow cytometry to sort T cells, B cells, and macrophages from LNs of animals from our cohort at day 5 and day 27 post-ZIKV infection (our flow cytometric sorting strategy is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>) and measured ZIKV RNA by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). We found ZIKV RNA in lymph node-resident macrophages and, to a lesser extent, in B cells, with higher levels of ZIKV RNA in macrophages isolated from non-SIV-infected animals at day 5 post-ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>) than in SIV-infected animals (
 <italic> P</italic> = 0.021). Interestingly, we also found ZIKV RNA in macrophages isolated from LNs of animals at day 27 post-ZIKV infection, a time point when plasma ZIKV RNA was undetectable in plasma (
