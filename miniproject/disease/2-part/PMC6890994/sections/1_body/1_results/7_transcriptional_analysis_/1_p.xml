<p>Since we observed associations between increased IP-10 levels and lower peak ZIKV viremia at day 3 post-Zika infection in our coinfected RMs, we next sought to explore global transcriptional responses that coincide with SIV and ZIKV infection. Gene expression was measured from mRNAs extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by NanoString nCounter analysis. We studied samples corresponding to pre-ZIKV infection (day 0) and day 3 post-ZIKV infection, with and without SIV coinfection. Principal-component analysis revealed that transcript profiles of PBMCs from the ZIKV RMs were distinct from those of the SIV/ZIKV RMs (

While ZIKV coinfection did not dramatically alter the transcriptional profile of PBMCs from SIV-infected animals, ZIKV did alter the transcriptional profile of circulating leukocytes (

Indeed, when we compared non-SIV-infected and SIV-infected RMs prior to ZIKV infection (ZIKV day 0), 163 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the two cohorts (
