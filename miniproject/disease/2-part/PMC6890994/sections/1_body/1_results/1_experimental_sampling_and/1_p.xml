<p>To determine how SIV infection might influence viremia and the host response to ZIKV infection, we infected 7 Asian RMs with 3,000 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of SIV
 <sub>mac239</sub> intravenously (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Three weeks thereafter, we subcutaneously infected these animals with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of ZIKV isolate Nicaragua/2016 (SIV/ZIKV animals) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For a control, we also infected 12 rhesus macaques (RMs) with ZIKV only (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The time point 3 weeks post-SIV infection was chosen to correspond to the peak inflammation and expression of ISGs during acute SIV infection in rhesus macaques but prior to the animals becoming dramatically immunocompromised (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We sampled peripheral blood and lymph nodes at numerous time points both pre- and post-SIV and/or ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>) to study viremia and innate and adaptive immune responses. To measure SIV progression, we measured SIV RNA levels in plasma (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) as well as counted peripheral blood CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (the number of cells per microliter of blood) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We found that the SIV/ZIKV cohort had a significant loss of memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells prior to ZIKV challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0156), consistent with these animals being progressively SIV infected, but ZIKV infection did not exacerbate the loss of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood of either the SIV-infected or the uninfected group of animals (
