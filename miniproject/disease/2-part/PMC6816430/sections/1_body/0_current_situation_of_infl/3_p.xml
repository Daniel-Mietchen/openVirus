<p>At the time of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009, the first imported case of pandemic H1N1 in Thailand was in early May 2009. By the second week of June 2009, there were two influenza outbreak notifications in the central region of Thailand, and then only a few weeks later the influenza virus spread throughout the country.

 </sup> At that time, there was no commitment to supplying inactivated influenza vaccines to Thailand during potential pandemics and there was no domestic production of bulk influenza vaccines. In fact, prior to 2007, there was no experience in egg-based vaccine production. By 2010, Thailand was importing 2.1 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine: GPO-MBP, a joint venture between the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) and Sanofi Pasteur, supplied approximately 800,000 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine by formulating and filling imported bulk, and the remaining 1.3 million doses were imported as finished products.
