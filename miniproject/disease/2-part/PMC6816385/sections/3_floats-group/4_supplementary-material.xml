  <title>Raw output of MCMC sampling analysis for the HCV dataset under the mPTP model</title>
  <p>Raw output of MCMC sampling analysis for the HCV dataset under the mPTP model showing the support of all nodes being speciation nodes. The color of the branches of the tree range from black to red in proportion to the MCMC support for each branch being part of the speciation processes (i.e., black branches were always sampled as speciation branches and red branches were always sampled as coalescent branches).</p>
