<p>To assess whether mPTP can be deployed as a quantitative ICTV method we analyze two medically important viruses, Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV), that are leading global causes of human mortality (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Stanaway et al., 2016</xref>). Both viruses cause liver inflammation, but are substantially different from each other. HBV has a partially double-stranded circular DNA genome with a length of about 3.2 kb while HCV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, with a genome length of approximately 10 kb (

 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Martell et al., 1992</xref>). Both virus types comprise at least two taxonomic levels (HBV: genotypes, subgenotypes; HCV: genotypes, subtypes). Besides the significance of the two viruses for human health, we selected them as test cases since due to the substantial amount of taxonomic research that has been conducted and that we can hence use to assess the efficiency of genetic clustering (e.g.,Â
