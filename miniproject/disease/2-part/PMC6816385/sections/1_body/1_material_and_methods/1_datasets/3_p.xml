<p>The HCV dataset (I) comprises 213 sequences corresponding to seven major taxonomic units named after genotypes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and numerous subtypes (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). The HCV classification into genotypes and subtypes was based on genetic-distance thresholds that were verified by the fact that they formed monophyletic clades in an inferred phylogeny (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the HCV classification serves as an appropriate test case for assessing whether a similar clustering can be identified with a more objective and automated method, such as mPTP, that does not require any user input apart from a phylogeny.
