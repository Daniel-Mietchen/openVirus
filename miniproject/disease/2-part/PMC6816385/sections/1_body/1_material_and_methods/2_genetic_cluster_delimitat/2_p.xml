<p>For the mPTP delimitation, a fully binary (bifurcating) rooted phylogeny is required. Therefore, using the aligned sequences we inferred the phylogenetic relationships under the GTR+Γ model of nucleotide substitution using RAxML-NG (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Kozlov et al., 2018</xref>). We rooted the phylogenetic trees according to the originally published phylogenies (i.e., using the branch leading to genotypes F/H for HBV and genotype 7 for HCV). Using heuristic search algorithms for finding the ‘best’ delimitation given the rooted phylogeny and without any further prior assumptions. We performed the mPTP delimitation under Maximum Likelihood (ML) and calculated the support of the delimited clusters using Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Kapli et al., 2017</xref>). We conducted the MCMC sampling twice for 10
 <sup>6</sup> generations, to identify potential lack of convergence with a sampling frequency of 0.1.
