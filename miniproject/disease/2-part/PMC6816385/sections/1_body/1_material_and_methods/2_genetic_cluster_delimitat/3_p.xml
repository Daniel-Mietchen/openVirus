<p>For ABGD, the user has to define two important parameters, (i) the prior maximum divergence of intraspecific diversity (
 <italic>P</italic>), which implies that the barcode gap is expected to exceed this value and should not be confused with the genetic thresholds assumed to define the inter-specific relationships, (ii) a proxy for the minimum gap width (
 <italic>X</italic>), which indicates that the barcoding gap is expected to be 
 <italic>X</italic> times larger than any intraspecific gap (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Puillandre et al., 2012</xref>). For both, HBV, and HCV, we used 10 prior maximum thresholds in the range of 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05. The proxy for the minimum gap width (
 <italic>X</italic>) was set to the default value (
 <italic>X</italic> = 1.5) for HCV, while for HBV the default value did not yield any delimitation and we therefore set it to a lower value (
 <italic>X</italic> = 0.5).
