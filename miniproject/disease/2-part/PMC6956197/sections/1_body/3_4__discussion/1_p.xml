<p>This study reported that the TR44839 virus is widespread in most study sites, particularly in those sites with 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic> displaying low to moderate intercolonial aggression (i.e., Okinawa and Taiwan), but much less prevalent in sites with ants showing a high level of intercolonial aggression (i.e., Penang). A plausible explanation for the widespread nature of the TR44839 virus is that intensive interactions between colonies may have facilitated the spread of pathogens. The observed pattern in this study is analogous with the pathogen transmission dynamics at the intracolonial level, where higher frequencies of nestmate interactions can readily promote the spread of pathogens within the colony, implying that colony boundaries and levels of intercolonial interactions may contribute to facilitating/preventing viral transmission in
