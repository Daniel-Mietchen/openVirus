 <italic>Lytic cycles</italic> are lethal to host cells and culminate in the production of new phages. Well-known examples of viruses with lytic cycles are the T7 and Mu phages that mainly infect 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. These phages initially hijack the bacterial cell machinery to produce virions. Thereafter, the bacterial cell is lysed, releasing 100â€“200 virions into the surrounding environment where they can infect new bacterial cells. They can thus play an important role in regulating the abundance of their host bacteria.
