<p id="Par39">To understand the mechanisms behind the phageâ€“host interaction in the context of the gut ecosystem, it might also be useful to use viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). The analysis of AMGs and their abundance in marine samples facilitated the identification of the role of bacteriophages in nitrogen and sulfur cycling by affecting the host metabolism [

Furthermore, the study of viral communities in the polar region of the Southern Ocean highlighted the value of AMG analysis in understanding how lytic and temperate phages survive during seasonal changes in their bacterial host abundance, which follows the availability of nutrient resources [

Another approach applied by Zeigler Allen et al. in the study of the marine microbiome community suggests using bacteriophage sequence signatures, together with measures of the virus/bacteria ratio and bacterial diversity, to evaluate the influence of viruses on the bacterial community instead of direct comparison of co-abundance profiles [
