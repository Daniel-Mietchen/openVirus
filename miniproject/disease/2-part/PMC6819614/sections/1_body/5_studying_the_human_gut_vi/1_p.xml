<p id="Par21">The extensive study of the bacteriome that has been taking place over the past few years may partly be due to the presence of universal phylogenetic markers such as the 16S rRNA gene. In contrast to bacteria, viruses lack such a universal marker. Studying the virome therefore requires large-scale metagenomic sequencing (MGS) approaches (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, there are numerous challenges to be overcome in the process of viral MGS data generation and analysis. Below we outline and discuss the common challenges in widely used methods of studying the virome, as well as their possible solutions. A summary of the challenges of virome studies and the approaches to tackle them are outlined in Table
