<p id="Par33">Regardless of the method chosen for virome annotation, more challenges come at the step of taxonomy assignment to viral sequences. Currently, only 5560 viral species have been described and deposited with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Despite the rapid growth of the ICTV database after it allowed the deposition of de novo assembled viral sequences that were not cultured or imaged [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>] and the application of gene-sharing networks to viral sequences for taxonomy assignment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>], levels above genus are still unavailable for many known viruses. Nonetheless, there are reasons to be optimistic. The ICTV committee recently decided to expand the taxonomical classification of viruses to levels above rank and order [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>], and the first-ever viral phylum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>] has already been reported. More higher-order ranks can be expected given the rise of pace and uniformity of novel viral genomes deposited [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>].
