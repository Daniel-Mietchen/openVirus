<p id="Par26">In addition to the exclusion of RNA viruses during the isolation of genetic material in some common extraction protocols, ssDNA viruses might also be overlooked. Sequencing of ssDNA virus genomes is difficult because of the limited number of genomic library preparation kits that allow in situ representation of ssDNA viruses without amplification bias (TableÂ

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Thus, the current conception that the gut virome is predominantly composed of dsDNA viruses might be biased by the relative ease of processing dsDNA.
