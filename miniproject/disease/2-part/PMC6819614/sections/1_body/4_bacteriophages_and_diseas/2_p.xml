<p id="Par16">It is important to keep in mind that, although many diseases show associations with various bacteriophages, it is extremely hard to establish causality. Furthermore, in these association studies it is difficult to establish whether alterations in the microbiome and virome are a cause or a consequence of the disease. Koch’s postulates are a set of criteria designed to establish a causative relationship between a microbe and a disease. In 2012, Mokili et al. proposed a metagenomic version of Koch’s postulates [

In order to fulfill these metagenomic Koch’s postulates, the following conditions must be met: i) the metagenomic traits in diseased subjects must be significantly different from those in healthy subjects; ii) the inoculation of samples from a diseased animal into a healthy control must lead to the induction of the disease state; and iii) the inoculation of the suspected purified traits into a healthy animal will induce disease if the traits form the etiology of the disease [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, only a few of these studies are supported by animal experiments, and most of these experiments are in the form of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) rather than delivery of specific inoculated phages [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Furthermore, the question of causality becomes even more complex when, as is often the case, multiple phages are likely to be involved in the etiology of a disease (Table
