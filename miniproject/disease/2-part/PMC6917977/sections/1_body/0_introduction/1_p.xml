<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a positive‐sense RNA virus belonging to the alphavirus family, which can be transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The viral RNA is encapsulated in a central capsid core, which, in turn, is surrounded by the viral envelope studded with viral envelope proteins 1 and 2 (E1 and E2) (Voss

Continued outbreaks of CHIKV and the risk of it spreading into new areas call for the urgent development of therapeutics to treat this debilitating virus.
