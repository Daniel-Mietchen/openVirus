<p>One of the advantages of using plants for the production of glycoproteins is that they are highly amenable to glycoengineering, which allows the generation of proteins with tailor‐made N‐glycans (Montero‐Morales and Steinkellner, 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). This is particularly relevant to mAbs since it is well known that the glycosylation profile on the single N‐glycosylation site in the Fc domain of IgG antibodies significantly impacts mAb activities (Jefferis, 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). For example, the targeted removal of core fucose residues from complex N‐glycans in mammalian and plant‐produced IgGs significantly increases Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) III binding and subsequent effector functions. This has been demonstrated impressively for anti‐cancer antibodies, where the first generation of glycan‐engineered antibody therapeutics is ready to emerge on the market (Garber,

 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). However, related studies for antibodies against infectious diseases are rare (Forthal 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), with only a few 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrating increased antiviral activity of glycan‐engineered mAbs in murine challenging models (Hiatt 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Zeitlin 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the impact of glycosylation to antiviral antibody‐induced effector functions is still under debate, as non‐human primate studies of anti‐HIV antibodies did not show glycan‐dependent efficacy (Moldt 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).
