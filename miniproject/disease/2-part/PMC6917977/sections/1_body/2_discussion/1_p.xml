<p>The expanding epidemics of CHIKV demand the development of efficacious therapeutics against this debilitating virus. A screening of 230 mouse anti‐CHIKV mAbs indicate that some of the antibodies against CHIKV E1 and E2 have protective activity and their protectivity is mostly correlated to the neutralizing potency (Pal
