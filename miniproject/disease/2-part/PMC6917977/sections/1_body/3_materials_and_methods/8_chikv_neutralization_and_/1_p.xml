<p>Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was performed as previously described (Yang

 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Specifically, mAbs were serially diluted in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), while CHIKV was diluted in serum‐free DMEM to a working concentration of 100 plaque‐forming units (PFUs) per well. Following dilutions, mAbs were added to CHIKV and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. CHIKV‐mAb mixes were then added to a 90%–95% confluence Vero cells in a 6‐well tissue culture plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C for virus attachment. After removing unattached virus‐mAbs in the medium, cells were overlaid with fresh media (complete DMEM containing 1% sea plaque agarose, Lonza) and incubated for an additional 3 days at 37 °C. Plaques were visualized by staining with neutral red (Sigma) and counted. Percent (%) neutralization was calculated as: [(number of CHIKV plaque per well with no mAb) − (number of CHIKV plaque per well of diluted mAb)/(number of CHIKV plaque per well with no mAb) × 100]. Experiments were repeated twice. The half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of each mAb was calculated using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0).
