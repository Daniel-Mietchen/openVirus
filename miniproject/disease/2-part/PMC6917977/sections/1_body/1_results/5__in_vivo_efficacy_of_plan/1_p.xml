<p>Among mouse models of CHIKV infection, WT mice (i.e. WT C57BL/6) develop arthritis symptoms similar to those observed in humans (Broeckel 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Thus, we used the WT C57BL/6 mouse model to assess the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic efficacy of plant‐produced CHKVmabs (Acharya 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Five‐week‐old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated in the right footpad with 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of CHIKV and then treated at 12 h post‐infection with 50 μg of WTpCHKVmab, ∆XFpCHKVmab or PBS intraperitoneally. Since viraemia generally peaks at 2 dpi and subsides to undetectable levels at 4 dpi in this mouse model, blood was collected at 2 dpi and viraemia measured by RT‐qPCR. Mice treated with both WTpCHKVmab and ∆XFpCHKVmab developed significantly lower viraemia compared to PBS‐treated mice (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for WTpCHKVmab; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 for ∆XFpCHKVmab) (Figure 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, ∆XFpCHKVmab appeared to be more potent than WTpCHKVmab in reducing viral load in mice (Figure 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Statistical analysis indicated that albeit not dramatic, the difference in efficacy between the two mAb glycovariants was nonetheless significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, ∆XFpCHKVmab compared to WTpCHKVmab). Collectively, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of plant‐derived CHKVmabs in WT mice suggests their potential as prophylaxis and post‐exposure therapeutics for CHIKV.
