<p>One of the challenges for mAb therapeutics against viral infections is the increased risk of infection by other viruses in treated patients via the mechanism of antibody‐dependent enhancement of infection (ADE). For example, cross‐reactive but sub‐neutralizing antibodies against one serotype of DENV from a previous infection can form complexes with another serotype of DENV during a secondary infection to promote viral infection of FcγR‐bearing myeloid cells, predisposing patients to develop the more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome through ADE (Sun

 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), we examined whether CHKVmab would enhance the infection of DENV. As previously demonstrated (Lai 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="pbi13194-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), 4G2, an mAb that cross‐reacts with E of most flaviviruses, efficiently caused ADE of DENV infection in K562 cells that express the human FcγR (Figure

 <xref rid="pbi13194-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These results indicate that plant‐produced CHKVmabs are not only efficacious but also safe as potential treatment against CHIKV infection.
