Here, we identify free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) as a cofactor for IAV entry into host cells. We found that downregulation of FFAR2 or Ffar2 expression significantly reduced the replication of IAV in A549 or RAW 264.7 cells. The treatment of A549 cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting <italic>FFAR2</italic> or the FFAR2 pathway agonists 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-(thiazol-2-yl)butanamide (4-CMTB) and compound 58 (Cmp58) [(<italic>S</italic>)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,3-dimethyl-<italic>N</italic>-(5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)butanamide] dramatically inhibited the nuclear accumulation of viral nucleoprotein (NP) at early time points postinfection, indicating that FFAR2 functions in the early stage of the IAV replication cycle. FFAR2 downregulation had no effect on the expression of sialic acid (SA) receptors on the cell membrane, the attachment of IAV to the SA receptors, or the activity of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. Rather, the amount of internalized IAVs was significantly reduced in FFAR2-knocked-down or 4-CMTB- or Cmp58-treated A549 cells. Further studies showed that FFAR2 associated with &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and that &#x003b2;-arrestin1 interacted with the &#x003b2;2-subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP2B1), the essential adaptor of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Notably, siRNA knockdown of either &#x003b2;-arrestin1 or AP2B1 dramatically impaired IAV replication, and AP2B1 knockdown or treatment with Barbadin, an inhibitor targeting the &#x003b2;-arrestin1/AP2B1 complex, remarkably decreased the amount of internalized IAVs. Moreover, we found that FFAR2 interacted with three G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (i.e., GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6) whose downregulation inhibited IAV replication. Together, our findings demonstrate that the FFAR2 signaling cascade is important for the efficient endocytosis of IAV into host cells.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> To complete its replication cycle, IAV hijacks the host endocytosis machinery to invade cells.

Aside from frequent seasonal epidemics caused by H1 or H3 IAVs and occasional pandemics, avian influenza viruses, such as those of the H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes, are currently posing increasing threats to humans (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The genome of IAV consists of eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments that encode 10 essential proteins: polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic protein (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein 1 (M1), matrix protein 2 (M2), nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), and NS2. Of these viral proteins, HA is responsible for mediating the binding of virus particles to sialic acid (SA) receptors on cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), which is the initial step for IAV entry into host cells.</p><p>After binding to SA receptors, IAV is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Rust et al. previously demonstrated that most IAV particles enter cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Besides, IAV is also internalized through caveola-mediated endocytosis, clathrin- and caveola-independent endocytosis, and macropinocytosis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Many cellular factors have been implicated in IAV entry because HA binding to SA receptors alone is insufficient for successful viral endocytosis into host cells. For example, EPN1 is recruited to the binding sites of IAV, where it initiates the formation of clathrin-coated pits, ultimately resulting in the internalization of the virus (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Loss of terminal N-linked glycosylation due to a mutation in the <italic>GNT1</italic> gene arrests IAV internalization at the plasma membrane before the virus is endocytosed (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Plasma membrane lipid raft clustering, caused by IAV attachment, activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), leading to the activation of downstream signaling molecules, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C &#x003b3;1 (PLC-&#x003b3;1) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which enhances IAV uptake. CD81 promotes the trafficking of IAV to fusion-competent endosomes and further organizes the endosomal membrane to assist viral fusion (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Upon IAV infection, Itch is phosphorylated and recruited to endosomes, where it ubiquitinates the viral M1 protein and mediates the release of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes from the endosomal compartments (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Although these cellular factors have been implicated in IAV endocytosis, the biological details underlying the IAV entry process remain poorly understood, and the roles of other host factors have yet to be revealed.</p><p>G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), a seven-&#x003b1;-helix transmembrane segment receptor, represents the largest superfamily of cell surface receptors and regulates a large array of biological functions (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Roles for GPCR family members in the replication of different viruses have been increasingly demonstrated. Notably, CCR5 and CXCR4 are required for HIV-1 infectivity, acting as coreceptors of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) is a novel cellular receptor for rabies virus (RABV) through interaction with RABV G protein (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). GPCR antagonists targeting histamine receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (serotonin) receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and adrenergic receptor block the entry of Ebola virus and Marburg virus at a step that follows initial attachment but prior to viral/cell membrane fusion (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). GPCR proteins are also involved in the replication and pathogenesis of IAV. It has been reported that stimulation of &#x003b1;2-adrenergic receptors by clonidine inhibits IAV replication (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and treatment of mice with the angiotensin II inhibitor losartan alleviates lung edema and improves lung histopathology, although the viral load in the lung tissue of mice is not reduced (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) (also known as GPR43), together with FFAR1 and FFAR3, is classified as a rhodopsin-like receptor and clusters at chromosome 19q13.1 in humans (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). <italic>FFAR2</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), dendritic cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and regulatory T cells (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). FFAR2 can be activated by short-chain fatty acids such as acetate and propionate (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and this activation is coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation, inhibition of cAMP accumulation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and modulation of the p38, Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and Akt signaling pathways (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). FFAR2 has also been linked to the severity of inflammation, although different studies have reached contentious conclusions (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, a role for FFAR2 in virus infection has never been demonstrated.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate that FFAR2 is a novel host factor for the efficient replication of IAV and discover that FFAR2 plays an important role in the entry step of the virus life cycle. We further found that FFAR2-mediated IAV internalization involves downstream signaling molecules such as G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), &#x003b2;-arrestin1, and the AP-2 complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>FFAR2 is important for infection by different subtypes of IAV.</title><p>We identified FFAR2 as a potential host factor for the replication of IAV by using a whole-genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library screen (our unpublished data) targeting 21,585 mRNAs and a replication-competent Venus-expressing H5N1 virus (H5N1 NA-Venus) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).

We also generated an <italic>FFAR2</italic> knockout (<italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO) A549 cell line by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. By simultaneous electrotransfection of four pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (pX458) constructs containing single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting <italic>FFAR2</italic> to A549 cells, a mixture of knockout cells was successfully generated. Sequencing analysis revealed a 271- or 578-bp deletion compared with the <italic>FFAR2</italic> mRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Both deletions led to a frameshift in the <italic>FFAR2</italic> alleles that resulted in the loss of FFAR2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). <italic>FFAR2</italic> knockout had no major effect on cell viability as measured by a luminescent cell viability assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). The titers of AH05 (H5N1) virus produced from <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells were dramatically lower than those of the control cells at 24 or 48&#x02009;h p.i.

Moreover, we employed a retroviral packaging system to complement the expression of FFAR2 protein in <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>, the amount of viral NP protein inside the <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA-treated A549 cells was dramatically decreased compared with that in the control siRNA-treated cells, demonstrating that most of the IAV particles were not internalized into the infected cells when the expression of FFAR2 was downregulated. These data clearly show that FFAR2 is important for the internalization of IAV into cells.</p><p>We then investigated whether treatment with 4-CMTB or Cmp58 also has an effect on the internalization of IAV. A549 cells were pretreated with 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M 4-CMTB, 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Cmp58, or DMSO for 3&#x02009;h prior to infection with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) at 37&#x000b0;C. At 15, 30, 45, or 60&#x02009;min p.i., cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS-HCl (pH 1.3) to remove the uninternalized virions, and the cell lysates were then Western blotted. In DMSO-treated cells, the amount of internalized NP protein gradually increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>). In contrast, only a small amount of viral NP was internalized in 4-CMTB- or Cmp58-treated A549 cells throughout the detection period from 15 to 60&#x02009;min p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>). These results indicate that the effect of 4-CMTB and Cmp58 on FFAR2 inhibits the internalization process of IAV.</p><p>To explore the molecular mechanisms by which FFAR2 regulates IAV internalization, we attempted to detect an interaction between FFAR2 and the 10 essential IAV proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2). To this end, we performed a Venus-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in which FFAR2 was fused in frame with N-terminal residues 1 to 173 of the Venus protein (FFAR2-VN) and the AH05 (H5N1) viral proteins were fused with C-terminal residues 174 to 239 of the Venus protein (VC). The Venus fluorescence signal was detected only in HeLa cells cotransfected with FFAR2-VN/AH05 HA-VC or FFAR2-VN/AH05 M2-VC under conditions where the FFAR2-VN- and -VC-fused AH05 proteins were well expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">B</xref>), indicating that FFAR2 interacted with only the AH05 (H5N1) HA and M2 proteins. We also performed a coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiment in HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids for the expression of glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) or GST-FFAR2, together with HA1, HA2, or M2 of AH05 (H5N1) virus. HA1 and M2 specifically interacted with FFAR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">E</xref>), whereas no interaction was observed between HA2 and FFAR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Given that our results prove that FFAR2 is involved in the process of AH05 (H5N1) virus internalization, the interaction between FFAR2 and HA1, the globular head domain of HA, most likely facilitates the internalization of IAV into cells. We then attempted to define the region of FFAR2 that was important for its binding with HA1. We generated two truncated FFAR2 constructs, FFAR2(1&#x02013;219) and FFAR2(1&#x02013;126), which were fused to the C terminus of GST and then examined for their interaction with HA1 in HEK293T cells. The domain mapping experiment indicated that the region spanning residues 1 to 219 of FFAR2 was important for the interaction of FFAR2 with AH05 (H5N1) HA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 7</label><caption><p>FFAR2 interacts with HA and M2 of IAV.

This binding triggers subsequent viral entry steps. For IAV, the principal route of entry into host cells is the CME pathway. A number of studies have demonstrated that IAV internalization requires the engagement of various cellular factors, for example, the EPN1 adaptor protein (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and the involvement of different signaling pathways, such as the recruitment of receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and the subsequent activation of PI3K (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), PLC-&#x003b3;1 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), or protein kinase C (PKC) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). However, the role of these factors was mostly demonstrated in a limited number of IAV subtypes, such as H1N1 or H3N2. Moreover, it has been reported that distinct signaling pathways are specifically activated by different IAV subtypes to facilitate virus internalization (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). These facts prompted us to investigate potential cofactors involved in the entry of H5N1 virus into host cells.</p><p>In the present study, we identified the host cellular protein FFAR2, a seven-transmembrane GPCR receptor, as an important cofactor for the replication of IAV, especially the H5N1 subtype, by using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen. Knockdown of FFAR2 by using siRNA treatment can universally restrict the replication of different subtypes of IAV, and the inhibitory effect of <italic>FFAR2</italic> knockout on IAV replication can be rescued by retrovirally mediated FFAR2 complementation in <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells. We found that the effect of siRNA knockdown of FFAR2 expression on IAV replication does not involve the stimulation of the IFN pathway because the level of Mx1 protein was unchanged and ISRE reporter activity was unstimulated. Furthermore, treatment of A549 cells with <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or the FFAR2 agonists 4-CMTB and Cmp58 significantly inhibited both the nuclear accumulation and cytoplasm localization of vRNP complexes at early time points after IAV infection but had no effect on viral genome transcription or replication. These results demonstrate that FFAR2 is involved in an early stage of the viral replication cycle prior to the transcription and replication of the viral genome. In an effort to define the specific stage of IAV replication that involves FFAR2, we first showed that FFAR2 knockdown in A549 cells had no effect on the cell surface expression of SA receptors and that the attachment of IAV particles to the SA receptors was also not affected. However, the attached viruses on the surface of cells treated with <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA, 4-CMTB, or Cmp58 were easily removed by washes with PBS-HCl (pH 1.3), resulting in a significant reduction in the levels of viral NP internalized in the infected cells. Of note, the treatment of A549 cells with 4-CMTB or Cmp58 inhibited the replication of H5N1 virus in A549 cells. Mechanistically, sustained stimulation with agonists could cause internalization of FFAR2, resulting in a decrease in the amount of FFAR2 on the cell surface. In this case, insufficient FFAR2 on the cell membrane would be unable to efficiently facilitate the internalization of IAV through the endocytosis pathway. By using the BiFC assay and the co-IP experiment, we demonstrate that FFAR2 interacted with viral HA and M2 among the 10 essential proteins of IAV. We speculate that the interaction between FFAR2 and HA most likely stimulates the FFAR2 signaling cascade, promoting IAV internalization after HA attachment to the SA receptors on the cell surface. Compared with HA, the amount of M2 on viral particles is small. Moreover, M2 mainly functions at the uncoating stage during IAV entry; i.e., it serves as an ion channel to acidify the interior of the virus particle, resulting in vRNP complex detachment from M1 and release into the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that FFAR2 is important in the internalization step during IAV entry. However, whether FFAR2 is also involved in the uncoating step by interacting with M2 requires further investigation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that FFAR2 is an important cofactor for IAV entry into host cells.</p><p>The mechanism of FFAR2 function during IAV uptake was unraveled by dissecting the roles of associated adaptors in the signaling cascade. Typically, mammalian GPCR endocytosis upon activation is dependent primarily on the regulation of arrestins through a CME pathway (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). GRKs are involved in this process and specifically phosphorylate activated GPCRs (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In our study, we found that GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6 knockdown in A549 cells inhibited IAV replication. However, it remains unknown whether these kinases simultaneously or sequentially regulate the phosphorylation of FFAR2. In addition, Western blotting showed that only GRK6 in A549 cells was abundantly expressed, and the endogenous expression levels of GRK2 and GRK5 were relatively low. Taking into account that GRK6 knockdown produced the most significant inhibitory effect on IAV replication in A549 cells, we speculated that GRK6 may play a more important role in the C-terminal phosphorylation of FFAR2 during IAV infection than GRK2 and GRK5.</p><p>The arrestins are a family of four proteins: arrestins 1 and 4 are primarily expressed in the eye and are associated with visual transduction, whereas the nonvisual arrestins 2 and 3 (also known as &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2) are more widely expressed (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The ubiquitously expressed &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 are best known for functioning in the regulation of phosphorylated GPCR desensitization and internalization (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). To date, &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 have been reported to be involved in the internalization process of many viruses, such as HIV (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and JC polyomavirus (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The GPCR family proteins have different binding affinities for &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Lee et al. used a bimolecular luminescence complementation assay and coimmunoprecipitation to demonstrate that FFAR2 can interact with &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). In our study, the introduction of &#x003b2;-<italic>arrestin1</italic> siRNA into A549 cells attenuated H5N1 virus replication, whereas treatment with &#x003b2;-<italic>arrestin2</italic> siRNA had no observable effect. It may be that &#x003b2;-arrestin1 interacts with FFAR2 with a higher affinity than &#x003b2;-arrestin2 during H5N1 virus infection.</p><p>The AP-2 adaptor complex is a heterotetramer consisting of &#x003b1; (AP2A1), &#x003b2;2 (AP2B1), &#x003bc;2 (AP2M1), and &#x003c3;2 (AP2S1) adaptin subunits (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). It plays multiple roles in CME, such as promoting the assembly of clathrin-coated pits and coordinating interactions between clathrin and other CME proteins (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). To date, the AP-2 complex has been reported to be involved in the endocytosis processes of different viruses, including HIV (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), murine cytomegalovirus (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), and white spot syndrome virus (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). As for IAV, a previous study by Chen and Zhuang reported that siRNA knockdown of the AP2M1 subunit of the AP-2 complex did not inhibit the clathrin-mediated uptake of IAV (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Here, we also found that AP2M1 knockdown had no effect on the replication of H5N1 virus. Interestingly, among the four subunits of the AP-2 complex, only AP2B1 knockdown significantly inhibited the replication of H5N1 virus. Although AP2B1 did not interact with FFAR2, according to our BiFC assay, it clearly interacted with &#x003b2;-arrestin1, which is consistent with a previous report that &#x003b2;-arrestins target the GPCRs to clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis via their direct interaction with the AP2B1 subunit of the AP-2 complex (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Moreover, Barbadin, by selectively targeting the interaction between &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and AP2B1, also inhibited the internalization of IAV. Together, these results suggest that the AP2B1 subunit of the AP-2 complex acts synergistically with clathrin and &#x003b2;-arrestin1 in the FFAR2-mediated endocytosis of IAV.</p><p>In summary, here, we demonstrate that the G protein-coupled receptor FFAR2 is required for the efficient replication of IAV. FFAR2 plays a key role in the step of IAV entry into host cells. We further reveal that the C-terminal phosphorylation of FFAR2 by GRK2, GRK5, or GRK6 is important for FFAR2 to support virus replication. Moreover, we found that the FFAR2&#x02013;&#x003b2;-arrestin1&#x02013;AP2B1 signaling cascade is necessary for the efficient endocytosis of IAV into host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). Together, our data suggest that FFAR2 is a crucial host factor for influenza virus entry into host cells.</p><fig id="F10" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 10</label><caption><p>Model of the role of FFAR2 in IAV entry into host cells. Upon initial binding with sialic acid on the cell surface, IAV binds to the FFAR2 protein, the C terminus of which is phosphorylated by the GRKs (i.e., GRK2, GRK5, or GRK6). &#x003b2;-Arrestin1 then translocates to the plasma membrane and interacts with FFAR2, followed by further interaction with AP2B1. Ultimately, the FFAR2&#x02013;&#x003b2;-arrestin1&#x02013;AP2B1 complex aids in the internalization of IAV via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JVI.01707-19-f0010"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cells and viruses.</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T), human lung carcinoma cells (A549), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and murine macrophage cells (RAW 264.7) were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), F-12K medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, DMEM supplemented with 6% newborn calf serum (NCS; Sigma-Aldrich), and RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% FBS, respectively.
