<p>A luciferase assay to determine viral RNP activity was performed as described previously (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or scrambled siRNA (30 nM) for 24 h, followed by cotransfection with four viral RNP complex expression plasmids from WSN virus (pCAGGS-PB2, pCAGGS-PB1, pCAGGS-PA, and pCAGGS-NP [0.5 μg of each]), the construct pHH21-SC09NS F-Luc (0.2 μg), and an internal control, pRL-TK (0.01 μg). At 36 h posttransfection, HEK293T cells were split by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and the luciferase activities were measured on a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega).
