<p>The 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>, 
 <italic>GRK3</italic>, 
 <italic>GRK5</italic>, 
 <italic>GRK6</italic>, β-
 <italic>arrestin1</italic>, and β-
 <italic>arrestin2</italic> genes were amplified by RT-PCR from total cellular mRNAs of A549 cells. The 
 <italic>GRK2</italic> gene was synthesized at Comate Bioscience Co., Ltd. (Changchun, China), due to its low abundance in A549 cells. 
 <italic>GRK2</italic>, 
 <italic>GRK3</italic>, and 
 <italic>GRK5</italic> were subsequently cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS, which contains a Myc tag at the C terminus. pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1-β-arrestin1 and pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1-β-arrestin2 were constructed by inserting the open reading frame (ORF) of β-
 <italic>arrestin1</italic> or β-
 <italic>arrestin2</italic> into the pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). pQCXIN-FFAR2 was constructed by inserting the 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> ORF into the pQCXIN vector (Clontech). GST-tagged FFAR2, FFAR2(1–219), and FFAR2(1–126) were constructed in pCAGGS with a GST tag at the N terminus. The ORFs of 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> and 
 <italic>AP2B1</italic> were fused with the Venus N terminus (VN) (residues 1 to 173), and the ORFs of 
 <italic>AP2B1</italic>, β-
 <italic>arrestin1</italic>, 
 <italic>GRK2</italic>, 
 <italic>GRK5</italic>, 
 <italic>GRK6</italic>, and 10 essential proteins of AH05 (H5N1) virus were fused with the Venus C terminus (VC) (residues 174 to 239), which were then cloned into pCAGGS. 
 <italic>HA1</italic> and 
 <italic>M2</italic> of AH05 (H5N1) virus were cloned into pCAGGS, and 
 <italic>HA2</italic> was cloned into pCAGGS with a Flag tag at the C terminus. The primer sequences of all oligonucleotides used for cloning are available upon request.
