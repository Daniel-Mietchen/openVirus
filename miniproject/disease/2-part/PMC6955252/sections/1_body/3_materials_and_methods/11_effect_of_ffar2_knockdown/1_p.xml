<p>A549 cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA (30 nM) or scrambled siRNA or were treated with 4-CMTB (100 μM), Barbadin (200 μM), or DMSO, followed by infection with AH05 (H5N1) virus at an MOI of 5. At 3, 6, or 9 h p.i., cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb to determine the level of NP protein expression.
