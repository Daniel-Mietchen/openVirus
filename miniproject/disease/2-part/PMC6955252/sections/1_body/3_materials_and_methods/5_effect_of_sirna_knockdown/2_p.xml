<p>siRNA targeting 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> or scrambled siRNA at a concentration of 30 nM was transfected into A549 cells seeded into 12-well plates by using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent. At 48 h posttransfection, the siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with VSV-EGFP (100 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID
 <sub>50</sub>]). Supernatants were collected at the indicated time points and titrated on HEK293T cells by calculating the TCID
 <sub>50</sub>.
