<p>siRNA targeting 
 <italic>Ffar2</italic> (5′-GCCACUGUAUGGAGUGAUC-3′) or scrambled siRNA at a concentration of 30 nM was transfected into mouse RAW 264.7 cells seeded into 12-well plates by using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent. At 48 h posttransfection, the knockdown efficiency was determined by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-FFAR2 pAb. The siRNA-treated mouse RAW 264.7 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 0.1 or 5). Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h p.i. (MOI = 0.1) or at 8 h p.i. (MOI = 5), and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells.
