<p>Total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Plus minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer and random 6-mers by using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). qRT-PCR assays were performed by using SYBR Premix Ex 
 <italic>Taq</italic> II (Tli RNase H Plus; TaKaRa). Relative RNA quantities were determined by using the comparative cycle threshold method, with the cellular GAPDH gene serving as the internal control. Dissociation curve analysis was performed after each assay to ensure specific detection. The qRT-PCR primer sequences are available upon request.
