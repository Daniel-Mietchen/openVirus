<p>pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1-β-arrestin1 or pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1-β-arrestin2 was cotransfected with psPAX2 and pMD2.G into HEK293T cells by using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents (Invitrogen). At 48 h posttransfection, viral supernatants were collected and used to transduce A549 cells cultured in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, A549 cells were retransduced with viral supernatants to enrich for transductants. After a 24-h incubation, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were harvested by using a MoFlo XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) and propagated in 6-well plates. The overexpression of β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 was tested by Western blotting with corresponding antibodies. To determine the knockdown efficiency of siRNA targeting β-
 <italic>arrestin1</italic> or β-
 <italic>arrestin2</italic>, the β-arrestin1- or β-arrestin2-overexpressing cells were transfected with siRNA targeting β-
 <italic>arrestin1</italic> or β-
 <italic>arrestin2</italic> or with scrambled siRNA at a concentration of 30 nM for 48 h by using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent. The siRNA knockdown efficiency was checked by Western blotting.
