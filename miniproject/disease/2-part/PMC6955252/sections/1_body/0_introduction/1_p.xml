<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is an important pathogen of the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>. Aside from frequent seasonal epidemics caused by H1 or H3 IAVs and occasional pandemics, avian influenza viruses, such as those of the H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes, are currently posing increasing threats to humans (

The genome of IAV consists of eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments that encode 10 essential proteins: polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic protein (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein 1 (M1), matrix protein 2 (M2), nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), and NS2. Of these viral proteins, HA is responsible for mediating the binding of virus particles to sialic acid (SA) receptors on cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids (
