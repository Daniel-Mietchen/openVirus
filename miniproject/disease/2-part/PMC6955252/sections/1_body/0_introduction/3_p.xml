<p>G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), a seven-α-helix transmembrane segment receptor, represents the largest superfamily of cell surface receptors and regulates a large array of biological functions (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Roles for GPCR family members in the replication of different viruses have been increasingly demonstrated. Notably, CCR5 and CXCR4 are required for HIV-1 infectivity, acting as coreceptors of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) is a novel cellular receptor for rabies virus (RABV) through interaction with RABV G protein (

GPCR antagonists targeting histamine receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (serotonin) receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and adrenergic receptor block the entry of Ebola virus and Marburg virus at a step that follows initial attachment but prior to viral/cell membrane fusion (
