<p>The effect of siRNA knockdown of FFAR2 on IAV infection was then evaluated with wild-type viruses. We found that FFAR2 downregulation in A549 cells led to 19- to 100-, 8- to 39-, and 26- to 56-fold reductions in growth titers from 12 to 72 h p.i. for A/Anhui/2/2005 (AH05) (H5N1), A/WSN/1933 (WSN) (H1N1), and A/chicken/Shanghai/SC197/2013 (SH13) (H9N2) viruses, respectively, demonstrating that FFAR2 is critical for the efficient replication of different subtypes of IAV (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>). To evaluate whether FFAR2 is specifically important for the replication of IAV, we analyzed the effect of FFAR2 knockdown on the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene (VSV-EGFP). We found that FFAR2 knockdown had no effect on the replication titers of VSV-EGFP at the indicated time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), thereby demonstrating the specificity of FFAR2 in supporting the replication of IAV. We also generated an 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> knockout (
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO) A549 cell line by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. By simultaneous electrotransfection of four pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (pX458) constructs containing single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> to A549 cells, a mixture of knockout cells was successfully generated. Sequencing analysis revealed a 271- or 578-bp deletion compared with the 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> mRNA sequence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Both deletions led to a frameshift in the 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> alleles that resulted in the loss of FFAR2 expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> knockout had no major effect on cell viability as measured by a luminescent cell viability assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). The titers of AH05 (H5N1) virus produced from 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells were dramatically lower than those of the control cells at 24 or 48 h p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Moreover, we employed a retroviral packaging system to complement the expression of FFAR2 protein in 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>, the complement of FFAR2 protein restored the replication of AH05 (H5N1) virus. These data further demonstrate that FFAR2 positively regulates IAV replication.
