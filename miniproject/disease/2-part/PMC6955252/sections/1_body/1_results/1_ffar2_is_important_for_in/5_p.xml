<p>Stimulation of innate immunity can potently inhibit the replication of IAV. To determine whether the dramatic decrease in virus replication upon downregulation of FFAR2 is associated with the stimulation of interferon (IFN) signaling, we examined the expression of Mx1 protein, a key antiviral effector of the IFN pathway, in 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA- or scrambled siRNA-treated A549 cells with or without IFN-α or IFN-β induction. Mx1 was not detectable in cells transfected with siRNA targeting 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> or scrambled siRNA in the absence of IFN-α or IFN-β stimulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>); no difference in the Mx1 expression level induced by IFN-α or IFN-β treatment was seen in cells treated with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA or scrambled siRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). We also determined the interferon-stimulated response element luciferase (ISRE-Luc) reporter activity in 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA-treated HEK293T cells and found that FFAR2 knockdown did not change the expression of the ISRE luciferase reporter gene compared with that in the control siRNA-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the restriction of IAV replication in FFAR2-downregulated cells is not associated with the stimulation of the IFN pathway.
