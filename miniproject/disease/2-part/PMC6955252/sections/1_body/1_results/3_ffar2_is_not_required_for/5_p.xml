<p>To explore the molecular mechanisms by which FFAR2 regulates IAV internalization, we attempted to detect an interaction between FFAR2 and the 10 essential IAV proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2). To this end, we performed a Venus-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in which FFAR2 was fused in frame with N-terminal residues 1 to 173 of the Venus protein (FFAR2-VN) and the AH05 (H5N1) viral proteins were fused with C-terminal residues 174 to 239 of the Venus protein (VC). The Venus fluorescence signal was detected only in HeLa cells cotransfected with FFAR2-VN/AH05 HA-VC or FFAR2-VN/AH05 M2-VC under conditions where the FFAR2-VN- and -VC-fused AH05 proteins were well expressed (

 <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) or GST-FFAR2, together with HA1, HA2, or M2 of AH05 (H5N1) virus. HA1 and M2 specifically interacted with FFAR2 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">E</xref>), whereas no interaction was observed between HA2 and FFAR2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Given that our results prove that FFAR2 is involved in the process of AH05 (H5N1) virus internalization, the interaction between FFAR2 and HA1, the globular head domain of HA, most likely facilitates the internalization of IAV into cells. We then attempted to define the region of FFAR2 that was important for its binding with HA1. We generated two truncated FFAR2 constructs, FFAR2(1–219) and FFAR2(1–126), which were fused to the C terminus of GST and then examined for their interaction with HA1 in HEK293T cells. The domain mapping experiment indicated that the region spanning residues 1 to 219 of FFAR2 was important for the interaction of FFAR2 with AH05 (H5N1) HA1 (
