<p>We then investigated whether treatment with 4-CMTB or Cmp58 also has an effect on the internalization of IAV. A549 cells were pretreated with 100 μM 4-CMTB, 10 μM Cmp58, or DMSO for 3 h prior to infection with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 5) at 37°C. At 15, 30, 45, or 60 min p.i., cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS-HCl (pH 1.3) to remove the uninternalized virions, and the cell lysates were then Western blotted. In DMSO-treated cells, the amount of internalized NP protein gradually increased over time (
