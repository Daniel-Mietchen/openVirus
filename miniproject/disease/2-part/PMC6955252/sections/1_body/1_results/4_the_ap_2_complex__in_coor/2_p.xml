<p>It has been reported that β-arrestin1 directly interacts with the β2-subunit of the AP-2 complex (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), which is a critical component of the CME pathway. We therefore investigated whether the AP-2 complex was also involved in FFAR2-mediated IAV endocytosis. The effect of the AP-2 subunits AP2A1, AP2B1, AP2M1, and AP2S1 on IAV infection was then determined by means of siRNA silencing. The expression of AP2A1, AP2B1, AP2M1, and AP2S1 was reduced in specific siRNA-treated A549 cells without causing cytotoxic effects (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">G</xref>). The gene-specific siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 0.1), and the virus titers in the supernatant were determined at 24 and 48 h p.i. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8H</xref>, only AP2B1 downregulation significantly decreased the virus titers compared with the control siRNA-treated cells. Next, 
 <italic>AP2B1</italic> siRNA- or scrambled siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 5) for 1 h on ice at 4°C, shifted to 37°C for 30 min to allow for internalization, washed with ice-cold PBS-HCl (pH 1.3) to remove virions retained on the cell surface, and lysed for the detection of internalized viral NP by Western blotting. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8I</xref>, the amount of viral NP protein inside the 
 <italic>AP2B1</italic> siRNA-treated A549 cells was dramatically decreased compared with that in the control siRNA-treated cells, demonstrating that most of the IAV particles were not internalized into the infected cells when the expression of AP2B1 was downregulated. BiFC analysis, by cotransfecting HeLa cells with FFAR2-VN with AP2B1-VC, produced almost no Venus fluorescence; instead, a strong Venus fluorescence signal was observed in HeLa cells cotransfected with AP2B1-VN and β-arrestin1-VC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8E</xref>).To further investigate the role of AP2B1, through its interaction with β-arrestin1, in the FFAR2-mediated internalization of IAV, we used a specific compound, Barbadin, to selectively inhibit the interaction between AP2B1 and β-arrestin1 (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). A549 cells were pretreated with Barbadin (200 μM) for 12 h and then infected with AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 5). We found that the amount of NP protein internalized in Barbadin-treated A549 cells was reduced at 3, 6, and 9 h compared with that in DMSO-treated A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8J</xref>). These results suggest that the AP-2 complex is involved in FFAR2-mediated IAV endocytosis not by directly interacting with FFAR2 but by relying on the bridging role of β-arrestin1.
