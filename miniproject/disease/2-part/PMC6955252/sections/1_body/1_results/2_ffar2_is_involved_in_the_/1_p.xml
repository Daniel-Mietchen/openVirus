<p>To investigate the step of the IAV replication cycle in which FFAR2 is engaged, A549 cells knocked down for FFAR2 were infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus at an MOI of 5. At 3, 6, and 9 h p.i., Western blotting showed that viral NP levels in cells silenced with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA were remarkably reduced compared with those in cells treated with scrambled siRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Moreover, pretreatment of A549 cells with 100 μM 4-CMTB led to significant suppression of viral NP expression at the early time points after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Notably, the significantly reduced level of NP expression in cells treated with 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic>-specific siRNA or 4-CMTB was observed as early as 3 h p.i., indicating that the host factor FFAR2 was most likely involved in the early steps of IAV replication. To corroborate this finding, we visualized the cellular distribution of NP by means of confocal microscopy in both FFAR2-knocked-down and control A549 cells infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus at early time points of infection. Viral NP was clearly visible in the nucleus of 16.7%, 66.0%, and 82.5% of scrambled siRNA-treated A549 cells at 2, 3, and 4 h p.i., respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, only 1.2%, 5.4%, and 33.2% of 
 <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA-treated cells displayed clear nuclear accumulation of viral NP at the same time points. These data indicate that FFAR2 downregulation impairs the early stage of IAV replication.
