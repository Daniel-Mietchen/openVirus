<p>The AP-2 adaptor complex is a heterotetramer consisting of α (AP2A1), β2 (AP2B1), μ2 (AP2M1), and σ2 (AP2S1) adaptin subunits (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). It plays multiple roles in CME, such as promoting the assembly of clathrin-coated pits and coordinating interactions between clathrin and other CME proteins (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). To date, the AP-2 complex has been reported to be involved in the endocytosis processes of different viruses, including HIV (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), murine cytomegalovirus (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), and white spot syndrome virus (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). As for IAV, a previous study by Chen and Zhuang reported that siRNA knockdown of the AP2M1 subunit of the AP-2 complex did not inhibit the clathrin-mediated uptake of IAV (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Here, we also found that AP2M1 knockdown had no effect on the replication of H5N1 virus. Interestingly, among the four subunits of the AP-2 complex, only AP2B1 knockdown significantly inhibited the replication of H5N1 virus. Although AP2B1 did not interact with FFAR2, according to our BiFC assay, it clearly interacted with β-arrestin1, which is consistent with a previous report that β-arrestins target the GPCRs to clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis via their direct interaction with the AP2B1 subunit of the AP-2 complex (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Moreover, Barbadin, by selectively targeting the interaction between β-arrestin1 and AP2B1, also inhibited the internalization of IAV. Together, these results suggest that the AP2B1 subunit of the AP-2 complex acts synergistically with clathrin and β-arrestin1 in the FFAR2-mediated endocytosis of IAV.
