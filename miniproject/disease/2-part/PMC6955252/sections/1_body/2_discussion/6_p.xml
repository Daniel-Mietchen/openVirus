<p>In summary, here, we demonstrate that the G protein-coupled receptor FFAR2 is required for the efficient replication of IAV. FFAR2 plays a key role in the step of IAV entry into host cells. We further reveal that the C-terminal phosphorylation of FFAR2 by GRK2, GRK5, or GRK6 is important for FFAR2 to support virus replication. Moreover, we found that the FFAR2–β-arrestin1–AP2B1 signaling cascade is necessary for the efficient endocytosis of IAV into host cells (
