  <p>FFAR2 interacts with HA and M2 of IAV. (A) BiFC analysis to examine the interaction between FFAR2-VN- and -VC-fused proteins of AH05 (H5N1) virus in HeLa cells. Cotransfection of vector VN and vector VC served as a negative control. (B) Western blotting to detect the expression of FFAR2-VN- and -VC-fused proteins of AH05 (H5N1) virus in HeLa cells. (C to E) Co-IP assay to determine the interaction between FFAR2 and HA1, HA2, and M2 of AH05 (H5N1) virus. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids for the expression of GST-FFAR2 individually or in combination with HA1 (C), HA2-Flag (D), or M2 (E). Lysates of transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with glutathione magnetic agarose beads. The bound proteins were subjected to Western blotting. (F) Mapping of the FFAR2 domain that mediates the interaction with HA1. Lysates of HEK293T cells cotransfected with HA1 and FFAR2 (or its truncation mutants) were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-GST pAb. The bound proteins were detected by Western blotting.</p>
