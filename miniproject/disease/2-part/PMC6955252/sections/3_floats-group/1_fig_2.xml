  <p>FFAR2 positively regulates IAV replication in A549 cells. (A to D) 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic> siRNA- or scrambled siRNA-transfected A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 0.1) (A), WSN (H1N1) (MOI = 0.01) (B), SH13 (H9N2) (MOI = 0.1) (C), or VSV-EGFP (100 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>) (D) virus. Supernatants were collected at the indicated time points, and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells (A to C) or by determining the TCID
   <sub>50</sub> on HEK293T cells (D). **,

   <italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001. (E) Schematic diagram of four sgRNA targeting sites at the 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic> gene loci and the two kinds of 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic> truncated mutants. Sanger sequencing results indicated that a frameshift occurred in the 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic>-truncated mutants within the 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO cell line; the knockout of 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic> was confirmed by Western blotting. (F) Cell viability of 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells was measured by using the CellTiter-Glo assay. (G) AH05 (H5N1) virus replication in 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells. 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO A549 cells or control cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 0.1). Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h p.i., and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells. ***, 
   <italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001. (H) The expression of FFAR2 in 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO_Comp A549 cells was confirmed by Western blotting. (I) AH05 (H5N1) virus replication in 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO_Comp A549 cells. 
   <italic>FFAR2</italic>_KO_Comp A549 cells or control A549 cells were infected with AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 0.1). Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h p.i., and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells. (J) Cell viability of A549 cells treated with 4-CMTB [2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-
   <italic>N</italic>-(thiazol-2-yl)butanamide] or Cmp58 [(
   <italic>S</italic>)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,3-dimethyl-
   <italic>N</italic>-(5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)butanamide] was measured by using the CellTiter-Glo assay. (K) A549 cells were pretreated with 4-CMTB or Cmp58 at the indicated concentrations for 3 h and then infected with AH05 (H5N1) virus (MOI = 0.1). Supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i., and virus titers were determined by means of plaque assays on MDCK cells. ***, 
   <italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001.
