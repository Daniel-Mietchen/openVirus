  <p>CHIKV dissemination (
   <bold>a</bold>) and transmission (
   <bold>b</bold>) models according to viral load and mosquito population. The solid lines show the probability of a successful viral transition from body to head (dissemination) or head to salivary glands (transmission) as a function of the viral load in the initial compartment (dissemination: body; transmission: head). The grey envelopes present 95% confidence intervals.
