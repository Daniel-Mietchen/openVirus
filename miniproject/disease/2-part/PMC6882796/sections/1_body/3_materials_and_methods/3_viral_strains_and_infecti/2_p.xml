<p id="Par23">Seven-day-old female adults were fed on a blood meal containing 1.4 mL of washed rabbit red blood cells and 0.7 mL of viral suspension (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The blood meal was supplemented with ATP as a phagostimulant at a final concentration of 1 mM. Mosquitoes were exposed to the blood using a Hemotek® membrane feeding system. Virus titers of blood meals were at 10
 <sup>7</sup> ffu/mL for CHIKV and DENV, and 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml for ZIKV. Engorged mosquitoes were transferred into boxes and fed
