<p id="Par4">A vector competence analysis of European 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations is critical for assessing the risk of arboviral diseases outbreaks as the establishment of competent mosquitoes can become the breeding ground for various arboviruses. To this aim, we collected eight European 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations from Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, and Switzerland, and experimentally infected them with three arboviruses, CHIKV (
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, Togaviridae), and DENV and ZIKV (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, Flaviviridae). Based on data obtained, we elaborated a vector competence data-driven prediction for CHIKV transmission using computational modeling to assist in evaluating the current risk of arboviral diseases transmission in Southern Europe.
