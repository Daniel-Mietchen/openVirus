<p id="Par3">Mosquitoes are able to transmit arboviruses by acquiring a viremic blood meal from an infected host. Along with blood, the ingested virus enters in the mosquito midgut and infects the epithelial cells that may in turn disseminate the virus to the mosquito internal tissues or organs. After the extrinsic incubation period (EIP)

 </sup>, the virus may reach the salivary glands where the viral cycle in the vector ends up with the virus transmitted to the host by the mosquito saliva
