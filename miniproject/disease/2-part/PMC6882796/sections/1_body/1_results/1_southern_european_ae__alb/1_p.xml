<p id="Par5">To analyze the vector competence of European mosquito populations for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV, F1-F4 mosquito populations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were used for each virus challenge experiment. The number of viral particles was estimated in the body, head, and saliva at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) for CHIKV and 7, 14, and 21 dpi for DENV-1 and ZIKV (Table
