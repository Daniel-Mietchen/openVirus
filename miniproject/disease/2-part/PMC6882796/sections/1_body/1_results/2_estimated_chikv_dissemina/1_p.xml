<p id="Par9">Vector competence significantly differs across mosquito populations for dissemination (Likelihood-ratio test; P = 0.017) but not for transmission (Likelihood-ratio test; P = 0.22). The corresponding classifiers AUC, a common measure of trade-off between true positives and false positives, improved respectively from 61% to 75% and 63% to 71% (Fig. S1). According to the dissemination model, the ability for CHIKV dissemination differed among the Southern European

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The non-European Canton sample was the most efficient for dissemination requiring only 591 (95% CI [239–1083]) viral particles per sample to reach 75% probability. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Southern European populations required substantially higher viral loads (e.g. Tivat: mean of 294,441 viral particles [189,670–437,521]; Arogno: 336,511 [191,866–544,503]) to reach similar probabilities of dissemination. Conversely, the same Canton population was found to have the highest transmission threshold, making transmission more likely in mosquitoes from Southern European populations (Table
