 </sup> stressing that the species is a competent vector to both arboviruses. The vector competence assessing the ability of a mosquito to transmit a pathogen is a measure which can be modulated by genetic, epigenetic and also environmental factors
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Firstly, the outcome of infection depends on the specific combination between vector and pathogen genotypes described under genotype-by-genotype (G x G) interactions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. Notably, different mosquito generations in insectaries were used in this study; their vector competence for viruses could be affected due to adaptation to laboratory conditions. However, we initiated the mosquito population from a large size of field-collected mosquitoes to avoid inbreeding. This allowed to keep the population genetic diversity, and limit changes in mosquito fitness performance for 13 generations

 </sup>. Thus, the results of mosquito vector competence for arboviruses were expected to be reliable. Using experimental viral challenges, it has been shown that

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. Despite several hundreds of CHIKV cases imported to continental Europe from the Americas, no autochthonous transmission of the Asian CHIKV was reported. A previous study showed that low temperatures limit the transmission of the Asian genotype

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup> and not of the ECSA genotype providing further evidence that environmental factors such as the temperature can intervene in modulating the G x G interactions through genotype-by-genotype-by-environment (G x G x E) interactions
