 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> showed the highest susceptibilities to CHIKV. Therefore CHIKV dissemination and transmission of each population were analyzed by determining the theoretical thresholds for virus to escape from each anatomical barrier, midgut and salivary glands. According to the dissemination model, three groups could be roughly divided depending on their theoretical thresholds of dissemination, whereas the transmission model showed a similar theoretical threshold of transmission among all European populations. These results suggest that the significance of the midgut as barrier to viral dissemination depends on the mosquito population. However, once the populations ensured an efficient dissemination of CHIKV, transmission is quite similar as they are sharing the same potential to transmit. Interestingly, the non-European control, Canton population has distinct dissemination and transmission features than the other European populations; it showed the highest potential to disseminate and the lowest probability to transmit CHIKV, stressing again the genetic basis of vector competence depending on pairings vector and pathogen genotypes
