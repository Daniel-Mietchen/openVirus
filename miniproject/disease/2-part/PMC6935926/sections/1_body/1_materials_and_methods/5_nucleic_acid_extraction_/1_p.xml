<p>Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min. The supernatant was eluted without disturbing the pelleted material and was used in nucleic acid extraction. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 100 μl of supernatant using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) eluting in 50 μl of H
 <sub>2</sub>O, followed by a DNase treatment with Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C for 30 min. RNA was purified and concentrated to 6 μl using the RNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Randomly amplified cDNA was prepared for each sample using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach, adapted from our previously described workflow (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), based on the round A/B methodology (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). For reverse transcription, 4 μl of RNA and 1 μl of primer A (5′-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-N9-3′, 40 pmol/μl) (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) were mixed and incubated for 5 min at 65°C and then cooled to room temperature. First-strand synthesis was performed by the addition of 2 μl SuperScript IV first-strand buffer, 1 μl of 12.5 mM dinucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 0.5 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μl H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and 0.5 μl SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher) before incubation for 10 min at 42°C. Second-strand synthesis was performed by the addition of 1 μl Sequenase buffer, 3.85 μl H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and 0.15 μl Sequenase (Affymetrix) prior to incubation for 8 min at 37°C, followed by the addition of 0.45 μl Sequenase dilution buffer and 0.15 μl Sequenase and a further incubation at 37°C for 8 min. Amplification of cDNA was performed in triplicate using 5 μl of the reaction mixture as input to a 50-μl AccuTaq LA (Sigma) reaction mixture, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 1 μl primer B (5′-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-3′) (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), with PCR cycling conditions of 98°C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 50°C for 20 s, and 68°C for 2 min, followed by 68°C for 10 min. Amplified cDNA was pooled from the triplicate reaction mixtures, purified using a 1:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), and quantified using a Qubit high-sensitivity double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) kit (Thermo Fisher), both according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
