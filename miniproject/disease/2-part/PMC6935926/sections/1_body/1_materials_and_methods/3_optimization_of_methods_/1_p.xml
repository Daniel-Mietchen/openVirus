<p>Prior to establishing the protocol detailed in full below, we assessed the impact of two possible optimization steps, centrifugation versus filtration and reduced time for cDNA synthesis. For centrifugation versus filtration, we investigated two approaches to deplete human/bacterial nucleic acid from our samples, i.e., filtration of the raw sample via a 0.4-μm filter (Sartorius) before further processing versus using a hard spin (16,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min). cDNA libraries for this comparison were produced as described previously (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) to that of a modified version with two alterations, first using SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher) in place of SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher) for reverse transcription, with the incubation time reduced from 60 min to 10 min at 42°C, and second, reducing the cDNA amplification PCR extension cycling time from 5 min to 2 min.
