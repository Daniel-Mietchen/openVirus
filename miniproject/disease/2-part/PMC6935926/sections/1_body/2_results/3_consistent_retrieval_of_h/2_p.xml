<p>We consistently retrieved Hazara virus reads from all three dilution series by Nanopore sequencing, independently of influenza virus titer in the sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Sequencing from dilution series 1 and 2 gave a consistent proportion of total reads mapping to the Hazara virus genome, across dilutions and between the first two pools, with mean ± standard deviation values per pool of 1.4 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> ± 660 reads per million (RPM) of total reads and 1.2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> ± 350 RPM, respectively. The pool 3 dilution series generated 260 ± 340 RPM Hazara virus reads across samples and showed a decreasing trend associated with increased dilution factor as increasingly more nonviral RNA was introduced from this high-background pool.
