<p>Starting with an influenza A virus-positive sample pool (10
 <sup>6</sup> genome copies/ml), we made three volumetric dilution series using three independent influenza virus-negative pools (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The total quantity of cDNA after preparation for sequencing was consistently higher in all samples using negative pool 3 as the diluent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), indicating the presence of a higher concentration of nonviral RNA within pool 3. This is likely due to host cell lysis or higher bacterial presence and demonstrates the variable nature of throat swab samples.
