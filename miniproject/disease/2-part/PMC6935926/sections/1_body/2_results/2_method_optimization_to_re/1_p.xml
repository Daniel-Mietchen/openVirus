<p>Synthesis of tagged randomly primed cDNA and its subsequent amplification via SISPA (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) required lengthy reverse transcription and PCR steps (1 h and 3 h 45 min), respectively. Optimizing these stages upgraded the reverse transcriptase from SuperScript III to SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher), reduced the incubation time to 10 min (processing time reduction, 50 min), and reduced the PCR extension time within each cycle from 5 min to 2 min (1 h 30 min processing time reduction). Comparing this final method with our original protocol, using triplicate extractions from the pooled set of influenza A virus-positive samples demonstrated no significant loss in performance in the more rapid protocol (Fig. S3), and we adopted this approach as our routine protocol, giving a wet-lab processing time of ∼8 h.
