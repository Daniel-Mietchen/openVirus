<p>Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) recommend nasal/nasopharyngeal specimens for influenza diagnosis, but throat swabs are easier to collect in clinical practice and therefore account for the majority of diagnostic samples processed by our clinical microbiology laboratory. Further work is needed to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of our protocol for a wider array of respiratory sample types (also including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, and saliva), which may contain different degrees of contaminating bacterial and/or human reads. Loss of assay sensitivity due to the presence of high-level background DNA from either the host or bacterial origin is a fundamental issue for metagenomic approaches, even in cell-free sample types such as cerebrospinal fluid (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). This challenge is exacerbated in throat swabs, as seen in our data. Our use of Hazara virus as an internal positive control allows us to identify those samples in which sensitivity has dropped to &lt;10
 <sup>4</sup> viral genome copies per ml. In our test set, 8% of samples showed insufficient sensitivity for Hazara virus; however, half of these contained a high titer of influenza virus, so only 4% were true sensitivity failures. This figure is in line with the reported 6% failure rate due to high background for RNA virus detection from a clinically validated metagenomic sequencing assay for pathogen detection in cerebrospinal fluid (
