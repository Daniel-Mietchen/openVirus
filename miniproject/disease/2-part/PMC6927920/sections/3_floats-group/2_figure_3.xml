  <p>Multicycle growth kinetics and plaque assay of recombinant WT and modified PR8 viruses. Viral growth kinetics: Canine MDCK 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or human A549 
   <bold>(B)</bold> cells (2.5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/well, 24-well plate format, triplicates) were infected (MOI = 0.001 for MDCK; MOI = 0.01 for A549 cells) with the indicated WT or modified PR8 viruses and incubated at 33°C. Tissue culture supernatants were collected at the indicated hours post-infection and viral titers were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml) using an anti-NP antibody (HB-65). Data represent the means and SD of the results determined from triplicate wells. Dashed lines indicate the limit of detection (200 FFU/ml).
