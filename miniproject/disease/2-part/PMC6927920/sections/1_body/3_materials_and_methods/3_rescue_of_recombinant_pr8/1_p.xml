<p>Ambisense pDZ plasmids were used for the rescue of the recombinant PR8 viruses as previously described (

 <sup>6</sup> cells/well) were co-transfected in suspension, using Lipofectamine 2000 (LPF2000, Invitrogen), with the PR8 ambisense pDZ-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -HA, -NP, -NA, -M plasmids and the NS plasmids containing IAV (PR8), IBV (B/Brisbane/60/2008), ICV (C/Taylor/1233/1947) or IDV (D/Swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011) NS1 proteins. Clonal viruses were selected by plaque assay, and virus stocks were propagated in MDCK cells at 33°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 3–4 days. For infections, virus stocks were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.3% bovine albumin (BA) and 1% PS (PBS/BA/PS). After viral infections, cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BA, 1% PSG, and 1 μg/ml tosyl-sulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma). Virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay (plaque forming units [PFU]/ml) in MDCK cells (
