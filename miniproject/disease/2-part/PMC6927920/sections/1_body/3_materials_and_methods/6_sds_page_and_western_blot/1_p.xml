<p>Total proteins from transfected or infected cell lysates were separated by denaturing electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% dried skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween) and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Sigma; to detect expression of NS1) or mouse monoclonal anti-NP (HB-65; ATCC H16-L10-4R5) antibodies. An anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used as a loading control. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) specific for mouse or rabbit immunoglobulins (Ig) were used to detect bound primary antibodies. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the Super Signal West Femto maximum-sensitivity substrate (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
