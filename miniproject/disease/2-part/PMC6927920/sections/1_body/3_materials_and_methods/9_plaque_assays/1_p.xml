<p>Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells (6-well plate format, 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well) were infected with the indicated PR8 viruses for 1 h at room temperature, and after virus adsorption, cells were overlaid with media containing agar and incubated at 33°C. At 3 days post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the overlays were removed, cells were permeabilized (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, and immunostained, as previously described (
