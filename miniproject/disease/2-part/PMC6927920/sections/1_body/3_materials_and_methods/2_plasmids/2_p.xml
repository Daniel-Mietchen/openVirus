<p>In order to generate ambisense pDZ-NS plasmids containing the different IAV (PR8), IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins and the same IAV PR8 NEP, we used our previously described pDZ-NS-2xBsmBI plasmid (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Nogales et al., 2014a</xref>), which contains the PR8 NS1, without the stop codon or splice acceptor site, and two 
 <italic>Bsm</italic>BI sites, followed by the porcine teschovirus-1 (PTV-1) 2A autoproteolytic cleavage site (ATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP) and the PR8 NEP. The PR8 NS1 was removed from the pDZ-NS-2xBsmBI plasmid by inverse PCR to generate pDZ-ΔNS1-2xBsmBI. Next, the different IBV, ICV, or IDV ORFs were amplified by PCR from the pCAGGs-NS1 plasmids with primers containing 
 <italic>Bsm</italic>BI sites and an HA tag at the C-terminal. NS1 PCR products were cloned into the pDZ-ΔNS1-2xBsmBI plasmid using the 
 <italic>Bsm</italic>BI restriction sites. All the plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing (ACGT, Inc.). Sequences of the primers used for the construction of the different plasmids are available upon request.
