<p>To evaluate the ability of NS1 proteins from different influenza viruses to inhibit general host protein expression or IFN-dependent responses, we selected representative members of each viral type (IAV, IBV, ICV, and IDV). Since the NS1 protein from some IAV strains have been shown to differ in inhibiting host gene expression (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chauche et al., 2018</xref>), we selected A/Brevig Mission/1/18 H1N1 (1918) and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) as representative NS1 proteins with the ability to induce or not, respectively, cellular shutoff. Moreover, the antiviral functions of these two IAV NS1 proteins have been well-described in the literature (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), human 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with individual plasmids encoding HA epitope tagged NS1 proteins from IAV (PR8 or 1918), IBV, ICV, or IDV; together with a plasmid expressing the Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells transfected with an empty (E) plasmid were used as an internal control in these experiments. Gluc expression was evaluated using a luminometer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) at 24 h post-transfection. As previously described (

 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>), PR8 NS1 did not inhibit Gluc reporter gene expression, whereas 1918 NS1 was able to efficiently inhibit protein expression of the reporter gene. IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins did not inhibit Gluc expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, a slight but statistical significant increase in the expression of Gluc was observed in cells transfected with plasmids encoding ICV and IDV NS1 proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), although the biological significance for this observation needs to be evaluated. PR8 IAV, IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins were detected by Western blot using an antibody against the HA epitope tag (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), although different levels of expression were noted. We were not able to detect expression of 1918 NS1, mainly because of its ability to inhibit host gene expression, including its own synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), as previously described (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>). These results demonstrate that the NS1 proteins from IBV, ICV, and IDV do not inhibit host gene expression, similar to PR8 IAV NS1.
