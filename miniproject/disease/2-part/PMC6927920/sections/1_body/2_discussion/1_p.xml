The NS1 protein of IAV has been extensively studied and multiple functions, including counteraction of cellular antiviral responses, have been previously described (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Opitz et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2008b</xref>). Likewise, IBV NS1 has been previously shown to inhibit host innate responses, mainly IFN (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Yuan and Krug, 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dauber et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hai et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Patzina et al., 2017</xref>). Although less studied, ICV NS1 has also been shown to inhibit IFN responses (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Nakada et al., 1986</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Muraki et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Pachler and Vlasak, 2011</xref>). To date, the ability of IDV NS1 to counteract innate immune responses have not been described. Despite their similarities in inhibiting IFN, the amino acid sequence of IAV, IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins are very different, suggesting that the mechanism(s) of counteracting host innate immune responses and/or interactions with host proteins involved in the IFN pathway, could be different for the NS1 proteins of these diverse influenza viruses. The IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins tested in our study do not have the ability to inhibit host gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), similar to some IAV strains, such as PR8 (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Kochs et al., 2007</xref>). However, all of them were able to inhibit ISRE promoter activation induced by SeV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This is, to our knowledge, the first time that IDV NS1 has been shown to inhibit induction of IFN responses, similar to the NS1 proteins from IAV, IBV, and ICV. Based on their ability to inhibit IFN responses, one could postulate that the NS1 protein of an influenza virus could be exchanged for that of other virus types. In this study we aimed to determine if the NS1 proteins from IBV, ICV, or IDV can functionally replace the NS1 of IAV. To address this hypothesis, we generated recombinant PR8 viruses expressing homotypic (PR8) or heterotypic (IBV, ICV, and IDV) NS1 proteins. To that end, we took advantage of our newly described IAV PR8 modified NS segment that allows the expression of NS1 independently of NEP (

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Our studies suggest that although the replication of IAV expressing heterotypic IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins was not severely impaired in MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and the viruses were able to inhibit IFN response to levels comparable to PR8/WT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), viral replication was impaired in human A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, our results 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> showed that virulence and replication of IAV expressing heterotypic NS1 proteins were also affected in WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Notably, the virulence and replication of PR8 viruses expressing heterotypic NS1 proteins were still maintained, although to a minor extent, in STAT2
 <sup>–/–</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that although IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins are able to counteract IFN responses similar to IAV NS1 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, they cannot complement additional functions that are required for viral replication and virulence.
