<p>IAV NS1, through its N-terminal domain, is able to bind multiple RNA molecules (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Marc, 2014</xref>), including polyadenylated mRNAs, double stranded (ds)RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, viral genomic RNAs or messenger (m)RNAs (

 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Terrier et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, more than 50 host proteins have been described to interact with IAV NS1 (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Nogales et al., 2018b</xref>), although there is some variability among the NS1 binding partners between different IAV strains, most likely due to host-adaptation mechanisms (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Nogales et al., 2017a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>,

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chauche et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, IAV NS1 is also able to interact with viral proteins such as the polymerase acid (PA) or NP (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Robb et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Marc, 2014</xref>). Through these numerous interactions, IAV NS1 is able to inhibit antiviral responses and translation, regulate the activity of the viral polymerase complex and, therefore, synthesis of vRNA; and control several processes related with the cellular or vRNA metabolism (RNA splicing, mRNA nuclear export, etc.). Currently, knowledge on the ability of IBV, ICV, and IDV NS1 proteins to bind RNA or cellular proteins is more limited, and these differences could explain the attenuation of PR8 viruses expressing heterotypic NS1 proteins.
