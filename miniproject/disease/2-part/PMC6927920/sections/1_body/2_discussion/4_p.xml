<p>Altogether, our data suggest that despite the similarities to effectively counteract IFN responses, the NS1 proteins of IBV, ICV, or IDV do not fully complement the activities of the multifunctional IAV NS1 protein. Our results also open the feasibility of conducting similar studies in the backbone of other influenza types (e.g., IBV, ICV, and IDV) to evaluate the contribution of their NS1 proteins in viral pathogenesis and in the feasibility of complementing them with the NS1 protein from heterotypic viruses.</p>
