<p>For the studies in children (YEFE and NIFTY), we assumed a 90% seroconversion rate (accounting for lower vaccine immunogenicity reported in children

 </sup>), 90% power, 2.5% alpha for a one-sided test and a non-inferiority margin of 10%, which gave a sample size of 190 per arm. This was increased by 10%; to account for 5% losses to follow up and 5% unevaluable participants with a positive serological response for YF virus at baseline. This gave a total sample size of 420 i.e. 210 in the full standard dose groups and 210 in the fractional or lower dose groups (
