<p>Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized to an arm depending on the study they are recruited to (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). They will receive one vaccine. This allocation will be blinded to the participants, the investigators and the study teams, and only the vaccinating nurse and pharmacist will be unblinded. Unblinding will be done at the end of the trial. Unblinding will not be necessary unless, as per DSMB request, for SAE review. The vaccine reconstitution will be done as per the manufacturersâ€™ instructions.
