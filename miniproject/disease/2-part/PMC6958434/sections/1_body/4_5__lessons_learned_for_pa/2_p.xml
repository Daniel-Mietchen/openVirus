<p>A key tool for communication by the NYSDOH is the Health Commerce System, a secure web-based system for information exchange with state health agencies and health care facilities, providers and practitioners. The notifications, alerts and documents related to the novel A/H1N1pdm09 virus were sent electronically to enrolled health providers. Outreach from the NYSDOH Bureau of Communicable Disease Control to clinicians gave weekly updates of statewide influenza surveillance; directives for electronic reporting of positive cases; guidelines for suspected influenza-associated deaths; and guidelines for diagnosis of influenza. The discussions addressed the advantages and disadvantages of the rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDT), the culture of influenza viruses as well as molecular laboratory developed tests, and commercially available RT-PCR tests. The choice of antiviral medication was often based on surveillance data of RIDT results that indicated the circulating strain(s). The submission of specimens for laboratory testing was recommended if the results would impact clinical management. Antiviral resistance testing at the Wadsworth Center was advised for cases not responding to treatment, and antiviral medications were recommended for prophylaxis in certain situations. </p>
