<p>For this surge drill, the participating PHLs estimated their maximum daily laboratory capacity for influenza testing. Mock influenza specimens, of which approximately 30% were positive, were prepared and shipped to the four laboratories, so that each received 25% of its estimated maximum capacity on each of three consecutive days. All specimens were sent with completed imitation request forms to facilitate test accessioning including the entry of patient demographics, followed by diagnostic testing and the reporting of results, for a thorough evaluation of the response capacity. A mock Incident Management System guided the participants to report daily on the results, facility logistics, scientific and technical issues, and resource management.</p>
