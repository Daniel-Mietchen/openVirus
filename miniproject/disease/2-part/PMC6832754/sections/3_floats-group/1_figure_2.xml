  <p>Maximum-likelihood tree of 567nt of all HPeV5 VP1 sequences from the NCBI GenBank with &gt;90% similarity to G001-19. The tree was generated in Mega X using the GTR+G+I model. Branch support was determined with 1000 bootstrap replicates, and is shown at each node. The near full-length 2019 recombinant HPeV5 sequences described here are in red.</p>
