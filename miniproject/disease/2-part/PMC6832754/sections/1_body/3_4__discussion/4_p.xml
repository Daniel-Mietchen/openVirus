<p>While no full-length sequences similar to either of the Australian recombinant HPeV3 or HPeV5 have been published from other countries at the time of writing, recent studies from Europe have indicated that, based on partial VP1 sequences, viruses closely related, at least in VP1, to the Australian HPeV5 were circulating in Europe as recently as 2018 [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interestingly, the same report observed a simultaneous spike in HPeV3 infections, with several HPeV3 lineages detected, including HPeV3’s with VP1 sequences that were highly similar (≥99% similarity by BLASTn) to the Australian recombinant HPeV3s from 2013–2014 (CSF19, FEC21, FEC22 and FEC23) [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Europe may have, therefore, been the geographical region where the progenitor HPeV5 and HPeV3 viruses had the opportunity to recombine and produced the virus described here. However, this is purely speculative without the complete genomes of the viruses detected there in 2018. We propose that more complete genome sequencing of HPeVs should be undertaken in future surveillance to better understand the epidemiology, virulence factors and the rate of recombination of this virus.
