<p>More complete sequencing of human parechoviruses (HPeV), globally, is important to better understand the epidemiology, to detect recombination, and to better understand the role of potential pathogenicity determinants, such as the presence/absence of an an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) receptor motif [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or changes in the non-structural proteins [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although HPeV3, in general, and perhaps the Australian recombinant in particular [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], appears to cause more severe disease in infants, sequencing should not be restricted to HPeV3, as any type of parechovirus may acquire genes from a more virulent HPeV through recombination [
