<p>Initial detection of parechovirus in the clinical samples was performed at VIDRL using a 5’ UTR PCR, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Samples not sequenced by the Ion Torrent were typed using a VP3-VP1 PCR [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] at VIDRL. Additional sequence was obtained from two HPeV5-positive samples using a 3D polymerase PCR [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and an in-house nested HPeV 2C-3A PCR. This 2C-3A PCR used 2 µL of cDNA in a 10 µL reaction using 1× Amplitaq Gold 360 master mix (Life Technologies), 2 µM Syto9 and 1 µM of each primer Parecho-AC-4338-4360F (ACNGCHAGYGARTTYATGGAYGG) and primer Parecho-AC-5103-5130R (ATACTGGCACTRGTRACAGCTGA). The nested 2C-3A PCR took 1 µL of the first 2C-3A PCR reaction in a 10 µL reaction with 1× Amplitaq Gold 360 master mix, 2 µM Syto9 and 1µM of each primer Parecho-AC-4578-4609F (AARAGAAGATTCCCATACATYATGCACATTAG) and primer Parecho-AC-4997-4775R (TCGTGTCTGGYTTGCAACTTTRG). Both PCRs were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s, with a final incubation of 72 °C for 3 min.
