<p>Immediately after PCR detection of HPeV infection in G001-19, a nasal swab, plasma and CSF collected from the infant during their hospitalization were sent to GCEID and PCR-amplified and sequenced using PCRs targeting VP1, 2C and 3D. All samples were positive, and the sequences obtained for each sample were identical in the respective PCRs (accession numbers MN193506-MN193511). The VP1 sequencing identified HPeV5 in the samples. Initial Sanger sequencing was followed by Ion Torrent sequencing of the G001-19 nasal swab in which a 7268 nt-long sequence of an HPeV5 was obtained (GenBank accession: MN212905). This consisted of 620 nt of the 5’UTR, the full polyprotein (6561 nt), the complete 87 nt of the 3’UTR and part of the poly-A tail. An RGD motif was present at the 3’ end of the VP1 sequence. The genome was assembled from 29,031 reads or 0.35% of the total reads from this sample.</p>
