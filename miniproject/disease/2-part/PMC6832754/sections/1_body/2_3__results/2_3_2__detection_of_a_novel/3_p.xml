<p>The nearest complete HPeV sequence in GenBank to the G001-19 HPeV5 was HPeV5 strain T92-15, detected in California in 1992 (GenBank accession AM235749.1). When individual virus proteins were compared by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST (NCBI)) to the sequences in Genbank, it was apparent that different genes shared high homology with different HPeV sequences in GenBank. The VP1 was 99.85% similar to HPeV5 detected in Belarus (HPeV_5_19393_2018_BLR, GenBank accession: MK168005.1) and 99.71% to HPeV5 detected in Germany in 2018 (BE.2211/HE/DE/2018, GenBank accession: MK291280.1), protein 2C was 90.58% similar to an HPeV1 31170176 (LC318432) from Japan, 2017 and the polymerase (protein 3D) was 98.37%â€“98.58% similar to HPeV3 (FEC22-KY556674.1, FEC21-KY556673.1 and CSF19-KY556671.1) detected in Australia during 2013 and 2014. </p>
