<p>In a scenario where only the notification of the diseases are available and laboratory tests are scarce, we see that the notification of dengue and Zika are shown to be independent of the notification of chikungunya. These findings are plausible, since dengue and Zika present more similar clinical manifestations to each other as compared to chikungunya [

The expressive joint manifestations produced by CHIKV infections allow a more accurate clinical diagnosis, even when specific laboratory tests are not available. Therefore, these results would not support the use of discarded cases of chikungunya as complementary cases of Zika infection, as suggested by Oliveira et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0228347.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, as the total number of chikungunya discarded cases was small (3.8%) in comparison to the universe of cases of the three diseases, that fact did not affect the temporal trend presented for this and our study. Nevertheless, it is worth noticing that our results should be nearest of the real, and thus contribute to construct more accurate prediction models of future Zika epidemics, using only possible cases of dengue.
