<p>Regarding the proportions of reported confirmed and discarded cases of each viruses, although chikungunya presents lower incidence compared with Zika and dengue, in 2015 we notice an inverted pattern in the proportion of confirmed and discarded cases compared to those reported by dengue and Zika. This can rise up the hypothesis that one virus inhibits the proliferation of the other. In 2017, when the proportion of discarded cases is larger for dengue and Zika, chikungunya shows a pattern with a higher proportion of confirmed cases in the first semester and lower in the second. Ribeiro et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0228347.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], performed surveillance study in the city of Salvador, Brazil. They argued that the increased pattern of chikungunya cases in opposition to the decrease of dengue and Zika cases in this population, may suggest that it was unrelated to vector population and that immunity after ZIKAV infection may cross-protect against dengue. Our findings, using data of the whole Brazil, are in accordance with their results.
