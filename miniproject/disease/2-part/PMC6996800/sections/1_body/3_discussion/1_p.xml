<p>In the context of mutual influence of notifications of co-occurring diseases, a series of discarded cases of disease 1 may affect the confirmed cases of disease 2. In such cases, it is possible to argue that individuals truly infected by disease 2 were wrongly notified as disease 1 provided there exists strong similarities and weak differences among main signs and symptoms of each disease, as it has been reported since 1969 for arboviroses [

 <xref rid="pone.0228347.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the other hand, when confirmed cases of disease 1 affect the discarded cases of disease 2, this can be interpreted as an increase (or decrease) in the notification of disease 2, but not necessarily this notification can be claimed as a confirmed case of disease 1.
