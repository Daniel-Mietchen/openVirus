<p>In Brazil, the co-circulation of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), together with the emergence and dissemination of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (mainly 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>), has a relevant negative impact on the health of the population and lead to an increase in the demand on health and other support services. From the DENV introduction, in 1986, to until arrival and subsequent spread of CHIKV and ZIKV, dengue was the most important vector-borne disease circulating in cities of Brazil, [

Although chikungunya causes arthralgia with pain at a higher level than dengue, the other symptoms are similar, which increased the likelihood of misdiagnosis [

Patients infected with ZIKV typically presented low (or no) fever and skin rash within the first 24 hours of the disease onset, while DENV and CHIKV cause high fever immediately. Also, CHIKV causes more intense arthralgia than DENV. However, the other symptoms are similar, which confound and complicate their differentiation and easily lead to misdiagnosis, [
