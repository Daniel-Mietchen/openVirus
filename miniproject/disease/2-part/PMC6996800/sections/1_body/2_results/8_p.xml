 <xref rid="pone.0228347.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the correlation matrix of the stationary series of confirmed and discarded cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika. We interpret the values of positive/negative correlation according to the interval: ±.00 to ±.10 very low; ±.10 to ±.40 as weak; ±.40 to ±.60 as moderate; ±.60 to ±.80 as strong; ±.80 to ±.99 very strong; ±1.0 as perfect. Summary of regression results are presented in
