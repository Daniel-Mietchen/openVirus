<p>The results of the Granger tests to explore associations between series are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0228347.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. They show that, at a significant level, the series of confirmed and discarded cases of dengue affect the series of confirmed and discarded cases of Zika and vice-versa. On the other hand, no associations were found between the series of confirmed and discaded cases of Zika and chikungunya. The series of confirmed Zika and confirmed (0.63) and discarded (0.70) dengue, as well as, the series of discarded Zika and confirmed (0.66) dengue present a positive strong linear correlation, which is stronger than the other correlations for the series described above.
