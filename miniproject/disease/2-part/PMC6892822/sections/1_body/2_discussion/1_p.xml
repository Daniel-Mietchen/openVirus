<p id="Par31">Advances in high-throughput sequencing have provided insights into the extraordinary diversity of viruses and their genomic determinants of host adaptation. However, the mechanism how these adaptive mutations enable replication in a given host is less understood. Our proteomic pulse labeling data allowed us to take an unbiased look at protein synthesis upon permissive and non-permissive infection. This is advantageous since it allows us to investigate changes in protein synthesis with high temporal resolution, which provides complementary information to more classical steady-state measurements

 </sup>. We found that the synthesis profiles of host cell proteins were remarkably similar. Hence, the outcome of infection does not appear to depend on a specific host response. In contrast, we observed striking differences in the synthesis profiles of viral proteins. Particularly, the matrix protein M1 was inefficiently produced during non-permissive infection. Our follow-up experiments showed that this depends— at least partially—on excessive splicing of the avian M1 mRNA to alternative transcripts. Systematic computational analysis of the RNA structure of the M segment revealed characteristic and evolutionarily conserved differences in the splice site regions between human and bird-adapted strains. Exchanging eight nucleotides in the 3′ splice site region from the human-adapted strain to corresponding sequences in the bird-adapted strain markedly impaired replication. Thus, our proteomic analysis of IAV infection identifies M segment splicing as a host range determinant. A hypothetical model for the influence of M segment splicing on the IAV host range is presented in Fig.
