<p id="Par19">M1 is encoded on segment 7 (i.e., the M segment), which is the most conserved segment between Pan and Mal (~89% nucleotide identity). The M1 protein is produced from a collinear transcript that can be alternatively spliced into three additional isoforms, which all use a common 3′ splice site:
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup> the M2 mRNA, which encodes the ion channel M2
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, RNA 3, which is not known to encode a peptide, and M4 mRNA, which is proposed to be translated to an isoform of the M2 ion channel in certain strains
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. We investigated the relative proportion of these isoforms in the RNA-seq data via splice junction reads. We detected all known isoforms plus a yet undescribed transcript of the avian M segment, which we call RNA 5. This transcript results from splicing at 5′ donor GG site (pos 520/521) and the common 3′ acceptor site and contains an open reading frame in-frame with M1 with a missing internal region (Fig.
