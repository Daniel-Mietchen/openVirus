<p id="Par21">In principle, the increased splicing of the M segment RNA by bird-adapted strains may reflect an evolutionary adaptation to different needs of the corresponding viral proteins in avian cells. In this case, avian-adapted strains would produce less M1 in both human and avian cells. Alternatively, the optimal balance of viral proteins could be constant and independent of the host species. In this case, avian-adapted strains would produce more M1 in avian than in human cells. To investigate this experimentally, we infected both human and chicken cells with the Mal virus and monitored the production of viral proteins using pSILAC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). We found that the Mal strain produced considerably more M1 in chicken cells than in human cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Hence, the reduced M1 production of avian viruses in human cells appears to reflect poor adaptation to the mammalian splicing environment.
