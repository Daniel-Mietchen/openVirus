<p id="Par20">While only a few percent (2–3%) of the M1 mRNA was alternatively spliced during permissive infection, ~27% was spliced upon infection with the avian strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Thus, the reduced level of M1 mRNA during non-permissive infection is at least partially due to increased splicing of the M1 mRNA to alternative isoforms. In contrast, M2 mRNA levels were rather similar. We note that the comparable M2 mRNA level during non-permissive infection results from two opposing processes—the increased splicing of the primary transcript to the M2 mRNA, and the global reduction in viral transcripts, which is probably due to the impaired polymerase activity
