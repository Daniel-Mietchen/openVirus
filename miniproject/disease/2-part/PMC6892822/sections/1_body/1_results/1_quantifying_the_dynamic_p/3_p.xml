<p id="Par10">We quantified proteins using two readouts: (i) SILAC-based relative quantification to assess differences in de novo protein synthesis and (ii) intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) to quantify absolute amounts of newly synthesized proteins

 </sup>. Our data thus provides kinetic profiles for relative and absolute differences in de novo protein synthesis across the course of infection (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In total, we identified 7729 host and 10 viral proteins and quantified 6029 proteins in at least two biological replicates with overall good reproducibility (Supplementary Fig.
