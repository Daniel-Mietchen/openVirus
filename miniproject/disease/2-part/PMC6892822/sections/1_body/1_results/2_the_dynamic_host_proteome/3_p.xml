 </sup> level. To study the relationship of mRNA and protein levels, we quantified mRNA levels at 8 h post infection by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). mRNA level differences at this time point showed good correlation with corresponding differences in de novo protein synthesis, particularly during the subsequent 8–12 h period (Fig.
