 </sup>. Thus, we would have expected the production of all viral proteins in the bird-adapted strain to be reduced to a similar extent. In contrast, we observed striking differences in the synthesis of individual proteins: HA was more abundantly produced by the avian strain throughout infection. In contrast, neuraminidase (NA) and particularly matrix protein M1 were stronger produced by the human strain at later stages. These differences in the production of individual viral proteins cannot be explained by the global difference in RdRP activity between strains. Thus, the avian strain displays dysregulated protein production relative to its human counterpart.
