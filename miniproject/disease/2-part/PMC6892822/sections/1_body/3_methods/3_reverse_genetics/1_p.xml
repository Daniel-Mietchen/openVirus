<p id="Par56">Recombinant IAVs derived from the A/Panama/2007/99 backbone were generated using an eight plasmid system for this strain based on pHW2000 by transfection of human HEK293T cells, followed by passage on MDCK type II cells. For the rescue of the Pan-Mal M reassortant virus, we used pHW2000-Mal M, whereas the Pan-AV virus was generated with pHW2000-Pan-AV together with seven plasmids encoding the other segments of human A/Panama/2007/99 virus.</p>
