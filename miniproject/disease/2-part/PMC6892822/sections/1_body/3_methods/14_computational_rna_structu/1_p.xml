We used the following settings for human-adapted strains: date range ≥2009, subtype H3N2, only complete genomes, host human; exclude laboratory strains and duplicate sequences and geographic grouping: South America, Europe, and Asia; for avian-adapted strains: date range ≥2009, only complete genomes, host: avian; exclude duplicate sequences and geographic grouping: Europe and Asia. These two sets of sequences were merged with the respective references sequence, that is, A/Panama/2007/1999—Pan (human) and A/Mallard/439/2004—Mal (mallard), and aligned using the program Muscle

 </sup> resulting in two MSAs, one for the human-adapted strains comprising 403 sequences and one MSA for the avian-adapted strains comprising 199 sequences. Both alignments are straightforward to establish based on the long open reading frame of the M1 isoform covering almost all of the M segment and on the overall high primary sequence conservation of the M segment. Evolutionary trees relating the sequences in either MSA were then derived using PhyML in conjunction with the HKY evolutionary model, which provided the best fit to the data [version v3.0
