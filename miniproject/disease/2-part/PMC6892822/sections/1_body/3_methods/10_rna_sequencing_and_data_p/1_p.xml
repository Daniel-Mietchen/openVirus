<p id="Par75">Total RNAs from A549 cells infected with Pan or Mal strain (infection conditions as described in the pAHA-SILAC experiment) were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Truseq Stranded mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared with 500 ng total RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina). The libraries were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina) and yielded in total 186 million 101-nt single-end reads. The sequencing reads were first subjected to adapter removal using flexbar with the following parameters: -x 6 -y 5 -u 2 -m 28 -ae RIGHT -at 2 -ao 1 -n 4 -j -z GZ

 </sup>. Reads mapped to the reference sequences of rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and miscRNAs (available from Ensembl and RepeatMasker annotation) using Bowtie2 (version 2.1.0) with default parameters (in --end-to-end &amp; --sensitive mode) were excluded. The remaining reads were then mapped to the human and Pan/Mal influenza A reference genome using Tophat2 (v2.0.10) with parameters: -N 3 --read-gap-length 2 --read-edit-dist 3 --min-anchor 6 --library-type fr-firststrand --segment-mismatches 2 --segment-length 26, and the guidance of RefSeq/Ensembl human gene structure and known viral gene annotation. Gene expression levels (RPKM) were estimated by Cufflinks (v2.2.1) with parameters: -u --library-type fr-firststrand --overhang-tolerance 6 --max-bundle-frags 500000000. Splice junction reads for various M transcripts were counted with customized Perl scripts. Splice isoforms were accepted that had &gt;500 read counts in both replicates. The same RNA-seq experimental and computational procedures were applied to samples that were transfected, as well as the Pan-AV and the control wild-type infection samples (Pan), except that HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina) was used and that libraries were sequenced in the 2 × 151-nt paired-end mode.
