<p id="Par76">To account for differences in transfection efficiency and sequencing depth from transfected samples, we calculated a scaling factor for NP, PA, PB1, and PB2 across all experiments based on their FPKM expression values. The splice junction read count was then divided by the average of the scaling factors.</p>
