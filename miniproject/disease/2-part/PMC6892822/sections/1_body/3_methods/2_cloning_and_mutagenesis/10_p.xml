<p id="Par47">This was followed by insertion into pHW2000 resulting in pHW2000-Mal M. The following point mutations were introduced into pHW2000-Pan M plasmid: A712G, G714A, A740G, T745C, A754G, G760A, G766A, and A772G, creating pHW2000-Pan-AV. The pHW2000-Mal M plasmid was mutated at the same positions to the respective sequence of the Pan strain (G712A, A714G, G740A, C745T, G754A, A760G, A766G, G772A, “pHW200-Mal M w/ Pan 707–779”). Mutations were introduced using the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (NEB) with pDEST26-Flag/HA-Pan w/ Mal 707–779 and the wild-type pHW2000-Pan M or pDEST26-Flag/HA-Mal w/ Pan 707–779 and the wild-type pHW2000-Mal M as templates for PCR. The following primers were used to amplify the insert:</p>
