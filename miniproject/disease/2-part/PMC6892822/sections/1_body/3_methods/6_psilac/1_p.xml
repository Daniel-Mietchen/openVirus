<p id="Par67">Cells were adapted to SILAC-light medium one day before the experiment and infected as described above using the indicated MOI. Prior to the pulse period, cells were maintained in PBS supplemented with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>/Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and 0.2% BSA for 30 min. Then, cells were pulse labeled with SILAC-M or SILAC-H medium for 6 h intervals, harvested, and then combined. Lysis was carried out in 125 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 1 h on a rotating wheel with subsequent centrifugation. The supernatant was precipitated according to Wessel and Flügge and precipitated proteins were subjected to in-solution digest. Proteins were denatured in 6 M urea/2 M thiourea, reduced, alkylated, and digested using Lys-C (3 h at 20 °C). Then, the digest solution was diluted 4× with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer and incubated with trypsin (Promega) for 16 h at 20 °C. Afterwards, samples were acidified and subjected to stage tip purification.
