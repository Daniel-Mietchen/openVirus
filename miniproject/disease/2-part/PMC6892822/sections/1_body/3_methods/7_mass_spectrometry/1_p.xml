<p id="Par68">Peptides from input and AHA-enriched samples were separated on a monolithic silica capillary column (MonoCap C18 High-Resolution 2000, GL Sciences), 0.1 mm internal diameter × 2000 mm length, at a flow rate of 300 nl/min with a 5 to 45% acetonitrile gradient on an EASY-nLC II system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 480 or 240 min gradient or on a EASY-nLC HPLC (Thermo Fisher) system by 2 or 4 h gradients with a 250 nl/min flow rate on a 15 cm column with an inner diameter of 75 μm packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ material (Dr. Maisch, GmbH). Peptides were ionized using an ESI source on a Q-Exactive, Q-Exactive Plus or a LTQ (linear trap quadrupole) Orbitrap Velos MS (all Thermo Fisher) in data-dependent mode. Q-Exactive and Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometers were operated in the data-dependent mode with a full scan in the Orbitrap, followed by top 10 MS/MS scans using higher-energy collision dissociation. The full scans were performed with in a
