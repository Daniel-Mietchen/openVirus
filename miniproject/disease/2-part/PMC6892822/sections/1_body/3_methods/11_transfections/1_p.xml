<p id="Par77">A549 cells were seeded on 6-well plates and transfected with 2.5 µg of expression constructs and Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and subjected to lysis and immunoblotting. For the RdRP reporter experiment, 10 cm dishes of HEK293T cells were transfected with vectors encoding NP (4.5 µg), PA (1.5 µg), PB1 (1.5 µg), or PB2 (1.5 µg) of strain WSN and either pHW2000-Mal M, pHW2000-Pan M pHW2000-Pan-AV, or pHW200-Mal M w/ Pan 707–779 (0.75 µg) using polyethyleneimine. Half of the sample was subjected to RNA isolation and RNA-sequencing 24 h post transfection.</p>
