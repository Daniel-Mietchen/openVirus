<p id="Par74">For quantification of pAHA-SILAC viral protein expression kinetics, we extracted all quantifications of peptide level evidences for each individual replicate from evidence.txt. Median logâ€‰2 ratios were then normalized to 0 for individual replicates. Comparative viral protein expression kinetics were based on Pan/Mal shared peptides. For each time period, replicate, and viral protein, the Pan/Mal SILAC protein ratio was calculated as the median of all SILAC peptide level ratios. Replicate SILAC protein ratios were averaged. For pSILAC, ratios for viral proteins were extracted from proteinGroups.txt. Non-normalized and log-2-transformed ratios were used.</p>
