<p>The number of vaccine candidates against ZIKV have increased recently and some of them have advanced to clinical trials. Three types of those vaccines that achieved phase 1 clinical trials are based on DNA, modified RNA and inactivated virus [

 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Current vaccine candidates, which are based on whole inactivated virus, or the complete E-protein may induce non-neutralizing and cross-reactive antibodies that could enhance disease of either ZIKV or DENV. Vaccines based on E-DIII are likely to circumvent this problem as E-DIII induces highly specific neutralizing antibodies and low levels of cross-reacting and enhancing antibodies. Indeed, a recent publication has demonstrated that Zika EDIII-domain fused to hepatitis B core Antigen (HBcAg) induces potent neutralizing antibodies in mice without enhancing DENV virus infection in vitro [
