<p>The cloning and production of ZIKV envelope protein domain III was published recently [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Briefly the E-DIII gene of 
 <italic>Zika virus</italic> Brazil-ZKV2015 strain was selected from GenBank, reference number KY785450.1, and sent to be synthesised by Geneart™. Afterward, the gene was cloned into a pET-21(+) (Novagen, Merck, Nottingham, UK) vector with a C-terminal His6-tag and a short C-terminal cysteine (GGC). The new construct (ZIKV E-DIII into pET-21(+)) was transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent 
 <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> bacteria and the protein was expressed by induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside into bacterial cultures. Subsequently, the 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> bacteria were collected by centrifugation, lysed and the inclusion bodies were washed and solubilized in 8 M urea, 100 mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM DTT, pH 8.0 and subsequently purified on a Ni Sepharose resin. The ZIKV ED-III protein, after purification, was refolded by dialysis. First dialysis was with 2 M urea, 50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.5 M arginine, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 10% glycerol, pH 8.5; followed with dialysis against 50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.5 M arginine, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 10% glycerol, pH 8.5, and finally dialysis with 50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 10% glycerol, pH 8.5. Pure protein was obtained by removing residual contamination with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a HiPrepTM16/60 SephacrylTMS166HR column (GE Healthcare, Glattbrugg Switzerland).
