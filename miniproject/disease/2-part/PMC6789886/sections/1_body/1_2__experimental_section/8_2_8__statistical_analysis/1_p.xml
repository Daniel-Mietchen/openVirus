<p>The statistical analysis was preformed using GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 for Max OS. When comparing two normally distributed groups a unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was used; when more than two groups were analysed, a Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test was performed, whereas normally distributed data were analysed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test. The value of 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant (* 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ** 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, *** 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.0001).
