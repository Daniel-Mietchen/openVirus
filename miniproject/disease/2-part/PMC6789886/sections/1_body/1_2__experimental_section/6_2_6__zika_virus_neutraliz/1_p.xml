<p>The test of neutralizing capacity of the antibody anti-ZIKV EDIII protein was performed using Vero cells (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CCL-81™, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (HI-FBS; Lonza Benelux BV, Breda, The Netherlands), supplemented with 0.75% sodium bicarbonate and 10 mM hepes buffer (Lonza) until a confluent monolayer was obtained. Serum from vaccinated mice was heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min to inactivate complement, and was serially dilutted two-fold, starting at 1:10 to 1:80. Subsequent incubation with an equal volume of Zika-Padova 1/201, Vero passage 2 [

 <sub>50</sub>/well. The serum-virus mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently added to a 100% confluent monolayer of Vero cells in CELLSTAR
 <sup>®</sup> 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5 days. Samples were read and a 100% reduction in cytopathic effect (CPE) as compared to the serum-negative control was used for the determination of neutralization. The serum samples were tested in two independent experiments.
