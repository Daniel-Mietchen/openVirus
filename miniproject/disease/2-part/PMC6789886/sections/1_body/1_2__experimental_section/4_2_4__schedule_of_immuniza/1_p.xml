<p>For assessment of vaccine immunogenicity, five female BALB/c inbred mice per group were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 20 µg (50 μL) per mouse of CuMVttVLP-EDIII vaccine, CuMVttVLP-EDIII formulated with DOPS adjuvant, only E-DIII protein diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or only PBS as a negative control. The vaccinations were performed three times, with 21 days between each injection. Blood samples were collected by tail vein puncture before each vaccination, on Days 0, 21, 42 and 63, to check the antibody response. At the end of each experiment all mice were humanely sacrificed by an approved Schedule 1 method (cervical dislocation). Two independent experiments with five female mice per arm were performed, totalizing 10 mice per group.</p>
