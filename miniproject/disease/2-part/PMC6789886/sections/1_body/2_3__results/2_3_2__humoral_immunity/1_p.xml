<p>To assess the humoral immune response induced by the vaccine candidate, mice were immunized 3 times on day 0, 21 and 42 with EDIII alone, CuMVtt-EDIII or CuMVtt-EDIII formulated in DOPS. Antibody production was assessed by ELISA using the sera collected three weeks after the prime vaccination (Day 21), three weeks after the first boost (Day 42) and three weeks after the second boost (Day 63). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the best vaccine formulation was CuMVtt-EDIII + DOPS that induced the highest antibody response followed by CuMVtt-EDIII formulated in PBS, and EDIII alone. Both CuMVtt-EDIII formulations were able to induce strong IgG responses after a single immunization.
