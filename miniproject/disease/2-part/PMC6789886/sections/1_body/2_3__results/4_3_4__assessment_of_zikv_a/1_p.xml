<p>Enhanced infection due to cross-reactive antibodies is well characterized for DENV. DENV-2 is considered to be the most virulent DENV serotype with a genetically diverse population and is most frequently associated with dengue epidemics worldwide. More importantly, most of the epidemics of dengue haemorrhagic fever have been associated with DENV-2 instead of the other serotypes. Therefore, the use of DENV-2 served as an excellent model for this study [
 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As ZIKV-induced antibodies may cross-react with DENV, a key feature of a ZIKV vaccine candidate is that it must not induce antibodies that enhance DENV infection. As described in the schematic figure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,b) representing a specific response against a virus, when it has been completely opsonised by neutralizing antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f006">Figure 6</xref>a), the phagocytic cells containing Fcy receptor will bind the Fc part of the antibody and internalise the IgG complexed virus. After internalisation, phagolysosomes will be formed and will destroy the virus. However, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f006">Figure 6</xref>b, when ZIKV is recognised by non-neutralizing antibodies, the antibody binding will not be able to neutralise the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>, but instead it will help the viral uptake without destruction via phagolysosomes, allowing therefore the cellular infection. Consequently, the virus can replicate to higher levels, likely causing increased disease. Therefore, to assess whether the vaccine candidate developed here would enhance DENV-infection in vitro, we performed an ADE-test for the vaccine-induced antibodies using DENV-2. To this end we used the THP-1 monocytic cell line that are derived from acute monocyte leukemic patients [
 <xref rid="B44-vaccines-07-00072" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and has been extensively applied to assess the mechanism of ADE with DENV-2 infection. Part of the THP-1 cells were stimulated to obtain a mature macrophage-like state. Serial dilution of the sera, obtained from mice three weeks after the third vaccination (Day 63), were made and both unstimulated and stimulated cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of DENV-2/NGC strain (P7). As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00072-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,d, the qRT-PCR results demonstrate that ZIKV specific serum antibodies induced by vaccination did not promote the synthesis of more DENV RNA as measured in the supernatants. Under none of the conditions tested (stimulated or unstimulated THP-1 cells), an enhancement of infection and viral replication was measured. When comparing the positive control with all other groups, Negative control, CuMVtt-EDIII or CuMVtt-EDIII + DOPS, it showed to be highly significant (
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.0001). Therefore, in addition to inducing virus-neutralizing antibodies, this vaccine-candidate also passed the test of not inducing ADE antibodies.
