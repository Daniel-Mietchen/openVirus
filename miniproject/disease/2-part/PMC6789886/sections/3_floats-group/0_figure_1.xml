  <p>Summarizes the vaccine design and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. (
   <bold>a</bold>) The conjugation of Zika virus E-DIII protein was done by modifying the CuMVttVLP with a chemical crosslinker (SMPH) and binding it to a modified protein with sulphydryl groups (-SH), as described in the Methods section “Vaccine formulation: coupling CuMVttVLP with E-DIII and mix with dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (DOPS)”. The AFM imaging was carried out by employing Nanosurf FlexAFM scan head (100 μm scan range) with C3000 controller using PPP-NCHAuD cantilevers (Nanosensors) in dynamic mode and processed using Gwyddion software. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Yellow samples show the CuMVVLP alone, without any protein attached, and (
   <bold>c</bold>) the following image shows a single particle with E-DIII proteins attached to it. The colour scale was adjusted to visually enhance smaller objects.
