  <p>A neutralization test was conducted to evaluate the ability of a ZIKV-specific antibodies to prevent cpe. Cells infected with ZIKV pre-incubated with sera from immunized mice showed no CPA (positive serum + virus). Cytopathic effect (CPE) was seen in serum without ZIKV specific antibodies (Negative serum + Virus), comparable to cultures infected only with ZIKV (Virus control). The panel “Cell control” shows uninfected cells.</p>
