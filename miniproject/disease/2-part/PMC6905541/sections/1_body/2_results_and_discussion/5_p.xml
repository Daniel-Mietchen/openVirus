<p>Another noteworthy fact is that 2019 cases presented different clinical-epidemiological characteristics in contrast with 2008´s. During the first semester of 2008, 209,309 cases were confirmed, including 10947 hospitalizations and 230 deceases, affecting mainly the age group of children under 15 years old [

During the same period by 2019, 27,913 probable dengue cases were notified in the state of Rio de Janeiro, of which 59.6% were confirmed clinical and laboratory. Only 267 of them required hospitalization, and no deceases have been yet reported. Most cases occurred in young adults between 20 and 49 years old, with no clear predominance of any gender [
