<p>Phylogenetic analysis of SFTSV strains isolated to date suggest that 6 genotypes (A to F) circulate in East Asia, and that genotype reassortment is commonly detected. The genotyping roughly correlates phylogeographically, although the nomenclature in the current literature is not consistently applied. Genotypes A, B, D, and F have been isolated in South Korea, genotypes B and E in Japan, and all genotypes have been isolated in China (
