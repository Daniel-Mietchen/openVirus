<p>Here, we describe the evaluation of 2 live-attenuated vaccine candidates against SFTSV, based on the wild type-derived rHB29 strain. We demonstrate the immunogenicity of the viruses following infection and show prior immunization induces protection against a lethal SFTSV infection in a ferret challenge model. In our previous study, we demonstrate that the aged ferret could reproduce SFTS-like pathogenesis following infection and that the resulting disease fully recapitulates the clinical manifestations of human SFTSV infections. We also show IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is important for SFTSV pathogenesis through transcriptomic analysis. These data suggest that our immune-competent age-dependent ferret model will be useful for the development of anti-SFTSV therapies and vaccine development (

 <sub>102</sub>A and rHB2912aaNSs) have reduced pathogenicity in the ferret and infected animals did not display any SFTS-like clinical disease in comparison to animals infected with the CB8/2016 strain (genotype D). It is noteworthy that virus RNA copy number in sera and target organs of rHB2912aaNSs-infected ferrets were significantly lower than those of the rHB29-infected ferrets. However, infected ferrets elicited a strong IgG and a neutralizing antibody response following a single immunization with rHB2912aaNSs. Further, rHB2912aaNSs was only detected from 4 to 6 d p.i. in the liver and spleens of infected animals, which are important immune defenses of the body. Therefore, we hypothesize that the low levels of viral RNA detected in the sera and tissues of rHB2912aaNSs-infected ferrets result in sufficient antigen presentation in the spleen or liver to induce a strong, protective, antibody response from a single dose of virus.
