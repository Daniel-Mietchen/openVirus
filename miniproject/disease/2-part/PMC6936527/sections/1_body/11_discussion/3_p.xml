<p>Safety is a major consideration for live-attenuated virus vaccines. Concerns regarding a reversion to virulence of the attenuated virus by genetic drift are often raised. However, as rHB2912aaNSs contains a 96% deletion of the NSs ORF rather than individual residue mutations, there is minimal chance of virus reversion to wild type through the acquisition of the deleted gene sequences during passage. When we conducted serial passaging of rHB2912aaNSs virus in vitro and in vivo, no revertant virus was detected during multiple sequential passage (up to 6 times in ferrets), demonstrating the genetic stability and safety of this vaccine candidate. For rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A, we did not detect a revertant mutation in cell culture experiments. However, its genetic stability during in vivo passaging remains to be studied. Genetic segment reassortment of closely related viruses with our vaccine candidates remains theoretically possible and reassortment is well documented among the 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> and SFTS viruses (
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). However, any genetic reassortment with rHB2912aaNSs would result in either an attenuated virus containing the rHB2912aaNSs-derived S RNA segment or the initial parental viruses.
