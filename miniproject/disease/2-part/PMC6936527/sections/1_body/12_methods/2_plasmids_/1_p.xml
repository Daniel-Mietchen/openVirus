<p>Plasmids for the recovery of SFTSV have been described previously (
 <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). pTM1-HB29ppL and pTM1-HB29N contain the SFTSV HB29 L and N ORFs under the control of T7 promoter and encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site sequence; pTVT7-HB29S, pTVT7- HB29M, and pTVT7-HB29ppL contain full-length complementary DNAs to the SFTSV strain HB29 antigenome segments flanked by T7 promoter and hepatitis delta ribozyme sequences. Plasmid pTVT7-HB29S12aaNSs, which was previously described (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), contains an internal deletion in the coding region of NSs (Î”2-282), leaving the methionine and last 11 amino acids of the NSs ORF intact. The plasmid was used in the recovery of rHB2912aaNSs. Plasmids used to generate rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A were described in previous work (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). All cDNA constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Recombinant viruses were recovered from cDNA plasmid transfection as previously described (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).
