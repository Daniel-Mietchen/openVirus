<p>Total RNA from infected ferret sera and organ tissues was extracted using TRIzol LS Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cDNA was generated by reverse transcription with specific (SFTSV-S) and random (Takara) primers using the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Enzynomics). Viral copy numbers were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using an S segment-based SFTSV-specific primer set: forward primer (SFTSV-S-F), gcagttggaatcaggga; and reverse primer (SFTSV-S-R), cccacttggacatgtgct. Copy numbers were calculated as a ratio with respect to the standard control as previously described (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and real-time PCR reactions were performed using a SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The limit of detection of qRT-PCR was 2 RNA genome copies per reaction.
