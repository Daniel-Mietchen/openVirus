<p>Ferrets immunized with recombinant viruses or PBS-preimmunized control animals were challenged i.m. with 10
 <sup>7.6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of CB1/2014 strain (0.5 mL in the outside of each thigh of both legs). Throughout the ferret challenge studies, we used a TCID
 <sub>50</sub> dose (∼10
 <sup>7.6</sup>) of SFTSV. This dose is known to cause 100% fatality rate in infected ferrets, as seen in our recent study (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Survival was monitored for 14 d after lethal SFTSV challenge with CB1/2014. Sera were collected from each ferret at 2-d intervals after infection and peripheral virus RNA copy numbers were determined. Hematological parameters were analyzed using EDTA-treated whole-blood samples from infected animals using the Celltac hematology analyzer (MEK-6550J/K; Nihon Kohden). Biochemical parameters of serum from infected animals were determined using Celltac α (MEK-6550; Nihon Kohden).
