<p>SFTSV strains used in this study were a recombinant derivative of the Hubei-29 strain generated by reverse genetics (rHB29). This sequence is based on a plaque-purified stock called Hubei 29pp (HB29pp) provided by Amy Lambert (CDC Arbovirus Diseases Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Fort Collins, CO) (
