<p>To investigate the immunogenicity of the recombinant viruses, we examined the anti-SFTSV humoral immune responses in infected ferrets. A nucleocapsid protein (N)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed with serially diluted ferret sera collected at 0, 8, 14, and 58 d p.i. (

 </xref>). Sera from rHB29-infected ferrets showed an increase in optical density (OD) values measured at day 8 and day 14 p.i.. It is noteworthy that although the OD values recorded in sera from rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A- and rHB2912aaNSs-infected ferrets at 8 d p.i. were lower than that of parental rHB29-infected group, both groups showed significantly increased OD values (compared to day 0 p.i.) by 14 d p.i. The antibody responses seen may be correlated with the relatively low virus RNA detected in sera and tissues of rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A- or rHB2912aaNSs-infected ferrets. At 14 d p.i., OD values of 1.0 were achieved with dilutions of 7.63, 7.10, or 4.11 (10log
 <sub>2</sub>) of rHB29-infected (

 </xref>), or rHB2912aaNSs-infected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>) animal sera, respectively. These data demonstrate that a reduced humoral immune response was initiated in the NSs-deletant virus-infected animals. OD signals were still detectable when fresh serially diluted serum samples were assayed at 58 d (approximately 8 wk) p.i. prior to the administration of a lethal virus challenge with CB1/2014.
