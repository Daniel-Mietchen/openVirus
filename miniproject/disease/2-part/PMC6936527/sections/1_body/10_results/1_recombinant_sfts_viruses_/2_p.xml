<p>Groups of 12 ferrets were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 2 wild-type viruses: The first, a Korean strain of SFTSV (CB8/2016;

The results showed that although rHB29-infected animals showed slightly increased fever and weight loss over time, significant weight loss and fever were not observed in animals infected with rHB29 or either of the NSs-mutant viruses. Animals infected with the CB8/2016 strain recorded an average weight loss of 12% by 8 d p.i. (
