<p>We next wanted to examine whether a single prior infection of the ferrets with either rHB29, rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A, or rHB2912aaNSs conferred protective immunity. At 8 wk p.i., the surviving animals were challenged with the genotype B, CB1/2014 strain of SFTSV. Six animals in each group were challenged i.m. with 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> plaque-forming units (PFUs) and their survival, weight change, temperature, and viral RNA loads were measured for 12 d. At 5 d postchallenge (p.c.), 3 animals were killed per group to analyze tissue tropism and assess viral dissemination by qRT-PCR (

 <sub>102</sub>A, or rHB2912aaNSs survived the lethal challenge with CB1/2014, whereas all challenge virus only controls died by 10 d p.i. (

  <italic>D</italic>–

 </xref>). Platelet counts in the rHB29- or rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A-immunized ferrets rose from a mean count of 518 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL on day 0 to 792 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL on day 8 following CB1/2014 challenge (

  <italic>D</italic> and 
  <italic>E</italic>
 </xref>), whereas platelet counts remained stable in the rHB2912aaNSs-immunized, CB1/2014-challenged ferrets throughout the course of infection (

 </xref>). Platelet counts in the CB1/2014-infected challenge only group were reduced from day 4 p.c. and continued to decrease until the cessation of the experiment (
