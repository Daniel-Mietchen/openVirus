<p>To further demonstrate the dissemination of rHB29, rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A, and rHB2912aaNSs in infected ferrets, 3 ferrets of each group were killed at days 4 and 6 p.i., and viral RNA copy numbers in lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and intestines were assessed by qRT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). In rHB29-infected animals, viral RNA was detectable at low levels in all tissues with the exception of intestine. Peak virus copy number (2.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral copies/g) was recorded in the spleen at day 6 p.i. (

 <sub>102</sub>A-infected animals (

  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>). This result was expected as these viruses only differ by one amino acid within the NSs ORF (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). When tissues from ferrets infected with rHB2912aaNSs were analyzed, a difference in virus tissue distribution was noted. rHB2912aaNSs was only detected in the liver and spleen of infected animals (1.29 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral copies/g), peaking at 4 d p.i. Viral genome copy numbers detected in the lung, kidney, and intestines of these animals were recorded at or just above the limit of detection (
