<p>Members of the 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family contain a trisegmented single-stranded RNA genome of negative or ambisense polarity, encoding 5 or 6 proteins (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The 3 genomic RNA segments are designated the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. The L segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the M segment encodes the 2 viral envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N) and a nonstructural protein (NSs) in an ambisense manner (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
