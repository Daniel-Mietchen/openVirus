<p>The nonstructural protein (NSs) of phenuiviruses, in particular that of SFTSV, is a well-characterized innate immune antagonist and virulence factor (

 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and SFTSV-PA (herein known as rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A) (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), contain a carboxyl-terminal truncated short 12 amino acid peptide sequence derived from the NSs open-reading frame (ORF) or have a single point mutation in the NSs coding sequence from proline to alanine at position 102, respectively. Both viruses demonstrated an inability to antagonize mammalian innate immune responses to viral infection in vitro. Additionally, rHB29NSsP
 <sub>102</sub>A was shown to be attenuated in vivo in C57BL/6 wild-type mice that had been pretreated with an anti-IFN-α/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1)-blocking antibody prior to infection (
