SFTS disease has been reported throughout East Asia since 2009 and is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia and has a 12 to 30% case fatality rate. Due to the recent emergence of SFTSV, there has been little time to conduct research into preventative measures aimed at combatting the virus. SFTSV is listed as one of the World Health Organization&#x02019;s Prioritized Pathogens for research into antiviral therapeutics and vaccine development. Here, we report 2 attenuated recombinant SFTS viruses that induce a humoral immune response in immunized ferrets and confer complete cross-genotype protection to lethal challenge. Animals infected with rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A or rHB2912aaNSs (both genotype D) had a reduced viral load in both serum and tissues and presented without high fever, thrombocytopenia, or mortality associated with infection. rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A- or rHB2912aaNSs-immunized animals developed a robust anti-SFTSV immune response against cross-genotype isolates of SFTSV. This immune response was capable of neutralizing live virus in a focus-reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and was 100% protective against a cross-genotype lethal challenge with the CB1/2014 strain of SFTSV (genotype B). Thus, using our midsized, aged ferret infection model, we demonstrate 2 live attenuated vaccine candidates against the emerging pathogen SFTSV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SFTS</kwd><kwd>emerging banyangvirus</kwd><kwd>live attenuated vaccine</kwd><kwd>ferret model</kwd><kwd>bunyavirus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100003625</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">HI15C2817</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Kwang-Min Yu</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Su-Jin Park</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Min-Ah Yu</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Young-Il Kim</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Young Ki Choi</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100003625</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">HG18C0029</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Kwang-Min Yu</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Su-Jin Park</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Min-Ah Yu</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Young-Il Kim</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Young Ki Choi</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">Wellcome<named-content content-type="funder-id">100010269</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">210462/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Benjamin Brennan</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4">Wellcome<named-content content-type="funder-id">100010269</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp4">099220/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Benjamin Brennan</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs5"><funding-source id="sp5">HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp5">AI116585</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Younho Choi</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Jae Jung</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs6"><funding-source id="sp6">HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp6">AI129496</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Younho Choi</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Jae Jung</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs7"><funding-source id="sp7">HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp7">AI40718</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Younho Choi</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Jae Jung</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs8"><funding-source id="sp8">HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp8">AI140705</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Younho Choi</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Jae Jung</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) is an emerging viral pathogen classified within the <italic>Huaiyangshan banyangvirus</italic> species, <italic>Banyangvirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

SFTSV infection in humans is believed to be predominantly mediated through the bite of a virus-infected tick. However, in 2012, human-to-human transmission of SFTSV was described through contact with, or exposure to, blood of SFTS index patients (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Subsequent reported human-to-human transmissions of SFTSV are thought to have occurred among families, residents of villages where patients lived, and even in hospital settings (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).

To date, there have been &#x0223c;8,500 reported cases of SFTS disease in China, more than 100 laboratory confirmed cases in both South Korea (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and Japan (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and 2 cases reported in Vietnam (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Members of the <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family contain a trisegmented single-stranded RNA genome of negative or ambisense polarity, encoding 5 or 6 proteins (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The 3 genomic RNA segments are designated the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments.

The genotyping roughly correlates phylogeographically, although the nomenclature in the current literature is not consistently applied. Genotypes A, B, D, and F have been isolated in South Korea, genotypes B and E in Japan, and all genotypes have been isolated in China (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The nonstructural protein (NSs) of phenuiviruses, in particular that of SFTSV, is a well-characterized innate immune antagonist and virulence factor (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). NSs acts as an antagonist to IFN signaling to evade the expression of antiviral genes (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Previously, we have described 2 viruses that are unable to interact with mammalian innate immune pathways such as the IFN-&#x003b2; induction and signaling cascades and the TPL2 signaling pathway. These viruses, rHB2912aaNSs (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and SFTSV-PA (herein known as rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A) (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), contain a carboxyl-terminal truncated short 12 amino acid peptide sequence derived from the NSs open-reading frame (ORF) or have a single point mutation in the NSs coding sequence from proline to alanine at position 102, respectively. Both viruses demonstrated an inability to antagonize mammalian innate immune responses to viral infection in vitro. Additionally, rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A was shown to be attenuated in vivo in C57BL/6 wild-type mice that had been pretreated with an anti-IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor 1 (IFNAR1)-blocking antibody prior to infection (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Many rodent models for SFTSV have been developed in recent years, but no one model completely recapitulated the SFTS disease phenotype seen in human cases (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Infection with SFTSV is only lethal to newborn rodents or genetically modified immunocompromised animals (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>); even experimentally infected Rhesus macaques (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and Cynomolgus macaques (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) do not develop a lethal disease. Recently, we described an immunocompetent age-dependent ferret model for SFTSV that recapitulated all SFTS disease pathologies, as evidenced by high viral loads in serum and tissues, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and a 93% mortality rate (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>Since the discovery of the virus, there has been minimal work published on the development of antiviral therapies or vaccine candidates, and there is currently no commercially available vaccine to prevent SFTSV. Thus, it is of high priority to develop and evaluate potential vaccines to control and halt the spread of this rapidly emerging infectious agent. Work has focused on a recombinant NSs protein vaccine (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), a DNA vaccine based on plasmids expressing the N or NSs proteins (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) or a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine candidate expressing the SFTSV Gn/Gc glycoproteins (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). One therapeutic agent has also been developed through the characterization of an antibody isolated from an infected patient. Here, the authors demonstrated that this antibody conferred protection to a lethal SFTSV challenge (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we bring together previously developed recombinant viruses and the newly described ferret model of infection to assess the efficacy of these viruses as live attenuated vaccine candidates. We show that while infection with a genotype D Korean strain of SFTSV (CB8/2016) was lethal in our ferret model, infection of the animals with recombinant viruses, including a wild-type derived recombinant Chinese isolate (rHB29; genotype D) resulted in a mild self-resolving infection devoid of fever. Infected animals experienced no thrombocytopenia, had reduced viral RNA levels in both serum and tissues and all animals survived infection. These animals developed a robust anti-SFTSV humoral immune response against homologous and heterologous genotypes of SFTSV by 14 d post inoculation and this immune response was 100% protective against a cross-genotype lethal challenge with the CB1/2014 strain (genotype B). Further, rHB2912aaNSs showed no reversion to wild type during serial passage in vitro and in vivo. It is of note, that both CB8/2016 and HB29 are genotype D wild-type viruses isolated from infected patients. However, as demonstrated, HB29 is less virulent in our ferret model of infection. The further deletion or mutation of the NSs ORF as seen in rHB2912aaNSs or rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A respectively, further attenuates these viruses (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we demonstrate genetically stable, safe, live attenuated vaccine candidates against the emerging pathogen SFTSV.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>Recombinant SFTS Viruses Do Not Induce Lethal Disease in a Ferret Model.</title><p>We recently described an age-dependent ferret model for SFTS disease where infected animals demonstrated reduced white blood cell counts, severe thrombocytopenia, high fever and a high mortality rate (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).

However, there are many hurdles that must be overcome to successfully produce a useable vaccine, including the establishment of reliable vaccine efficacy testing methods. Firstly, the creation of proper animal infection models will be necessary to evaluate vaccine efficacy in vivo. To date, only a few animal models, such as type I IFN-deficient (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), newborn (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), or mitomycin-treated mice (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), can recapitulate the fatal illness seen in human patients following SFTSV infection. However, it should be noted that type-I IFN-deficient and mitomycin-treated mouse models are both immunosuppressed systems. This means they cannot deliver the normal immune response against virus infection. Hence, a model for SFTSV infection with a normal immune status is essential to reliably test candidate vaccine efficacies. Secondly, a standard neutralization testing method will be needed to evaluate the cross-protective efficacy of novel vaccines. Recently, serum neutralizing antibody-based testing methods were reported (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>); however, the cross-reactivity of these antibodies with different SFTSV genotypes still needs to be evaluated to define a standard strain to be used in vaccine production.</p><p>Here, we describe the evaluation of 2 live-attenuated vaccine candidates against SFTSV, based on the wild type-derived rHB29 strain. We demonstrate the immunogenicity of the viruses following infection and show prior immunization induces protection against a lethal SFTSV infection in a ferret challenge model. In our previous study, we demonstrate that the aged ferret could reproduce SFTS-like pathogenesis following infection and that the resulting disease fully recapitulates the clinical manifestations of human SFTSV infections. We also show IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is important for SFTSV pathogenesis through transcriptomic analysis. These data suggest that our immune-competent age-dependent ferret model will be useful for the development of anti-SFTSV therapies and vaccine development (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Our results show that both NSs-mutant viruses (rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A and rHB2912aaNSs) have reduced pathogenicity in the ferret and infected animals did not display any SFTS-like clinical disease in comparison to animals infected with the CB8/2016 strain (genotype D). It is noteworthy that virus RNA copy number in sera and target organs of rHB2912aaNSs-infected ferrets were significantly lower than those of the rHB29-infected ferrets. However, infected ferrets elicited a strong IgG and a neutralizing antibody response following a single immunization with rHB2912aaNSs. Further, rHB2912aaNSs was only detected from 4 to 6 d p.i. in the liver and spleens of infected animals, which are important immune defenses of the body. Therefore, we hypothesize that the low levels of viral RNA detected in the sera and tissues of rHB2912aaNSs-infected ferrets result in sufficient antigen presentation in the spleen or liver to induce a strong, protective, antibody response from a single dose of virus.</p><p>Safety is a major consideration for live-attenuated virus vaccines. Concerns regarding a reversion to virulence of the attenuated virus by genetic drift are often raised. However, as rHB2912aaNSs contains a 96% deletion of the NSs ORF rather than individual residue mutations, there is minimal chance of virus reversion to wild type through the acquisition of the deleted gene sequences during passage. When we conducted serial passaging of rHB2912aaNSs virus in vitro and in vivo, no revertant virus was detected during multiple sequential passage (up to 6 times in ferrets), demonstrating the genetic stability and safety of this vaccine candidate. For rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A, we did not detect a revertant mutation in cell culture experiments. However, its genetic stability during in vivo passaging remains to be studied. Genetic segment reassortment of closely related viruses with our vaccine candidates remains theoretically possible and reassortment is well documented among the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> and SFTS viruses (<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). However, any genetic reassortment with rHB2912aaNSs would result in either an attenuated virus containing the rHB2912aaNSs-derived S RNA segment or the initial parental viruses.</p><p>Recently, genetic and phylogenetic analysis of SFTS viruses revealed that SFTSV could be grouped into at least 6 different genotypes referred to as genotypes A to F and that the prevalence of SFTSV genotypes are varied dependent on country (<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Since the recombinant SFTS viruses described herein belonged to genotype D, the immunized ferrets were subsequently infected with a known lethal dose of a heterologous genotype B strain (CB1/2014) to evaluate cross-protective efficacy. These data clearly demonstrate that a single immunization of rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A or rHB2912aaNSs is sufficient to confer heterologous-genotype protection in an aged ferret model when challenged with a lethal dose of the virulent strain of SFTSV, CB1/2014. Further, this protective effect was evidenced by a lack of clinical manifestations, an absence of thrombocytopenia and reduced virus replication and dissemination to the surrounding tissues of infected animals.</p><p>Further research will need to be undertaken into the development of new reverse-genetics systems to fully understand the differences noted in the in vivo virulence observed between the Korean-derived isolates (CB1/2014 and CB8/2016) and the Chinese isolate (HB29) in our ferret model. The sequence of the recombinant rHB29 virus is based on a strain of SFTSV isolated from a patient described in Yu et al. (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, there are several differences between the viral isolates at the amino acid level in key proteins such as the virulence factor and innate immune antagonist NSs. The NSs protein of HB29 is only 96.6 and 98.0% similar to the NSs of CB1/2014 or CB8/2016, respectively. Our own experimental data has demonstrated a single point mutation (such as P<sub>102</sub>A) within NSs can dramatically reduce virulence of a virus (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). There is a total of 29 or 50 amino acid substitutions between HB29 and CB8/2016 or CB1/2014, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1914704116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>). Therefore, it is possible that any of the amino acid changes between the different isolates could result in the attenuated phenotype observed in HB29-infected ferrets. Future work should aim to identify and pinpoint the amino acid changes that increase the pathogenicity of the Korean isolates.</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of percentage amino acid sequence identities of strains used in this study to the published sequence of HB29 (AJD86038 [L], AJD86039 [M], AJD86041 [NSs], AJD86040 [N])</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">Genotype</td><td rowspan="2" align="center" colspan="1">Strain</td><td colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1">Amino acid sequence identity, %</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">L (RdRp)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M (Gn/Gc)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S (N)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S (NSs)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype B</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CB1/2014</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">99.1</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">97.7</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.8</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">96.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype D</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CB8/2016</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">99.4</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.5</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">99.6</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In conclusion, we evaluated 2 recombinant HB29 derived live-attenuated SFTSV vaccine candidates and demonstrated their immunogenicity and protective efficacy using a lethal model for SFTSV in ferrets. rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A or rHB2912aaNSs virus infection showed significantly reduced pathogenicity in the aged ferrets compared with the homologous genotype CB8/2016 strain (genotype D). Both viruses induced strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses against homologous and heterologous SFTSV strains. In particular, we found that following a single immunization with rHB29NSsP<sub>102</sub>A or rHB2912aaNSs ferrets were completely protected from lethal SFTSV challenge. No virus RNA was detectable in the serum or organs of preimmunized animals that had been challenged with CB1/2014 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>), demonstrating the induction of sterilizing immunity. This suggests that a live attenuated vaccine platform might represent a suitable vaccine strategy against SFTSV due to its ability to induce a wider range of immune response types. It was recently reported that a live attenuated rVSV-based vaccine expressing the SFTSV Gn/Gc glycoproteins can elicit protection against SFTSV in immunocompromised IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>); however, our current study represents a substantial contribution toward the development of an effective preventive vaccine for SFTS. Our live attenuated vaccines induced complete protection against lethal SFTSV challenge in an immunocompetent middle-sized animal model that exhibits clinical manifestations seen in SFTS patients (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Given the genetic diversity of SFTSV in nature, few prior studies have examined the cross-protective immunity against heterologous SFTSV genotype infections; thus, our present study provides valuable insights into the design of preventive vaccines against SFTSV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Cells and Viruses.</title><p>Vero E6 cell line (commonly used cell line originally obtained from European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures, previously described in ref. <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).
