<p>Differentiation between a poliomyelitis-like process and other disease processes like GBS can be difficult. Paying attention to the nuances of the symptoms and test results can be very important in distinguishing between them. First, the timing of the symptoms differs with GBS, occurring weeks after an acute infection. West Nile myelitis occurs more frequently during the acute infection. Fever and leukocytosis are commonly present in West Nile myelitis, while in GBS it is not. The distribution of the paralysis also differs, with symmetrical paralysis presenting in GBS and asymmetrical paralysis and sometimes monoplegia evident in West Nile myelitis. Bowel and bladder dysregulation are also commonly seen in West Nile myelitis, while in GBS it is usually not. As previously stated, West Nile myelitis often causes encephalopathy, which is not seen in GBS. Electrodiagnostic studies in West Nile myelitis show significantly decreased or absent motor function from likely involved anterior horn cells, while GBS shows slowing or blocking of the nerve conduction from demyelination. Finally, analysis of the CSF can show both conditions having elevated protein, but West Nile myelitis can have a pleocytosis while GBS does not [
