<p>Up to 75% of cases of WNV myelitis present with encephalitis, which was not present in our patient [
 <xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pathogenically, it presents similarly to poliomyelitis. WNV myelitis uniquely presents with asymmetric areflexic or hyporeflexic weakness with a preserved sensory response. These findings are consistent with anterior horn demyelination, and WNV almost exclusively involves the anterior horn. Thus, these findings should elevate the index of suspicion [
 <xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Epidemiologically, neuroinvasive diseases are also less common in young and middle-aged adults [
 <xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The main diagnostic differential is GBS, which presents with a viral prodrome with subsequent flaccid paralysis without CSF pleocytosis. Early identification of disease allows for monitoring for complications such as respiratory failure [
