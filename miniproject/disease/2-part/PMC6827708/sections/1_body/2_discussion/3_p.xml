<p>WNV belongs to the flavivirus genus and was first isolated in Uganda in 1937 [

Up to 80% of patients who contract WNV can be asymptotic. A minority of patients develop West Nile fever, which is accompanied by fever, fatigue, body aches, nausea, vomiting, rash on the trunk, and lymphadenopathy. An even rarer presentation results in neuroinvasive diseases. This devastating complication can include encephalitis, meningitis, and/or West Nile myelitis with symptoms consisting of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, bowel and bladder disruptions, and flaccid paralysis [
