<p>The association of obesity with various viral infections has always faced a “chicken or egg” disputation [

 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Do viral infections trigger the infectobesity first, or does obesity lead to higher susceptibility to viral infections that manifest the comorbidity? As described above, we reinforced the reciprocal causality of viral infections and obesity underlying the infectobesity [
 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. First, multiple viruses and VLAs have been epidemiologically associated with obesity and some with identified mechanisms in adipogenic or lipogenic induction (

 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As more infectious agents beyond viruses are associated with obesity, we propose an immuno-pathological explanation about pathogenic persistence and subverted immune deviation (such as prolonged IFN-α response irritated during chronic viral infections) is a theme underlying viral infectobesity [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00726-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the intrinsic gut IFN-β response and early mucosal IFN-λ response to acute viral infections generally promote less inflammation and cause negligible tissue damage [

 <xref rid="B75-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, the later and particularly prolonged type I IFN response during the viral persistence entails a systemic inflammatory response in terms of the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-18 in myeloid cells and TNF-α from monocytic cells) and activation of inflammatory lineages of macrophages, NK cells, and hepatic T cells [

 <xref rid="B107-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Systemic and adipose tissue-specific meta-inflammation, manifested by these inflammatory cytokines and immune cells, are exaggerated by the immune responses induced by both viral persistence and some obesogens, which sustain obesogenesis and complicate into infectobesity [
