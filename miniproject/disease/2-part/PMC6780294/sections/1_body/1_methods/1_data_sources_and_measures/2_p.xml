<p>The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) provided influenza virus surveillance data through the Korea Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Surveillance System (KINRESS) [
 <xref rid="b14-jpmph-52-5-308" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thirty-six to 90 representative institutes reported tested and positive samples for the following subtypes of influenza virus: influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B virus. Since the KCDC started separate monitoring of each influenza virus type in 2009, we used data from 2009 to 2016 in our models. Since the influenza surveillance system is organized by season globally, we structured each season to extend from the 36th week of one year to the 35th week of the next year.
