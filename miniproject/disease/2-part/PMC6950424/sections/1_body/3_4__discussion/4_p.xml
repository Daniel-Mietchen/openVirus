<p>The NP and PB2 have been found to have a major role in blocking the antiviral effect of murine Mx1 [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As previously reported, the interaction between PB2 and PB1 is not influenced by the presence of the Mx1 protein. Mx1 inhibits the interaction between PB2 and NP, probably leaving the ternary RdRp complex intact, suggesting that Mx1 inhibits the interaction between the RdRp and the NP protein in vRNP complexes [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our results helped to explain how eqMx1 could block viral replication by interacting with viral NPs, thus blocking NP-PB2 interaction and explaining how a single mutation could affect the binding of two proteins.
