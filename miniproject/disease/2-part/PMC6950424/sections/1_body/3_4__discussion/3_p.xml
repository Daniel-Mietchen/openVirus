<p>NP is known as a key module of the vRNP complex and is indispensable for virus replication. NP is the most conserved protein within IAV viral proteins and was identified as a determinant of viral sensitivity towards Mx1 proteins in previously conducted studies, for example, site mutations at 48Q, 98K, and 99K in A/swine/Belzig/2/2001 are sufficient to provide resistance to huMxA [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By using polymerase reconstitution assays, we found two positions in H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP, G34, and H52, which could be a possible target for H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> IAV. In our study, we showed that in the H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP the mutation N52H enabled it to escape the eqMx1 restriction. Interestingly, the S34G substitution in the H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> did not reverse the activity against eqMx1. Substituting tyrosine (Y) at position 52 with histidine (H) in H5N1 altered the polymerase activity of H5N1 drastically and eqMx1 almost lost its restriction affect towards H5N1-Y52H. A similar substitution in H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP (H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-H52Y) produced a reverse effect and eqMx1 inhibited the polymerase activity, confirming the importance of this site. We concluded that site 52 is more universal for eqMx1 as it was found to be of equal importance in both IAV strains, whereas site 34 was found to alter the polymerase activity only of H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> against eqMx1. The sequence alignment of unique sequences of H7N9 and H3N8 predicted that position 52 was highly conserved in both strains, whereas site 34 was more prone to mutations in both strains, reiterating the importance of site 52. None of the mutations at sites 34 and 52 in either H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> or H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> had a significant effect against huMxA but showed a slight alternation of the restriction instead. These sites may be important in escaping the huMxA antiviral activity when in combination with other as yet unidentified sites.
