<p>The HEK293T cell line was selected as the first choice for the transfection of plasmids throughout the study except for virus infection experiments because the HEK293T cells are well used in previous studies [

Since influenza viruses are the pathogens that cause major respiratory tract infections, the lung epithelial cells might be used for in vitro analysis of host-virus interaction at the cellular level. We tried to transfect human lung epithelial A549 cells but found the transfection efficiency was very low (only about 10â€“20%). Additionally, when compared with the endogenous MxA in both cell lines using MX1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Protientech, Rosemont, Illinois, USA), A549 cells did express notable levels of endogenous human MxA that might interfere with our results (see

A validation of interaction between eqMx1 and viral NP, and the site-specific antagonism of different viral strains, in lung epithelial cells of equine origin might be a future perspective in order to clarify the mode of action of equine Mx1 in vitro.
