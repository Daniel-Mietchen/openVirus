<p>Myxovirus resistance proteins, including MxA and MxB in humans (named Mx1 and Mx2 in other animals), belong to dynamin-like GTPases family and are considered to be cell-autonomous host restriction factors of the innate immune system against many viral pathogens. Both the type-I and type-III interferons stimulate MxA and MxB expression during innate immune signaling [
