<p>MxA represents a considerable barrier against the zoonotic introduction of avian influenza viruses into the human population [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly, several investigations reported the antiviral properties of MxA from a human and mouse [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], porcine [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A few of these mutations were already found in circulating IAV strains before they were even reported to cross the species barrier [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but in many cases, the adaptational mutations occurred subsequent to infection and transmission. Indeed, recent studies indicated that IAVs which successfully established stable lineages in humans acquired adaptive mutations in the NP [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was reported that a mutated H7N7 IAV carrying human signature NP mutations was more virulent in transgenic mice than the parental virus [
