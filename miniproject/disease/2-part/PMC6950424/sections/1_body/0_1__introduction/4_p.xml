<p>MxA is a dynamin-like large GTPase comprised of an N-terminal globular GTPase domain, a bundle signaling element (BSE), and a C-terminal helical stalk. MxA can form stable tetramers and oligomers, which assemble in a criss-cross manner via the stalk [

Although the exact mechanism of Mx1-mediated immunity to influenza viruses is still unclear, a proposed possible mechanism suggests that, upon entry of viral infectious particles, MxA recognizes the incoming vRNPs and starts to self-assemble into rings, resulting in a higher-order oligomeric complex that blocks the vRNP function [
