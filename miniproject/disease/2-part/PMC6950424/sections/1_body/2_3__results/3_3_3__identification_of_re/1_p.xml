<p>Next, we evaluated the key residues of NP from the H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> IAV that confer eqMx1 resistance in the context of the H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> polymerase. The sequence analysis comparing the NPs of H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> and H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> of avian origin showed 16 amino acids (AAs) variations between the two strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Based on the sequence alignment obtained in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, two different chimeras were constructed by fusing two NP proteins from H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> and H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) and tested their polymerase activity against eqMx1. An artificial chimera N-JL89xH7N9-C comprised of the N-terminal 200 AAs of the H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP and the C-terminal domain (AAs position 201 to 480) of the H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> NP, behaved like the full-length H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> NP, indicating that the eight different AAs at the C-terminal of the NP protein did not contribute to the Mx1 resistance phenotype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). However, a chimeric construct N-H7N9xJL89-C with the replacement of the N-terminal of H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-NP by 200 AAs from H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub> made it more sensitive towards inhibition by eqMx1 in contrast to the actual H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>-NP. Conversely, the opposite mutant N-JL89xH7N9-C that had an insertion of 200 AAs from H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub> into the N-terminal of H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>-NP lost its activity as compared to the wild type H7N9
 <sub>ZJ13</sub>-NP, indicating that the N-terminal played a key role in the determination of resistance or sensitivity towards eqMx1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f004">Figure 4</xref>C).
