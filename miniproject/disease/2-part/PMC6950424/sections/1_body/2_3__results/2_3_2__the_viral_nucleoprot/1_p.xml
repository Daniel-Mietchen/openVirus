<p>Viral NP is a major target of MxA and the adaptive mutations of NP enable the virus to escape from MxA restriction [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Analysis of a total of 153 representative nucleotide sequences of viral NPs from IAVs with different host specificities (including avian, swine, canine, equine, and human) showed that the NP proteins generate diverse lineages in a host-species-specific manner (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01114-f001">Figure 1</xref>), we hypothesized that the NP from equine viruses may have evolved a specific signature of adaptation to counter eqMx1, and this “signature” of the equine virus may not be able to overcome the restriction of human MxA.
