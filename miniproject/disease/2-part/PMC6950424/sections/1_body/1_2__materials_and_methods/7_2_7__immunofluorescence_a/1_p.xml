<p>Briefly, MDCK cells were infected with wild-type (H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>) and/or mutant viruses (JL89-H52N-NP) at an MOI of 0.001 and collected supernatants were used to infect MDCK cells in 96-well plates at various dilutions for 48 hr. Cells were fixed with chilled absolute ethanol for 30 min. The fixed cells were incubated with the anti-NP antibody (from our lab) for 2 hr at 37 °C in a humidified chamber, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- (FITC) labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 hr 37 °C. Following three washes with PBS, the cells were examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon TE200, Tokyo, Japan).
