<p>Wild type Influenza A/equine/Jilin/1/89 (H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>) and recombinant viruses were generated using a plasmid-based reverse genetics system as previously described [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The generated wild-type virus and JL89-H52N-NP mutant virus were further propagated in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 35 °C for 72 hr, and allantoic fluid was harvested and centrifuged, and a hemagglutination test was performed to confirm the presence of the virus. Viruses from positive-testing samples were filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter (Millex, Merck, Ireland), and the viral titers were determined using the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> method of Reed and Muench [
