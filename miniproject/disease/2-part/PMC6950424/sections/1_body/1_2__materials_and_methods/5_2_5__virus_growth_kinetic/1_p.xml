<p>The cells were seeded in 6-well plates and the next day, cells were transfected with pcDNA-3.1 eqMx1. 24 hr post-transfection, an infection experiment was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-01114" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, after 24 hr, the culture medium was removed and the cells were gently washed twice with preheated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then infected for 1 hr at 37 °C with wild-type (H3N8
 <sub>JL89</sub>) and/or mutant viruses (JL89-H52N-NP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. Viral dilutions were made in DMEM, supplemented with 1 μg/mL of TPCK added trypsin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.25% BSA (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Plates were gently shaken every 15 min so that the virus remained equally distributed within the cells. Later, excess virus was removed and cells were gently washed three times with preheated PBS and fresh infection media was added. Finally, the supernatants were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hr post-infection and debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The amount of virus in each supernatant was determined either by plaque assay or by determining tissue culture infectivity dose and is expressed here either as PFU per mL or TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL respectively.
