<p>In order to perform the statistical analyses, we used GraphPad Prism, version 5 (

Employing the statistical approaches of one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post-test, the statistical differences were analyzed. All experiments were thrice conducted independently. The error bars present standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM) in each experimental group that is documented in the figure legends. The abbreviations are designated as NS not significant,
