<p>In order to clone the cDNA derived from the total RNA of eMDMs, we used reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to amplify eqMx1. The eMDMs were treated with equine IFN-α1 (100 ng/μL) (Kingfisher Biotech, Minnesota, USA) for 24 hr. The primer sets were constructed following the genome sequences of 
 <italic>Equus caballus</italic> myxovirus (Mx) dynamin-like GTPase 1 (Mx1), transcript variant X1, gene (GenBank accession no. XM_005606071.3), and the sequence of primers can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01114">supplementary data (Table S1)</xref>. Then, the fragments were successfully cloned in pcDNA3.1-HA vector (pcDNA3.1 (+) vector (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) that possessed 2X HA tags situated on the C-terminus and also p3X-Flag-CMV vector (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) that contained 3X Flag tags located at the N-terminus. The huMxA gene was acquired from Summus Co. (China) and was also successfully cloned using pcDNA3.1 (+).
