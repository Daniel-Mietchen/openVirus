<p>Site-directed mutants of NP sequences were generated using overlapping PCR and identified by DNA sequencing. Mutants of pcAGGS-H7N9-NP and pEF-JL89-NP were constructed according to the online In-Fusion
 <sup>®</sup> HD Cloning Kit (Clontech, Felicia, CA, USA) user manual (

Briefly, the fragments of the pCAGGS/pcDNA3.1 vector and each target gene were amplified and were then fused using the In-Fusion
 <sup>®</sup> HD Enzyme kit (Clontech, Felicia, CA, USA). To create the N-H7N9xJL89-C plasmid, pcAGGS-H7N9-NP was used as the template to amplify the pCAGGS vector along with the N-terminal (1–200) of H7N9. This sequence was then fused with the JL89-NP C-terminal (201–480) fragment, where pEF-JL89-NP was used to amplify the inserted C-terminal (201–480) fragments. To obtain N-JL89xH7N9-C plasmids, pEF-JL89-NP was used as the template to amplify the pEF-JL89 vector backbone sequence along with the N-terminal (1–200) of JL89 and the inserted C-terminal (201–480) fragment of H7N9 was amplified from the pCAGGS-H7N9-NP sequence. The amplified vector and insert fragments were then fused together as described earlier. Single point mutations were also created by overlapping PCR in the same way. The constructed plasmids were transformed into DH5-alpha or Stable II competent cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Once the transformation was successful, the plasmids were extracted using PureLink HiPure plasmids DNA purification kits (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). All generated plasmids were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The sequence of all the primers is available in
