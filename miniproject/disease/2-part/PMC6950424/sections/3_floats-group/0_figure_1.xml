  <p>Antiviral activities of human MxA (huMxA) and equine Mx1 (eqMx1). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Structure-based domain representation of human MxA and equine Mx1. The GTPase is shown in grey, the middle domain (MD) is blue, and the GTPase effector domain (GED) is shown in pink. The GTPase domain is connected to the MD and GED through bundle signaling element (BSE) (yellow) and the stalk is colored orange. The arrows in the schematic denote the first and last visible residues in the structure. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Expression of plasmids by western blotting. The expression of huMxA-pcDNA3.1-HA, eqMx1-pcDNA3.1-HA, and p3X-FLAG-eqMx1 plasmids. The figures represent the bands of expressed proteins as visualized using western blotting, with antibodies used against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag and flag tag. (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) Relative luciferase activities of different influenza A virus (IAV) strains. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids of PB1 (40 ng), PB2 (40 ng), PA (20 ng), and nucleoprotein (NP) (80 ng) from different IAV strains, together with 40 ng of minigenome reporter (FF-luc) and 10 ng of 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase expression plasmids (pRL-TK, as an internal control) in the presence of HA-tagged pcDNA-3.1 eq-mx1 (
   <bold>C</bold>) or pcDNA-3.1 huMxA (
   <bold>D</bold>) and an empty control vector at increasing concentrations of 0, 50, 100, and 200 ng each. After 24 hr of transfection, cells were lysed using a 1X reporter lysis buffer. Firefly and 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activities were measured. The resulting relative activity in the presence of either H7N9
   <sub>ZJ13</sub> or H3N8
   <sub>JL89</sub> was set to 100%. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The western blot analysis was performed to determine the expression levels of eqMx1 or huMxA and NP expression plasmids. (Statistical differences between samples are indicated, according to a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s test; NS = not significant, * 0.01 ≤ 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 0.001 ≤ 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Error bars represent the SEM within one representative experiment).
