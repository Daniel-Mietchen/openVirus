  <p>Co-immunoprecipitation of eqMx1 and NP/PB2. We carried out this experiment by doing a pull-down of the NP followed by the analysis of co-immunoprecipitated PB2 using HEK293T cells that were co-transfected with p3XFLAG- eqMx1 (4 μg) together with PB1, PB2 (2 μg each), PA, FF-Luc (1 μg each), and NP expression plasmids from H7N9
   <sub>ZJ13</sub> or its mutants H7N9 
   <sub>ZJ13</sub>-S34G, N52H; or H3N8
   <sub>JL89</sub> or its mutants H3N8
   <sub>JL89</sub>-G34S, H52N; or an empty control vector (4 μg each). Total lysates were made 24 hr after transfection, HEK293T cells lysates were assayed by FLAG-IP (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) or NP-IP (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) and blotted with the indicated antibodies. The PB2 antibody was acquired from NOVUS Biologicals, Centennial, Colorado, USA (NBP2-42879). For western blot analysis, actin was used as a loading control. All experiments were repeated three times and representative figures are shown.
