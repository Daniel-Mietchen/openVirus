  <p>Single amino acid mutation of the NP confers resistance to eqMx1. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The different AAs in the NP of H7N9
   <sub>ZJ13</sub>, H3N8
   <sub>JL89</sub>, and H3N8
   <sub>XJ07</sub>. (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>E</bold>) HEK 293T cells were transfected with a firefly minigenome reporter, 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> expression control, and respectively indicated point mutants of the NP from either H3N8
   <sub>JL89</sub> polymerase (
   <bold>B</bold>) or H7N9
   <sub>ZJ13</sub> polymerase (
   <bold>B</bold>) or H5N1 polymerase (
   <bold>C</bold>) in the presence of eqMx1 (0, 200 ng). Polymerase activity of mutants with point mutations at sites 34 and 52 of the NP from both H3N8
   <sub>JL89</sub> (
   <bold>D</bold>) and H7N9
   <sub>ZJ13</sub> (
   <bold>E</bold>) was measured against huMxA (0, 200 ng). Luciferase activity was measured at 24 hr post-transfection. The polymerase activity observed in the presence of the HA-tagged eqMx1 was normalized to an empty control vector (black bar). The resulting relative activity in the presence of either H7N9
   <sub>ZJ13</sub> (blue) or H3N8
   <sub>JL89</sub> (grey) was set to 100%. The sequence analysis of the aforementioned IAV strains is shown in C. (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>E</bold>) data are firefly Luciferase gene activity normalized to that of 
   <italic>Renilla</italic>. (Statistical differences between cells are indicated, following a one-way ANOVA and subsequent Dunnett’s test; NS = not significant, * 0.01 ≤ 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 0.01 ≤ 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Error bars represent the SEM of the replicates within one representative experiment). The expression levels of all NP point mutant proteins were assessed by western blotting.
