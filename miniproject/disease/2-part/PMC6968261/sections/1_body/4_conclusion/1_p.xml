<p>The results of our study suggest that future global climate change resulting in increased global temperature will have negative fitness cost on 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes for ZIKV and could significantly alter their vector competence. Further, the impact of future climate change will be driven by unique intrinsic interactions between specific vectors and pathogens and therefore is unlikely to be uniform across different species and populations [
