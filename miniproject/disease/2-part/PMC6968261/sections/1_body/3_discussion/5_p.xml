<p>In our study, the increased temperature did not consistently increase competence or accelerate EIP. In fact, for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, overall competence was either higher or statistically similar at the lowest temperature regime and EIP was shorter. Our findings were contrary to the findings of [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who demonstrated a unimodal effect of temperature on the EIP of ZIKV on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> across eight constant temperatures (16–38°C), with the shortest EIP at 36.4°C and the peak infectivity at 30.6°C. In addition to the use of unique populations and strains, a critical difference between our study and studies that have found a direct correlation between temperature and EIP [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42–44</xref>] is that our mosquitoes were reared under fluctuating diurnal temperatures. Unlike adult holding temperature, some previous studies have found an indirect correlation between larval rearing temperatures and vector competence [
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45–47</xref>]. This effect could be related to altered RNA interference functionality at different temperatures [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, fluctuation of temperatures has been shown to result in reduced longevity, lower midgut infection rates and increased EIP for virus compared to a constant temperature [
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48–51</xref>].
