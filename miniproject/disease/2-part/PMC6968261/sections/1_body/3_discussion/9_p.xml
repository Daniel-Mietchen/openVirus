<p>We measured lower infection rates at later timepoints, particularly at high temperatures. Since arboviral infections in mosquitoes are persistent, these data suggest that ZIKV infected individuals were less likely to survive the experimental period and that this increased mortality was facilitated by increased temperatures. Further studies monitoring life-history traits following infection at altered temperatures will help clarify this relationship.</p>
