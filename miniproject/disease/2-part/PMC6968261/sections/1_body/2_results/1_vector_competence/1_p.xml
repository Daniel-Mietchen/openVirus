 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were equally susceptible to ZIKV infection [Fisher’s exact test 
 <italic>P</italic> = .44]. Overall, temperature influenced infection rates in a population and species-specific manner. Higher temperatures were associated with lower ZIKV infection rates of AEG MI population, i.e. the individuals reared and held at baseline temperature (M) had a significantly higher proportion of individuals infected (85/90) as compared to those reared at higher temperatures (H) (67/90) [Fisher’s exact test 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001]. However, the temperature did not influence infection rates of the AEG MX population [H (72/90) M (76/90) Fisher’s exact test 
 <italic>P</italic> = .56]. Although the temperature did not influence overall infection rates of the ALB LI population [M (71/90) L (73/90) Fisher’s exact test 
 <italic>P</italic> = .85], we noted differences at 7 dpi. Specifically, an increase in temperature significantly increased infection of ALB LI individuals [M (29/30) L (23/30) Fisher’s exact test 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05] (
