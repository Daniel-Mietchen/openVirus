  <p>The longevity of 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes at varying temperature regimes.
  </p>
  <p>Note: Mosquitoes were reared at similar temperature regimes as described for vector competence experiments: including L (D28N24), M (D30N26) and H (D32N28) regimes. Mortality was monitored and recorded daily. Graphs are Kaplan–Meier survival curves depicting proportions surviving at various days post-emergence. Significant differences were measured between populations and temperature regimes **Log-rank test (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).
