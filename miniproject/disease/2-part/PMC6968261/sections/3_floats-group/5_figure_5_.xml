  <p>Blood feeding frequency of 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes at different temperatures.
  </p>
  <p>Note: The bar graphs represent the frequency of blood meal acquisition for individuals offered non-infectious blood meals twice a week post-mating. Mosquitoes were reared at similar temperature regimes as described for vector competence experiments: including L (D28N24), M (D30N26) and H (D32N28) regimes. Significantly higher feeding rates were measured for the ALB LI population at higher temperatures ***Fisher’s exact test (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).
