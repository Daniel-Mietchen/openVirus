<p>In the last decades, Mosquito-borne diseases have become a significant health issue in many regions around the world. Projections indicate that around 2050, half of the population will be at risk of some arbovirus infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0222900.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These arboviruses, which include diseases such as Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya, are epidemic in most of the tropical countries. Besides temperature and humidity, human migrations and sanitation also contribute to the epidemic conditions in these places [

 <sup>th</sup> week of 2019 in Brazil. This number represents almost three times the reported cases in 2018 for the same period [

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>o</italic>
 </sub> is defined as the number of secondary infections derived from one single infectious subject and is widely used as an epidemiological metric employed to describe the transmissibility of infectious agents [
