<p>The usage of the SEIR model to investigate diseases epidemics provides a tool to quantify different parameters in outbreaks. The basic reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>o</italic>
 </sub> is the most important quantity, and it is defined as the number of secondary infections caused by an infected individual [
