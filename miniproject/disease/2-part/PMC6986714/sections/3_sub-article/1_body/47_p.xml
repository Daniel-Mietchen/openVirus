<p>Reviewer #1: Authors are presenting a mathematical epidemiology modeling approach to describe outbreaks of Chikungunya in Rio de Janerio, Brazil for the years 2016, 2018, and 2019. Parameters for the Chikungunya model are obtained from the published literature and unknown parameters are estimated using the best fit to the solved equation. Then, parameters for Mayaro virus are plugged in the equation in order to calculate the basic reproduction number for Mayaro in the same geographic region. Finally, for Chikungunya in the year 2018, the authors developed equations resembling three vector control strategies.</p>
