<p>Considering the Mayaro model, authors are replacing Chikungunya parameters by those described for Mayaro and then presented results for this pathogen. Although this is valid, the manuscript lacks any other discussion on the topic, this is key in order to consider this manuscript as a scientific contribution worth to be published in a journal, otherwise, we can also fit the parameters for any vector-borne disease (letâ€™s say, Eastern Equine encephalitis, West Nile, etc) and comment on the basic reproduction number. Mayaro specifically grants discussion regarding its life sylvatic/urban life cycle, its endemicity in Latin America (it has been present in the continent longer than Chikungunya), its reservoirs, among others. Further, from the infectious diseases dynamics perspective, is more similar to Yellow fever, thus, the taxonomic justification (Chikungunya and Mayaro are alphaviruses) is short to explain its dynamics in any particular region.</p>
