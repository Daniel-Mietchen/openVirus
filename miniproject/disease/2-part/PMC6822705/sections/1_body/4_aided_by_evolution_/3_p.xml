<p>Soon after the emergence of WN02 in 2001, a southwest genotype (SW03), defined by two amino acid substitutions NS4A-A85T and NS5-K314R, arose from within this clade [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. WN02 and SW03 continue to coexist within the US (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008042.g003">Fig 3</xref>
 </bold>) and even cocirculate within the same locations, years, and mosquito vectors (e.g., Arizona [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], California [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and New York [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]; 
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008042.s005">S5 Fig</xref>
 </bold>), suggesting that there are not any major barriers segregating these genotypes. However, there is some evidence that SW03 has a more rapid rate of spread than WN02 in California [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This could suggest that NS4A-A85T and/or NS5-K314R are the result of recent adaptations; however, the direct fitness of either allele has yet to be experimentally evaluated. Altogether, the evidence that supports the hypothesis that rapid evolution of WNV facilitated its westwardly spread is limited, and additional studies are required to tease apart if locally derived genotypes, such as WN02 and SW03, are specifically adapted to the environment in the Americas.
