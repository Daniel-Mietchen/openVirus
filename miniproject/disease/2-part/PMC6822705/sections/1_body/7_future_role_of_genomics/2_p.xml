<p>Generating a well-distributed temporal and spatial WNV genomic dataset can be used to determine which strains are causing outbreaks and, importantly, where those strains came from and when they became locally established. This work will help to identify if WNV outbreaks in Ames, Iowa, for example, are connected to outbreaks as far away as Des Moines, Iowa (approximately 60 km); Omaha, Nebraska (approximately 270 km); or even Chicago, Illinois (approximately 560 km). Systematically searching for connections among WNV outbreaks around the country may reveal endemic “transmission networks,” which could be exploited for control and forecasting purposes. WNV control is primarily based on local interventions to temporarily reduce the populations of mosquito vectors [

Thus, a highly coordinated effort among several health departments and mosquito abatement districts to synchronize vector control within a transmission network may reduce reintroductions and limit WNV transmission beyond a single season. In addition, genomic epidemiology approaches with large-scale efforts to collect and share mosquito abundance and infection rate data [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]). This, in turn, could be used to maximize vector control efforts by strategically focusing resources at a precise time and location to limit potential outbreaks [
