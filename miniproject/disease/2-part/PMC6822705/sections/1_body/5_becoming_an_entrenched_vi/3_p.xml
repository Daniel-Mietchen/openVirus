However, it is unclear if dynamic clustering of the virus across the US will lead to the emergence of new adaptive genotypes and if locally adapted viruses are more likely to cause outbreaks. Understanding such fundamental questions of the epidemiology and biology of WNV strains between and within states may be important for effectively combating this entrenched virus.
