 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] may account for a large portion of WNV dispersal, the rapid rates of spread, nonuniform diffusion pattern, and lack of geographical structure are best explained by frequent mixing of local and nonlocal viruses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] support the hypothesis that the introduction of nonlocal viruses was facilitated by the movement of WNV-infected migratory birds. Indeed, the early spread of WNV along the eastern seaboard aligns with a major bird migration flyway; and while the routes primarily run north and south, the elliptical migration patterns of passerines may account for the East to West WNV expansion [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, it is also possible that other mechanisms may account for the rapid spread and frequent virus mixing. For example, the impact of human behavior on WNV spread [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], specifically through the unintentional transport of WNV-infected birds or mosquitoes via the dense trucking industry in North America, should be examined more thoroughly. Better understanding of how WNV spreads long distances may be critical to inform future mitigation strategies.
