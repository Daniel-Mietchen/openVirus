 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The quality of the model was evaluated and validated using Procheck, based on the Ramachandran graph to verify the structure. The results of Procheck demonstrated that this model showed 94.2% of residues in the most favored regions, 5.8% of residues in the additional allowed regions, 0% in generously allowed regions, and 0% in regions generously allowed and disapproved (Additional file
