<p id="Par52">In this study, 36 indels were obtained by comparing the VP1 sequences of clades C and D mainly in the subdomain P2, which contains the antigenic epitopes and host receptor binding domains. These indels occurred in the antigenic sites of the outer capsid region, the amino acid substitutions occurred at the positions: 294, 295, 296, 395 and 407 (Additional file
