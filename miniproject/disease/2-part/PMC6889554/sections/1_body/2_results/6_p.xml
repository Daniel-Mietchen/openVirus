<p id="Par50">To investigate the temporal evolutionary dynamics of the GII.17 norovirus in the Amazon, we applied Bayesian analysis with different population dynamic models. The strict molecular clock and GMRF Bayesian Skyride coalescence model were the most suitable models. The selection of the evolutionary model was made by comparing a posteriori probabilities of the models under investigation. Following Bayes factor calculation, the TMRCA was estimated in 1881 (95% HPD: 1832–1921). The evolution rate for GII-17 strains was 1.95 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> (1.28 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup>–2.63 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup>) (Additional file
