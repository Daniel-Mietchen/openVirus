<p id="Par46">The RT-PCR assays were satisfactorily validated. The optimum annealing temperature for the LNOV 5KR/5KF and LNOV 6KR/6KF primers was 58 °C and 55 °C, respectively. The qualitative RT-PCR analysis using both the undiluted and diluted viral RNA revealed that the genetic material could be amplified at 10
 <sup>− 5</sup> dilution. Thus, considering an initial undiluted viral RNA concentration of 6.0 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> ng/μL, the viral genome could be detected till the concentration of 6.0 × 10
 <sup>− 2</sup> ng/μL in the assays using the two pairs of primers (LNOV 5KF/5KR and LNOV 6KF/6KR).
