<p id="Par35">The performance of the method was confirmed based on the conformity hypothesis test, considering the definition of pair of answers (presence of concordant and discordant results using CP and CN). This test verified whether the method detected the viral nucleic acid (the results are “concordant”) or does not detect the viral nucleic acid (the results are “discordant”). Based on these data, we verified the probability of accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis (agreement method), considering a significance level of 0.05%.</p>
