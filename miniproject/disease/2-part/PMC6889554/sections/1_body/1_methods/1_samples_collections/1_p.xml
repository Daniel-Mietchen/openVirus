<p id="Par29">The NoV-positive cases were identified from the database of the National Viral Gastroenteritis Surveillance Program, Brazilian Ministry of Health. This program includes epidemiological surveillance of diarrhea cases, which was obtained from inpatients who attended the public health facilities of the Northern region of Brazil (states of Amazonas, Pará, Roraima, Amapá, and Tocantins). Fecal specimens from children under 5 years of age were also included in this study. Previously, these fecal samples tested negative for rotavirus. In this study, 32.2% (208/645) samples tested positive for NoV by immunochromatography (RIDA®QUICK Norovirus) or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (RIDASCREEN® Norovirus 3rd Generation). These NoV-positive samples were subjected to one-step RT-PCR to amplify the ORF1/ORF2 junction region using the MON431/MON 432 and G2SKR (557 bp) primers, which can detect all NoV genotypes [
