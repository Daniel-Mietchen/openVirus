All genomes or complete ORF2 GII.17 sequences registered in the GenBank were used for evolutionary analysis. The final database comprised 85 sequences after data formatting using the CD-Hit program (Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance) to split the sequences with 100% identity (Additional file
