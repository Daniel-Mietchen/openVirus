<p id="Par66">Amino acid analysis of the complete VP1 of the strains detected in the Amazon region demonstrated higher accumulation of mutations in the antigenic sites when compared to other pre-epidemic strains. A molecular characterization study conducted with several GII.17 strains circulating in Jiangsu Province, China between 2014 and 2015 identified differences in amino acids that occurred mainly in the P2 domain, particularly at positions 295–297, 376, 398–400, and 414 [
