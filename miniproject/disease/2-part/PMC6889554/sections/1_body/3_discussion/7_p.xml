<p id="Par62">A study conducted in Japan to evaluate the limit of detection obtained values ranging from 10
 <sup>− 2</sup> to 10
 <sup>− 4</sup> in Multiplex-PCR for the following viruses: Aichi virus, Human Parechovirus, Enterovirus, and Human Bocavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These results demonstrated that the maximum detection limit that can be achieved is 10
 <sup>− 4</sup> dilution. Our study demonstrated a sensitivity of 10
 <sup>− 5</sup> for the designed primer pairs.
