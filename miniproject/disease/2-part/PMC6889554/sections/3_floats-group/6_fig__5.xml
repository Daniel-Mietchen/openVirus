   <bold>a</bold> Alterations observed in the epitopes of the outermost surface of the epidemic NoV GII.17 [T294I (Thr294Ile), D295N (Asp295Asn), H296Q (His296Gln), G395D (Gly395 Asp), N407D (Asn407Asp), X/D393D (Asp393)]. 
   <bold>b</bold> The figure shows the common set of virus residues interacting with host cell histo-blood group antigens (HBGA). The position hosting Asp378/377 underwent an insertion of an electronegative amino acid forming a hydrogen bond (The illustration was made for this study by the author himself)
