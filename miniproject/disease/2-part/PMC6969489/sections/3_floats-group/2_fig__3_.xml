 <caption>
  <p>Characterization of size-based capture. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Illustration of capture and separation of 3 different sizes of fluorescently labeled silica particles by VIRRION with 3 zones of ITDs. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Fluorescent and combined bright-field images of particles captured and separated by VIRRION into individual zones. (Scale bar: 200 Âµm.) (
   <italic>C</italic>) Capture efficiency of different silica particles captured by VIRRIONS under different flow rates. (
   <italic>D</italic>) Capture efficiency of silica particles after multiple repeated capture by the same VIRRION.
