<p>The VIRRION platform is constructed with aligned nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (CNxCNT) arrays, decorated with gold (Au) nanoparticles to separate, enrich, and detect fluidic human samples by direct Raman-based spectroscopic identification (

After chemical vapor deposition (CVD), CNxCNTs grew on Fe particles and formed aligned nanotube arrays. They were then coated with Au nanoparticles (Au/CNxCNTs) to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in Raman spectroscopy. This stamping method allowed us to pattern Fe catalytic particles with a concentration gradient using a simple and low-cost process, compared to a conventional lithography-based fabrication technique that requires a range of equipment to obtain the same pattern involving a variety of chemicals and photoresists, as well as several steps of patterning (including lithography and deposition) that have to be repeated sequentially. Using this process, multiple zones of the herringbone arrays with different ITDs, from 22 ± 5 to 720 ± 64 nm, were patterned to match viruses of different sizes. Previous studies have shown that herringbone patterns, made of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), enhance mixing of the samples inside a microfluidic channel by inducing a chaotic flow (

The 3-dimensional (3D) and porous herringbone pattern enhanced the interactions between the viruses and the Au/CNxCNT arrays, and the presence of a gradient of ITDs selectively captured different particles based on size. While our previous report demonstrated the feasibility of a size-based virus capture approach (
