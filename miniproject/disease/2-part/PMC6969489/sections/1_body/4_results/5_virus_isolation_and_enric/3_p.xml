<p>We further analyzed the captured viruses by NGS to characterize the captured virus population without prior knowledge of the strains (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We captured a mixture of samples containing more than one strain of viruses. When sequencing this type of sample, it is difficult to enrich without introducing bias (
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). We prepared samples by spiking equal volume, 0.2 mL, of H5N2 and H7N2 with an HA titer of 2
 <sup>9</sup> (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), into viral transport media, and ran the pooled viruses on VIRRIONs consisting of one array of 100-nm ITD. After enrichment, the sequence data covers 8 complete genomic segments for each strain (

 </ext-link>). We compared viral reads of the HA gene before and after enrichment. Interestingly, before enrichment, the H5N2:H7N2 ratio based on HA viral reads was 1:7.8, where 344 reads were from H5N2 and 2,693 reads from H7N2. After enrichment, the ratio was relatively well preserved at 1:6.5, but with an increase in viral reads (1,314 reads for H5N2 and 8,568 reads for H7N2). There appeared to be a more than 3-fold enrichment for both viruses. However, this difference in enrichment efficiencies maintained the stoichiometric proportion of viruses present in the original samples. Moreover, the complete genome of both strains was sequenced with an average coverage of 519× for H5N2 and 599× for H7N2. In addition, after enrichment, the host (chicken) reads decreased from 68.44% (reads) of the total reads (547,998 of 800,699 reads) to 34.2% (297,157 reads) of the total reads (866,855 reads). These results indicate that the VIRRION can minimize artifacts during enrichment. This feature is important for virus diversity profiling.
