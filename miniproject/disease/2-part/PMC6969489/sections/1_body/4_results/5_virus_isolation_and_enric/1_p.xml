<p>After capturing and identifying H5N2 virus particles, we propagated the virus in cell culture directly on the VIRRIONs. Notably, during culture, the host cells attached and proliferated on the Au/CNxCNT arrays. The virus-like particles were observed on the surface of the cells, indicating effective replication and production of virus progeny (

 <sup>6</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL, which is similar to controls where the virus is propagated in the same cell line in a culture flask. We obtained a higher virus titer, âˆ¼10
 <sup>7</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL, when we propagated captured viruses using embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). To do that, we disassembled the VIRRION, collected the Au/CNxCNT with embedded viruses, and directly inoculated these into ECE for AIV propagation. For both cell culture and ECE propagation, we also confirmed viral replication by Dot-ELISA (
