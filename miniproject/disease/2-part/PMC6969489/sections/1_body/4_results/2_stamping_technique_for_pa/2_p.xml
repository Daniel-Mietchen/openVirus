 </xref> shows the relationship between the density and dimension of the Fe particles and CNxCNTs, and the concentration of the Fe-based precursor. By increasing the precursor concentration, the diameter and density of Fe-rich particles as well as those of CNxCNTs also increased. More importantly, we observed that the CNxCNT array has tunable ITDs that are a function of the concentration of Fe-based precursors, and the ITDs ranged from 22 ± 5 to 720 ± 64 nm (
