<p>In virus surveillance, collected samples are subjected to a series of time-consuming steps, such as ultracentrifugation and cell culture, to enrich virus particles or amplify virus titers (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"/>â€“
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, many viruses are not easily culturable, and bias is often introduced during amplification, leading to artifacts in the sequence data (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Even standard methods require a laboratory with proper infrastructure and are time intensive, ranging from several hours to days. Unfortunately, such methodologies for viral enrichment are impractical when samples are time-sensitive or have variable viral titers.
