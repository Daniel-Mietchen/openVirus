  <p>ZIKV rE
   <sup>D</sup> induces neutralizing antibody responses. 
   <bold>a</bold> Mice were primed with 5 µg of ZIKV rE
   <sup>M</sup> or rE
   <sup>D</sup> (+/−alum) and boosted with similar doses at weeks 3 and 9. Mice were bled (
   <bold>b</bold>) at indicated time points (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 for rE
   <sup>M</sup>, rE
   <sup>D</sup>, rE
   <sup>M</sup>+alum, and rE
   <sup>D</sup>+alum, and 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 for vehicle control). 
   <bold>b</bold> ZIKV-specific single point dilution (1:50) IgG titers were determined by virus capture ELISA. 
   <bold>c</bold> ZIKV-specific endpoint dilution (EPD) titers were determined at week 16 by virus capture ELISA; EPD is the serum dilution at which detection signal equals background levels. 
   <bold>d</bold> ZIKV-neutralizing activity at week 16 was determined on Vero cells and expressed as the serum dilution at which 50% of the virus was neutralized (Neut
   <sub>50</sub>). Statistical differences were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test (*
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Data points represent individual mice. Error bars represent standard deviation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file
