<p id="Par13">The recombinant ZIKV E (H/PF/2013; aa1–404) monomers (rE
 <sup>M</sup>) and stable E dimers (rE
 <sup>D</sup>) were expressed in the EXPI293 transient expression system (ThermoFisher) following supplied protocols. The rE
 <sup>D</sup> was created by an A264C substitution in E-domain II and all proteins were equipped with a C-terminal 6 × His-tag. Recombinant proteins were purified as previously described

 </sup>. In short, cell supernatants were concentrated by tangential filtration and proteins were affinity purified using Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>-chromatography columns. Pooled elution fractions were subjected to size exclusion chromatography and purified protein samples were flash frozen and stored at −80 °C.
