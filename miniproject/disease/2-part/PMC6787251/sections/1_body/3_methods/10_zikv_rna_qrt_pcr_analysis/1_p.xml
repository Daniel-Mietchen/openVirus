<p id="Par23">Viral RNA was isolated from 30 µl of mouse sera using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in RNase free MilliQ water and stored at −80 °C. For qRT-PCR, 2 µl of RNA was added to 18 µl of PCR mastermix (10 µl of iTaq universal probes mix + 0.5 µl of iScript advanced reverse transcriptase + 2 µl of forward primer (10 µM; CATGATACTGCTGATTGC) + 2 µl of reverse primer (10 µM; CCTTCCACAAAGTCCCTATTGC) + 0.4 µl of probe (IDT; 10 µM; FAM-CGGCATACA-ZEN-GCATCAGGTGCATAGGAG-IBFQ) + 6.5 µl of nuclease-free H
 <sub>2</sub>O). Next, samples were analyzed in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Thermocycler according to the following program: 10 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 95 °C (10 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 60 °C) × 40 cycles. RNA was isolated from a known quantity of ZIKV H/PF/2013 to generate a standard curve.
