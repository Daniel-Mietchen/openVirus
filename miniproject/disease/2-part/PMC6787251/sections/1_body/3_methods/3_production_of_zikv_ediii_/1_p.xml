<p id="Par14">ZIKA virus EDIII (H/PF/2013, aa302–403) was expressed as an N-terminal MBP fusion protein equipped with a C-terminal 6 × His-tag in BL21–
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Cells were transformed with a pET21-MBP/ZIKVEDIII expression plasmid and expanded overnight to 100 ml cultures (LB-growth medium, supplemented with 100 µg per ml ampicillin). Overnight cultures were transferred to 1L LB-growth medium and grown to and OD
 <sub>600</sub> = 0.6 at 37 °C, shaking at 225 rpm. ZIKV EDIII expression was stimulated by adding 50 mM IPTG and cells were grown overnight at 16 °C with shaking at 225 rpm. Next, cells were pelleted and lysed by high pressure homogenization. ZIKV EDIII proteins were purified from the lysate by Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography. Eluted fractions (50 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10% sucrose, pH 7.0) were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 and stored at −80 °C.
