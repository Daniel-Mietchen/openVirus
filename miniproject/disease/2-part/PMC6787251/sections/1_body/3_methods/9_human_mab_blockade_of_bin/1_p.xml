<p id="Par22">High-binding ELISA plates were coated with 2 ng per µl 1M7 human mAb in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, plates were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS + 0.05% Tween for 30 min at 37 °C. After blocking, plates were washed in PBS + 0.2% Tween and incubated with ZIKV H/PF/2013 for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed and incubated with serially diluted immunized mouse sera for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, the plates were washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated A9E, G9E or C10 human mAb at 2 ng per µl for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the plates were washed and developed with AP-substrate and absorbance was measured at 405 nm.</p>
