<p id="Par10">Next, we investigated if the immune sera of mice vaccinated with rE
 <sup>M</sup>+alum and rE
 <sup>D</sup>+alum could protect mice from lethal ZIKV challenge. We immunized wild-type mice as previously described (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and transferred heat-inactivated immune sera to Ifnar1
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice which are highly susceptible to ZIKV. Ifnar1
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were challenged with 1000 FFU of ZIKV H/PF/2013, 1 day post serum transfer. Mice were monitored for weight loss and ZIKV induced disease, and mice were bled at days 0 (before virus challenge), 4, and 14 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The potently neutralizing mAb G9E was used as a positive control for protection against ZIKV infection

 </sup>. Mice that received G9E or serum from rE
 <sup>D</sup>+alum immunization were completely protected against weight loss and disease signs. In contrast, mice receiving rE
 <sup>M</sup>+alum serum exhibited significant weight loss and hindlimb paralysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). At 4 days post challenge, viremia levels in the rE
 <sup>D</sup>+alum group were significantly reduced compared with the rE
 <sup>M</sup>+alum and vehicle groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), and all groups cleared viremia at day 14. We also measured ZIKV-specific IgG titers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) and neutralizing antibody titers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>) at days 0 and 14. Mice receiving rE
 <sup>M</sup>+alum and rE
 <sup>D</sup>+alum immune sera showed similar ZIKV-specific IgG titers at day 0, which were marginally higher for both groups at day 14. On the other hand, neutralizing antibody titers were higher at day 14 in the rE
 <sup>M</sup>+alum group, likely caused by an endogenous immune response elicited against replicating virus in these animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).
