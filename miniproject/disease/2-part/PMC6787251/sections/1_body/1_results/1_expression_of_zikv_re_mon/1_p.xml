<p id="Par6">Here, to investigate if ZIKV rE dimers are better subunit vaccine antigens than monomers, we expressed ZIKV rE variants (aa1–402) that are monomers (rE
 <sup>M</sup>) or stable dimers (rE
 <sup>D</sup>) under physiological conditions. We generated stable ZIKV rE
 <sup>D</sup> proteins as previously described for DENV E protein by introducing a disulfide bridge (A264C) in the E-domain II interactive region of the homodimer

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The oligomeric state of the purified rE
 <sup>M</sup> and rE
 <sup>D</sup> proteins were confirmed by protein gel electrophoresis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The stable rE
 <sup>D</sup>, but not the rE
 <sup>M</sup>, was efficiently recognized by neutralizing mAbs that have dimer-dependent quaternary footprints, such as ZIKV-specific mAbs A9E, G9E, and ZKA-230 and flavivirus cross-reactive mAbs C8 and C10 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).
