<p id="Par5">Here, we investigate if ZIKV rE dimers are better subunit vaccine antigens than monomers. Unlike the E monomer, the dimer is recognized by strongly neutralizing mAbs isolated from ZIKV patients and the dimer, not the monomer, stimulates strongly neutralizing and protective antibodies that targeted epitopes that were similar to epitopes recognized by human antibodies following natural Zika virus infection. These results highlight the importance of mimicking the highly structured flavivirus surface when designing subunit vaccines. The flavivirus field has a long history of using E monomers as vaccine antigens with limited success. These results highlight the importance of mimicking the highly structured flavivirus surface when designing subunit vaccines, and are applicable to developing second generation subunit vaccines against Zika as well as other medically important flaviviruses like dengue and yellow fever.</p>
