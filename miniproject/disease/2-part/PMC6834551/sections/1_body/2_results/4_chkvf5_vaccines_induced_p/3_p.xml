<p>Seven mice from each vaccine group were challenged by i.m. calf injection with 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu of CHIKV. At 5 dpi, mice were euthanized and tissues were collected for virological and immunological assessments. Infectious viral titers in the ipsilateral ankle and calf muscle were determined by limiting dilution plaque assays from tissue homogenates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D,E</xref>). Though there was no statistically significant reduction in virus load in the ipsilateral ankle, there was a significant reduction in infectious virus in the ipsilateral calf from all of the CHIKVf5 vaccine groups (MCMV, AdV, and prime/boost) relative to the appropriate vaccine controls. This finding indicates that the vaccine dramatically reduces viral loads in the calf muscle, but not the ankle tissues.
