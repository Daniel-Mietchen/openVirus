<p>In general, s.c. footpad CHIKV infection quickly replicates to high titers in the ankle, which promotes viral replication and dissemination in a manner that T cells may not be able to control. To test whether the route of infection influences T cell vaccine efficacy, we inoculated mice with 1,000 PFU by three different infection routes (footpad, intramuscular into the calf muscle, or subcutaneous in the calf) in unvaccinated mice and monitored footpad swelling and viral tissue distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Only animals inoculated in the footpad developed swelling in the ipsilateral footpad and ankle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, only animals inoculated via the footpad route developed measurable viremia at 3 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Infectious virus was isolated from footpad-infected animals in both ipsilateral and contralateral ankles and calf muscles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4Câ€“F</xref>). Animals inoculated intramuscularly in the right calf had the most consistent and highest levels of virus in the ipsilateral calf at 5 dpi and detectable virus in the ipsilateral ankle, while virus isolation from the contralateral ankle was highly variable. Animals inoculated s.c. in the right calf had detectable virus in the ipsilateral ankle, but levels in the ipsilateral calf and contralateral ankle were variable with no virus detectable in the contralateral calf muscle.
