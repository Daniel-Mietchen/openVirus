<p>Since neutralizing antibodies were not detected in the vaccinated animals at the time of challenge, we determined whether protection elicited by the CHIKVf5 vaccine is mediated by the induction of protective T cell responses by T cell depletion experiments in CHIKVf5 prime/boost vaccinated animals. At 14 days post boost (2 days before challenge), animals were infused with depleting antibodies targeting CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and/or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). To confirm effective and specific T cell subset depletion, at 5 dpi splenocytes isolated from three mice per group were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>, depletion of specific T cell subpopulations (CD4 and/or CD8) were appropriately depleted to levels of &gt;95%. At 5 days post challenge, CHKVf5-vaccinated mice that were untreated or those receiving control rat IgG or CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depleting antibodies had significantly reduced levels of infectious CHIKV present in the calf muscle relative to animals that received the control vaccine. These groups were not significantly different from each other suggesting that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells alone do not play a major role in CHIKVf5-mediated protection. However, depletion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells increased levels of infectious CHIKV present in the calf, which was enhanced in mice depleted for both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. This finding indicates that while CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are required for vaccine-mediated protection against CHIKV i.m. challenge, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells cooperate to mediate protection in the calf muscle.
