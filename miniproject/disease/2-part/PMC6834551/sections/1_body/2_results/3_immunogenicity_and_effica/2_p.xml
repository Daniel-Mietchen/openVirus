<p>The remaining animals were challenged with 1,000 PFU CHIKV SL15649 s.c. in the right footpad, and four mice per group were sacrificed at 3 dpi or 28 dpi to measure immunogencity and antiviral efficacy. Twenty-eight days after challenge, IFNγ ELISpots were performed on the splenocytes from all vaccine groups (
