<p>The Smith strain MCMV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) pSMfr3 (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) was utilized for generating infectious MCMV vaccines. The gene of interest was inserted in-frame onto the C-terminus of the MCMV 
 <italic>IE2</italic> gene so that the insertion is co-expressed with IE2 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Generation of the MCMV constructs was performed via a two-step galactokinase/kanamycin (GalK/Kan) cassette insertion and replacement (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The GalK/Kan cassette was generated by PCR with primers that overlapped 
 <italic>ie2</italic> by 50 bp. The PCR product was electroporated into electrocompetent SW105 cells containing pSMfr3, and bacteria were selected on Kan-containing agarose plates. The fusion gene CHKVf5 was generated by overlapping PCR. A PCR product containing 50 bp homology with 
 <italic>ie2</italic> was generated (F primer: GGTTCTTTCTCTTGACCAGAGACCTGGTGACCGTCAGGAAGAAGATTCAGTGTGCGGTGCATTCGATGAC, R primer: AACCTCTTTATTTATTGATTAAAAACCATGACATACCTCGTGTCCTCTCAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACATC) and electroporated into SW105 cells containing the IE2-GalK/Kan MCMV BAC. Resulting bacteria were selected on 2-deoxy-galactose (DOG) minimal plates, and the presence of the insert was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Virus was reconstituted by electroporation into NIH/3T3 cells, and passaged five times to eliminate the BAC cassette prior to ultracentrifugation. Constructs were screened by PCR and sequenced to confirm the presence of the insert. MCMVs were titered by plaque assays on NIH/3T3s. Dilutions of virus was plated on NIH/3T3s, and cells were placed in an incubator on a rocker. At 2 hpi, a CMC overlay was added to the cells, and the cells were incubated for 5â€“7 days, until plaques were formed, prior to fixing and staining with methylene blue.
