<p>Two crucial findings indicate that the CHKVf5 vaccine elicits protection through T cells. First, depletion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells at 2 days before challenge from vaccinated mice negated the protective efficacy of the vaccine against i.m. challenge by restoring viral loads to levels observed in vaccine controls and non-vaccinated mice. It appears that both T cell subtypes contribute to immune efficacy since depletion of either CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells failed to fully restore CHIKV tissue load to control levels. However, depletion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells significantly reduced the ability of mice to control virus indicating a dominant role for these cells. We presume that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell help is required for full efficacy but these cells specifically enhance CHIKV inflammatory joint disease. Second, the CHKVf5 vaccine does not contain any known CHIKV neutralizing domains. As such, we did not detect neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV in any of the vaccinated mice, and the generation of antibody responses against CHIKV following challenge developed with normal kinetics and amplitude when compared to controls indicating that there was no amnestic-type response. Together, these data demonstrate that the CHKVf5 vaccine constructs elicit robust T cell responses that protected against CHIKV in muscle tissues. Finally, we showed that vaccination with adenoviruses containing CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes did not decrease joint tissue viral loads after footpad challenge, but it reduced footpad swelling and inflammation following CHIKV challenge. In addition, the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell vaccine provided enhanced survival for
