<p>While the development of neutralizing antibodies is a clear immunological correlate of protection for CHIKV, it was unknown what role T cells play in protection against CHIKV infection and disease. In the current study, we mapped the T cell responses to CHIKV in C57BL/6 mice using an overlapping CHIKV peptide library in order to identify potential CHIKV targets for development of a T cell vaccine. During this T cell profiling experiment, we identified 26 unique peptide sequences that elicited significant IFNÎ³ responses in splenocytes obtained from CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice. Based upon this information, we constructed a fusion polyprotein that contained the amino acid sequence for a number of these positive CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> restricted peptides. This CHKVf5 fusion gene was inserted into two different T cell promoting vaccine platforms including MCMV and AdV. Vaccinated mice developed robust T cell responses directed against the transgene construct that were amplified following challenge with CHIKV. Vaccination prior to footpad inoculation resulted in a dramatic increase in footpad swelling at 3 dpi. We attribute this to preformed anti-CHIKV CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. While the CHKVf5 vaccine did not protect against high ankle viral loads following challenge, it did significantly reduce viral loads in the calf muscle when i.m. challenged with CHIKV.
