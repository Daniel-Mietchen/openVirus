<p>We showed that vaccinated animals had a significant reduction of CHIKV titers in the calf muscle. The tissue-specific protection is reminiscent of the study with RRV, where protection by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells was observed in the muscle tissue during RRV infection (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), but CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells failed to reduce viral loads in the ankle tissues. Similarly, we found that CHKVf5-elicited T cells and peptide 260 and 451-elicited T cells were unable to significantly reduce viral burden in the ankles. Similar tissue-type targeting occurs following SINV infection, where T cells are important for viral clearance in the brain and spinal cord (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were important for protection mediated by a live-attenuated vaccine for VEEV (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Together these studies demonstrate the importance of T cells in alphavirus clearance from infected tissues.
