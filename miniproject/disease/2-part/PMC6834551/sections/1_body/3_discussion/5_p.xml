<p>Interestingly, we found that T cell responses elicited by CHIKVf5 were more frequent and directed against different epitopes when compared to those observed following CHIKV infection. For example, splenocytes from CHIKV infected mice had high frequencies of IFNγ responses to peptides 47-48, 256, 350, 439, and 451. While T cell responses against peptides 350 and 439 were robust, the CHKVf5 did not contain these because it was designed prior to us determining whether these were CD4
 <sup>−</sup> or CD8
 <sup>−</sup> specific. Future T cell vaccine constructs would most likely add these epitopes as they may impact protection. Since peptides 47, 256, and 451 were included in the CHKVf5 fusion gene, we expected that vaccinated mice would primarily induce responses to those epitopes. However, peptide 260 and 451 elicited the highest frequency of IFNγ
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in splenocytes from CHKVf5 vaccinated mice indicating that vaccine-induced responses were skewed toward infection-associated, non-dominant epitopes. Thus, one could argue that the protection elicited by the CHKVf5 vaccine may be due to this skewing of the immune response and higher frequencies of responding T cells. Similarly, while both MCMV- and AdV-CHKVf5 vaccines elicited strong T cell responses, the breadth of the responses was vaccine vector-dependent. The AdV-CHKVf5 vaccine directed responses against peptides 47, 255, 256, 260, and 451, while MCMV-CHKVf5 mainly directed T cells against 260 and 451. Prime-boost with both vectors increased the frequency and breadth of responses. Adenovirus vectors elicit potent effector and central memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Together, the MCMV prime/AdV boost may offer advantages in induction of a diverse T cell memory response to CHIKV epitopes resulting in a more protective phenotype.
