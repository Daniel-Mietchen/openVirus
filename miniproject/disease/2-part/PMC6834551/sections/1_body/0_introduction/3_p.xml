<p>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have been implicated as a major contributor to joint inflammation during CHIKV infection of mice. Footpad injection of C57BL/6 mice with CHIKV results in edema, arthritis, and tenosynovitis in the ankle joint, as well as necrosis in the musculoskeletal tissues (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Infiltrating cells in the ankle include CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Mice lacking CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have reduced inflammation of the footpad after infection, but viral levels in the blood and ankle are similar to control mice (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Adoptive transfer of CHIKV-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells into TCR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice also resulted in increased footpad swelling and joint vascular leakage compared to controls after CHIKV infection, while viral load in the blood remained the same as controls (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Furthermore, therapeutic administration of mice with CTLA4-Ig after CHIKV infection inhibited T cell recruitment to the ankle and decreased footpad swelling (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In contrast to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, depletion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells fails to reduce footpad swelling (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This data supports a pathogenic role for CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells but the role for CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells remains unclear. Some evidence suggest T cells promote viral clearance during CHIKV infection. Mice lacking B and T cells (Rag1
 <sup>−/−</sup> or Rag2
 <sup>−/−</sup>) develop more severe persistent infections characterized by chronic viremia and persistence of infectious virus in a number of tissues (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies into Rag1
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice fails to clear CHIKV in tissues of persistently infected animals (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In addition, mice lacking mature B cells (μMT mice) vaccinated with an inactivated CHIKV vaccine have decreased levels of virus in the serum compared to control-vaccinated mice after CHIKV challenge, although the vaccinated mice also had increased footpad swelling (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This suggests that vaccine-elicited T cells can provide limited protection, but this was not directly tested. Combined, these data are suggestive of a role of cellular immunity in protection against CHIKV infection.
