  <p>AdV-260 and AdV-451 vaccination elicits T cells responses and protects mice from CHIKV in ipsilateral calf. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mice were vaccinated with AdV-260 and/or AdV-451 or PBS (i.m.). Mice were infected i.m. with 10,000 PFU CHIKV SL15649. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Prior to CHIKV challenge, IFNγ ELISpot assays were performed on a subset of vaccinated mice (
