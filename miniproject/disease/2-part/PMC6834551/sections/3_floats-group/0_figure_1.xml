  <p>IFNγ responses in C57BL/6 mice at 7 and 14 days post CHIKV infection. Mice were infected with 1,000 PFU CHIKV SL15649 in the footpad. At 7 or 14 dpi, mouse splenocytes were isolated and incubated with individual CHIKV 18-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids and 1e5 cells were incubated on IFNγ ELISpot plates. At 48 h post incubation, ELISpot plates were washed and analyzed for spot formation. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Splenocytes from three mice were pooled and incubated with each individual CHIKV 18-mer in the CHIKV peptidome. Peptide numbers for reactive samples are indicated. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> IFNγ- eliciting peptides from 
   <bold>(A)</bold> were repeated by ELISpot for two additional animals infected for 7 or 14 days. “LOD” indicates limit of detection.
