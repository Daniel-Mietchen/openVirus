   <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion reverses the protective effect of the CHKVf5 vaccine. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mice vaccinated with MCMV-CHKVf5 and boosted with AdV-CHKVf5, or control vectors were treated with 300 Î¼g rat isotype control, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, or anti-CD4 plus anti-CD8 depleting antibodies at 2 days prior to challenge. Mice were infected i.m. with 10,000 PFU CHIKV SL15649, and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> ankle and calf tissue viral loads were measured by limiting dilution plaque assays. Statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed data using Dunn's multiple comparison test (**
