  <p>MCMV and AdV vaccine vector expression of the CHKVf5 fusion gene. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Shown is the genomic position of the CHIKV peptides contained in CHIKVf5. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The CHIKVf5 fusion gene contains amino acid sequences for peptide 47, 416, and 451 as well as a 308 amino acid portion of nsp4, separated by 2 Gly residues. A Câ€² terminal HA epitope (8 amino acids) was added for detection purposes. The CHKVf5 fusion gene was inserted into MCMV as a C-terminal fusion with IE2 and into a replication defective adenovirus 5 vector (deleted of E1 and E3). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Recombinant MCMV and AdV expressing CHKVf5 vectors were tested for HA expression in transduced NIH 3T3 cells. Cell lysates were analyzed at 1 dpi for HA and the loading controls actin or GAPDH.
