<p>The testing of MN titers of individual serum is labour intensive and time consuming. Hence, we determined whether serum specimens from different individuals can be pooled together for MN testing. From each age group, we have pooled serum specimens from all individuals and the MN titers against H1N1-pre and H1N1-inter were determined. The difference of MN titers between H1N1-pre and H1N1-inter for all age groups was within one dilution, except for the age group 60â€“69 for which the MN titer of H1N1-inter was four-fold lower than that of H1N1-pre (
