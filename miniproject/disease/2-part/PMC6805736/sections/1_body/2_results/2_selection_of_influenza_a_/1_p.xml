<p>Phylogenetic analysis showed that A(H3N2) clade 3C.2a2 and 3C.2a1b predominated in the 2017 summer epidemic in Hong Kong. However, only 3C.2a1b rapidly increased in 2018, accounting for 76% of the strains tested between April and September of 2018 (

In the antigenic analysis by the World Health Organisation, A(H3N2) virus strains in the clade 3C.2a1b have different antigenic characteristic from strains in the clade 3C.2a2. Hence, for H3N2-pre, we have chosen a strain that belongs to clade 3C.2a2 (A/Hong Kong/656/2018; GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_312267). In the antigenic analysis by the World Health Organisation, A/Hong Kong/656/2018 is antigenically similar to egg-passaged A/Switzerland/8060/17, which is the recommended H3N2 vaccine strain [
