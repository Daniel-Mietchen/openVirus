<p>Some studies have tested post-vaccination human serum with emerging strains [

However, the data is not useful in predicting population susceptibility to emerging strains in areas with a low-vaccine uptake rate. In Hong Kong, the overall seasonal influenza uptake rate was only 14.8% as of 3 March 2019 [

The vaccination rate for those not eligible in the government vaccination program, such as young healthy adults without chronic medical illness, is likely to be lower. Since A(H1N1) disproportionately affects the younger population, our study approach is particularly relevant.
