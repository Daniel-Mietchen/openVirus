<p>Although the predominant influenza virus strains of a particular influenza subtype during an influenza season can only be ascertained after the influenza season has begun, these can be predicted by analysing the influenza virus strains collected during the interepidemic period. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref>, HA S183P substitution, which was found in most A(H1N1) strains collected in the 2018/19 winter influenza season, showed a clear trend of increase since the last A(H1N1) predominant season in 2015/16 winter. Our approach, which used representative emerging influenza strains collected during the interepidemic period, provides population susceptibility data before an epidemic has been started. The population susceptibility data that are available before an epidemic would guide resource allocation.
