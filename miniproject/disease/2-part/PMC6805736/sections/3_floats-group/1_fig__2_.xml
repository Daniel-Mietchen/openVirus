 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic tree of HA showing the genetic relationship of influenza A(H3N2) in Hong Kong. Nucleotide sequences were downloaded from GISAID (Supplementary Table S2). All influenza A(H3N2) strains from Hong Kong available at GISAID as of 7 January 2019 are included. Vaccine strains recommended by the World Health Organisation are highlighted in blue. H3N2-pre and H3N2-inter used in the MN assay are highlighted in green and red, respectively. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum-likelihood method with the best-fit substitution model HKY + G. Bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 trees.</p>
