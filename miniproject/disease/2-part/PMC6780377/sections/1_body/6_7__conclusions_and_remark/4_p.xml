<p>The inflammatory response is activated in host cells during DENV infection to clear the pathogen from the host immune system. Whenever the host senses the presence of the DENV virus, activation of innate and inflammatory pathways occurs as a means of eliminating the disease. Alternation of host responses is a hallmark of dengue infection, whereby weak innate immunity and inflammatory response may lead to parasite growth and disease advancement. Again, excessive inflammation may be the reason behind the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease. In that case, a reduction of proinflammatory molecules can help to decrease dengue-induced vascular leakage. In summary, we require a better understanding of host innate and inflammatory pathways, as this information can help to identify appropriate targets. Targeting such inhibitors may result in antiviral drug development (focusing on blocking inflammation and endothelial barrier permeability) without interfering with the host immune mechanisms. Resolving the issues discussed in this work can yield more comprehensive knowledge about DENV and related host factors that can be utilized in novel therapeutic targets for the development of anti-DENV drugs.</p>
