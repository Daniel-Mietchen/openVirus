<p>In most cases, DENV transmission is accomplished by the primary vectors, whereby 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> have long been recognized as hosts for the viruses [

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> is the most common primary epidemic-causing and predominant vector of dengue [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other species that act as secondary vectors for carrying DENV include 
 <italic>Aedes scutellaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> (subgenus Stegomyia) and 
 <italic>Aedes niveus</italic> (subgenus Finlaya), which are considered as sylvatic vectors. Meanwhile, other species such as 
 <italic>Aedes taylorior</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes furcifer</italic> (subgenus Diceromyia), as well as 
 <italic>Aedes mediovittatus</italic> (Gymnometopa) and 
 <italic>Aedes triseriatus</italic> (Protomacleaya) also play key roles as secondary dengue vectors for carrying dengue infectious virus [
