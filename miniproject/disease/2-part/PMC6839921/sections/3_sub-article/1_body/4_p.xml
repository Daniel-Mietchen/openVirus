<p>In this study, the authors demonstrate an important role for liver Kupffer cells in the clearance of alphaviruses from the circulation of infected mice. Clearance requires scavenger receptors and studies in knockout mice indicate that MARCO might be the KC receptor responsible for alphavirus clearance from the circulation. Further, the authors characterize the specific lysine residues in the viral E2 glycoproteins that are critical for viral clearance.</p>
