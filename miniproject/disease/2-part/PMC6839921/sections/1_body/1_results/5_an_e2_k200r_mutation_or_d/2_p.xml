<p>To investigate if expression of MARCO also influences viremia and viral dissemination following subcutaneous inoculation of virus, we inoculated MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice subcutaneously with WT CHIKV and evaluated viral burdens at 1 d post-inoculation. Similar to infection of WT mice with CHIKV E2 K200R, infection of MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice with WT CHIKV resulted in an elevated viremia and more rapid viral dissemination to distal sites including the right ankle and quadriceps compared with infection of WT mice (
