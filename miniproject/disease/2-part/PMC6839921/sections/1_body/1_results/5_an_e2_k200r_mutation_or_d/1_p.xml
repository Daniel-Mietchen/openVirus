<p>To evaluate if phagocytic-cell mediated clearance of blood-borne virus has implications following a more natural route of infection, we inoculated mice subcutaneously with WT or E2 K200R viruses and evaluated viral burdens in various tissues at 1 d post-inoculation. Viral burdens in the serum were significantly higher in mice inoculated with E2 K200R strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that phagocytic cell-mediated clearance is an important immune mechanism to control viremia following subcutaneous inoculation. Moreover, although viral burdens were similar in tissues proximal to the site of inoculation (i.e, the L. ankle), significantly elevated levels of virus were detected in the contralateral right ankle of mice infected with E2 K200R strains (
