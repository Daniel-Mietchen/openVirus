<p>CHIKV strains used include Asian strain AF15561 (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ashbrook et al., 2014</xref>), Asian-American strain 99659 (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2017</xref>), ECSA stain SL15649 (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>), and WA strain 37997 (
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Vanlandingham et al., 2005b</xref>). All CHIKV stocks were derived from infectious cDNA clones by electroporating RNA into BHK-21 cells, as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>), with the exception of virus used in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, which was a propagated P1 stock of AF15561 generated in human dermal fibroblasts. Unless otherwise noted, AF15561 was used as the representative CHIKV strain. RRV strains used include SN11 (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), T48 (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Doherty and Whitehead, 1963</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 1991</xref>), and DC5692 (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Jupille et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Lindsay, 1996</xref>). SN11 is a clinical isolate that was passed 1x on C6/36 cells before we propagated a stock in BHK-21 cells (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), while T48 and DC5692 were derived from cDNA clones by electroporation of viral RNA into BHK-21 cells as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2006</xref>). For some experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7â€”figure supplement 1C</xref>), viral particles were propagated in serum free media and purified by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 24,000 x g for 6 hr. Unless otherwise noted, SN11 was used as the representative RRV strain. ONNV SG650 was derived from a cDNA clone through electroporation into BHK-21 cells, and propagated on BHK-21 cells for one passage to increase titer. Mutant variants used were described previously, (AF15561 E2 K200R [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hawman et al., 2017</xref>]; T48-DC5692 E1/6K [RR73] [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Jupille et al., 2011</xref>], T48-DC5692 E2/E3 [RR100] [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Jupille et al., 2011</xref>], and T48 E2 R251K [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Jupille et al., 2013</xref>]) or were generated through site-directed mutagenesis of cDNA clones. Mutant virus stocks were sequenced to confirm the presence of introduced mutations. All viruses were titered by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells or by RT-qPCR. The cDNA clone of CHIKV 99659 was a gift from Mark Heise (University of North Carolina), the cDNA clones of CHIKV 37997 and ONNV SG650 were gifts from Stephen Higgs (Kansas State University), and RRV SN11 was a gift from John Aaskov (Queensland University of Technology).
