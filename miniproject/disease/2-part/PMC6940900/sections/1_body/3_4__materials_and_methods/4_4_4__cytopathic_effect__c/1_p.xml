<p>MDCK cells were cultured in 96-well microplates at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well for 24 h and infected with 100 TCID50 H1N1, H1N1-H275Y or H3N2 virus for 2 h. The cells were cultured in maintenance medium (DMEM containing 2 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin) and treated with 0.2% DMSO (a vehicle to dissolve test compounds) or different concentrations of test chemicals. Cell viability was measured with CCK-8 reagent as previously mentioned after 48 h of incubation. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by determining the concentrations of the compounds needed to inhibit 50% CPE against the compound concentrations. GraphPad Prism 5 was used as fitting software. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) against MDCK cells was determined by procedures similar to those for EC
 <sub>50</sub> determination without virus infection. The inhibition rate was calculated using the following equation [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]: inhibition rate (%) = [(A − B)/ (C − B)] × 100, where A: mean optical density of test, B: mean optical density of virus controls, C: mean optical density of cell controls.
