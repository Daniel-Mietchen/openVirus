<p>We tried to explore the potential mechanisms by which NC-5 inhibits influenza infection. The complete life cycle of the influenza virus is approximately 8–10 h and it is divided into the following three stages: virus entry (0–2 h), viral genome replication and translation (2–8 h), and progeny virion release (8–10 h) [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-06261" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A time-of-addition experiment was performed via adding NC-5 to influenza-infected cells at different stages of the virus replication cycle and then measuring the relative level of NP and M1 proteins 10 h later. The cells were co-incubated with the virus at 4 °C for 1 h, then, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice, the cells were cultured at 37 °C. Two milliliters of medium was added to each well and NC-5 (80 μM) was added at 0–2 h, 2–4 h, 4–6 h, 6–8 h, and 8–10 h post-infection. When NC-5 was added during the replication stage and release stage (4–6 h or 6–8 h after infection), the M1 protein level was significantly reduced with an inhibition rate of 48.2% in 6–8 h (

However, in the adsorption stage or the early biosynthesis stage (0–2 h or 2–4 h after infection), no inhibitory activity was observed. The results suggest that NC-5 may disrupt RNA polymerase-mediated transcription and replication as well as the virus assembly and release stages. However, the results of the luciferase experiments did not indicate inhibition of RNA polymerase compared with the DMSO control (
