<p>The results of the Western blot analysis, conducted to investigate the influence of NC-5 on H1N1 virus NP and M1 protein level, showed that NC-5 could significantly decrease the expression of NP and M1 protein (

This result was also supported by the fluorescence microscopy observations of the NP distribution in the host cell (
