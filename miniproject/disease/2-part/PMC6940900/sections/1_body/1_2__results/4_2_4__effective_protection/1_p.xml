<p>A dose-response study in a virus-infected murine model was designed to evaluate the efficacy of NC-5 against the influenza virus in vivo. Body weight, survival and clinical manifestations were recorded for 14 days. The mice infected with wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant viruses presented with severe clinical manifestations, including a ruffled coat, inappetence, inactivity, shudder and body weight loss three days after infection. Among mice infected with H1N1, those given saline died on day eight, while mice being given NC-5 (100 mg/kg/d) or OS (100 mg/kg/d) both had a survival rate of 80% (
