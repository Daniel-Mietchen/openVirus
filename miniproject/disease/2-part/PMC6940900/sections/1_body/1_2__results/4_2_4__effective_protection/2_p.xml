<p>On the fifth day post-infection, five mice in each group were sacrificed for lung pathology examination. NC-5 treatment also led to an obvious reduction in influenza-induced lung pathology. As shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f006">Figure 6</xref>E, severe hyperemia appeared in the alveolar walls, and the spaces between the alveolar walls were filled with moderate inflammatory infiltrates of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in the H1N1 and H1N1-H275Y virus-infected models as well as in mice given OS following infection with H1N1-H275Y. The lungs of mice given NC-5 exhibited reduced histopathological symptomatic changes in a dose-dependent manner. The lung parameters showed that treatment with NC-5 could significantly decrease the lung index and lung injury score (

The lung parameters of mice infected with H1N1-H275Y and the mice administered OS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-06261-f006">Figure 6</xref>C,D, lung index: 1.2, lung injury score: 7.3) were similar to those of the corresponding models (lung index: 1.4, lung injury score: 7.7), while the groups that received NC-5 at 100 mg/kg/d showed a significant improvement in condition (lung index: 1.0, lung injury score: 3.5). The results above and other parameters indicate that NC-5 could prolong survival, release pathological changes in the lungs and reduce body weight loss. NC-5 demonstrates potent therapeutic efficacy in vivo against wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses.
