<p>Currently, no treatments with proven efficacy are approved for the treatment of HPIV infections. Corticosteroids, generally dexamethasone and budesonide, are associated with fewer clinic visits and admissions for croup and the reduced use of nebulized epinephrine (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We initially misdiagnosed our patient in Case 2 as having COP and administered corticosteroids. The efficacy of corticosteroid administration in immunocompetent adult patients with HPIV pneumonia is not known. Some data suggest favorable effects on varicella-zoster virus (in combination with acyclovir) and hantavirus (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Further studies are needed to clarify the significance of corticosteroids as a treatment option for primary HPIV pneumonia in immunocompetent patients. However, much of the available data for the use of antiviral agents in the treatment of HPIV comes from immunocompromised patients. The efficacy of antiviral drugs in immunocompetent adults with HPIV pneumonia has not been fully evaluated, and thus further studies are needed.
