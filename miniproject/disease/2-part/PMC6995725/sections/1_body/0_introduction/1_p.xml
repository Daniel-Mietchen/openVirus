<p>Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. Compared with findings in studies of HPIV infection in children, less is known about these infections in adults. In previous studies, 0.2 to 11.5% of hospitalized patients with pneumonia were found to have HPIV infection (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); however, the characteristics of primary viral pneumonia due to HPIV are not well known. We recently experienced two cases of pneumonia in which HPIV-1 was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and confirmed by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (Fast Track Diagnostics Resp 21 Kit, Silema, Malta), which detects the following respiratory pathogens: influenza A and B viruses; coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus A/B; rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus A/B; adenovirus; enterovirus; human parechovirus; bocavirus; and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>. We herein report these cases and review the clinical and radiological features.
