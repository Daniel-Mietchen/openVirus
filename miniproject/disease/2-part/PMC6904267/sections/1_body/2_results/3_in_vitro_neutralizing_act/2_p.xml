<p>Next, the ability of MMAb 10G12 to rescue HAdVs infection was investigated to explore potential therapeutic effects. HAdV-7 or HAdV-55 with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub> were added to 96-well plates containing 85–95% confluent monolayers of A549 cells and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Purified 10G12 was then serially diluted 2-fold from 25 to 0.1 μg/ml, added to infected A549 cells and incubated for 1 week at 37°C. Anti-DENV1 and anti-EGFR antibodies served as negative controls. Infected cells were observed under a microscope and the number of holes in cells with lesions was counted. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, even at 1 h after infection, 3.2 μg/ml 10G12 could rescue 100% of cells infected with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub> HAdV-7, and none of the cells at this dilution displayed lesions. Even 0.8 μg/ml 10G12 could protect 25% of cells infected with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub> HAdV-7. Furthermore, even 25 μg/ml 10G12 was unable to rescue A549 cells infected with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub> HAdV-55. These findings indicate that MMAb 10G12 exhibited potent therapeutic effects against HAdV-7.
