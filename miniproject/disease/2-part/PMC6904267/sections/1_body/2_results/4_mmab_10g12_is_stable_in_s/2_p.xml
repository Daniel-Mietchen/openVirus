<p>To test the MMAb stability in PB at different pH values, purified 10G12 was diluted in PB at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0, and incubated at 37Â°C for 5 or 8 days. ELISA assays were then performed to detect whether samples still efficiently recognized HAdV-7. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, samples diluted in PB at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 after 8 days of incubation still had the same binding activity as those before incubation. These results indicate that MMAb 10G12 is stable in serum and PB at different pH values.
