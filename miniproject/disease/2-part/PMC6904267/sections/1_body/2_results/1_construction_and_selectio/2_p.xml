<p>In total, 11 positive clones were identified from samples after the third round of panning against HAdV-7, and their ability to interact with HAdV-7 is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. These phagemids were extracted and each insert was sequenced. The results revealed five unique full-size scFv sequences among the 11 clones (10G12, 6H9, 10D7, 8G10, 6B10, 10G4, and 1C9 shared the same sequence; 5H4 had the wrong sequence). V
 <sub>H</sub> and V
 <sub>L</sub> of 10G12, 10A4, 1B1, and 5D12 were recloned into pMABG1 or pMABKa to generate murine IgG1 molecules. Although these four antibodies were specific to HAdV-7, 10A4, 1B1, and 5D12 did not exhibit neutralizing activity (data not shown). Thus, subsequent experiments only characterized 10G12.
