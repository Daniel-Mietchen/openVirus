<p>Wells of ELISA assay plates (9018, Costar, USA) were coated with 200 ng antigen and incubated overnight at 4°C. Wells were then blocked with 200 μl of 5% (w/v) skimmed milk-PBS for 2 h at 37°C, and 200 μl of antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween (0.1% v/v), and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated IgG antibody (1:5,000, v/v) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Finally, three rounds of washing with PBS-Tween were carried out, and detection at 492 and 630 nm was performed using OPD chromogen substrate.</p>
