<p>To test the ability of MMAb to rescue HAdVs infection, 100 μl of A549 cells (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were seeded in each well of 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Next, 100 μl samples of HAdV-7 or HAdV-55 with 100TCID
 <sub>50</sub> were added to 96-well plates containing 85–95% confluent A549 cell monolayers and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Purified 10G12 was serially diluted 2-fold from 25 to 0.1 μg/ml in DMEM without Phenol Red and serum, and 100 μl aliquots of each dilution were added to 96-well plates and incubated for 1 week at 37°C. Anti-DENV1 and anti-EGFR antibodies served as negative controls. Infected cells were observed under a microscope and the number of holes in cells with lesions was counted.
