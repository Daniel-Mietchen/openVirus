<p>MMAb 10G12 is a murine neutralizing antibody like 6A7, 3F11, and 3D8 (Tian et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>). Monoclonal antibodies of mouse origin can induce human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) responses, which restricts the use of MMAb in humans (Hertel et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). The first MMAb, Muromonab, has been on the market since 1992, and humanized antibodies based on murine MAb are increasingly being developed (Makulska-Nowak, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). In future work, MMAb 10G12 may be further humanized for therapeutic use.
