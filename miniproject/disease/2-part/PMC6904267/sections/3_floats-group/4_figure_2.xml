  <p>Stability of 10G12 in serum and PB at different pH values. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> ELISA analysis of the binding between HAdV-7 and MMAb 10G12 in serum. Purified 10G12 was diluted in fetal bovine serum to 25 μg/ml and incubated at 37°C for 3, 7, and 10 days. ELISA assays were performed with 200 ng of inactivated HAdV-7 per well. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> ELISA analysis of binding between HAdV-7 and MMAb 10G12 in PB at different pH values. Purified 10G12 was diluted in PB at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 and incubated at 37°C for day 5 and 8. ELISA assays were performed with 200 ng inactivated HAdV-7 per well. Data were obtained from two separate experiments, and results are presented as means ± SD (**
