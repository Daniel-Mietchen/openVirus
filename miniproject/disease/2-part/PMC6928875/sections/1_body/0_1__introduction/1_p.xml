<p>Enteroviruses are non-enveloped viruses belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> that are associated with important human and mammalian diseases. Enteroviruses have non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes that measure around 7.5 kilobases [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are 15 species in the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, namely, 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> A to L and 
 <italic>Rhinovirus</italic> A to C. Among members of the species 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> A, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are two of the most common causes of recurrent community outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) among children worldwide and particularly in the Asia–Pacific region. For example, in mainland China, recurrent large outbreaks of HFMD involving &gt;120,000–600,000 patients have been reported since 1998 [

 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Importantly, severe EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections are associated with life-threatening complications, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with respiratory failure, and death [
