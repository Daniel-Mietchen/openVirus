  <p>Antiviral effects of the identified fatty acids against EV-A71 (
   <bold>A</bold>) and CV-A16 (
   <bold>B</bold>). RD cells were seeded into 96-well plates to reach 90% confluency for infection and then pre-incubated with lipid-supplemented medium at the following concentrations for 2 h: AA and DPA = 100 µM, DHA = 50 µM, and EPA = 60 µM. The lipids were dissolved in 2% ethanol and 2% ethanol alone was used as “Control”. The cells were then infected with either EV-A71 or CV-A16 (MOI = 10.0). At 1 hpi, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) and then replenished with lipid-supplemented medium for 4 h of incubation. The cell lysates were then collected for qRT-PCR. Data represented means and standard deviations. Abbreviations: AA, arachidonic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; DPA, docosapentaenoic acid; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; hpi, hours post-infection.
