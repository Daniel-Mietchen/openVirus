<p id="Par18">In 2017, low dengue incidence rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), atypically high numbers of biweeks with lower than expected dengue incidence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and negative country-level effects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and c) indicate a reduction in dengue incidence in Brazil and Colombia. Utilizing available Zika case data, we were unable to establish a direct link between this reduction and the Zika epidemic. It is important to note that there are limitations to using passive surveillance data (as we have done here), particularly when novel pathogens are involved. In the case of ZIKV invasion in the Americas, many cases that occurred early in the epidemic were not reported, since it took time to first identify the presence of ZIKV and then to establish reporting protocols. The unavailability of Zika case count data during the height of the ZIKV epidemic in northeast Brazil, one of the most severely affected regions

 </sup>, may have contributed to our inability to identify a relationship between cumulative Zika cases and observed dengue incidence. In both Brazil and Colombia, misclassified cases (potentially resulting from shared symptoms between case definitions of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya) also may have restricted our ability to detect such a relationship. Other factors such as climatological effects
