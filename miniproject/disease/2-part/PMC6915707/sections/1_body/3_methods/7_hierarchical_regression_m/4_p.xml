 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>year</sub> and

 <italic>i</italic> ranges over the subnational locations and 
 <italic>j</italic> ranges over the 26 biweeks. These coefficients allow for seasonal differences in transmission intensity at the subnational level. Additionally, there is an offset for year-specific subnational population size (
