<p id="Par26">To avoid negative biweekly incidence values, we constructed strictly nondecreasing upper, middle, and lower approximations of the cumulative time series. Working backward from the most recent time point, we accounted for decreases in the cumulative count by either subtracting the difference from all previous time points (lower approximation) or by setting the higher incidence equal to the lower incidence in the following biweek (upper approximation). This process was repeated for all time points, resulting in a strictly nondecreasing time series. The middle approximation is constructed by averaging the values of the upper and lower approximation at each time point.</p>
