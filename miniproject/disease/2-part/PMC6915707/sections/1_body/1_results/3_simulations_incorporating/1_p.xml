<p id="Par16">We tested whether immune-mediated interactions between DENV and ZIKV could produce the dengue dynamics observed in Brazil and Colombia by simulating the arrival of Zika in a dengue endemic population (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). We used a stochastic compartmental model that incorporated combinations of cross-protection or enhancement between the two viruses (see “Methods” for further details). We performed simulations in which ZIKV was introduced to a population in which DENV was in a stable state as well as simulations that incorporated the sequential introduction of dengue over the decades preceding the ZIKV introduction reflecting the observed detection of DENV serotypes

 </sup> (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref> for sample simulations from both settings). In simulations where ZIKV infection temporarily reduces an individual’s risk of DENV infection by 80%, Zika epidemics are followed by a trough in dengue incidence ranging from 2.2 years to 3.5 years depending on the enhancement scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i–l</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Even in the absence of enhancement between DENV and ZIKV, multiple simulations showed increases in dengue after troughs ranging from a 1.3-fold increase to a 2.7-fold increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Based on our simulations, which assumed that cross-protection lasts one year on average, the time until dengue resurgence (trough duration) would likely be longer than the assumed one-year duration of cross-protection. In all scenarios, suppression of DENV transmission resulted in subsequent increases in DENV prevalence, suggesting that the low period of incidence observed in 2017 may be followed by large increases in DENV.
