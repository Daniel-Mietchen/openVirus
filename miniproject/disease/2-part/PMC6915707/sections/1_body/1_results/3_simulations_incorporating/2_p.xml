<p id="Par17">We also tested the impact of correlation in ZIKV and DENV transmission intensity on observed associations between cumulative ZIKV and DENV incidence (see Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). We consistently observed a reduced impact of ZIKV on dengue in simulations where DENV transmissibility was assumed to be higher. When the transmissibility of ZIKV and DENV were assumed to be equal, reductions in DENV due to cross protection were not larger in simulations with higher ZIKV attack rates as the impact of ZIKV was offset by increased DENV transmissibility. These results are consistent with an unclear or variable relationship between DENV reductions and cumulative ZIKV incidence as we have observed in the data.
