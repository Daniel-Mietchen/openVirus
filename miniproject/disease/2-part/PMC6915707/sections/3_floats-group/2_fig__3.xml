  <title>Spatial hierarchical biweekly dengue incidence models.</title>
  <p>Shared coefficients from the year model are highlighted in yellow. Shared effect coefficients for Brazil (
   <bold>a</bold>) and Colombia (
   <bold>c</bold>). Zika and chikungunya coefficients are estimated from autoregressive dengue models. Positive (negative) coefficients indicate increases (decreases) in expected dengue incidence for the year model and indirectly as effects on transmission for the Zika and chikungunya models. Shared year multipliers for expected dengue incidence are shown for Brazil (
   <bold>b</bold>) and Colombia (
   <bold>d</bold>). The top row of panels b and d are translated from coefficients in (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>c</bold>). Other rows display subnational effects (combined shared and location-specific effects). Mean and 95% credible intervals (CrI) are shown. Intervals that overlap zero are displayed in gray.
