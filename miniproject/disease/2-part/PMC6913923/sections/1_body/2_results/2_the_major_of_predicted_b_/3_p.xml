<p>The similarity level observed among the epitopes of each orthohantavirus compared was shown in

  <bold>Table</bold> 2
 </xref>. Firstly, when compared to other orthohantavirus nucleoproteins, while SHNP presented only intermediary and high similarity levels (62% to 99%), we found B-cell epitopes from very low to high similarity (11% to 100%). The majority of predicted linear B-cell epitopes on SHNP were highly conserved in comparison with orthohantavirus associated with HFRS and to orthohantavirus associated with HCPS. The epitopes SHNP
 <sub>(G145-K173)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(P182-G196)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(T347-F361)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(Q363-I380)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(D394-E405)</sub> presented an conservation degree ranged from 67% to 100%, being the sequence SHNP
 <sub>(Q363-I380)</sub> the most conserved epitope, with an similarity level of 100% when compared to the most of orthohantavirus associated to HFRS and 94% when compared to virus or isolates associated with HCPS (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Besides, the predicted epitopes SHNP
 <sub>(K30-E48)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub> presented high conservation degrees (ranged from 84% to 95% and 77% to 97%, respectively) in comparison with to the most of orthohantaviruses associated to HFRS and intermediary degree (ranged from 47% to 53% and 51% to 56%, respectively) when compared to sequences of virus or isolates associated to HCPS. Remarkably, the predicted epitopes SHNP
 <sub>(P182-G196)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> were considered specific to 
 <italic>Seoul orthohantavirus</italic>, once both presenting 100% of similarity with Gou specie and low level of conservancy (ranged from 14% to 21% and 11%; respectively) in comparison with orthohantavirus associated HCPS.
