<p>In order to verify the specificity of predicted B-cell epitopes, the reactivity against rSHNP, rJHNP, SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110),</sub> SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub> were tested by ELISA against samples from mice immunized with both recombinant proteins, rSHNP and rJHNP and with non-immunized mice, at dilution of 1:100.
