<p>Despite the increasing use of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches to predict epitopes against several diseases, the experimental validation of predicted sequences remains scarce, despite being a critical step to the development of novel vaccines and diagnostic tools. In this context, this was the first study reporting the experimental validation of specific B-cell linear epitopes against orthohantavirus, resulting in the recognition of SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> epitopes as promising targets to further development of monoclonal antibodies and/or highly-specific tools to HFRS orthohantavirus diagnosis. Moreover, about the non-reactivity of predicted epitope SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub> and considering the use of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> strategies to select B-cell epitopes, the oligomerization mode of selected target seems to be an important aspect to epitope selection. Here, we initially predicted three specifics B-cell epitopes in HFRS orthohantavirus and evaluated their localization in tertiary monomeric structure of SHNP, considering all epitopes exposed in protein surface. Controversially, considering that nucleoprotein oligomerizes in dimeric or hexameric forms [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we believed that the non-reactivity of epitope SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub> could be explained by its localization in quaternary structure.
