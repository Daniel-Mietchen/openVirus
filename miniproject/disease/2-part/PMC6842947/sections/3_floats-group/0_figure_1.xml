  <p>Design of the NCRD of iSP-D. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Amino acid sequence alignment of the CRD sequences from human SP-D (hSP-D, Genbank accession code: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="X65018" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">X65018</ext-link>) and porcine SP-D (pSP-D, AF132496). Residue numbering according to hSP-D sequence. Dashes indicate spaces that are inserted to maximize the identity across the alignment. The residues that comprise the neck region of hSP-D are underlined (residues #203-#235). Dots indicate identical residues between hSP-D and pSP-D. Dashes indicate spaces inserted to maximize the identity across the alignment. Mutated residues in hSP-D that generate iSP-D are shaded in magenta, blue and green. The 
   <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site at #303 in the CRD of pSP-D is indicated (orange box). The secondary structural regions are indicated as gray arrows (β-sheets) and dark gray bars (α-helices), deduced from the crystal structure of rat SP-A (
   <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). SP-D groove regions (delineated), cysteines (bold) and cysteine bridges (black dotted lines/arrows), and key residues necessary for coordination of Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>-ions and hydroxyl groups of oligosaccharides (asterisks) are also indicated. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Tertiary protein structure of the neckCRD of SP-D. Shown is a ribbon diagram of the NCRD of hSP-D (blue, PDB accession no. 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="3G81" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">3G81</ext-link>) overlayed with that of pSP-D (brown, PDB accession no. 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="4DN8" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">4DN8</ext-link>). A bound α-methyl mannoside as stick representation in yellow is visualized to illustrate the lectin binding pocket and 3 calcium ions are shown as black spheres. Modifications of hSP-D present in iSP-D are highlighted with deviating colors: the 326
   <sup>GSS</sup>-insertion (magenta), and the Asp324Asn and Asp330Asn mutations (blue; also indicated with blue arrows). Location of the N-linked glycan in the CRD of pSP-D is shown in orange sticks. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Surface representation of the neckCRD of pSP-D. Shown is the neck region (light blue) and the CRD (brown) of pSP-D (PDB accession no 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="4DN8" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">4DN8</ext-link>) with porcine-specific residues mutated into hSP-D highlighted in different colors: the 326
   <sup>GSS</sup>-insertion (magenta), and the Man8-contact residues Glu251, Gln287, and Lys289 (green). Calcium ions are only partly visible on the surface (black).
