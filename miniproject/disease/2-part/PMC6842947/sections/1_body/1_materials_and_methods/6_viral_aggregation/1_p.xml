<p>SP-D-mediated aggregation of IAV particles was determined with A/Aichi/68 (H3N2) and carried out as described previously (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). For both hSP-D and iSP-D, preparations of 4.0 Î¼g/ml were mixed with a suspension of virus in a final volume of 1 ml. During stirring, the light transmission was monitored for 12 min using an SLM/Aminco 8000C spectrofluorimeter (excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 nm). Viral aggregation resulted in an increase in light transmission, and results were expressed as a percentage of control light transmission at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0. As a negative control, virus without addition of SP-D was included. Experiments were performed five times, and statistical analysis was performed with the Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.
