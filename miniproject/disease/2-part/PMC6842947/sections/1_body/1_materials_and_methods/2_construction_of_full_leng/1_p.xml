<p>Full-length recombinant iSP-D was generated based upon the full-length hSP-D cDNA clone provided by Dr. E. C. Crouch [Washington University, St. Louis, USA; (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)]. This clone was used as a template for PCR cloning into pCR4-TOPO to introduce a BsmBI/BamHI (5′-end) and NotI (3′-end) restriction site to accommodate subcloning in expression vector pUPE-101.01, as previously described for construction of the expression clone for full-length pSP-D (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The expression vector pUPE-101.01 is a modified version of the pTT3 expression vector (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The full-length human SP-D clone in PCR4-TOPO was used as a template to introduce the 8 porcine-specific aa residue mutations in 5 subsequent rounds of site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension PCR using the Quikchange II site-directed mutagenesis kit. After each round of site-directed mutagenesis, the obtained hSP-D PCR4-TOPO clone was verified by sequence analysis and used as a template to perform the next round of site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis primer pairs used are listed below; all DNA sequences described are 5′ to 3′ with desired nt mutations underlined. Round 1, 326
