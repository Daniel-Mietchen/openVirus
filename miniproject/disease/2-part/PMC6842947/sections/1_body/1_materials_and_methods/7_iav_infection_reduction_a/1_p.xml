<p>To investigate SP-D-mediated inhibition of infection we used an infection reduction assay as previously described (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Briefly: 100 μl of increasing concentrations of SP-D (0–2,000 ng/ml) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of the respective virus preparations containing 3,000 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> diluted in PBS containing 1 mM of CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (PBS-CM). Peanut agglutinin, which was included as a negative control, failed to reduce the number of cells infected with any of the IAVs used (data not shown). The 4 viruses used in this study were: A/Netherlands/602/09 (H1N1), A/Commonteal/Netherlands/10/00 (H1N1), A/Swine/849/93 (H3N2), and A/Mallard/NL/1/07 (H3N2). Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to MDCK cells, incubated for 1 h at 37°C and after washing, the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C in culture medium without trypsin to prevent secondary infection of cells by IAV. After trypsinization, the obtained cell suspensions were fixed and stained with FITC-labeled monoclonal antibodies against viral nucleoprotein (DAKOCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow-cytometry using the DIVA software.
