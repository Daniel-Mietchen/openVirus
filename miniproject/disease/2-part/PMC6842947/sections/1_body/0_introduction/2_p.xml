<p>Pulmonary innate defense involves the secretion of soluble proteins that are capable of neutralizing IAV infectivity, several of which are members of the “collectin” family (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These collagenous lectins include surfactant protein D (SP-D), a large cruciform-shaped glycoprotein that exhibits strong antiviral properties, as demonstrated by many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)]. The dodecameric X-shaped configuration of SP-D results from the assembly of four trimeric arms, each of which contains an N-terminal collagenous domain that clusters three mannose-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent lectin domains (or carbohydrate recognition domains, CRDs) at the C-terminus of each arm. These trimeric CRDs facilitate multivalent, high-affinity interactions with the spike proteins on IAV, in particular the hemagglutinin (HA), a trimeric glycoprotein that mediates attachment of IAV to host cells via sialic acid (SA) receptor-mediated attachment (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This type of inhibition is highly conserved and described for SP-Ds from different animal species and is referred to as “β-type inhibition” since it involves Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent lectin-mediated binding between the CRD and high-mannose glycans present on HA. The importance of this interaction is demonstrated by loss of antiviral activity in the absence of calcium ions and by experiments with poorly glycosylated IAVs that are (more) resistant to SP-D-mediated neutralization (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Upon binding to SP-D, several mechanisms of IAV neutralization are initiated that include viral aggregation, blocking IAV attachment to the epithelium, and opsonization of IAV that results in enhanced clearance of IAV by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These antiviral properties depend, to a large extent, on the state of assembly of SP-D since many studies have demonstrated that trimeric SP-D is much less active in neutralizing IAV as compared to fully assembled, dodecameric or higher order multimers of SP-D (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Importantly, human SP-D (hSP-D) lacks the ability to bind 
 <italic>pandemic</italic> IAVs due to limited glycosylation of the HA head regions. Studies in mice infected with SP-D resistant pandemic IAVs demonstrated that this leads to increased morbidity and mortality (
