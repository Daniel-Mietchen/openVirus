<p>The potency of SP-D to bind and neutralize IAVs varies between different animal species and it was demonstrated previously that porcine SP-D (pSP-D) exhibits distinct antiviral activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> as compared to SP-Ds from other animal species including hSP-D and mouse SP-D (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Furthermore, unlike hSP-D, pSP-D is able to bind and neutralize pandemic IAVs (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The mechanisms that underlie the exceptional IAV-neutralizing properties of pSP-D have been studied in detail and it was shown that this mainly involves distinct structural features located in the CRD of pSP-D. pSP-D is glycosylated with a highly sialylated 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycan at Asn303 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) on its CRD that results in calcium-independent “γ-type inhibitor”-like activity, mediated by SA residues that interact with the conserved SA-receptor binding site located on the HA of all IAVs. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with pSP-D isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage as well as studies with recombinant pSP-D demonstrate that this “γ-inhibitor” mechanism not only enhances the overall activity but that it also broadens the range of viral strains that can be inhibited, including strains that are not neutralized by hSP-D (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, studies with 
 <italic>N</italic>-deglycosylated full-length pSP-D showed that its distinct antiviral activity can only in part be attributed to the presence of the N-linked glycan in the CRD of pSP-D (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Sequence analysis of pSP-D aligned with hSP-D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and crystallographic investigations with trimeric neckCRD (NCRD) recombinant fragments of pSP-D (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) revealed the presence of a unique tripeptide extension of the long loop in the CRD of SP-D, referred to as “326
 <sup>GSS</sup>” near the lectin site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A–C</xref>, shaded in magenta). Molecular dynamics simulations of this fragment complexed with oligomannose showed that this flexible tripeptide adopts a more stable conformation upon sugar binding and that the insertion possibly interacts with more distal portions of the branched mannoside. Docking studies with tri-antennary octamannose underlined that with a terminal mannoside bound in the lectin site, several contacts between another arm of the oligomannose showed potential to interact with the 326
 <sup>GSS</sup>-loop. Since this loop is absent in hSP-D, this could explain the distinct Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-mediated interactions between pSP-D and viral glycans as compared to hSP-D (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Analysis of the crystal structure of the CRD of pSP-D also indicated that Asn324 and Asn330 might add to the flexibility of the 326
 <sup>GSS</sup>-insertion by altering the conserved structural calcium sites located between the long and short loops of the CRD, thereby increasing its ability to interact with non-terminal saccharides. In addition to the 326
 <sup>GSS</sup>-insertion at the lectin-site, several other porcine-specific residues on the surface of the CRD of pSP-D play a potential role in increased affinity of pSP-D for viral glycans. Furthermore, several non-lectin site residues on the surface of the CRD of pSP-D: Glu251, Gln287, Asn288 (conserved in hSP-D), and Lys289, form a bulge in the surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,C</xref>, shaded green) that hypothetically may interact with several mannose residues from another arm of the octamannose (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Taken together, the antiviral and crystallographic studies on pSP-D have shed light on the structural requirements that might explain its extraordinary potential to neutralize IAVs.
