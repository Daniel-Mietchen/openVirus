  <p>Peptide-MHC II Binding Prediction and HLA Association of West Nile Virus Epitopes. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Predicted IC
   <sub>50</sub> values for experimentally tested peptides and the HLA II alleles of the study cohort. Peptides with the highest affinities locate toward the bottom of the y-axes and have IC
   <sub>50</sub> values below 500 nM (dotted line). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The chord diagram demonstrates for each individual, the experimentally identified epitope on the left side of the circle, connected with the HLA II allele predicted with best percentile rank on the right side of the circle. Immunodominant peptides are in bold. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Chord diagram indicating HLA II alleles associated with immunodominant epitopes in C and E. Epitopes detected only in asymptomatic individuals are indicated by asterisks. Epitope sequences previously identified by HLA II tetramer staining (
