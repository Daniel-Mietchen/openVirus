<p>Since the structural context of an epitope has been proposed to influence immunodominance (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), we next analyzed the structural characteristics of the protein regions from which the identified epitopes were derived. For this purpose, we mapped the immunodominant epitopes on the three-dimensional structures of the WN virus C and E proteins. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, responses to the C protein were mainly focused to helices H2 and H4, whereas helices H1, H3, and the N-terminal part of C did not elicit dominant responses. In the E protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), immunodominant epitopes clustered in each of the three domains [three in domain I (E41, E125, and E149), two in domain II (E205 and E245), two in domain III (E325, E381)] and in the stem region (E417). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D,E</xref>, epitopes from all three domains were located at the outside of the E protein in its dimeric conformation as well as in its trimeric form. In addition, the trimer exposes an epitope (E417) in the stem region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), whereas the stem is hidden below the E ectodomain in its pre-fusion conformation (
