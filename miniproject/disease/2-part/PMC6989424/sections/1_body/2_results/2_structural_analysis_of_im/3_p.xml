<p>As a further estimate for the structural homology of the common flavivirus epitope sites, we computed the RMSD of selected epitope regions after pairwise structural alignments of WN virus sE protein domains with those of YF, Zika and DEN viruses, respectively. The analysis included epitope regions E41, E245, and E381, which were common among flaviviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), as well as epitope E149, which had no equivalent in other flaviviruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>). As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, alignment of sE proteins yielded RMSD values of 2.58–3.96Å, consistent with those for homologous proteins (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The ß-sheet encompassing E41 yielded very low RMSD values (0.90–1.61 Å), and values below 2 Å were also observed for all pairwise comparisons of E245 and E381, except for E245 in DEN virus, which had a value of 3.50 to 3.59 Å. In contrast, E149 yielded RMSD values of 6.74 to 26.10 Å, indicating a structurally divergent region. In fact, in WN virus, this site harbors an extra α-helix protruding from the upper part of E DI, which is absent in Zika and DEN viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). It is notable that an α-helix occurs at a similar sequence position in the YF virus E protein, however this helix exhibits a ~90° twisted orientation and sticks closer to the surface of E DI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Together, the data suggest that the common epitope sites resulted from conserved structural features that favor their selection across different flaviviruses.
