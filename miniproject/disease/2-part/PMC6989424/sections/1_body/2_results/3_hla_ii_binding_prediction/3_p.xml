<p>To assess the strength of association between a particular HLA allele and the epitope response in each individual, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for all combinations of HLA alleles and dominant peptides shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>. In the case of peptides predicted as binders for more than one HLA allele, combined calculations for these alleles were performed, as described previously (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Evidence for significant associations with specific HLA alleles were obtained for most but not all immunodominant peptides (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The data show that, while only 25% (3/12) of these epitopes were associated with one single HLA allele (C41-DRB4
 <sup>*</sup>01:03, C73-DRB5
 <sup>*</sup>01:01 and E381-DRB1
 <sup>*</sup>11:01), 75% (9/12) were associated with two to four different HLA molecules (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings indicate that most immunodominant WN virus epitopes are recognized in the context of different HLA molecules, consistent with the well-known phenomenon of promiscuous binding of immunogenic peptides (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). The data also corroborate previous results obtained with tetramers using different HLA-DR molecules (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) which match almost half of the C and E peptides identified in the present study (peptide matches are underlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The OR calculations were also applied to asymptomatic or WND subjects separately. Three of the epitopes yielded a significant HLA association in asymptomatic donors but not in WND patients. These epitopes (E41-IDVKMMNMEAANLAD-HLA-DRB1
 <sup>*</sup>01:02 and -DRB1
 <sup>*</sup>04:01 [
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.039; OR 29.0], E381-DSYIVVGRGEQQINH-HLA-DRB1
 <sup>*</sup>11:01 [
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0196; OR 51.7] and E433-GVFTSVGKAIHQVFG-HLA-DRB1
 <sup>*</sup>07:01 [
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.039; OR 29.0]) were detected experimentally only in asymptomatic but in none of the WND subjects and are indicated by asterisks in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>.
