<p>We first investigated the overall reactivity of CD4 T cell responses to peptides derived from the WN virus structural proteins, the capsid C, membrane prM/M and envelope E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). PBMC samples from WN virus-infected individuals were depleted of CD8-positive cells and tested in IL-2 ELISPOT assays with pools of overlapping 15 mer peptides that cover the entire sequence of each of the structural proteins. The study population consisted of 29 subjects (18 asymptomatic/11 WND patients; age range 27–70 years) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), recruited at a mean of 40 ± 6 days after diagnosis. In terms of the overall magnitude, highest responses were elicited by E peptides, which accounted for 57% of the total response, followed by C and prM peptides, which accounted for 29 and 14% of the total response, respectively (
