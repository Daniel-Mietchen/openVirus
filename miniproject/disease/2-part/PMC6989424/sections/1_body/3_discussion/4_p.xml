<p>In contrast to the other WN virus epitopes identified, the E417 epitope appears to be less accessible in the context of mature virions, because it is sandwiched between the external protein shell and the lipid membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, upon endocytosis and encounter of the acidic pH in the endosome, flavivirus E proteins undergo a fusogenic conformational change from dimers to trimers, in which the stem is located at the outside (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Since fusion can already occur at the pH of early endosomes (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>), the post-fusion conformation may be an important substrate for generating peptides of the stem region. Such structural aspects may also explain previous observations with TBE virus, which demonstrated that epitopes derived from the stem are immunodominant only in naturally infected patients but not in those vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated vaccine, in which the prefusion conformation of E is stabilized by formaldehyde cross-linking (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). There are many other well-known examples, such as influenza virus or HIV, which undergo conformational changes that may play a role in the preferential selection of certain epitopes. Moreover, studies with influenza virus reported that some peptides are generated only during protein synthesis in infected cells but not upon exogenous uptake of the same antigen (
