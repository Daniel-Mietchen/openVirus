<p>Despite the overall similarities of epitope responses between asymptomatic subjects and WND patients, we did observe certain peptide-HLA combinations which only occurred in asymptomatic individuals. It is unclear at present whether these differences relate to the presence of alleles that protect from WND. An HLA-specific association for both protection and susceptibility to WND was suggested in previous studies (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Additional research is needed to clarify whether such differences could discriminate patients with different disease outcomes. Knowledge of the immunodominant epitopes displayed by such alleles could substantially contribute to our understanding of the determinants that impact the clinical outcome of infection and the efficacy of vaccines.
