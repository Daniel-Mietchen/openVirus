<p>WN virus PCR was performed as described previously (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Briefly, WN virus RNA was extracted from plasma, whole blood, serum and/or cerebral spinal fluid using NucliSENS easyMAG extractor (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). For the detection of WN virus lineages 1 and 2, a real-time TaqMan PCR with primers and probe located within the conserved WN virus 3′-noncoding region was used (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).
