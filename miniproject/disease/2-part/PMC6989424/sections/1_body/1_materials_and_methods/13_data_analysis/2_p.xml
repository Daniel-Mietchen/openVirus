 <italic>R</italic>− = number of subjects who did not express the specific allele and did not have a positive response to the specific peptide (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Fisher's exact test was applied to calculate the statistical significance of the association between one or more specific HLA alleles and the response to a specific peptide (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). A 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
