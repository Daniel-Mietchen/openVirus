<p>At the time of diagnosis, 25 out of 29 (86%) individuals had detectable WN virus RNA in blood samples, and 29 out of 29 (100%) had detectable WN virus IgM (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). WN virus infection was confirmed in all study participants by neutralization tests, as described below. Previous infection with mosquito-borne flaviviruses from other serocomplexes was analyzed by neutralization assays, as described in detail below. At the time of diagnosis, all 29 participants were negative in Zika neutralization tests. In addition, previous DEN virus infection was ruled out in 28 out of 29 subjects using DEN immunoassays after depletion of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies, as described below. As a control, samples obtained from 10 flavivirus-na√Øve individuals were analyzed.
