<p>Peptides were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies (Berlin, Germany). Peptide purity was &gt;70%. Peptides were quantified and verified for correct sequence by JPT, using high-performance liquid chromatography. The average purity was &gt;85%. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted in AIM-V medium (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A total of 190 peptides (15 mer) overlapping by 11 amino acids which cover the entire sequences of C, prM, and E from the WN virus strain Austria/2008 (protein accession code: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="AGX89731" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">AGX89731</ext-link>). Three master pools covered the C, prM, or E protein sequences. Matrix pools of C (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) and E (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22) contained up to 14 peptides with each peptide present in two distinct pools. All positive results obtained with the matrix pools were confirmed by testing the samples with single peptides in independent experiments.
