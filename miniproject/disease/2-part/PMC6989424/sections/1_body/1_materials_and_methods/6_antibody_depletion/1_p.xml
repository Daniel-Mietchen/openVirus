<p>Depletion of cross-reactive antibodies and dengue IgG ELISAs (Euroimmun) were performed to rule out previous DEN virus infection (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Broadly cross-reactive antibodies were depleted from serum samples using a strep-tagged soluble E protein (sE, lacking the stem-anchor region) from Rio Bravo virus (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), coupled to StrepTactin XT spin columns (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). Residual DEN-IgG reactivity was below the detection limit in 28 of 29 patients, indicating that they were DEN-naïve. In the depleted serum of one donor (#705) DEN-IgG Abs were not removed by Rio Bravo virus E protein.
