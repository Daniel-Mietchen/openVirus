<p>Like flaviviruses in general, mature WN virus particles consist of a nucleocapsid, which is composed of the single-stranded RNA genome and multiple copies of the capsid (C) protein, as well as a lipid envelope with two membrane-associated proteins, the membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The M protein is generated by proteolytic cleavage of a precursor (prM) that is a component of immature virions (

Upon entry into host cells, the acidic pH of the endosome triggers an irreversible conformational change in the E protein that leads to membrane fusion and converts the metastable pre-fusion dimer into a stable post-fusion trimer (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Due to its important cell entry functions, the E protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). CD4 T cells provide essential help for potent neutralizing antibody production by direct cell surface interactions with B cells and the recognition of antigenic peptides presented with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules. Peptides for such direct help can derive from the E protein, recognized by the B cells or the two other structural proteins (M and C) that are co-internalized as part of the virus particle.
