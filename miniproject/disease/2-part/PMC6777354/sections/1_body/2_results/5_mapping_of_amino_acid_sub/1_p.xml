<p>To assess the possibility of changes of RNA replication properties at pre and post emergence of GII.P17-GII.17 based on the time-scaled phylogeny for the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> region in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, we mapped the amino acid substitutions between GII.P17 strains and other 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> genotypes onto three-dimensional structures of the RdRp protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). A total of 48 amino acid substitutions were identified among the GII.P17 and GII.P4 strains (Accession number; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="FJ537137" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">FJ537137</ext-link>). Of these, the substitutions at aa33, aa34, aa49, and aa434 were located close to the interface between monomers, while substitutions at aa206, aa215, aa409, aa438, and aa442 were located close to the active site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, a total of 16 amino acid substitutions were estimated among the GII.P17 and GII.P3 (a closely related genotype to GII.P17) strains (Accession number; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="KJ194500" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">KJ194500</ext-link>). The substitution at aa49 was located adjacent to the interface between monomers, whereas the substitutions at aa206, aa215, aa407, and aa409 were located proximal to the active site (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>). For intra-GII.P17 genotype, Phe206Leu and Lys405Arg substitutions were found around the active site in the strains of cluster 2 (12 strains) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thirty one substitutions were also found in the strains belonging to the cluster 1 (121 strains), and a Ser427Asn substitution was located proximally at the interface between monomers. Ile193Val, Ile215Val, Asp224Glu, Ile346Val, Thr394Ala, Val395Ile, Asn409Ser, Val438Met, Gly445Ser, and Phe503Leu substitutions were located close to the active sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).
