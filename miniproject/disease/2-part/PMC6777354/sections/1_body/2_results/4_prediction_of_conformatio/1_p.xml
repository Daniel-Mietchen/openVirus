<p>Conformational epitopes and selective pressures in the VP1 protein were analyzed in order to assess the possibility of antigenicity changes at pre and post emergence of GII.P17-GII.17 based on the time-scaled phylogeny for the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. As a result, common epitopes among strains of clusters 1, 2 (GII.P17-GII.17 clusters) and 3 [a closely related cluster (GII.P3-GII.17 strain) to the GII.P17-GII.17 clusters] were found in the shell domain and the protruding 2 (P2) domain. Although the amino acid epitope positions were similar among the strains, many amino acid substitutions were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Substitutions in epitopes were also identified in strains belonging to the same cluster. Of these substitution residues, amino acids (aa) 375, aa376, aa394, aa396, and aa442 are located close to the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding sites of VP1, which are utilized for attachment of HuNoV to host cells. Additionally, three positive selection sites were identified in the P2 domain (Asn342Ser, Glu376Asn/Asp, and Arg412Leu/Glu/Pro). Of these sites, aa342 and aa376 were at predicted epitopes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These results indicate that GII.P17-GII.17 could evolve with changes in antigenicity and binding affinity to HBGAs.
