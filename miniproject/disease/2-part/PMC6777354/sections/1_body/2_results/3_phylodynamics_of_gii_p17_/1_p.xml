<p>We estimated the transition of population sizes of GII.P17-GII.17 in the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region using a Bayesian skyline plot. The population of this region increased sharply in around 2014 and remained constant from 2016 after an immediate reduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that this was compatible between the fluctuation of the plot and actually epidemiological GII.17 prevalence.
