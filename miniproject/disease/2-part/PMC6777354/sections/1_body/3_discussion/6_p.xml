<p>We constructed a genome network of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains examined in this study and found four major clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Notably, the strains belonging to clusters 1 and 4 were detected exclusively in Japan, while the strains belonging to clusters 2 and 3 were detected from various countries. Moreover, the two haplotype strains found in Japan might give rise to many variant types. However, we could not determine specific amino acid substitutions in the strains belonging to clusters 1 and 3, which contained the haplotype strains (data not shown). Thus, these haplotype strains may exhibit no phenotypes acquiring high infectivity due to the mutations, although the reason for this remains unclear at present. Moreover, the strains belonging to cluster 4 had unique amino acid substitutions in p48, p22, protease, RdRp, and VP2 proteins (data not shown). These viruses were found only in Miyagi prefecture in Japan, during short periods and was never detected in other areas, perhaps because these mutations are deleterious to the propagations of the virus. As a limitation, the results of the present analyses may partially be affected by selection bias introduced in the collection of the strains.
