<p>We also assessed the phylodynamics of GII.P17-GII.17 and found that the genome population sizes of GII.P17-GII.17 increased rapidly during 2014â€“2015 and then decreased rapidly thereafter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These fluctuations may be associated with epidemics of the newly emerged HuNoV and the acquisition of herd immunity. For example, the fluctuations in the phylodynamics of the GII.4 virus could be associated with the emergence of a variant virus with altered antigenicity and the acquisition of herd immunity to the VP1 capsid protein of that virus (Debbink et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lindesmith et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Motoya et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the phylodynamic fluctuations in GII.P17-GII.17 identified in this study are associated with epidemics in various regions and subsequent acquisition of herd immunity (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Fu et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Matsushima et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Dang Thanh et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These results suggest that continuous phylodynamic analysis may provide early notice of other HuNoV epidemics and repeat prevalence of HuNoV, including GII.17.
