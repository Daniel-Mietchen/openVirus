<p>We also showed that GII.P17-GII.17 contains amino acid substitutions in residues adjacent to the RdRp active sites and the contact surfaces between RdRp monomers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Ng et al. showed that the amino acids around the active sites regulate viral genome replication (Ng et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Moreover, substitutions around the monomer contact surfaces of RdRp affect the stability of the dimer and its RNA binding abilities (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Thus, the similar substitutions found in the present study warrant additional investigation into changes in the properties of the RdRp protein. Previous studies have also revealed key amino acids associated with the efficiency of HuNoV genome replication (Bull et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Eden et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Of these, the threonine residue at aa33 is phosphorylated by a host factor, Akt, and is involved in producing high replication rates (Eden et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This residue is located around the interface between monomers in the RdRp structure. The RdRp protein of GII.P4 contains a threonine residue at the position, while that of GII.P17 contains an asparagine (data not shown). This may suggest that the enzyme activity of RdRp differs between the GII.P4 and GII.P17 genotypes.
