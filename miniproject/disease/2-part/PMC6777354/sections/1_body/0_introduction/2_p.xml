<p>HuNoV belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>, and it is further genetically classified into three genogroups, GI, GII, and GIV. Genetic analyses have shown that HuNoV GI and GII can be further classified into 9 and 22 genotypes, respectively (Kroneman et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Of these, many genotypes have been associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks throughout the world (Hoa Tran et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The genomes of noroviruses contain three open reading frames and encodes six non-structural proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the two capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 (de Graaf et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
