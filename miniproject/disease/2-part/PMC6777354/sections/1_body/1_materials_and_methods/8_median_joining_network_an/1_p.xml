<p>Transmission links between GII.P17-GII.17 strains were analyzed using a median joining network with PopART software (Bandelt et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Leigh and Bryant, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). We constructed a dataset that covered nucleotide sequence lengths from the start position of 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> to the terminal position of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> (resulting in a total of 114 strains). The dataset was then processed to detect recombination between the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> and 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences based on seven primary exploratory recombination signal detection methods (RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi, Chimera, SiScan, and 3Seq) using RDP4 software (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and the threshold of the 
 <italic>p</italic>-value for significance was set at 0.001. Recombination regions were assigned when they were identified by more than four of the seven methods; however, this criterion resulted in the identification of no recombinant sequences in the dataset. The median joining networks were analyzed using an epsilon value of zero.
