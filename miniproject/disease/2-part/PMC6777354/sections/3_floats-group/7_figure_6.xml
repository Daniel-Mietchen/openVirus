 <caption>
  <p>Structural models of the RdRp protein for representative GII.P17 strains. Homodimer structures of the RdRp of GII.P4 [PDBID 1SH0; 
   <bold>(A)</bold>], Kawasaki323 [cluster 2; 
   <bold>(B)</bold>], and Kawasaki308 [cluster 1; 
   <bold>(C)</bold>] are shown. Each monomeric chain that compose the dimer structure are colored gray (chain A) and dim gray (chain B). Amino acid substitutions between GII.P17 and GII.P4 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or within the GII.P17 clusters 
   <bold>(B,C)</bold> that are close to the interface between monomers and to the active site cleft are colored blue with the positions under the order of alignments, whereas the substitutions distant from these regions are shown in yellow. The residues of active sites for RNA replication are colored red. The purple quadrilaterals highlight the region of the active site cleft.
