<p>Three inactivated vaccines have entered into clinical studies, of which clinical data for only ZPIV vaccine has been published [
 <xref rid="B45-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. ZPIV is a whole inactivated virus vaccine of Puerto Rican strain PRVABC59 [
 <xref rid="B46-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Studies in mice showed that a single vaccination given intramuscularly with alum generated antibody titers of approximately 3.7 log10 and fully protected Balb/C immunocompetent mice from viremia, whereas unvaccinated mice were unprotected and subcutaneously vaccinated mice were only partially protected against the Zika Brazil strain [
 <xref rid="B46-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A subsequent study in non-human primates vaccinated twice at four-week intervals with alum generated binding and microneutralization antibody titers of 3.54 and 3.55 log10, respectively, and complete protection against viremia and viruria following challenge with either Brazilian or Puerto Rican strains of Zika virus [
 <xref rid="B47-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. ZPIV safety and immunogenicity was tested in three clinical trials to assess Zika vaccine responses relative to dose level, vaccination schedule, or following vaccination with either the Yellow Fever YF-VAX or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) IXARO vaccines to assess responses in a flavivirus-exposed population [
 <xref rid="B45-tropicalmed-04-00104" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. There were no vaccine-associated SAEs reported. The most common adverse events were pain and tenderness at the injection site; no neurologic events were reported. Seroconversion was 92% using a cutoff for peak geometric mean titer of 1:10 and 77% using a titer of 1:100. Response rates after a single immunization were 11% and 5.5% using cutoffs of 1:10 or 1:100, respectively. Vaccine responses were observed through day 57. Passive transfer of purified IgG derived from 10 Zika immunized participants to groups of 5 Balb/C mice per participant provided sterilizing immunity against viremia for 82% (41 of 50) of mice overall, with viremia observed for one or more mice per group inoculated with sera from five (50%) individuals [
