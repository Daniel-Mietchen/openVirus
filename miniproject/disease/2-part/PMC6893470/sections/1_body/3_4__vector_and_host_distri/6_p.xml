<p>Both vector and host ranges are forecast to shift further under future climate change. 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>, a major vector for WNV, is already present in new locations [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], and is projected to expand its range further in Canada, especially under a high-greenhouse-gas emission scenario [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. The distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> in California and Florida is predicted to decline in mid-to-late summer, but may have increased populations during the winter [
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], and range shifts are also anticipated under climate change [
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Broad analyses indicating expected range shifts due to climate change have been performed [
 <xref rid="B147-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>].
