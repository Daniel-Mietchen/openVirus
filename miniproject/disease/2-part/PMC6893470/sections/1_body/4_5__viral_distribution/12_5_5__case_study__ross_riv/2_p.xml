<p>Temperature results in Queensland in northwest Australia have been variable, and this may be due to the stronger effects of rainfall and tides [
 <xref rid="B258-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. One study found that RRV incidence increased by 2.4% for each 1 Â°C increase (including a statistical correction for season) [
 <xref rid="B259-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. Temperature was not significantly related to RRV in the city of Brisbane [
 <xref rid="B260-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>] in one study, but another study found a negative effect of maximum temperature there [
 <xref rid="B261-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>]. Maximum and minimum temperature were associated with RRV risk along the coast, but not inland in another study [
 <xref rid="B262-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>]. Maximum temperature was weakly positively correlated with RRV in Townsville after accounting for other variables [
