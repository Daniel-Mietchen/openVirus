  <p>HIV-1 genetic diversity impacts its susceptibility to bnAbs. As an illustration, neutralization data were gathered for four bnAbs (PGT121, PG9, 3BNC117, and 10E8), each targeting a different site of vulnerability (V3g, V1V2g, CD4bs, and MPER, respectively), tested against three panels of transmitted-founder (T/F) viruses representing clade C (

   <xref rid="B60-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], B (
   <italic>n</italic> = 40) [
   <xref rid="B62-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and CRF02_AG (
   <italic>n</italic> = 33) [
   <xref rid="B61-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Based on individual half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) values, the percentage of viruses neutralized at the bnAb concentration of 1 Î¼g/mL within each clade is represented and highlights intersubtype discrepancies of the neutralization coverage.
