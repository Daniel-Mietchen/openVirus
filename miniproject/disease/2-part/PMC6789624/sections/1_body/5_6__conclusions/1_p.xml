<p>HIV-1 diversity, which is particularly considerable for the envelope glycoproteins, is a major hurdle to achieving the goal of an effective vaccine. The interplay between HIV-1 evolution and the development the neutralizing response to HIV-1 infection has been explored in depth over the last few decades. The identification of bnAbs and sites of vulnerability of HIV-1 Env trimers, followed by comprehensive studies regarding the genesis of such bnAbs among the B cell repertoire, has raised the hope of generating a broad neutralizing response with innovative vaccine strategies. A range of new immunogens and vaccine design strategies are going to be tested in the next few years and lessons from immunogenicity trials will be crucial. So will be the results of ongoing clinical trials using bnAbs for HIV prevention and treatment, especially regarding their efficiency in different locations and against different genotypes. Considering the evolving nature of HIV-1 towards greater diversity and resistance to neutralization, as described in this review, new trials using combinations of bnAbs or near-pangenotypic antibodies will be needed to validate the full coverage of any immunization strategy, and to gain insight into the antibody concentrations required for effective protection. The fine-tuning required between breadth and serum concentration of NAbs in order to achieve protection remains unknown. Finally, the vaccine field would probably benefit from a prospective sampling of HIV-1 strains circulating around the globe to monitor their sensitivity to present and future active and passive immunization strategies.</p>
