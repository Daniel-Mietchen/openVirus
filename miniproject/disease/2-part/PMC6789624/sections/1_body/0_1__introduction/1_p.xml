<p>Prevention strategies against HIV-1 infection have been transformed in recent years with the implementation of the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using antiretroviral drugs. The development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that are now in clinical trials should provide additional possibilities for prevention [

Despite encouraging results of PrEP on HIV-1 incidence in some communities, challenges such has global drug availability, long term side effects of antiviral drugs, adherence to the prophylaxis methods, and social acceptability are limitations likely to persist. Therefore, efforts to develop an effective vaccine to stop the HIV/AIDS pandemic are still needed. The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, which mediate entry into host cells, are the target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and constitute the key antigen for a prophylactic vaccine. So far, this armored door is locked and no antigenic form able to enter an efficient vaccine has been identified yet. This is largely due to the huge antigenic diversity of the envelope glycoproteins, which can represent up to 35% difference in amino acid sequences between subtypes. In this review, we will focus on the current knowledge on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein diversity and its evolving nature leading to a continuously increasing resistance to NAbs, with major consequences in the HIV-1 vaccine field.
