<p>Among the various vaccine strategies explored, several are not based on mimicking the pathways of bNAbs but could have the potential to overcome HIV-1 diversity. One of these strategies is to use mosaic antigens covering the genetic diversity of circulating viruses worldwide by computational optimization of immunogens to maximize the coverage of potential epitopes [

Although low levels of NAbs were detected in several studies using mosaic Env antigens, some protection against simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) was observed in rhesus monkeys, associated with elicitation of Env-binding antibodies with enhanced effector functions [

 <xref rid="B106-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Further evaluation of the breadth of protection conferred by this strategy is needed. Another approach is to use consensus Env immunogens designed to surrogate the HIV-1 sequences of the circulating viruses. Several studies have used a group M consensus Env to induce antibodies able to neutralize T/F viruses [

 <xref rid="B108-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. A heterologous response has been detected in these studies, suggesting that consensus Env might deserve to be further explored to overcome the Env diversity.
