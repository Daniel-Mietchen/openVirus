<p>The protection efficiency conferred by a prophylactic vaccine is thought to rely in large part on its ability to trigger the production of bnAbs [

 <xref rid="B79-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Therefore, studying the sensitivity to bnAbs of HIV-1 over time would be an interesting proxy to better characterize the evolution towards resistance, quantitatively and qualitatively. A thorough investigation using some of the most potent bnAbs against subtype B viruses found increasing resistance to bnAbs targeting all major sites of vulnerability (V1V2g, V3g, CD4bs, and the gp41-gp120 interface), except gp41 MPER [
 <xref rid="B62-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. On the bright side, this reflects a strong natural selection pressure and the humoral response against these four targets, which might be triggered by a putative vaccine. However, this also shows that HIV-1 is able to escape from all these bnAbs without losing its capacity to infect new individuals over time. The constant sensitivity to bnAbs targeting the gp41 MPER could be due to a lack of selective pressure or to higher functional constraints in this region [

 <xref rid="B81-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Interestingly, different profiles of evolution were observed for other genotypes. Subtype C viruses have become more resistant to VRC01 (CD4bs), PG9 (V3g), and 4E10 (MPER) but not to CAP256-VRC26.25 (V1V2g) or PGT128 (V3g) [
 <xref rid="B60-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. For CRF02_AG the increasing resistance was found significant only for bnAbs targeting the CD4bs, although the study period might have been too short to get complete information for other specificities [
 <xref rid="B61-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the course of the continuous drift of HIV-1 genome and epitopes, it is possible that different clades follow separate evolution pathways regarding resistance to neutralization, due to conformational constraints specific to the clade or diverse selection pressure forces specific to the population. This is supported by the fact that the class of bnAbs isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals is influenced by both the clade of the strain infecting each individual (the bnAbs-imprinting capacity of HIV-1 envelopes [
 <xref rid="B82-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]) and by the ethnic origin [
