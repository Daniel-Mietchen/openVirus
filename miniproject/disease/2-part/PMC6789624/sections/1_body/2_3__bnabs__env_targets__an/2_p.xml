These sites of vulnerability include the conserved regions near the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), the V1V2-glycan apex (V1V2g), the V3-glycan region (V3g), the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and a complex region at the gp120-gp41 interface including the fusion peptide located at the N terminus of gp41 (
