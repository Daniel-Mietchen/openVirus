<p>Nevertheless, 20â€“30% of HIV-1 infected individuals develop, after two or three years of infection, bnAbs able to block infection by diverse viruses from multiple subtypes [

 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The delayed bnAb response could be attributed to a slow antigen-dependent affinity maturation process and seems to result from exposure to an evolving antigen over many years [

 <xref rid="B35-vaccines-07-00074" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although bnAb responses fail to control viremia once infection has been established, a vaccine able to generate such responses prior to viral exposure could effectively prevent infection in humans, as the appropriate antibodies would be present before HIV diversification.
