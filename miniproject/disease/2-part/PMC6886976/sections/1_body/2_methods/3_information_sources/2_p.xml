<p>We used a vulnerability assessment tool as a reference paper
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> of one of the authors (ADN), which has been successfully applied in various emergency settings. It is an easy to use manual for identifying local-level vulnerabilities and for determining effective resource allocation. It, therefore,reflects what we look for in our search.
