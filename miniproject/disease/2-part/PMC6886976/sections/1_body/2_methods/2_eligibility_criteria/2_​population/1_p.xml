<p>The review focuses on tools that seek to identify social groups most vulnerable to infectious threats. As of now, it is unclear how much literature on methods discerning vulnerable groups in disease outbreaks exists. Therefore, comparable tools from the climate change field (eg, vulnerability assessment in natural hazards) will also be considered. We will include all infectious diseases but will have a special focus on infectious threats that specifically affect SoNAR-Global partner countries, such as influenza, measles and certain viral haemorrhagic fevers (Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever). The selection of these threats was discussed with SoNAR-Global partners.</p>
