<p>Throughout the search—starting from numbers of records retrieved from databases to final search results—we provide a search flow diagram to visualise our selection process.
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Following this step, four reviewers (MJ, LL, EJ and RK) will independently review the full texts and will extract data from the selected studies with focus on author, article type, type of threat (natural hazard, infectious disease or AMR), year, country and type of intervention. As all authors have a social science background, the data extraction will most likely resemble a thematic analysis. Variables for data extraction will be defined inductively (variables come up while familiarising with the data) and deductively. According to the review objectives and outcomes, we predefined the following variables: methodology used (eg, qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods), conceptual or theoretical framework of the assessment tool, degree of involvement of the affected population and applicability and utility of the tools and results of vulnerability assessments (eg, specific vulnerable groups or communities). Finally, extracted data will be systematically compared and divergences acknowledged; limitations of the vulnerability assessment tools will be noted.
