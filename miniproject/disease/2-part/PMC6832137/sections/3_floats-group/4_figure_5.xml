  <p>Organization of the Influenza A virus’s genome. The influenza A virus’s (IAV’s) genome consists of eight segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA. Encoded by the genome are three polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2), nucleoprotein (NP), and two envelope proteins (HA and NA). The M and NS mRNAs can be alternatively spliced to yield M1 and M2, and NS1 and NS2 proteins, respectively. Boxes indicate coding regions, sized relative to the other gene segments. Black lines at each end represent the 3’ and 5’ untranslated regions. The total length of each segment (conding and non-coding regions) in nucleotides (nt) is indicated.
