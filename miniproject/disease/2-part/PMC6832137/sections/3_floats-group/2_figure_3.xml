  <p>Organization of a flavivirus genome. The genome of flaviviruses, such as dengue and Zika, is ~11 kb in size and encodes a single, large polyprotein, which is proteolytically processed into three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. The 5’ end of the genome contains a cap structure critical for the initiation of translation. RNA structures present in the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTR) are critical for capping and genome replication.</p>
