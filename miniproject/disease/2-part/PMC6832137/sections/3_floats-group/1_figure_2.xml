 <caption>
  <p>Diagram of hepatitis C virus genome. The HCV genome consists of a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs). The ORF is translated into a single polyprotein, which is further processed into individual proteins. The 5’ and 3’ UTRs are critical for internal ribosome binding, translation, and HCV genome replication.</p>
