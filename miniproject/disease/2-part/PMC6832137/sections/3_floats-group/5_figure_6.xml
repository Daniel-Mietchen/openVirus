  <p>Sphingolipid involvement in the infection cycle of clinically important viruses. The three lines indicate the steps involved in the replication of HCV and flaviviruses (red), HIV (green), and influenza virus (yellow). Reported roles for lipids (sphingomyelin [SM], glycosphingolipids [GSL], and/or cholesterol (Chol)) in the lifecycle of each virus are indicated.</p>
