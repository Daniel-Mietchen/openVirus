<p>Glycosphingolipids are also key players in HIV infection. HIV-1 infection of susceptible cells involves fusion of the HIV membrane with the host cell membrane. This process involves interactions between the viral gp120 and gp 41 envelope glycoproteins and CD4 and chemokine coreceptors (CXCR4 or CCR5) on the host cell. Several studies have implicated glycosphingolipids in the fusion process. Hug et al. demonstrated that glucosylceramide-derived glycosphingolipids found on the target cell membrane are involved in the organization of gp120â€“gp41, CD4, and chemokine receptors into a membrane fusion complex [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], implying that GalCer is an alternative receptor for HIV replication entry. Similarly, antibodies to GalCer reduced HIV infectivity andinternalization in two CD4-negative neural cell lines, U373-MG and SK-N-MC [
