<p>Sphingolipids are important biomolecules found in all eukaryotic membranes. They regulate membrane trafficking, cell signaling, and play a crucial role in influenza virus particles’ release or cell surface binding of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120 [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They are also major constituents of lipid rafts, which are integral components of the HCV replication complex [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Sphingolipid biosynthesis starts with the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA and serine into ceramide, a sphingolipid byproduct of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident enzyme—serine palmitoyltransferase, or SPT [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00912-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Ceramide can be carried by ceramide transport protein (CERT) [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to the trans-Golgi where it is converted into another sphingolipid called sphingomyelin. Alternatively, four-phosphate adaptor protein 2, or FAPP2 [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], carries ceramide to the cis-Golgi where glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) produces the first glycosphingolipid called glucosylceramide (GlcCer; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00912-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Glucosylceramide is subsequently converted into more complex glycosphingolipids including lactosylceramide (LacCer), globosides (e.g., Gb3) and gangliosides (e.g., GM3, GM1, and GA1; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00912-f001">Figure 1</xref>). GCS is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. The insufficiency or overproduction of glycosphingolipids has been associated with disease in humans. Consequently, efforts were made to inhibit GCS activity to reduce glucosylceramide accumulation in patients. One such GCS inhibitor, Genz-112638 [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], has been approved for treating Gaucher disease linked to defective glucosylceramide catabolism [

Additionally, glycosphingolipids are highly enriched in neurons, skin epithelial cells and might contribute to the tropism, replication and pathogenicity of viruses targeting related organs. Traditional methods to detect sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids include thin liquid chromatography (TLC) [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], high pressure thin liquid chromatography (HPTLC) [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], immunocytochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recently, sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids have been detected with state-of-the-art liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (e.g., LC-MS/MS system). This approach has enabled investigators to accurately determine the levels of sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid species in cells or tissues [
