<p>Seasonal influenza epidemics are responsible for over 200,000 hospitalizations in the United States and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. Influenza A (IAV) is an enveloped virus possessing a negative sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA genome. Eight RNA segments encode 11 different viral proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00912-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The envelope spike glycoproteins HA and NA mediate viral entry and release, respectively, and serve as antigenic determinants of the virus. M2 is proton-selective ion channel involved in uncoating once the virus has entered the cell. Matrix protein (M1) forms a matrix under the viral envelope which is critical for maintaining the integrity and shape of the intact viral particle. Each segment of viral RNA is encapsulated with nucleocapsid protein (NP) and associated with the trimeric polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, and PA), forming what are referred to as a viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) plays a critical role in evasion of host immunity. Non-structural protein 2 (NS2) is involved in the export of newly synthesized vRNPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for packaging.
