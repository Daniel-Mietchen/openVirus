<p>Despite differences in the viral proteins and corresponding host cell receptor(s), the presence of sphingolipids in the envelopes of HCV, flaviviruses, HIV, and IAV appears critical for the proper organization of viral envelope proteins within microdomains to facilitate viral entry. Correspondingly, cell surface receptors required for viral adsorption and subsequent entry are concentrated in sphingolipid-rich microdomains present on host cell membranes, with sphingolipid itself serving as an alternative receptor for some viruses (e.g., HIV). Several of the viruses (e.g., HCV and DENV) discussed utilize specialized sites for genome replication. The trafficking of viral genomes and required replication platforms appear dependent on vesicular networks which involve lipid moieties, including sphingolipids. Lastly, the morphogeneses and egressions of the viruses discussed require the trafficking and assembly of components to budding sites on host membranes enriched for sphingolipids. Continued research is needed to ascertain the role of sphingolipids in the pathogenesis of these viruses and other enveloped RNA viruses.</p>
