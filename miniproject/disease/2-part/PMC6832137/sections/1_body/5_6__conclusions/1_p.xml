<p>The role of sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids has been overlooked for many years in viral infection due to the difficulty of detecting or measuring these lipids. However, with the advent of lipid mass spectrometry, it is now possible to accurately determine the level of sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids in virus-infected cells and virus particles. Recent findings clearly imply that many enveloped RNA viruses have evolved to leverage sphingolipids and/or glycosphingolipids to enter target cells, replicate their genome, or form new virus particles enriched with these lipids (
