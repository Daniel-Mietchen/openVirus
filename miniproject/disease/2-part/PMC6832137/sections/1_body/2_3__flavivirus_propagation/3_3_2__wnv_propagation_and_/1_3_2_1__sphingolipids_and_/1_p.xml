<p>The role of sphingomyelin in WNV replication is well documented. A study by Martin-Acebes and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] showed that WNV replicates at a much higher level in mice deficient in acid sphingomyelinase (unable to catabolize sphingomyelin), or cells derived from Niemann–Pick disease type A patients (NPA; accumulate sphingomyelin) relative to the their wild type controls. This suggested that sphingomyelin accumulation enhances WNV infectivity. Consistent with these findings, adding sphingomyelin to infected fibroblast cells markedly increased WNV infectivity. Further analysis showed that sphingomyelin colocalizes with WNV dsRNA at cytoplasmic foci, implying that sphingomyelin plays a role in the formation of the WNV replication platform [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These findings imply that sphingomyelin is also required for WNV attachment, internalization, and/or virus–endosome fusion.
