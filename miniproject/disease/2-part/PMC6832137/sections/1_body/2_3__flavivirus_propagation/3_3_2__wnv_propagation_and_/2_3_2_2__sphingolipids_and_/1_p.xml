<p>In an earlier report, Martin-Acebes and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] also showed that WNV particles were enriched in sphingomyelin. Surprisingly, pharmacological inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase (converts sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphorylcholine) reduced WNV release from infected cells, implying perhaps that ceramide generated from sphingomyelin catabolism is critical for the infectious WNV particle. Subsequent analysis showed that inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase activity reduces the budding of the immature WNV particles, a crucial step in infectious WNV particle formation [
