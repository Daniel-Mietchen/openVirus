<p>The role of sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids in ZIKV replication is not well understood. This is crucial because ZIKV patients with Guillain–Barré Syndrome, have elevated levels of antibodies targeting gangliosides GM2, GM1, GA1, and GD1 [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00912" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], hence highlighting the need to define the role of glucosylceramide-derived glycosphingolipids in ZIKV infectivity. Our group has evidence that ZIKV particles are enriched in sphingomyelin, ceramide, and glucosylecramide (unpublished data). Our current data suggest that glycosphingolipids leading to gangliosides biosynthesis (
