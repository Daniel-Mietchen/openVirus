<p>Beyond these basic antibodies, the availability of new monoclonals with anti-infective activity in vivo would open up the door to even more creative options: Bispecific antibodies could be used in key immune cells and could effectively support the natural response to infection. Studies in animal models of chronic malaria infection led to the observation that this results in a reduction in the impact of cytotoxic T cells and modulates the T
 <sub>reg</sub> capacity, leading to an “exhausted” or ineffective T-cell response [

For such diseases, which include malaria, one question for the longer term is whether immune checkpoint inhibition, or interfering with interferon-α signaling, could be used [
