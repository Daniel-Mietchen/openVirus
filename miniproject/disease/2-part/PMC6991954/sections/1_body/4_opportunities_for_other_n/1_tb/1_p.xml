<p>TB is a good example of the gap between a pathogen’s prevalence and burden. 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> spreads easily among human populations; presently, about one-third of all humans are infected, and new infections occur in 1% of the population each year. Among these billions of carriers, there are, however, “only” 10 million active TB infections, with 1.3 million deaths in 2016. Thus, the vast majority of carriers keep the pathogen in check. TB exerts 2 levels of immune evasion: one in which it is maintained in a latent state and one in which it breaks free and causes active disease [

Even if an mAb treatment would not be curative, shortening the standard treatment of patients infected with multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains would represent a major advance. In addition, “Checkpoint blockade during chronic TB infection requires further consideration” [
