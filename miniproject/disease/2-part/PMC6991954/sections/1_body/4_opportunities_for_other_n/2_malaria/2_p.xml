<p>One difficulty in targeting the merozoites in symptomatic malaria is that the extracellular phase of the pathogen is relatively short-lived and is only a small part of the life cycle. Additionally, the number of merozoites invading erythrocytes is very large (up to 10
 <sup>12</sup>), compared with the number of sporozoites invading the liver stages (dozens). As such, the most interesting place to intervene with an mAb is at the initial infection of the liver. Currently there are 3 mAbs published with potent activity against the circumsporozoite protein, CSP, and these can reduce the parasitaemia in sporozoite-infected FRG (triple mutant Fah/Raγ2/IL2Rγ) mice that carry a human liver implant [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>], cloned from patients vaccinated with irradiated sporozoites. Antibodies that block the invasion process of the red blood cells by merozoites represent another possible approach. In studies of the merozoite protein RH5 (reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5) as a potential vaccine, some antibodies were described that could block the cycle of erythrocyte infection [
