<p>In summary, mAbs offer tremendous potential to augment the antifungal arsenal: Animal models have provided promising results, there is a wide range of potential targets, they have the capacity to both inhibit the pathogen and augment the host response, and it may be possible to target diverse fungal pathogens with an appropriate mAb cocktail or by targeting panfungal antigens. Use of mAbs as adjuvants to existing antifungal drugs also shows promise [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. To date, only 2 mAb treatments have advanced to clinical trials: the previously mentioned 18B7 in 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, and Mycograb, a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)-specific antibody fragment, which showed promise for treating 
 <italic>Candida</italic> infections but failed to make it to market due to production difficulties and unresolved safety issues. Antifungal immunomodulation is a complex area, and the field is still emerging. These preliminary studies highlight the potential for exciting new advances in mAb research and application, both for understanding fungal immunity and for manipulating it to tackle life-threatening fungal infections.
