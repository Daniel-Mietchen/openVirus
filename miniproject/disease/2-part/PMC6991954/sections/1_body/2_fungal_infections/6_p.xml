 <italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic>, while less globally prevalent than 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> or 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, is the most important cause of IFIs in Latin America. mAbs have been raised against the major 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>brasiliensis</italic> antigens glycoprotein 43 (gp43) and gp70. In an infected mouse model, anti-gp43 activity, mediated by mAb E3-enhanced phagocytosis of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>brasiliensis</italic> cells, increased interferon-Î³ production and led to a reduction in the fungal burden [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], while anti-gp70 mAbs significantly reduced fungal colony-forming units and almost completely abolished granuloma formation in the lungs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Antibodies raised against mouse CD25
 <sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T
 <sub>reg</sub>) cells, which control immunity and excessive inflammation, depleted CD25
 <sup>+</sup> cells, resulting in less severe tissue inflammation, with reduced mortality in susceptible mice [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Again, this demonstrates the potential for mAbs to exert control of fungal infection, either directly by incapacitating the fungal cells or indirectly via modulation of the host response.
