<p>A human challenge model is now available for clinical research in dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. In this model, the efficacy and safety profile of therapeutic antibodies can be evaluated rapidly in small-scale clinical settings, prior to traditional large-scale field studies with naturally infected patients. To develop mAbs for dengue therapy, it is important to consider an approach that prevents or reduces ADE, and several studies that address this link have been undertaken. A neutralizing human mAb, D23-1B3B9, that targets the fusion loop in domain II showed strong neutralizing activity against all 4 DENV serotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, at subneutralizing concentrations, it also elicited ADE activity in vitro [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. To reduce the ADE, Injampa and coworkers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] modified the D23-1B3B9 antibody Fc domain at position N297Q. The modified antibody kept the same cross-neutralizing activity to all 4 serotypes as those of wild-type antibody but lacked ADE activity against all 4 serotypes at subneutralizing concentrations. In another neutralizing mAb, SIgN-3C, 2 leucine to alanine mutations were engineered in the Fc part, abrogating binding to Fc gamma receptors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This mutant Fc version (SIgN-3C-LALA) protected mice, while ADE was completely abrogated. Similarly, Mab11/mutated Fragment crystallizable region (mutFc) (an mAb that is unable to bind to cells with Fcγ receptors [FcγR]) and potentiate ADE have been used as a prophylactic therapy [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Passive immunization with this mAb (at 25 mg/kg) reduced viral load and disease progression in nonhuman primates.
