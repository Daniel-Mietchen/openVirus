<p>Despite decades of effort, there is no effective treatment against dengue. Currently, Dengvaxia is approved by the FDA and is the only licensed dengue vaccine in the world. This is also a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] that has been approved in several countries. However, interim results from long-term safety follow-up studies demonstrated an increased risk for hospitalization of vaccine-sensitized individuals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], suggesting that ADE-related concerns are relevant. It has been reported that non-neutralizing levels of anti-DENV antibody can enhance viral entry into host cells by forming a DENV-antibody complex [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. There is concern that an incomplete antibody against DENVs may cause ADE-mediated severe dengue disease. Hence, there is a need for a safe and highly efficacious dengue therapy or vaccine that provides immunity against all 4 serotypes simultaneously.
