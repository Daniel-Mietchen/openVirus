<p>mAb therapy is an alternative to vaccines and other therapies against dengue. Many mAbs against dengue from mice and humans have been characterized, and the use of mAbs has also been explored as a therapeutic option. Antibody SIgN-3C, identified by the Singapore Immunology Network, neutralized all 4 dengue serotypes and decreased viremia of all serotypes in mice when given 2 days after infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which binds E protein domain III (EDIII) and neutralizes all 4 serotypes of DENV, also showed useful antiviral utility. VIS513 (25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) was administered at 5 days post infection in nonhuman primates, and no infectious virus could be detected by either plaque assay or virus isolation after treatment, a finding that was, however, not mirrored by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) findings.
