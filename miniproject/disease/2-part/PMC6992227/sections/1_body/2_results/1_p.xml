<p>Based on sequential screening by EIA, ELISA and immunochromatography (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">methods</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007965.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) we selected a pair of mAbs: EE8 and XC2 as capture and detection mAbs respectively, since they were giving the lowest LOD in LFA. They were subsequently used in an Ebola sGP Detection Kit, a diagnostic test relying on silver amplification coupled to immunochromatography. Both EE8 and XC2 mAbs recognize sGP and GP from Mayinga and Makona, even though we note a better recognition for the secreted proteins as depicted in the
