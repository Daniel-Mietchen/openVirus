<p>As ZEBOV produced by Vero cells may not reflect production following infection of a whole organism, i.e. ratio of viral proteins may differ, especially sGP, we next evaluated the effect of human matrix (blood or plasma) on Ebola sGP Detection Kit LOD to detect ZEBOV in plasma of an infected monkey. To this end, we analyzed genome copy number and Ebola sGP Detection Kit test on monkey plasma at 7 days post-infection (inoculated with 10
 <sup>2</sup> FFU of ZEBOV Gabon). Monkey plasma was serially diluted in human plasma or blood. Ebola sGP Detection Kit gave positive results for conditions where genome copy numbers were as low as 1.55 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/ml when human plasma and blood were used as matrix (

Of note, linear regression analysis of Delta OD and genome copy log values showed that Ebola sGP Detection Kit test gave similar results independently of the human matrix used to dilute infected monkey plasma or cell supernatant (Student p values &gt; 0.05,
