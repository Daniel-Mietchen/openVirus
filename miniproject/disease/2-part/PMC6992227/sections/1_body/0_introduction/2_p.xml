<p>EBOV are enveloped single-stranded negative RNA viruses with a genome encoding seven genes. However, more than seven proteins are produced due to co-transcriptional editing and post-translational processing of the GP gene and gene products [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The expression strategy of GP gene of all EBOV involves transcriptional editing and gives rise to different glycosylated proteins [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a consequence, the GP gene encodes the envelop spike glycoprotein (GP) and at least two additional non-structural secreted glycoproteins (sGP and ssGP). The sGP glycoprotein is encoded by the non-edited mRNA, representing 75% of the GP gene-specific RNA [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The GP protein is encoded by the addition of a single adenosine residue at the editing site, which occurs in about 20% of the GP gene-specific transcripts. In about 5% of the GP gene-specific transcripts, addition of two adenosine residues generates transcripts encoding the non-structural small secreted GP transcripts (ssGP). Furthermore, GP is endoproteolytically cleaved into surface subunit GP1 and transmembrane subunit GP2 linked by a disulfide bond to form mature GP1,2 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As a consequence of these complex transcriptional steps, the main product transcribed from the GP gene, sGP is detected in significant amount in blood from animal models and acutely infected patients [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The multiple roles that sGP may play during infection include immunomodulatory functions such as an antigenic decoy activity, an inhibiting virus-specific neutralizing activity of GP antisera from survivors and an activity of antigen subversion of the humoral response to redirect the host immune repertoire toward epitopes that are sGP-specific or shared by the two proteins, sGP and GP [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It has also been proposed a role for GP proteins in regulating viral production and endothelial cell barrier functions in inflammatory conditions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. GP1,2 is also found in blood: cleavage of surface GP1,2 by the cellular metalloprotease TACE (TNFÎ±-converting enzyme) results in GP1,2 shedding (shed GP) [
