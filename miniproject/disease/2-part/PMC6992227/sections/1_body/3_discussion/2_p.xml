<p>Since our goal is to early detect infected patients following onset of symptoms, we choose to target GP proteins (sGP and GP) to maximize the capture and detection of antigens (sGP, shed GP, virions) through the entire course of infection. The main form is a secreted protein encoded by 70â€“80% of the primary open reading frame of 
 <italic>ebolavirus</italic> GP gene [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As expected, significant amounts of sGP were detected in acutely infected humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007965.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Following selection of mAbs and pairing experiments, we identified a pair of mAbs recognizing specifically ZEBOV sGP with a Kd of 10 nM. Selected mAbs also detect the recombinant GP by ELISA, but with a slightly lower intensity. These two mAbs were then used to establish an Ebola sGP Detection Kit.
