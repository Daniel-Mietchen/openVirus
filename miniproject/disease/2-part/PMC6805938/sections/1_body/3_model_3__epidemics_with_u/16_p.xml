<p id="Par37">This model shows that strategic rewiring affects epidemic dynamics in multiple ways. When infected individuals benefit from increasing the global number of infections, it leads to an accelerating uptake and a much faster global spread than an epidemic without strategic rewiring. If instead the infected individuals tend to assort, the epidemic can be stalled as infected individuals entirely disconnect from susceptible ones.</p>
