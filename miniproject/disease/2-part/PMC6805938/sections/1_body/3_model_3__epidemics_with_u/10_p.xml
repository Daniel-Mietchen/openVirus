<p id="Par31">This framework tells us how individual preferences translate into assortative or disassortative rewiring behavior for infected and susceptible individuals in the course of an epidemic. This allows us to formulate dynamics similar to those presented in the earlier sections (see Supplemental TextÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">C</xref> for the general derivation), but now derived from the preferences and predictions of individuals. By combining epidemiological modeling with strategic rewiring, our framework could be used to analyze social movements, the spread of technologies, and strategic rewiring dynamics in detrimental infections (e.g., in which individuals rewire to avoid infection
