 </sup>. However, because the contagion is detrimental to the host, there is usually a tension between behavior of infected individuals, affected by the contagion to try to increase its spread, and that of the uninfected population, attempting to limit it. The spread of a purely beneficial contagion would not involve this tension and we expect different spreading dynamics.
