<p id="Par21">The behaviors observed in our epidemiological models differ drastically from classic spreading dynamics. In short, the addition of the connectivity benefit affects how the average degree impacts the epidemic threshold, affects the exponential rate of early time spread, and affects the nature of the fixation dynamics which are sensitive to both how these new links are created and to whom. The impact of the benefit on the epidemic threshold and fixation dynamics are the most important because they illustrate how this model of benes on contact networks is not merely a different region of parameter space for classic models of epidemics on networks.</p>
