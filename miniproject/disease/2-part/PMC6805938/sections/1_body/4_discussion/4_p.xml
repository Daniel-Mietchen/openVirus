<p id="Par41">In the model of epidemics with utility benefits, individuals’ behavior is based on preferences for the distribution of the infection in the local neighborhood and global population. They strategically rewire based on predictions about how their actions will increase utility. One example is the phenomenon called NIMBY
 <sup>

 </sup>, where individuals have a preference for global adoption of a technology but do not want it in their immediate neighborhood, e.g. wind turbines. As we show in three illustrative cases, variation in the strength of these preferences leads to different dynamical regimes. In one regime, displayed by the

Social movements instilling the desire to convert anybody, and not just acquaintances, will spread quickly. In contrast, when individuals prefer to conform with their neighbors, as in the 
 <italic>cool kids</italic> and 
 <italic>snobs</italic> cases, assortative rewiring results in a disconnected network and a stalled epidemic. Thus, the outcome of an epidemic may reveal the mechanisms underlying its generating dynamics.
