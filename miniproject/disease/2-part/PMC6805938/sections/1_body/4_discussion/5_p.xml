<p id="Par42">It should be noted that our efforts provide a set of testable predictions regarding the dynamics of beneficial epidemics, and could be tested in a variety of contexts. For example, one could test the rate of spreading of a novel beneficial gene in a bacterial lineage as a function of both the degree of horizontal gene transfer and strength of the benefit. In many cases the observation of superexponential dynamics will require high resolution temporal data to accurately categorize a bene and the associated model parameters.</p>
