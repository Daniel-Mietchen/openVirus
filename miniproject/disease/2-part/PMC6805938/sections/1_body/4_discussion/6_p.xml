<p id="Par43">In this paper we considered the dynamics of beneficial epidemics for certain biological and social systems. We investigated contagions that confer specific types of benefits related to fitness or social utility, but many other types of beneficial epidemics are possible. For example, one could combine elements of our three models so that changes in social networks have cross-generational effects. Alternatively, one could consider a contagion that is beneficial to one type of host but harmful to others. These more complex models may exhibit other interesting behaviors that differ from the more traditionally and extensively studied harmful epidemics. By differentiating between the dynamics of various types of epidemics, it may be possible to identify distinct signatures of epidemics and determine the type of contagion as it is spreading in real time.</p>
