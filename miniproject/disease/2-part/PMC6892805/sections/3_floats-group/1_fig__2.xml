  <p>Specific humidity and precipitation drive RSV transmission. 
   <bold>a</bold> Model results for the predicted effect of specific humidity and precipitation on transmission. 
   <bold>b</bold> Normalized monthly RSV cases before peak incidence (gray) and after peak incidence (yellow) against mean monthly humidity for four locations in the dataset, month-of-year shown in point. 
   <bold>c</bold> Mean incidence averaged biennially for the same four locations demonstrating distinct dynamic patterns. 
   <bold>d</bold> Seasonal trajectory in terms of humidity and precipitation for same locations in 2010 and 2100, month-of-year shown in point. 
   <bold>e</bold> Boxplot showing seasonal change in transmission grouped by dynamic pattern.
