  <p>Projections of RSV dynamics under different climate scenarios. 
   <bold>a</bold> Simulated effect of log mean transmission and log seasonal transmission change (annual max–min transmission values) on dynamic pattern, holding births and initial population constant, with trajectories of current and future climate shown with arrows on the right plot. 
   <bold>b</bold> Simulated epidemic dynamics for three states in Mexico using precipitation projections from all climate models (gray lines). Ninetieth percentile (red), 50th percentile (orange), and 10th percentile (blue) in terms of the amplitude of seasonal transmission are highlighted. 
   <bold>c</bold> Map of the uncertainty in the projected 2100–2010 difference to log seasonal transmission change where outer circles is the upper 90th percentile and inset blue squares are the 10th percentile projections.
