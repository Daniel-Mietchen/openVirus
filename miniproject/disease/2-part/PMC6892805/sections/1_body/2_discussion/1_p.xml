<p id="Par17">Our model unites predictions for the climate drivers of RSV across both temperate and tropical locations, finding that the effect of low humidity trades off against rainfall drivers, depending on location. The striking similarity in the role of specific humidity for both influenza and RSV suggests that parallel mechanisms are at play for the two viruses (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>); however, the lack of an animal model for RSV means experimental work cannot currently be used to support our findings. This correspondence appears to hold even though the population dynamics of influenza and RSV are palpably different. Influenza disappears at high latitudes in the summer whereas RSV is much more endemic. Disentangling the roots of these differences is an important area for future work. Precipitation has also been hypothesized to be important for influenza transmission, although this has not been tested in laboratory settings, likely due to the relative complexity of experimental set-up

 </sup>. It is unknown whether physical processes such as aerosol deposition, or behavioral processes such as grouping indoors, explain the mechanism of precipitation drivers of transmission for both RSV and influenza.
