Less attention has been paid to directly-transmitted infections, despite key work on influenza demonstrating the significant role climatic variables can play in driving the transmission of these types of infections. Experimental studies show that influenza transmission increases in conditions of low humidity

 </sup>. Observational studies in temperate climates support this finding; while in tropical locations, influenza peaks have been observed to occur in the rainy season when humidity increases
