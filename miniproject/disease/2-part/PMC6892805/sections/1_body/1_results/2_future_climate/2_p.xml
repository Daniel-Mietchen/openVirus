<p id="Par14">While individual CMIP5 models are consistent in projecting increasing surface air temperature and hence specific humidity, there is significant disagreement across models with regard to future changes to regional precipitation

 </sup>. Given that precipitation is found to be an important driver of RSV, particularly in tropical locations, we explore the implications of the model range in precipitation projections for future RSV epidemic dynamics. In Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b we show simulations of the RSV cycle for three locations in Mexico where transmission is driven by humidity, fixed at the 2100 CMIP5 multi-model-mean and precipitation, based on trajectories from all 23 CMIP5 models (three models did not include explicit precipitation projections and are removed). The upper 90th percentile, the 50th percentile, and the lower 10th percentile, in terms of the amplitude of RSV transmission predicted by the model, are highlighted within the figure.
