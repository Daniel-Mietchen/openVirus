<p id="Par11">We consider the implications of our estimated climate effect for four locations in our dataset with exemplar dynamic patterns and timing of epidemic onset (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, c). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d we show the seasonal trajectories for these locations, with the mean monthly rainfall and humidity overlaid on our predicted transmission effect. Hennepin County, MN, an example of a location with biennial outbreaks, has large changes in predicted transmission over the course of the year, with maximum transmission in the winter months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) when peak incidence also occurs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Kings County, NY, an example of a location with annual outbreaks, has a wintertime peak in predicted transmission driven by declining humidity, though not to the same extent as the biennial test case. In contrast, our model predicts that Miami-Dade County, FL, an example of a shallow-trough location, experiences peak transmission in the summer months driven by summertime rainfall. The dominance of the rainfall effect means that Miami experiences an increase in cases even as humidity increases, a reversal of the patterns observed over most US counties (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), which explains the early onset of the epidemic in this location.
