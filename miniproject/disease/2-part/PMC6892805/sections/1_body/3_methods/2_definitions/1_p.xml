<p id="Par27">We define three types of dynamic pattern observed in the location-specific time series within the dataset. Shallow-trough dynamics are defined as when the annual mean minimum incidence for a particular location exceeds 5% of the mean maximum incidence. Biennial locations are defined using the significance of the biennial signal using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We use a significance value of 1% (all
