<p id="Par28">To calculate mean onset week we first calculate mean incidence per week (i.e., each week averaged over all years for a given locations), and then normalize these values between 0 and 1. We define the start of the epidemic period as the 26th week of the year, approximately the first week of July. This period is chosen as it spans all epidemics within our data (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). We define onset as when normalized incidence exceeds 0.2, assuming this value is low enough to constitute onset but high enough to exceed random fluctuations in the data. Using normalized incidence, as opposed to incidence/population thresholds, allows to create a uniform measure across both US and Mexican datasets in spite of sampling differences between the two locations.
