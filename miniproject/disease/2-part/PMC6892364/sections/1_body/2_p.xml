<p id="Par4">The definitive diagnosis of many infectious diseases still relies on direct observation of the causing pathogens. However, at many times this is difficult to achieve, especially for viral diseases because of the size of virus particles. For example, the microscopic examination of acid-fast bacilli remains the main tool for tuberculosis detection, yet the technique sensitivity varies on smearing, staining, and slide reading [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, molecular techniques, such as PCR or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay have been developed to assist in a more reliable diagnosis. They are designed to detect the presence of infecting pathogen molecularly. Because it directly measures the nucleic acids or proteins of infecting pathogens, the risk of missing the organism in direct observation may be avoided.
