<p id="Par13">With the increase of MinION sequencing power, whole-genome sequencing of pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and human [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] using MinION has become common practice in the field or clinical settings. Metagenomic sequencing, previously limited to high-throughput short-read sequencers, has gotten more applications with MinION [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although the ideal approach is to make no presumptions about the infecting pathogens and sequence all the DNA materials contained in the environmental or clinical specimens, there are many technical difficulties, such as the low titer of the infecting agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and large host DNA background [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Sequencing the cultured isolates might overcome the problems. However, because only 1–2% of bacteria can be cultured [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], unculturable bacteria might be overlooked, so are the cases with virus, fungi, or parasite infections.
