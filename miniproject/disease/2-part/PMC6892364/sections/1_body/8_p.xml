<p id="Par10">The portability of MinION comes at the expense of sequencing accuracy. Despite recent improvements to the chemistry and computational tools, the sequencing errors are still between 5 and 15% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Consensus calling using bioinformatics tools can improve accuracy to more than 97% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. When consensus calling was applied to simultaneously screen for multiple antimalarials resistance, it was clear that north Indonesia, north Vietnam, and southeast Thailand had different mutation patterns in 
 <italic>K13</italic> gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the gene related to artemisinin resistance, that were in concordance with a major paper describing the artemisinin-resistance related mutations around the Mekong region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, the mutations conferring resistance to chloroquine were similar in these three regions. This method applies the amplification of multiple genes with PCR. The sequencing depth is high so consensus sequence can be generated with high confidence. Targeted sequencing is cost efficient by performing multiplex sequencing. Although the running cost of other sequencing platform is cheaper than MinION (for example, $67.82 for MiSeq compared with $71.56 for MinION per sample [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]), MinION has significantly lower cost to set up.
