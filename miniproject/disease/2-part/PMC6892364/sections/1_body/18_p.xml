<p id="Par20">Sequencing as a technique may become the gold standard of diagnosis with the advent of portable sequencing. The technology is still evolving but it has shown development in portability, sequencing accuracy, and ease of operation. In portability, new type of flowcell and equipment can enhance sequencing in the field or in the laboratory. Additional equipment such as Voltrax (an add-on for the flowcell which will automate library preparation) or MinIT (a GPU computer) may eliminate the need to for extraction kit or laptop computer. Many methods have been shown to be successful coupled with MinION. If targeted sequencing is needed, existing methods, such as LAMP can amplify genes of interest in an isothermal reaction, eliminating the need for thermal cycler. MDA can amplify whole genome of pathogens to reach the optimum input DNA concentration. The isothermal nature of the enzymes used in LAMP and MDA is also advantageous for field or clinical settings. The sequencing power is now enough for unbiased metagenomic sequencing. All of these will pave the way for the portable sequencer be used in field or clinical setting to assist in the fight against infectious disease.</p>
