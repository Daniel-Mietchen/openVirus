<p id="Par6">There are many genetic analyses designed to confirm diagnosis or to test for microbial resistance. PCR can be used to detect the presence of pathogen DNA. Using multiplex primers targeting DNA of many organisms, an investigator can detect the presence of single or multiple infecting agents [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. PCR can also be used to check for single nucleotide polymorphisms conferring drug resistance. By creating primers matched the substituted nucleotide, the susceptibility or resistance can be determined by the absence or presence of certain bands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Combination with real-time PCR using probes specific to mutations will amplify mutated gene and can be observed in real time [
