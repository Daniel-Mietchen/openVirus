<p id="Par19">These developments open many research possibilities by allowing both genome and epigenome to be analyzed from a single sequencing run [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. For example, 16s ribosomal RNA (16s rRNA) can be sequenced with RNA sequencing. Theoretically, the method can identify bacteria species and screen for antibiotics resistance simultaneously. By identifying gain or loss of ribosomal RNA base modifications, antibiotic resistance can be inferred [
