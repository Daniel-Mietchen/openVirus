  <p>Influenza A virus structure and genome organization. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Virion structure: Influenza A viruses include a lipid envelope containing the two viral glycoproteins (HA, green and NA, purple). The ion channel M2 (red) protein is also located in the membrane. Under the viral bilayer is located a protein layer composed of the M1 (light blue) protein, and the NEP (yellow). Inside the virion are located the eight vRNA segments coated by the NP (pink) as viral vRNP complexes and associated with the viral polymerase complex made of the three polymerase subunits PB2 (red), PB1 (blue) and PA (gray). Viral components in the vRNP and in the viral particle are indicated. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Genome organization: Influenza A virus contains eight ss, negative-sense, viral RNA segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS). Each viral segment contains non-coding regions (NCR, black) and the packaging signals (PKS, gray) at the 3′ and 5′ termini in each of the viral segments.
