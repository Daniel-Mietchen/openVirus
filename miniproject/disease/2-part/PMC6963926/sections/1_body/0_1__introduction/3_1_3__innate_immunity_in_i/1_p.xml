<p>The cellular defense mechanisms provided by the innate immune system are a formidable barrier to inhibit virus infections [
 <xref rid="B50-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and involve the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This recognition leads to the activation of signaling pathways and the production and secretion of IFNs of type I (IFNα and IFNβ) and III (IFNλ2 or IL-28A, IFNλ3 or IL-28B, and IFNλ1 or IL-29), and chemokines and cytokines involved in inflammatory processes [
 <xref rid="B50-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. IAV RNAs are mainly recognized by the endosomal, membrane-associated PRR Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 (double-stranded RNAs, dsRNAs) or 7/8 (ssRNAs), respectively [

 <xref rid="B51-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], by the cytoplasmic PRR retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which detects dsRNA and 5′- triphosphates of the negative ssRNA viral genome [

 <xref rid="B52-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], generated during replication of multiple viruses, by the NOD-like receptor family member NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), which recognizes various stimuli (see below) [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and by the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) protein, recognizing not well-characterized influenza stimuli [
 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The result of PRR detection of viral PAMPs is the activation of multiple transcription factors, such as the nuclear factor kappa β (NF-κB), the activator protein 1 (AP-1), and IFN regulatory factors (IRF)-3 and IRF-7, which are responsible for the transcription of IFNs [
