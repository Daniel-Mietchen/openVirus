<p>Human IAV infections cause contagious respiratory diseases associated with mild to severe respiratory illness or even death, and they are considered as an important public health threat worldwide, which also results in significant economic losses [

 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. IAV are divided into multiple subtypes, based on the HA and NA glycoproteins. Currently, there are 18 HA (H1 to H18) and 11 NA (N1 to N11), but the growing IAV surveillance programs and sequencing technologies could increase the number of subtypes in the following years. IAV can infect a wide range of avian and mammalian species, although the natural reservoirs of IAV are shorebirds and wild waterfowls [

 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Among all the HA and NA subtypes, only H3N2 and H1N1 IAV subtypes are circulating in human beings and they are responsible for annual recurrent epidemics that affect the entire world [

Seasonal influenza infections are prevented and controlled through annual vaccination campaigns to decrease IAV infections and viral transmission as well as to reduce their negative impact in the global economy. However, although vaccination remains the most effective approach to protect the population from seasonal infections, the effectiveness of current vaccination approaches is suboptimal [

Concerns associated with IAV are further aggravated by the adaptive capacity of the viruses to infect new hosts or escape to the immune system, as well as their ability to transmit efficiently in the population and the limited therapeutic options to treat viral infections [
