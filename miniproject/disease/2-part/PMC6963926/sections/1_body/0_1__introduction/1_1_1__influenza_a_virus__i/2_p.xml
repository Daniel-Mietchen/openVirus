<p>The viral envelope is decorated with the two viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) at a ratio of approximately four to one, respectively [

 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HA envelope protein mediates virus entry by binding to sialic acid-containing cell receptors, and then fusing endosomal and viral membranes during endocytosis [

 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while NA is required for viral release from infected host cells, and it acts as a receptor destroying enzyme, cleaving terminal sialic acid residues from glycoproteins present at the cell surface [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The matrix 2 (M2) protein is also found in the viral membrane, although in much lower abundance than HA or NA glycoproteins. M2 is a small transmembrane protein that forms a proton-selective ion channel in the viral envelope. M2 promotes uncoating of the vRNPs after membrane fusion and the protein has also an essential role in viral assembly and release [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Under the viral envelop, there is an inner shell composed of the matrix 1 (M1) protein, which interacts in the virion with the vRNP and the HA and NA proteins. M1 apart from being a membrane-associated scaffold factor of the virion, acts as a crucial factor for different viral processes during infection, including virion assembly and budding [

 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The nonstructural (NS) gene or segment 8 of IAV encodes an mRNA transcript that is alternatively spliced to express two viral proteins, the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), produced from a continuous primary transcript, and the nuclear export protein (NEP), which is produced by an alternatively processed transcript, using a weak 5â€² splice site. NEP is also located in the virion and may interact with M1 in the viral particle [

 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00168-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). During the infection, NEP is responsible for the nuclear export of synthetized vRNP, ensuring that the vRNPs are available for packaging [
 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, NEP has also other functions during IAV infection, contributing to viral budding and to regulate viral RNA synthesis. NS1 is a multifunctional protein and a key viral factor that counteracts the host antiviral responses. NS1 has been shown to inhibit the production of interferon (IFN), the activity and expression of multiple interferon-induced genes (ISG) and the processing and nuclear transport of host mRNAs causing cellular shut-off [

 <xref rid="B26-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Segment 3 of IAV also encodes two proteins, the polymerase component PA and PA-X. PA is translated directly from the PA mRNA, whereas PA-X is translated using a +1 frameshift mechanism from the same open reading frame (ORF) [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Synergistically with NS1, PA-X is also able to block the cellular antiviral responses by inhibiting host protein expression. Moreover, the PA-X protein has been shown to modulate host inflammation, immune responses, apoptosis, and virus pathogenesis [
