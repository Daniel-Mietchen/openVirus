<p>In summary, SNPs may influence gene regulation, the structure and stability of RNA, the expression of RNAs or proteins, the conformation and function of proteins, etc. Thus, the identification of SNPs in genes and the analysis of their effects may lead us to better understand gene function or their impact on human health [
 <xref rid="B84-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In fact, SNPs that are or could be important for multiple human pathologies, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, schizophrenia, blood-pressure homeostasis, and autoimmune or metabolic diseases, have been identified [

Advanced sequencing and bioinformatics technologies have allowed the identification of a large number of human SNPs whose information is accessible in the databases. Nevertheless, the biological significance and function for most of the SNPs found in the human genome remain unknown. Currently, the scientific community recognizes the importance of this kind of genome variations that can act as biological markers and assist researchers in multiple aspects, such as: (1) Locate genes associated with multiple diseases, (2) anticipate an individualâ€™s response to a specific infection, (3) predict population responses to several treatments such as drugs or vaccines, (4) design individualized therapies, (5) identify markers for medical testing, (6) perform pharmacogenetic studies, etc. This review focuses on the role of known SNPs on IAV infection, as well as their impact on the effectiveness of vaccines against IAV.
