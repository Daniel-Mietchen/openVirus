<p>The sequencing of the human genome together with the development of novel bioinformatic tools have made possible the identification of multiple SNPs. More information is available for the scientific community in the databases. In addition, the identification and study of the human genome variability has opened the opportunity to investigate their association with the risk of developing multiple human diseases facilitating their diagnosis or the susceptibility to infections caused by viruses or other pathogens. Moreover, the knowledge and analysis of genomic variability will be a valuable tool to predict the outcome of prophylactic or therapeutic interventions, including vaccines and drugs. The analysis of human SNPs and their association with IAV infections or vaccination outcomes have just begun. However, current research and data reflect the importance to obtain a better understanding of these relations and the mechanisms underlying the effect of SNPs in the human immune system. In the future, this knowledge could be used to better understand host factors affecting viral replication and disease severity and to develop new and more effective therapeutic strategies against viral infections. </p>
