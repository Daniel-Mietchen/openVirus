<p>Soluble pattern-recognition molecules, forming part of the innate immune system, can neutralize IAV infection. Particularly, the serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL), several secreted human C-type lectins of the collectin family, collectin 11, and the pulmonary surfactant proteins (SP) –A1, –A2, and –D (SFTPA1, SFTPA2, and SFTPD, respectively), may neutralize IAV infectivity in vitro [

Two frequent SP-A2 (SFTPA2) missense alleles (rs1965708-C, leading to the mutation Q223K and rs1059046-A, leading to the mutation T9N) were associated with acute respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome after infection with pH1N1 2009 virus in a Spanish population [
