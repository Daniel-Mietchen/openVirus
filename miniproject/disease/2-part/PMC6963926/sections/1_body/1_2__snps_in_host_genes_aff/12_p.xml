<p>CD55 is an important complement regulatory protein which blocks C3 and C5 activation by preventing the formation of new C3 and C5 convertases, two proteases involved in inflammation and complement activation. Consequently, CD55 protects cells from complement attack and decreases amplification of the complement cascade [

 <xref rid="B139-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] and individuals with this genotype showed significantly lower levels of CD55 expression in comparison to those with the more frequent allele [
 <xref rid="B137-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Therefore, patients who carry the T/T genotype may have more robust complement activation during IAV infection, resulting in enhanced inflammation and disease severity [

 <xref rid="B79-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. According to these results, the polymorphism rs2564978 in gene CD55 was linked to disease severity in adult Chinese cases of avian (H7N9) and human pH1N1 IAV in another study [
