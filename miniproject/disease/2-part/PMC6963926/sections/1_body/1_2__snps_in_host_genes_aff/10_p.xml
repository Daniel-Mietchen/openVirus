<p>TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which orchestrates the host´s defense. A minor allele (A) at position -238 of TNF (SNP rs361525) was more frequent in Greek patients infected with pH1N1 virus compared to control subjects [
 <xref rid="B130-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>], and developing pneumonia was more uncommon in Greek and Mexican subjects with no copies of the minor allele compared to subjects with at least one copy of the minor allele [

 <xref rid="B131-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], leading to the hypothesis that this SNP allele could be linked with an elevated susceptibility to infection with the pH1N1 virus [

 <xref rid="B130-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Decreased TNF-α expression was observed in subjects encoding the minor allele at position -238 [
 <xref rid="B92-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. This may explain how SNPs leading to lower production of TNF-α may predispose to more severe clinical symptoms following IAV infections. However, the TNF-α rs 1800629 minor A allele, associated with higher levels of TNF-α expression, was associated with susceptibility to Japanese Encephalitis virus infection in an Indian population [

 <xref rid="B133-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], suggesting that the protective or deleterious roles of TNF-α expression may vary depending on the infecting virus.
