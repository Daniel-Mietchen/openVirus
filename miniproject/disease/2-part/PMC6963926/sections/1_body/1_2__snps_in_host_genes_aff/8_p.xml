<p>Another important SNP (rs34481144) associated with risk of severe influenza in humans from the United States (US) infected with seasonal IAVs is located in the 5â€²-UTR of the IFITM3 gene [
 <xref rid="B123-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>,
 <xref rid="B124-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. This SNP affected IFITM3 expression being the risk allele associated with lower mRNA expression. The mechanism for this lower mRNA expression involves the decreased IRF-3 binding and increased binding of the transcriptional repressor CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in promoter-binding assays for the risk allele [

Moreover, the risk allele disrupted a CpG site that becomes differentially methylated in CD8+ T cell subsets, leading to less CD8+ T cells in the airways during natural influenza infection in the carriers of the risk allele, and suggesting that a critical role for IFITM3 may be to promote immune cell persistence at mucosal sites [
