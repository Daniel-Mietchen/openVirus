<p>RIG-I detects dsRNA and 5â€²-triphosphates of the negative ssRNA IAV genome, leading to innate immune responses activation [
 <xref rid="B52-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A Caucasian male patient with severe IAV H1N1 infection during the 2009 swine flu pandemic showed two heterozygous variants (one in each chromosome): p.R71H (SNP rs72710678) and p.P885S (SNP rs138425677), located, respectively, in the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) and RNA binding domains of RIG-I [
 <xref rid="B109-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. These variants significantly decreased the recognition function of RIG-I, and therefore, patient cells proved impaired antiviral responses to RIG-I ligands and elevated proinflammatory responses to IAV, providing evidence for dysregulation of the innate immune response and increased immunopathology [
 <xref rid="B109-pathogens-08-00168" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. These results suggest that these RIG-I polymorphisms may have contributed to severe IAV outcome in this patient and reinforce that RIG-I variants should be evaluated in future studies of host factors affecting ssRNA virus infections.
