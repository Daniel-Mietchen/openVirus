<p>Mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL-2) is a protein that binds N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, and fucose on different microorganisms and activates the lectin complement pathway [

For that, authors classified the vaccine recipients in poor, normal or adverse responders. They observed that the G to A SNP in the codon 54 allele (rs1800450) in MBL-2 was associated with a decreased risk for the development of adverse or poor responses (
