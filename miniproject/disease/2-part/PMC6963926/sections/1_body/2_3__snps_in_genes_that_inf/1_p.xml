<p>Currently, IAV vaccines are the main strategy to prevent IAV infection, though their effectiveness is suboptimal in many cases. Notably, the efficacy of vaccines against IAV infections can fluctuate and there is a significant immune response variability across the population. Factors such as previous exposure to IAV infections or vaccines, age, and the closeness of the match between the vaccine and circulating strains are important to explain differences in vaccine effectiveness between seasons and group populations [
