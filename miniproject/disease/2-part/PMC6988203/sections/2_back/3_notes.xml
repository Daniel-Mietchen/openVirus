  <title>Authors’ informations</title>
  <p id="Par50">Edson Kinimi is a molecular biochemist in the Department of Veterinary Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology, at Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), Morogoro, Tanzania. Edson holds a Master of Science in One Health Molecular Biology from SUA and at the moment is a PhD student in the development of nanobody-based diagnostics for viral diseases that threaten food security. His interest is on bioscience engineering.</p>
  <p id="Par51">Steven Odongo is Lecturer in the Department of Biotechnical and Diagnostic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine Animal Resources and Biosecurity, Makerere University, Kampala (Uganda). He holds a Doctorate of Bioscience Engineering from Vrije University Brussel (Belgium), Master of Science in Molecular Biology from Catholic University Leuven (Belgium) and Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine from Makerere University. His research interest is in development of immunodiagnostics for infectious diseases agents burdening sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
  <p id="Par52">Serge Muyldermans is professor at the ‘Cellular and Molecular Immunology’ research group from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium. He holds doctorate in sciences from the same university and was trained as a biochemist. He developed a technology to identify nanobodies, i.e. recombinant single-domain antigen binding fragments from camel heavy chain antibodies. Nanobodies can be selected with specificity to any antigen of interest. The research interest of Serge Muyldermans is in exploring new applications for the nanobodies.</p>

He holds a Doctorate and Bachelors degree in Veterinary Medicine and Masters degree in Medical Sciences and Applied Biology from the University of Cambridge. His research interests are in One Health, Wildlife Diseases, viral and bacterial plagues of conservation and economic impact.</p>
  <p id="Par54">Gerald Misinzo is an associate professor of veterinary virology at the Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Parasitology and Biotechnology of the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, and Leader of SACIDS-ACE at SUA. He holds a PhD in veterinary medicine from the University of Ghent in Belgium a Master of Science in Molecular Biology from Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven, Belgium) and a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine from SUA. His research interest is on viral epidemics of short-cycle stocks.</p>
