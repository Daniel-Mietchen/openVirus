<p id="Par30">Studies have shown that both camels and suids are susceptible to PPRV infection and develop clinical disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The role of wildlife animals and domestic Artiodactyls in the epidemiology of PPR is unknown or insufficiently understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Infections of various wildlife species including African buffalo (
 <italic>Syncerus caffer</italic>) and many antelope species occur apparently subclinical [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] but the only confirmed reports of disease in African wildlife have occurred under captive or semi-free range conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. According to previous studies, animals that recover from PPRV infections develop life-long immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Because of its immunosuppressive effect, PPRV infections are usually accompanied by secondary infections thereby complicating clinical diagnosis.
