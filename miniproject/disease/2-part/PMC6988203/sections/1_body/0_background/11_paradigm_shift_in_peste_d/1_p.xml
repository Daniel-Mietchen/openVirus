<p id="Par37">For PPR diagnosis, a plethora of serological and molecular assays have been developed with continuous on-going improvements. The assays detect PPRV antigens, nucleic acid or PPRV induced antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. These assays include agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA),reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) either gel-based or real time, or reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays (RT-PRA), immunochromatographic lateral flow devices (IC-LFDs), luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) and pseudotype-based assays. They vary in their technical demands, but all require a laboratory with exception of IC-LFDs, and possibly RT-LAMP and RT-RPA (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The AGID and CIE assays are less sensitive at the early stages of infection where antigen levels are below detectable threshold and could only detect 42.6% of ante-mortem and necropsy specimens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Thus, progress was made to replace them with assays that are more sensitive and specific, such as ELISA, immunochromatographic assays and nucleic acid-based assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. ELISA employs an enzyme–substrate reaction for the detection of antigen–antibody interactions. They are suitable for screening large sample sizes and better documentation of evidence-based clinical samples status. Later on, a high sensitive immunocapture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IC-ELISA) was developed based on conventional monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)and it demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity of 10

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Again, sandwich-ELISA and dot-ELISA based on conventional antibodies were developed and they have been in use since 2002. Dot-ELISA when was compared for its relative diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with routinely used sandwich-ELISA were 82% and 91% respectively, for the diagnosis of PPR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. However, dot-ELISA could serve as simple field test to screen clinical samples from suspected PPR cases. In comparison with commercial IC-ELISA kit, sandwich ELISA exhibited 88.9% and 92.8% relative diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Although the sensitivity of the dot-ELISA is lower, it can also be used in combination with other assays such as LIPS, pseudotype-based assays and nucleic acid-based tests in laboratories where resources are limited. The gel based RT-PCR assays serve to detect viral nucleic acid with high sensitivity and accuracy regardless of being labor intensive, time-consuming and prone to high risk of cross-contamination. Alternatively, real-time RT-PCR assays detect and quantify PPRV present in clinical samples in real time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. The high cost of the equipment and technical demands impede its utility in low-income countries. In low-income countries, potent, inexpensive field-deployable diagnostic tools are prospect for use in the prevention and control measures of PPR. Recently developed lateral flow devices based on conventional antibodies have rejuvenated hopes in the least developed countries for rapid detection of PPRV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Despite the pen-side versatility of some lateral flow devices, their sensitivities were not able to detect PPRV in clinical samples with a low virus load as sensitively when compared to IC-ELISA, LIPS and nucleic acid-based diagnostic tools. Detection of serum antibody is also not effective because all assays based on detection of PPRV antibody could not differentiate infected animals from vaccinated animals. Recombinant antigen-based assays are of value during post vaccination evaluation and in the last phase of eradication where free PPRV diagnostic tools are required [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. On the other hand, a battery of potential field-based diagnostic tools have been developed and introduced for use in the diagnosis of PPR (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).
