<p id="Par40">A novel inexpensive RT-LAMP provides an isothermal method to amplify viral RNA without the requirement of expensive specific thermal cycler [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, RT-LAMP reagents can be stored at ambient temperature for at least 2Â weeks. The RT-LAMP reaction could be performed in an inexpensive water bath, dry bath, or heat block and the reaction results could be directly distinguished through color change or formation of the precipitate by the naked eye or alternatively via agarose gel electrophoresis or real-time turbid meter. Reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification assays have been developed for the diagnosis of PPR based on M and N genes of PPRV with higher sensitivity than RT-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This sensitive, inexpensive and streamlined method can be more readily used in developing countries that do not have access to high technology laboratories. However, in each RT-LAMP assay, primers must be specifically designed to be compatible with the target nucleic acid sequences, which may discourage researchers. In addition, the RT-LAMP assay requires six primers and has unsatisfactory reliability in detection of highly variable viruses. An alternative field deployable recombinase polymerase amplification assay was developed targeting viruses of veterinary importance [
