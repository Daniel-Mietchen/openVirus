<p id="Par42">The Oxford nanopore MinION technology brings rapid comprehensive detection, diagnostics, and bio-surveillance of emerging infectious diseases to extremely remote and physical challenging geographical landscapes, completely detached from the traditional physical building. This technology has been used in arbovirus surveillance and during Ebola and Zika outbreaks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. This technology is non-PCR-based tool for meta-transcriptomic detection of RNA virus from the clinical samples using Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers. In principle, clinical samples are processed in the Biomeme’s bulk nucleic acid extraction developer kit. There are few challenges in applying Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing to diagnosis of infectious diseases, these include; high host’s nucleic acid to pathogen ratio and low quality nucleic acid in the sample. It is, therefore, very important to carefully design, develop and optimise diagnostics pipelines before attempting to apply them to clinical samples. This diagnostic platform may provide the capacity for genomic surveillance of PPRV as well as other infectious diseases in resource-limited settings in real time.
