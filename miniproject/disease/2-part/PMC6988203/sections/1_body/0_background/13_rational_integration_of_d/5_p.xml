<p id="Par47">Civil unrest, global climate and environmental change from hurricanes, flooding, and earthquakes have a dramatic influence on the frequency of certain diseases in new locations. A minute or dramatic change in the environment can have a significant impact on the spread of diseases including PPR. These catastrophes including droughts or wars may lead to humans’ movements from place to place with their belongings, including animals. In such situations, contagious diseases like PPR may spread very rapidly. Therefore to curb PPR spread and control animals’ movements, highly sensitive nucleic acid-based field-deployable diagnostic tools are critical tools in keeping up with continuously changing disease dynamics. In addition, prompt outbreak identification is central to controlling the spread of highly contagious diseases like PPR, but recognizing that an outbreak has occurred can be difficult. Most molecular methods to detect different viral strains require that specimens are sent to distant reference laboratories, with confirmation of an outbreak possibly requiring days to weeks in resource-constrained countries. The development and use of both field deployable immunoassays and molecular diagnostic tools such as IC-LFDs, RT-LAMP, RT-RPA and Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers may play a significant role in controlling disease outbreaks in extremely remote areas in which transportation of clinical samples in optimum cold chain is unreliable (Fig.
