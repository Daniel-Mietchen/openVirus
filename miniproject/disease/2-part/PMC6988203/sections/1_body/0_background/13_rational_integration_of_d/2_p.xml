<p id="Par44">Most of PPR field deployable IC-LFDs have lower sensitivity than IC-ELISA, LIPS and nucleic acid-based tests, but they are still useful tests on the PPR-battlefield in extremely remote settings, away from traditional veterinary laboratories. For instance, in the entire flock, if a less sensitive test has scored some animals’ positive for PPR, the herd would be grouped as infected or at risk of developing a disease. Therefore field level diagnosis should be institutionalised for early screening and transportation of PPRV suspected samples from rural remote areas and ecosystem containing susceptible wildlife. In turn, early control measures will be put in place to prevent further spread of PPRV to neighboring flocks or a distant PPRV free zone (Fig.
