 <italic>Peste des petits ruminants virus</italic> (PPRV) causes an acute and highly contagious infection, which can cause significant socio-economic losses in domestic animals and threatens the conservation of wild herbivores. The PPRV belongs to the genus Morbillivirus of the family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which includes eradicated 
 <italic>Rinderpest virus, Measles virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Canine distemper virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Phocine distemper virus</italic>, Cetacean and Feline morbilliviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Rapid field diagnostics against rinderpest became available in final phases of the eradication process, but were never really tested within livestock whilst proving valuable in wildlife environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The rinderpest eradication in 2011 provided the pathway and the possibility of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) eradication given the close phylogeny of these viruses, availability of a reliable and effective vaccine against PPR and sensitive and specific diagnostic tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. PPR most likely emerged in the early part of the twentieth century whilst its presence was masked by ongoing rinderpest epidemics, which also affected small stocks and where immunity was cross protective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Based on phylo-geographical analysis, geographic origins of the most recent common ancestor of PPRV lineages I, II, and III were proposed to originate from Africa whilst lineage IV might have originated from India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. PPRV has continued to expand its geographic boundaries, reaching regions previously not infected and putting hundreds of millions of both domestic small ruminants and wildlife at risk of infection. However, the occurrence of PPRV in previously uninfected regions, together with the mixing of lineages in endemically infected countries, highlights the dynamic and transboundary nature of this disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The expansion of PPR range has been known for many decades but it has taken a considerable time to raise international interest and to bring PPR to the status of a priority disease for livelihood and food security. PPR was finally included in the Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs), an initiative of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The annual global impacts of PPR was in 2017 estimated at between US$1.4 and $2.1 billion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, it is estimated that an investment of US$ 7.1 billion on global PPR eradication could be recovered within 5 years of successful eradication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some academics believe that the actual cost of eradication could be much lower than this [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but unfortunately the tardiness of the response to its expansion, increases the likely cost by the day.
