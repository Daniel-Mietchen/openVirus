<p id="Par34">PPRV exists as a single serotype, but is divided into four distinct genetic lineages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The development of necessary tools for PPRV control, including vaccines and diagnostics, greatly relied on detailed insights into the PPRV genome and protein constituents; and on this same basis the virus is now classified into lineages. Structurally, the N protein is divided into four regions I, II, III and IV of amino acids sequences, 1–120, 121–145, 146–398 and 421–525, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Owing to high immunogenicity of regions I and II, these could be targeted for improvement and development of immunoassays. On the other hand, based on H protein mapping of the functional domain, two regions are the most immuno-dominant epitopes (263–368 and 539–609) and are diverse among all the members of Morbilliviruses with significant potential for development of a DIVA vaccine that could differentiate infected from vaccinated animals [
