  <p>Phylogenetic analyses of (A) hemagglutinin and (B) neuraminidase gene sequences of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (A/giant panda/Hong Kong/MISO20/2018) isolated from a giant panda in Hong Kong, China (bold), and other previously characterized strains retrieved from GISAID. The trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using Kimura 2-parameter in MEGA6 (

A total of 1,691 nt positions in hemagglutinin and 1,404 in neuraminidase genes were included in the analyses. Bootstrapping was performed with 1,000 replicates; only bootstrap values
