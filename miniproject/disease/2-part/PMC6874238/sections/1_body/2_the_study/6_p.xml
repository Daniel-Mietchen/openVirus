<p>Rapid antigen detection on the nasal swab specimen collected on day 1 was positive for influenza A virus. The viral load (± SD) in the nasal swabs on day 1 of the illness was 5.84 ± 0.07 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL; on day 2, 5.81 ± 0.05 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL; and on day 3, 2.83 ± 0.16 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL. On day 5, viral loads became undetectable (

MDCK cells inoculated with the nasal sample showed cytopathic effect on day 3 of incubation with cell rounding, progressive degeneration, and detachment. Serologically, HI and MN antibodies against pH1N1 were undetectable &gt;40 days before the onset of the illness and on days 1 and 4 of the illness, but high titers (HI, 1:320; MN, 1:160) were detected in the second and the fourth week after the onset of the illness (
