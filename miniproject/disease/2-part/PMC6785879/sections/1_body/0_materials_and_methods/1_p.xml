<p id="Par29">In order to ensure a systematic, up-to-date review of the literature the following search strategy was implemented. Harzing’s 
 <italic>Publish or Perish</italic> software (Windows GUI Edition) 7.10.2373.7118 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] was used to search and extract relevant literature from the online databases Google Scholar. The review keywords “Schmallenberg virus, 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>, ruminants Ireland” (and their combinations using AND/OR) were entered in the 
 <italic>Publish or Perish</italic> software. All publications between the years 2011 (the year Schmallenberg virus was first identified) and 2019 were searched. No restrictions on language were imposed so long as an English abstract was available. All relevant publications were added to the master list (
 <italic>n</italic> = 576). Each publication was then critically evaluated (removing duplicates) to determine whether it had information which met the aim of this review or not; all relevant publications were then selected for possible inclusion in this review. The bibliographies within these publications were also searched for further relevant publications. In total, 226 publications met the inclusion criteria set out in the aim of the literature review and so were cited.
