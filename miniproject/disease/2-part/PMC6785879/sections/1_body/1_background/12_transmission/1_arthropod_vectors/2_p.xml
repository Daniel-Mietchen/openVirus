<p id="Par55">In order to implicate potential 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species in SBV transmission, 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> specimens (entire specimens or heads only) can be tested for SBV RNA using RT-qPCR. Regarding entire specimen analysis, pigmented (parous; 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> that have oviposited and blood-fed at least once) 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> specimens are considered more appropriate for virus detection studies compared to nulliparous, blood-fed or gravid 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> specimens for a number of reasons. Pigmented (parous) 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> are likely to survive long enough for virus replication and dissemination within the vector and complete a full lifecycle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) resulting in full dissemination of the virus within the insect. In contrast, nulliparous 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> are not considered appropriate because they have not yet taken a blood meal from a mammalian host. However, it must be noted that nulliparous 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> can test positive for SBV RNA; this is suggestive of transovarial transmission within the vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Blood-fed 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> are also considered inappropriate because positive detection of virus RNA could be a result from the blood meal in their mid-gut rather than fully disseminated virus infection in the midge (i.e. the virus may be present in the mid-gut but not present in the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> salivary glands). While gravid 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> could be used in theory (as there is no longer a blood meal in the abdomen), positive detection of virus RNA could be ambiguous as it could be a result of residual virus present in their mid-gut from a previous blood meal, rather than a result of fully disseminated virus infection in the midge. An alternative method to analysing entire 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> specimens is to remove the head of the insect and analyse them separate to the body. While this method may be somewhat laborious, it would remove a certain degree of ambiguity regarding positive results in the case of entire 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> specimen analysis.
