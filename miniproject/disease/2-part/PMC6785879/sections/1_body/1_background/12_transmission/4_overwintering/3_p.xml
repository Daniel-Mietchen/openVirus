<p id="Par64">Limited data suggest that SBV may overwinter in 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vectors, possibly via transovarial transmission; two studies report the detection of SBV RNA in nulliparous 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> (
 <italic>C. obsoletus/C. scoticus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. pulicaris</italic> and 
 <italic>C. punctatus</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>] and also in a pooled sample of male 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> specimens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. These findings suggest the potential for transovarial transmission of SBV in arbovirus vectors; this may play an important epidemiological role in SBV overwintering. Overwintering in adult midges during the winter has also been considered. Adult midges of the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> Obsoletus group are able to survive for long periods (for up to 10 days at 4째C and up to 92 days at temperatures ranging between 17째C and 35째C) without a blood meal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. These findings suggest that infected midges could persist during cooler months of the year and infect hosts once temperatures rise to temperatures that are more favourable for virus transmission. This is supported by evidence of SBV transmission in Germany in the winter of 2013 following a brief rise in temperature above 5째C for a couple days [
