<p id="Par40">Currently (September 2019), the geographical origin of SBV also remains unknown. The distribution of closely related Simbu serogroup Orthobunyaviruses (Aino, Akabane, Sathuperi and Shamonda viruses) in Africa and Australasia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] suggest that SBV may have been introduced into Europe from distant geographical regions. Some reports suggest that aircraft transporting animals from an area where SBV may be enzootic or in virus-infected midges may be involved in the introduction of SBV into Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. It is interesting to note that SBV emerged in a similar geographical location (triangular region located at the border of Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands) to where bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) emerged 5 years previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. One could hypothesise that both SBV and BTV-8 were introduced into Europe via a similar, but not yet defined, route [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. A model demonstrated that the majority of SBV infections in the UK in 2012 occurred as a result of SBV-infected midges being transported through downwind movement facilitated by prevailing winds from continental Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], most likely from Northern France [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Similarly, the emergence of SBV in Ireland in 2012 has been attributed to the transport of SBV-infected 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> in wind movements from Southern England [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Interestingly, when SBV sequences collected during the SBV re-emergence in the UK in 2016-2017 were compared with those originally isolated in the UK in 2012, a second distinct clade of SBV was identified; further research is required to determine if these novel viruses represent a re-incursion from continental Europe or were derived through spatial separation of viruses already present in the UK [
