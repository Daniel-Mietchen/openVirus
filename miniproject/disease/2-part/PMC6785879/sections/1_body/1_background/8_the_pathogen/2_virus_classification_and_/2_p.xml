<p id="Par39">When SBV was first discovered in 2011, metagenomic analyses revealed that the virus shared similar genomic sequences with three other Orthobunyaviruses which also infect cattle; Shamonda (SHAV), Aino (AIV) and Akabane (AKAV) viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. None of these viruses have been detected in Europe to date (September 2019). Interestingly, SBV sequences share a 69% identity with the Akabane virus L-RNA-segment, 71% identity with the Aino virus M-RNA-segment and 97% identity with the Shamonda virus S-RNA-segment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses of SBV have revealed that it may be a reassortant virus with the M RNA-segment from Sathuperi virus and the S and L RNA-segments from Shamonda virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, one study based on phylogenetic and serologic analyses, produced conflicting results with Yanase et al. (2012) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]; Goller et al. (2012) suggested that SBV belongs to the Sathuperi virus species and may be an ancestor of Shamonda virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Understanding the exact phylogeniology of SBV has proven challenging, particularly considering the fact that a number of the Simbu viruses have yet to be fully sequenced. Further research in this area is recommended; understanding the phylogeniology of SBV may help elucidate the origin and the epidemiological circumstances surrounding the emergence of this novel virus in Europe.
