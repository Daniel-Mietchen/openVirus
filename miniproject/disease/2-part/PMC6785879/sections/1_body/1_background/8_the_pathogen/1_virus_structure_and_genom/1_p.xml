<p id="Par37">Similar to other members of the Peribunyaviridae family, SBV is an enveloped virus with a genome composed of three negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments which are named according to their size: Small (S), Medium (M) and Large (L) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It is assumed that these segments have a similar coding capacity and proteins to other related Orthobunyaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Considering that SBV is an arbovirus, antigenic drift in the virus genome is considered limited because the virus relies on vector transmission; mutations which could be advantageous for replication in the final host might be disadvantageous in the vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This bottleneck has also been seen with other RNA viruses that are transmitted by mosquito vectors, such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This is supported by reports of high SBV genetic stability in vector-derived SBV sequences in Poland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Additionally, Hoffmann et al. (2015) reported that SBV has a relatively low mutation rate both in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Several field studies of virus variability have also demonstrated that the virus is relatively stable over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Some variations in the SBV genome have been reported in the time since the virus first emerged in Europe in 2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Of the three SBV RNA segments, the M-segment, which encodes two surface glycoproteins (glycoprotein n; Gn and glycoprotein c; Gc) and one non-structural protein (NSm), is considered the most variable segment within the SBV genome. Similar to Akabane virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], the M segment of SBV possesses a hypervariable region within the sequence coding for glycoprotein Gc, lending it to be the most variable segment within the genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The SBV L-segment encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] while the S-segment encodes the nucleoprotein N and the non-structural protein NSs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].
