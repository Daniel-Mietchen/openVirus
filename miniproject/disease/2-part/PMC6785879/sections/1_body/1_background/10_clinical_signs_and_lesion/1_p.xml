<p id="Par43">In female dairy cattle (pregnant and non-pregnant), SBV infection can cause short-duration, non-specific and somewhat inconspicuous clinical signs such as pyrexia (fever up to 41°C), drop in milk yield and diarrhoea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinical signs in adult cattle typically last for up to 6 days and are closely associated with the short-duration SBV viraemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. In small ruminants SBV infection is typically subclinical, however clinical signs such as fever, decreased milk production and diarrhoea are reported to occur during the viraemic phase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Congenital foetal Schmallenberg virus infection in naïve ewes and goats can result in abortions and stillbirths with or without congenital malformations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. In goats, one study reported a reduction in milk yield of up to 50% in the lactating flock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. In sheep flocks anecdotal evidence suggests that lactating sheep also experienced fever, diarrhoea and decreased milk production, however a conclusive link to SBV infection could not be determined [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. In sheep experimentally infected sheep with SBV, one RNAemic sheep showed diarrhoea for several days, but fever was not recorded in any of the animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Experimental infection with SBV in adult female (non-pregnant) goats and bucks resulted in seroconversion, but inoculated goats did not display any clinical signs, gross lesions or histological lesions, nor was SBV RNA detected semen samples collected from two virus inoculated bucks [
