<p id="Par76">Within the first 2.5 years of the emergence of the first SBV cases in Germany in 2011, the virus had achieved an almost pan-European distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To date (September 2019), the virus has been confirmed in almost all European countries including Austria [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is likely that the neighbouring countries have also had SBV infections but confirmed cases have not yet been reported. A model for the transmission of SBV between regions in Europe suggested that vector dispersal is the principal mechanism for transmission of SBV, even at the continental scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>]. More recently, SBV has been reported in countries outside of Europe, including Azerbaijan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] suggesting possible geographical expansion of SBV. However, reports of SBV emergence in new geographical regions which are based solely on serological detection of SBV antibodies, particularly when samples originate in regions where other Simbu viruses are known to be enzootic, should be interpreted cautiously as some ELISAs can have cross-reactivity between SBV and other Simbu viruses [
