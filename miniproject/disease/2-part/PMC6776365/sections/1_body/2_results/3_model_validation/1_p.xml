<p>To quantify the effect of climatic factors on rodent population density, we tested the models (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and methods</xref> for details) with 
 <italic>Î¸</italic>

  <italic>r</italic>
 </sub> containing (
 <italic>i</italic>) minimum temperature, (
 <italic>ii</italic>) absolute humidity, (
 <italic>iii</italic>) both variables, and (
 <italic>iv</italic>) none of these climate variables. The goodness of fit for all the candidate models is provided in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The model without the climate influence was regarded as optimal to infer the population dynamics of Norway rat in a local urban setting (DIC = 9.17, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.50, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007757.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The reproduction rates of the local Norway rat population, as estimated by our model, peaked in June, July, and October, and reached the lowest level in May and August (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The average life span of the Norway rat is estimated to be about 6 months, and the local environmental carrying capacity is estimated to be 8.24. The trace plot of Markov chains and the posterior distribution for the parameters in the optimal rodent model is shown in
