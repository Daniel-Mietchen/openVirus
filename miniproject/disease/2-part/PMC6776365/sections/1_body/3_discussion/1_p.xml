<p>We used a mathematical model to quantify the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on risk of HFRS, and to test the mechanistic understanding of HFRS transmission dynamics in a SEOV endemic area of China. By analyzing time-series data of Norway rat populations and SEOV infections, we found that the population dynamics of Norway rat in urban settings were relatively well-predicted by a simple model which excluded climatic conditions. Unusually, we demonstrated that a potential biotic driver (relative humidity) could enhance predictive ability of the HFRS transmission analysis.</p>
