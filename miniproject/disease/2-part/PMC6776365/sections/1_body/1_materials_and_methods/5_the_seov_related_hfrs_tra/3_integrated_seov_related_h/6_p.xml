<p>The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method was used for parameter estimation with the MATLAB toolbox delayed rejection adaptive metropolis algorithm [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The values of the parameters were estimated by sampling from the convergent posterior distributions of the Markov chains. Gelman-Rubin-Brooks MCMC convergence diagnostic was used to test convergence by identifying whether the series came from a stable distribution or not [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Prior distributions of the parameters were mainly set according to scientific literature and values of biological relevance, but those parameters that lacked prior information were set to a large variance (100) with no boundaries (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The chains were set to perform 1 million iterations with burn-in of 20,000. Deviance information criterion (DIC) was used to measure the goodness of fit for the models with various framework, and a difference value &gt;10 was regarded to be significant. R
 <sup>2</sup> was used to measure the interpretability of the model for the observed data.
