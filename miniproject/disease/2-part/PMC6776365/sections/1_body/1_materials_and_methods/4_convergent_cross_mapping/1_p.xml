<p>Convergent cross mapping (CCM) is used to detect nonlinear causal relationships between time series of HFRS incidence (Y) and environmental factors (X), which is designed to measure causality in nonlinear dynamical systems. CCM can help to identify bidirectional causality (i.e. X and Y are mutually coupled) or unidirectional causality (e.g., X time series variable in a system has a causal influence on Y, but not vice versa) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, CCM was used to identify time-delayed effects of a causal interaction between time series of environmental variability, the population dynamics of rodent hosts, and HFRS incidence based on nonlinear state space reconstruction [
