  <title>Wavelet coherence between Norway rat population density and climate variables from 1998 to 2004.</title>
  <p>Arrows showed phase differences between Norway rat population density and climate variables. The straight down represents climate variables lead Norway rat population density 1/4 period. Legend is wavelet coherence level. The parts inside white contour shows a significant relationship. The parts outside the transparent cone have affected by edge effect. TM, monthly mean temperature; TMAX, monthly mean maximum temperature; TMIN, monthly mean minimum temperature; PREC, monthly cumulative precipitation; RH, monthly mean relative humidity; AH, monthly mean absolutely humidity; RN, Norway rat population density.</p>
