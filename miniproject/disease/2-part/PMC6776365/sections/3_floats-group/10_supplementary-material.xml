  <title>The causal relationship between climate variables and rodent host population, and between climate variables and HFRS incidence.</title>
  <p>(A) The convergent cross mapping results for Norway rat population density and climate variables with time lags (tp) and for HFRS incidence (B). The causal relationship was regarded as significant (P &lt; 0.05) when the solid line (cross map skill of the observed data) exceeded the dashed line (surrogate data). TM, monthly mean temperature; TMAX, monthly mean maximum temperature; TMIN, monthly mean minimum temperature; PREC, monthly cumulative precipitation; RH, monthly mean relative humidity; AH, monthly mean absolutely humidity.</p>
