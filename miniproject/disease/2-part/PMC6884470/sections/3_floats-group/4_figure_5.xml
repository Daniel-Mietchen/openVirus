  <p>Kinetics of serum biomarker signature in acute-phase OROV fever. Signature curves were plotted using the global median of each cytokine (pg/mL) index as the cut-off mark to distinguish high and low producers of each cytokine/chemokine from early (left panel) and late seroconverters (right panel). Each line corresponds to the biomarker signatures at different days after disease onset to identify changes in the overall cytokine/chemokine profile along time of infection. Grey boxes highlight those biomarkers with levels above the global median observed in more than 50% of OROV fever patients. Geometric symbols (rectangle, diamond and bullet) depict those biomarkers considered “universal” and those exclusively found in “early seroconverters” and “late seroconverters”, respectively.</p>
