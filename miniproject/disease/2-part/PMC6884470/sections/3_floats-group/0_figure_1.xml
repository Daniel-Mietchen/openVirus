  <p>Serological profile of circulating IgM/IgG in acute-phase OROV fever patients at different days upon disease onset. IgM/IgG titers were measured by MAC-ELISA and OROV patients classified as positive (n = 48) or negative (n = 27), according to the IgM/IgG serology at baseline (top graph). Antibody titers were determined along the days after disease onset and displayed in scatter plot as the continuous-time to depict two clusters of OROV fever patients classified as early and late seroconverters (middle graphs). Bars charts represent the mean titers with standard errors (reverse of serum dilution) of 4 subgroups of early and late seroconverters, according to days of disease onset (1–3, 4–7, 8–10 and ≥11). Multiple comparisons amongst groups were carried out by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-test for sequential pairwise comparisons. Asterisks underscore differences amongst subgroups. **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001 (bottom graphs).</p>
