  <p>Kinetics of circulating chemokines in acute-phase OROV fever patients in different days upon disease onset. Levels of CXCL8, CCL2, CXCL9 and CXCL10 assessed 1–3, 4–7, 8–10 and ≥11 days upon disease onset in plasma of OROV fever patients considered as early seroconverters (n = 48, left panels) or late seroconverters (n = 27, right panel). Bars represent mean with standard errors (pg/mL) and grey boxes the reference range corresponding the 95%CI of the mean for the HD group. Multiple comparisons amongst groups were carried out by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-test for sequential pairwise comparisons and significant differences depicted as asterisks and connecting lines. Differences between HD and OROV fever subgroups in different days of disease are shown as asterisks. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001.</p>
