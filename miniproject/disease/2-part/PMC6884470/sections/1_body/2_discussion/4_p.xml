<p id="Par17">In the present study, we demonstrate that OROV fever patients with early and late seroconversion profile display divergent pattern of inflammatory response as assessed by measuring circulating chemokines and cytokines. The early seroconverters display high levels of CXCL8 and IL-5 in all time-points. The high production of IL-5 observed in early seroconverters is consistent with the role of this cytokine in inducing B cell activation and differentiation into antibody producing-plasma cells. This finding may suggest that these patients are ahead in the timeline of infection or this may reflect an intrinsic ability of certain hosts to mount a more robust immune response to OROV. Another possibility is that these early seroconverters may display a distinct serological pattern due to cross reactivity generated by previous infection with other
