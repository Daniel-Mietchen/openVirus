<p id="Par18">High producers of CXCL10 and IL-17 were a hallmark of OROV fever late seroconverters. However, as the levels of IL-17 were particularly low in all OROV patients tested, it is a challenge to validate this molecule as a biomarker for laboratorial follow up of OROV fever. On the other hand, substantial levels of CXCL10 were observed in late but not in early soroconverters. High levels of CXCL10 have been already reported in other virus infection

 </sup>. Similar pattern of production was observed for CCL2, a chemokine associated with monocyte recruitment, essential for viral clearance
