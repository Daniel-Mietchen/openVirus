<p id="Par15">In addition to IFN-induced responses, TNF signaling components such as TNF-Receptor Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) seem to be important for OROV innate immunity-mediated control. Conversely, as the infection progresses, these mediators are down-modulated in a virus-dependent manner. Possibly, the virus tries to escape the antiviral cellular pathways by increasing the expression of short non-coding cognate miRNAs

 </sup>. Thus, the only cytokine ever assessed during OROV fever was type I IFN and it has been demonstrated to be essential for resistance in mouse model.
