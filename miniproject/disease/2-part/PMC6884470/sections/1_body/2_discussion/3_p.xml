<p id="Par16">In agreement with these findings, OROV patients presented higher levels of IFN-α indicating strong activation and lower levels of TNF and IL-10 than those by HD, regardless of antibody profile at baseline. IFN-α was the sole cytokine presented in higher levels in both early and late converter patients, as evidenced by the biomarker signatures. In fact, IFN-α was the only mediator present in all time-points upon disease onset and in both early and late seroconverters, indicating possibly that the type I IFN-mediated antiviral responses may not be directly connected to antibody production.</p>
