<p id="Par11">In order to evaluate the overall profile of soluble putative biomarkers in early and late seroconverters upon different days of disease onset, the continuous data was converted into categorical data. For that, the global median of all groups tested was calculated and applied as the cut-off point to distinguish between high and low producers of each chemokine and cytokine. This strategy allowed for generating the proportion of subjects with biomarker levels above the global median, which were assigned as high producers. The proportion of high producers was plotted in an increasing fashion, creating the ascendant signature for each and every biomarker (left to right) at each time point tested (top to bottom). The biomarkers with proportion of high producers above the 50
 <sup>th</sup> percentile were selected in grey. Among these, three patterns of altered biomarkers were observed and highlighted with symbols as depicted in Fig.Â
