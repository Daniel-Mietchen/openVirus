<p id="Par10">In regard to cytokine production, the levels of IFN-α were higher throughout the timeline kinetics in both groups of patients when compared to HD (grey zone). In general, the production of TNF, IFN-γ and IL-10 were lower in both groups of patients as compared to HD. The levels of IL-5 were significantly increased in patients at 8–10 and ≥ 11 days after disease onset as compared to HD. On the contrary, higher levels of IL-6 and IL-17A were observed at 1–3 and 4–7 days after disease onset in late seroconverters in comparison to HD (Fig.
