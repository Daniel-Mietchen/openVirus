<p id="Par9">The timeline kinetics of chemokine and cytokine levels were determined at 1–3, 4–7, 8–10 and ≥ 11 days after disease onset in plasma of OROV fever patients classified as early and late seroconverters (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Higher levels of CXCL8 were observed throughout the timeline kinetics in both groups as compared to HD (grey zone). Distinct kinetics of CCL2 production was observed in early versus late seroconverters. While early seroconverters displayed lower levels of CCL2 at 1–3 and 4–7 days and higher levels at 8–10 and ≥ 11 days after disease onset, late seroconverters displayed higher levels only at 1–3 days of disease onset as compared to both HD and the time point ≥ 11 days after disease onset. Lower levels of CXCL9 were observed in early seroconverters at ≥ 11 days after disease onset. Interestingly, lower levels of CXCL10 were observed in almost all the time points tested in patients classified as early seroconverters, while in those considered late seroconverters the CXCL10 production was augmented at 1–3 and 4–7 days of disease onset as compared to HD. Moreover, in late seroconverters, higher levels of CXCL10 were also observed at 1–3 days as compared to 8–10 and ≥ 11 days after disease onset (Fig.
