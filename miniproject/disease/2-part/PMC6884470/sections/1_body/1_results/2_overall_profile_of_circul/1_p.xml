<p id="Par8">The overall chemokine and cytokine profiles were assessed by flow cytometry in plasma samples from acute-phase OROV fever patients categorized according to IgM/IgG serology results at baseline as early (IgM/IgGPos at baseline) or late (IgM/IgGNeg at baseline) seroconverters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The results showed that OROV fever patients presented higher levels of CXCL8 and IFN-α (pink background) and lower levels of TNF and IL-10 than HD (blue background), regardless of antibody profile at baseline. Early seroconverters showed lower levels of CCL2, CXCL10 and IFN-γ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, blue background). Conversely, late seroconverters presented higher levels of CCL2, CXCL10, IL-6 and IL-17A as compared to HD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, pink background). Moreover, higher levels of CCL2, CXCL10, IFN-α, IL-6 and IL-17 were observed in late seroconverters as compared to early seroconverters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, pink background).
