<p>From the total of collected samples, RNA extraction were performed on 19.31% (112/580) samples. Of these, 56.25% (63/112) were from 2016 and 43.75% (49/112) from 2017. Of the analyzed samples, 29.46% (33/112) were positive for CHIKV by PCR, with 57.58% (19/33) from 2016 and 42.42% (14/33) from 2017. Of the positive samples, CHIKV specific IgM tests were available for 36.36% (12/33) patients, of which 50% (6/12) were CHIKV IgM positive (

Only one of the CHIKV-positive samples with serological tests results presented both DENV and CHIKV IgM antibodies. Of the 33 CHIKV-positive samples, one (3.03%) patient of 11 years old presented clinical signs of encephalitis as well as fever, vomiting, headache, myalgia and eye complications. The presence of CHIKV IgM antibodies was detected in this sample, but DENV IgM and IgG were not detected. Among the PCR negative samples (79/112), CHIKV IgM tests were performed on 39.34% (31/79) of the patients. Of these, 70.97% (22/31) of the samples presented CHIKV IgM antibodies (
