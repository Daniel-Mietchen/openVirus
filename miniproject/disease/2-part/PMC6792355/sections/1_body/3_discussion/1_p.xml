<p>In this study, we performed a molecular investigation of CHIKV infection in symptomatic patients in Piaui State, Northeast Brazil, during 2016 and 2017.

As the presence of acute symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and headache lasting less than 5 days after the onset of the symptoms was a criterion of inclusion, our symptoms data should be carefully considered. However, it is noteworthy to add that one of the CHIKV-positive patients developed encephalitis, the most common neurological complication reported during outbreaks in La Reunion
