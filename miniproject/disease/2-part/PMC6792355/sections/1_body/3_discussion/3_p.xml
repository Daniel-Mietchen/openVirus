<p>After the partial nucleotide sequencing of 
 <italic>E1</italic> and 
 <italic>E2</italic> genes, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Piaui CHIKV isolates presented in this study were clustered within the ECSA genotype and formed a monophyletic clade with other Brazilian samples from 2014 to 2016. Based on the evolutionary analysis, our extracted viral RNAs share the most common recent ancestor dating from 2015, suggesting the introduction of CHIKV ECSA genotype into Piaui probably in that year.

 </sup> States, also located in the Brazilian Northeast region, have suggested that CHIKV was also introduced in these States in 2015.
