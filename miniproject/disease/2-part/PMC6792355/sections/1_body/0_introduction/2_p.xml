<p>CHIKV was isolated for the first time in 1952-53 in Tanzania

 </sup>. Until 2004, CHIKV had caused small and sporadic outbreaks at the African and Asian continents, however that year, the ECSA genotype caused massive outbreaks in the East Africa coast

  <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
 </sup>. This was followed by unprecedent epidemics in Indian Ocean islands and Asia as well as the first outbreak in a temperate region in Italy

 </sup>. In 2013, the first cases of autochthonous transmission in the Americas were reported in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, caused by the Asian genotype
 <sup>

 </sup>. In late 2014, the Asian genotype was detected in the Amapa State, Northern Brazil

 </sup>. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, between 2016 and 2018, 547,797 suggestive cases of CHIKV were reported in the country, with 361,640 laboratory confirmed cases and 387 CHIKV-associated deaths

  <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
 </sup>. The Northeast region of the country accounted for 86.4% and 76,8% of the suggestive cases during 2016 and 2017, respectively
