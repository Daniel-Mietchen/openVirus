 </sup> genes, partial genome sequences were amplified. The expected products of 330 bp (
 <italic>E1</italic>) and 240 bp (
 <italic>E2</italic>) were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels stained with the intercalant agent GelRed
 <sup>™</sup> (Biotium Inc., Freemont, California, USA) and visualized under U.V. lights. The expected bands were excised from the gel and purified using the QIAQuick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for nucleotide sequencing.
