<p>Our inventory was finalized after three full practice runs and consisted of three main pieces of luggage to transport

We used a Pelican Air 1615 case (internal dimensions, 75.16 cm length by 39.37 cm width by 23.82 cm depth; Torrance, CA, USA) to transport plastic consumables, ambient temperature liquids, personal protective equipment (PPE), racks, pipettes, and power strips. This is a larger suitcase that was checked during air travel. We used a smaller Pelican 1510 case (internal dimensions, 50.3 cm length by 27.94 cm width by 19.3 cm depth) to transport the electronic equipment, including the MinION systems, thermocyclers, vortex, microcentrifuge, and Qubit fluorometer. While this case is extremely rugged and would likely fare well against the checked baggage handling, we were concerned about damage during luggage inspection and opted to carry this onto the plane. We also carried on the laptop inside a backpack. Our cold chain was maintained during transportation in an Ozark Trail 26-quart certified bear-resistant cooler (internal dimensions, 40.64 cm length by 22.86 cm width by 27.3 cm depth; Potosi, MO, USA). To simultaneously transport materials at –20°C and 4°C, the cooler was partitioned with a 7.6-cm piece of Styrofoam cut to a snug fit. All enzymes and reagents requiring storage at –20°C were stored in a cold block and surrounded with frozen cold packs in the bottom of the cooler. Primers and flow cells were stored at 4°C on top of the Styrofoam and were surrounded by refrigerated cold packs. We maintained the cold chain on-site by storing reagents in a hotel refrigerator/freezer before repacking the cooler to transport the reagents to the exhibition barn. The SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase was shipped to the barn on dry ice at the insistence of the manufacturer. Since ethanol at a concentration over 70% cannot be transported on a commercial airliner, it was shipped via ground transportation. For a workbench, we used a small folding table found at the event and purchased plastic tablecloths, Lysol, and extra garbage bags locally. To avoid disrupting the event, we set up
