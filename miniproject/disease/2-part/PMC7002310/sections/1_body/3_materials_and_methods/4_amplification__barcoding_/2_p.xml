<p>For full-genome amplification, we used a 10 μM mixture of MBTuni-12, MBTuni-12.4, and MBTuni-13 primers in a 2:3:5 ratio. We combined 5 μl cDNA, 5 μl primer mix, 25 μl 2× Q5 polymerase mix (New England Biosciences), and 15 μl nuclease-free water. We amplified the full genome by cycling the mixture as follows: 98°C for 30 s; 5 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 45°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 1.5 min; 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 64°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 1.5 min; and a final extension of 72°C for 5 min. We cleaned the amplicons with 0.5× AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter) and washed them with 80% ethanol before resuspending them in 25 μl nuclease-free water.</p>
