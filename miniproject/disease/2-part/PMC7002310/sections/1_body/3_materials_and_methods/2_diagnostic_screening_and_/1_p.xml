<p>To confirm the presence of IAV and to identify the location of outbreak clusters, we screened 94 swine displaying ILI using the Flu Detect influenza A virus swine rapid tests (Bridgewater, NJ, USA) via nasal swabs. We performed the screening early in the morning to locate IAV-positive swine and returned to the same location for sampling and sequencing later that evening.</p>
