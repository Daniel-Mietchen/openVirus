<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulating in swine have the potential to infect humans and are capable of causing pandemics (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), as evidenced by the 2009 H1N1 virus pandemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1</xref>). Since that pandemic, there have been 465 human cases of swine-origin influenza viruses (termed variant influenza viruses) in the United States resulting from exposure to swine, most commonly during attendance at agricultural fairs, and sporadic cases have been reported periodically in other countries (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Exhibitors travel with their swine across geographical regions in the United States to attend national, state, and local exhibitions. At these exhibitions, swine of various ages and from many geographical regions intermingle. Throughout the exhibition, swine are walked around the barns, shuttled into staging pens, and exhibited in a corral simultaneously with a dozen or more swine. The swine are typically shepherded by children, as many exhibition rules require that individuals presenting a swine within the exhibition ring be under the age of 20. The exhibition itself can last up to a week, during which time swine are living in immediate proximity to others and have direct contact with humans. Children in particular may be immunologically naive to swine influenza viruses that are genetically and antigenically distinct from recent seasonal influenza viruses or vaccines to which they have been exposed (
