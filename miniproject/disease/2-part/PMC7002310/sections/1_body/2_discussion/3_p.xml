<p>By returning samples from the field, we were able to confirm the sequencing results with our Illumina sequencing pipeline (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Without considering a coverage threshold for the Nanopore data, we sequenced 13 full genomes in the field. These same 13 samples were also successfully sequenced in the lab on an Illumina MiSeq platform. By comparing MiSeq- and MinION-produced sequences, we saw that the maximum MinION-derived sequence accuracy is achieved at 10× to 20× mean coverage (Fig. S32 [

If we apply a 20× coverage threshold to the Nanopore data, only 4 genomes were successful in the field but with 8 HA segment sequences passing. Importantly, the HA sequence is the most critical for making vaccine strain determinations. Also, we have higher confidence in consensus sequences from low-coverage viruses that are near identical to other viruses with higher coverage. As we are likely sampling the same transmission chain in real time, we can use the global sequence alignment to manually estimate the true sequence, particularly in fixing the frameshift mutations that are MinION’s most common error. In future experiments, we can ensure that coverage thresholds are met by monitoring coverage in real time and more deliberately deciding when to stop sequencing, rather than simply sequencing for a defined 6 h as we did here. Illumina sequencing also allowed us to confirm the accuracy of our in-field-generated consensus sequences (99.3% overall). This level of accuracy confirms the validity of the suite of analyses that we performed in the field with the Nanopore data.
