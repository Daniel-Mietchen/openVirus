A/Ohio/9/2015 and A/Ohio/13/2017 were the nearest CVVs to the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and had 2 and 0 antigenic changes, respectively. These two viruses also had relatively low sequence coverage of the HA segments (Fig. S4 and S19 [

A/Ohio/35/2017 was the most similar CVV in our database to the 11 H1N2 viruses and had 32 amino acid differences compared to their consensus sequence (

More generally, the H1N2 virus HA genes were only ∼93% identical to the nucleotide sequence of A/Ohio/35/2017 and, as discussed above, had NA genes belonging to different ancestral lineages. Based on the genetic differences and markers of antigenic drift detected by the analysis, the HA and NA consensus sequences, including untranslated regions (UTRs), were electronically transmitted to the CDC’s Vaccine Preparedness Team in the Influenza Division to initiate the development of a synthetic candidate vaccine virus. We were able to start this intervention from the field roughly 18 h after the initial setup of
