<p>To assess the MinION-derived sequence accuracy, we transported RNA and DNA amplicons created on-site to the CDC in Atlanta, GA, for confirmatory sequencing via the Illumina MiSeq platform using the standard Influenza Genomic Team (IGT) surveillance pipeline (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). On the MiSeq platform, 13 samples had completed genomes with average coverage of ≥100× for each segment (IGT’s standard QC threshold). Of those 13 samples, 12 had a MinION-derived mean coverage of ≥5× across segments, with 8 segments having ≥20× coverage across HA (Table S3 [

There was high concordance (
