<p>We created a mobile influenza virus genomics platform to estimate the risk to humans posed by viruses within a local IAV outbreak by performing in-field extraction and amplification of influenza A viruses, complete genome sequencing, automated genome assembly, BLAST comparisons, phylogenetic analysis, and variant detection to candidate vaccine viruses. We used our high-throughput influenza virus sequencing pipeline as a template for developing

For RNA extraction, we elected to use Akonni Biosystems’ TruTip rapid RNA kit due to its small footprint and demonstrated effectiveness on influenza A viruses (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). We chose the mini8 by miniPCR due to its small size, ability to run 8 samples at a time, low cost, low power needs, and overall simplicity. Due to the high fidelity of our rapid amplification strategy, we were able to simplify amplicon quality control from fragment analyzation to fluorometric quantification, which is already a necessary step for amplicon pooling. For sequencing, we chose the Nanopore sequencing platform MinION for its extremely small size, rapid sequencing speed, and live access to data as it is sequencing. Direct RNA sequencing of IAVs has recently been demonstrated, and while this technique is extremely fast (&lt;2 h from RNA to sequencing), it is not yet suitable for clinical applications due to a lack of sensitivity and multiplexing (
