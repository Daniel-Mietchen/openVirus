The reference panel of viruses has broad diversity, including swine-origin viruses of classical swine lineages (1A.1 [H1-α], 1A.2 [H1-β], and 1A.3.3.3 [H1-γ]), human seasonal lineages (1B.2.1 [H1-δ2] and 1B.2.2 [H1-δ1]), Eurasian avian-like lineages (1C.1 and 1C.2), an avian-origin North American lineage, and human seasonal lineages (H3, H1 pdm09, N1, and N2) (

Viruses collected during our investigation included 1 H3N2 (barcode 22), 1 H1N1 (barcode 06), and 11 H1N2 (barcodes 01, 05, 14 to 21, and 23) viruses. These 11 H1N2 viruses contained identical genome constellations. Both the HA and NA gene segments were closely related to 2017/2018 H1N2 influenza viruses circulating in the U.S. swine population and have been sporadically detected in previous H1N2v zoonotic infections. The HA gene segments belonged to the H1-δ2 or clade 1B.2.1, using the swine influenza virus H1 HA global nomenclature system. This lineage is common to swine in the United States and is derived from human seasonal H1N1 virus that was transmitted from humans to swine in the early 2000s (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Each of the H1N2 viruses possessed an NA gene derived from the 1998 human seasonal H3N2 lineage now found in U.S. swine influenza viruses. This NA is a distinct gene lineage from the NA gene found in the closest CVV, A/Ohio/35/2017 (2002 human seasonal NA lineage). The PB2, PB1, PA, and NS gene segments were of triple-reassortant internal gene (TRIG) cassette origin commonly found in swine influenza viruses in the United States. The NP and M gene segments belonged to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus lineage (
