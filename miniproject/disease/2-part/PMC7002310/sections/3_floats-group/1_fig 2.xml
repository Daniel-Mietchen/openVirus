 <caption>
  <p>Timeline comparison of portable versus centralized surveillance pipelines. The 
   <italic>Mia</italic> pipeline is modeled after the Influenza Genomics Team’s (IGT) high-throughput sequencing pipeline with special considerations for speed and portability. It is expected to obtain results from 24 samples in a maximum of 14 h and 30 min. The IGT pipeline is designed for throughput and accuracy and could obtain results from 96 samples in 39 h if operated continuously.
