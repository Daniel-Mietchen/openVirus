<p>One inoculated pig from each group was necropsied at 3â€…dpi, and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of lung tissues was conducted. Microscopic observations of pulmonary sections revealed that swine infected with JX346 had obvious alveolitis and lesions in the lung tissue, including infiltration of inflammatory cells, widened alveolar walls, and degenerate and intact neutrophils within the alveolar lumen (
