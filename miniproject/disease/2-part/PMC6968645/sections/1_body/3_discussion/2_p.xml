<p>We further investigated the pathogenesis of H10N8 influenza virus in swine, which showed that the human-origin strain caused more severe lesions than did the avian-origin strain. Many studies have shown that lysine at position 627 in PB2 is critical for virus pathogenicity and mammalian adaptation of avian influenza virus [

 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These mutations may be responsible for the differences in pathogenesis between human and avian-origin strains in swine.
