<p>However, there are several limitations in evaluating the transmissibility of JX346 between swine in this study. Firstly, no virus could be detected in the transmission group. The only evidence for transmission is based on serological assay, and the HI and MN titer is lower compared with the infected group. Secondly, the number of animals used in the transmission experiment is not sufficient and only one pig had titers above the cut-off for HI and MN, which limits our understanding of the transmissibility of JX346 in swine.</p>
