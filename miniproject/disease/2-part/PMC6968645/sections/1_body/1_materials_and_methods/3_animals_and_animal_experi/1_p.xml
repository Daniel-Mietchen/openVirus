<p>The animal experiments were approved by the Committee of Experiment Animal Welfare Ethical of South China Agriculture University. Nineteen one-month-old pigs were purchased from farms that were negative for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and pseudorabies virus. They were confirmed to be free from influenza virus infection and were found to be seronegative for H1N1 and H3N2 swine influenza viruses by HI assay. The 19 pigs were randomly allocated into three groups (eight in group A, eight in group B, and three in group C). Five pigs in group A (A1–A5) and group B (B1–B5) were inoculated with JX346 and GD-E1 at a titer of 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL intratracheally (1 mL) and intranasally (1 mL), respectively. Three contact healthy pigs were commingled with infected pigs at two days post-infection (dpi) to investigate viral transmission in group A (A6–A8) and group B (B6–B8). Three control pigs in group C were inoculated intratracheally (1 mL) and intranasally (1 mL) with phosphate-buffered saline as a control group. Body temperatures and clinical signs were recorded daily, and nasal swabs were collected daily on 1–14 dpi for inoculated pigs and on 1–14 days post-contact (dpc) for contact pigs. Sera were collected at 7 dpi/dpc and 14 dpi/dpc for the HI and MN assays with homologous virus for each group to determine the antibody titer. One inoculated pig from each group (A5, B4, and C3) was necropsied at 3 dpi. Lung and tracheal tissues were collected for virus titer and pathology analysis. The viral titers from nasal swabs and lung samples were determined using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in 96-well plates by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay.
