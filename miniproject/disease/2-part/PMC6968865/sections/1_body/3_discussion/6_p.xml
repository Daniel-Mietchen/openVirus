<p>Contrived clinical samples were prepared by spiking either serum or urine with whole virus particles and processing to determine if these sample types were detrimental to assay performance compared to processing viral particles in molecular grade water only. No significant difference was observed as determined by the Ct values of the EPC or the pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue assays, indicating that the assays were compatible with the routine clinical sample types used for flavivirus and alphavirus molecular testing.</p>
