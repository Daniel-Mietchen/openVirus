<p>The Pacific Islands suffer from a high burden of mosquito-borne disease. It was reported that between 2012 and 2014, dengue (serotypes 1–4), CHIKV and ZIKV viruses were circulating in the region with over 120,000 people infected and that this number may be highly underreported. During that time 28 outbreaks of disease were reported. These numbers include 18 DENV (serotypes 1–4), 7 CHIKV and 3 ZIKV outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These outbreaks result in a heavy toll on the islands’ health system. Thus rapid testing methods are required in the region to enhance surveillance and assist with critical response measures to limit the spread of disease.
