<p>In addition, both flavivirus and alphaviruses show a different global distribution with viruses such as YFV endemic in Africa, TBEV endemic in Eurasia, JEV in Southeast Asia, MVEV in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and SLEV mainly found in the United States and more rarely in Canada and Mexico. Similar geographical patterns are also seen with alphaviruses. One advantage of the current pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue screening test is that the assays can be used in any global region to quickly detect the presence of an unknown viral infection. Once a viral family has been identified, individual typing reactions can be used to determine the pathogen responsible for disease. This simplifies and reduces the costs of broad screening approaches in disease outbreaks or during pathogen surveillance in humans or vectors.</p>
