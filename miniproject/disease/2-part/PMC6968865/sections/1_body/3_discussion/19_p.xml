 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227550.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the weekly prevalence of DENV infection from December 2016 to March 24
 <sup>th</sup> 2017. The highest numbers of dengue cases were reported in January 2017 with a decline in February. Interestingly, the number of cases of dengue infection then increased again in the month of March. March coincides with the start of routine testing of patients attending the Port Vila Central Hospital with DENV like symptoms using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue molecular assays. The increase of dengue cases seen in March may be attributed to an increase in sensitivity when using molecular methods compared to conventional EIA.
