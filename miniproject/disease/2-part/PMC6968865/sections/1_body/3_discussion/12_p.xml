<p>Although the Port Vila Central Hospital was equipped with molecular diagnostic facilities, at the time of this study it did not have access to molecular methods for the detection of flavivirus/alphavirus. Testing carried out included NS1 antigen testing, IgG and IgM serological tests. In order to confirm the presence of DENV samples had to be sent to New Zealand in order to type the strain responsible by molecular diagnostic techniques. This could result in a delay of 2 weeks to confirm the presence and serotype of dengue responsible for infection.</p>
