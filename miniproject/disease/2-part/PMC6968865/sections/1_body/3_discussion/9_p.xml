<p>QCMD panels for DENV, ZIKV virus and CHIKV from 2016–2018 were obtained to monitor the performance of the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assays using international standards and reference material. As can be seen from 
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, results obtained using the pan-species assays and individual typing primers and probes demonstrated 100% concordance with the expected results after sample decoding. In addition, all “educational samples” that were detected by 52.9% to 86.1% of participating laboratories were positive when using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assays. These results indicate that the assays are performing well, if not better than other molecular assays used worldwide.
