<p>Prior to testing samples, a small study was performed to determine if alternative samples types such as mouth swabs or urine samples from patients suspected of DENV infection could be used as a less invasive alternative sample type. Four matched urine, plasma and mouth swab samples were taken and these extracted using standard procedures as described. Although DENV RNA could be detected in all three sample types, a significant Ct lag was observed for urine and mouth swab compared to plasma (

The data indicated there was approximately 100,000 fold more virus in serum/plasma samples compared to other matrix, further demonstrating that serum/plasma are the preferred test sample types. These data also agree with a previous study using viral RNA and NS1 antigen assays [
