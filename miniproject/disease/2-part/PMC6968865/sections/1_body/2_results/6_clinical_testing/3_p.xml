<p>No molecular tests were available at Port Vila Central hospital for the detection of dengue virus. Thus samples previously tested for NS1 antigen/IgG and IgM were obtained from patients in the months December 2016 to February 2017. From March 2017 patients attending the hospital with suspected dengue infection were screened with the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue/dengue-2 assays.
