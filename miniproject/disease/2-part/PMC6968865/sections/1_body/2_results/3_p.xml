<p>In order to determine the LLOD of the assays, the Vircell total run control (whole inactivated viruses containing a mixture of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, CHIKV and ZIKV in a plasma matrix) and genomic RNA from DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4 and CHIKV (Vircell, Valencia, Spain) and were used. Samples were diluted in human serum to simulate clinical samples and processed as previously described followed by amplification in ten individual replicates. LLOD was defined as the lowest dilution in which all ten PCR replicates gave a positive signal. The LLOD for the flavivirus assay was found to be 0.63 copies per PCR, 2.18 copies per PCR for the pan-dengue assay and 1.25 copies for the pan-alphavirus assay using whole virus particles. Interestingly, the whole viral samples performed better than the purified RNAs when diluted in human serum (
