<p>No cross reactivity was observed when testing the assay against 150,000â€“300,000 copies of viral nucleic acids introduced into the PCR reaction using the targets listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In all cases the EPC was positive, as was the positive control, indicting that the lack of amplification was not due to failure of any component of the assay or the presence of PCR inhibitors.
