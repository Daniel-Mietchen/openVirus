<p>To determine the feasibility of using urine as a primary sample, fresh urine was spiked with both NATtrol Zika Stock (Qualitative) (Manufacturer, CATALOG# NATZIKV-ST) and NATtrol Zika Virus Range Verification Panel (Manufacturer, CATALOG# NATZIKV-RV). The whole cells and control materials were processed as previously described and compared to the same samples spiked directly into water. No significant delays between the urine samples and water controls were observed indicating that urine is not inhibitory in the sample processing method and suitable to use as a primary patient sample.</p>
