<p>However, members of the flavivirus and alphavirus families are quite heterogeneous at the RNA level, therefore it can be difficult to design a single set of primers and probe sequences that can detect each of the families at the genus and species level. An example of this is DENV that contains four serotypes, each being quite diverse at the genomic level [
