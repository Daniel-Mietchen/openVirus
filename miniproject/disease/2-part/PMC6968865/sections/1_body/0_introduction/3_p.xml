<p>Alphaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that are classified as belonging to the group IV Togaviridae family of viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0227550.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are over thirty members in the alphavirus group that are able to infect a wide range of vertebrates including humans, rodents, fish, birds, and horses. At the genomic level alphaviruses consist of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome 11 to 12kb in length with a 5’ cap, and 3’ poly-A tail. Alphavirus particles are enveloped, have a size of around 70 nm in diameter under the electron microscope and appear to be spherical with a 40 nm isometric nucleocapsid. Like flaviviruses the main mode of transmission to the human population is via bites from infected mosquitoes. Notable viruses that infect the human population include chikungunya (CHIKV), Barmah Forest virus (BFV), Mayaro virus (MAYV) [
