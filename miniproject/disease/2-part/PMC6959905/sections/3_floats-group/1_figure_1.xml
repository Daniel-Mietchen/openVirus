  <p>HIV screening rates in physician offices and emergency departments in the US, 2009 to 2014. Plots represent national HIV testing rate per 1000 occurring in Physician Offices (National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey [NAMCS] data) and Emergency Departments (National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey [NHAMCS] data), from 2009 to 2014. HIV testing rate was calculated using the equation below: Estimate of HIV testing/all visits = Σpatwt of visits getting HIV tested/all visits = 1/(all visits 
   <sup>∗</sup>Σ patwt of visits getting HIV tested). HIV = human immunodeficiency virus.
