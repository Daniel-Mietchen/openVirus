<p>The overall rates of HIV testing increased over the study period; however, increased HIV testing rates are not uniformed across different facilities and subpopulations. System level factors may play a significant role in improving HIV testing among minority populations. While our study could not investigate provider knowledge and practice, factors such as lack of time, funding constraints as well as lack of staff could impact decision to test or offer testing. The lower rates of HIV testing observed in the ED is worrisome, particularly for populations without a usual source of care. Tailored interventions for the ED may be necessary to reduce missed opportunities for HIV testing. To develop such interventions, future studies should examine factors such as reason of visit, testing history, and the reasons for offering/taking or not offering/taking HIV tests to understand both clinician and patientsâ€™ behavior appropriately. Future research should also examine which sub-populations (based on demographics and transmission risks) are more likely to get or not get tested, regardless of the health settings. In addition, future studies should also assess the knowledge, clarity and application of CDC testing guidelines among providers. Monitoring the response of health care settings, providers and patients to the CDC's HIV testing guidelines is important to achieve the goal of increasing HIV testing in the United States, and a key component of ending the epidemic. Therefore, careful and thoughtful approaches are needed for identifying HIV infections during physician and ED visits nationally.</p>
