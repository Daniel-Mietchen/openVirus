<p id="Par23">Short interfering RNA (siRNA) are 21–23 base pairs (bp) in length and as an exogenous agent can experimentally manipulate gene expression. siRNAs, compared to similar therapeutic agents, exhibited minimal toxicity and high stability. siRNAs had demonstrated to have a promising modulatory effect on virulence, drug resistance and pathogenesis [
