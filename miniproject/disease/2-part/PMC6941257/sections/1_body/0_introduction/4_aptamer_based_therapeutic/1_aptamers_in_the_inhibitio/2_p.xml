 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is another fundamental pathogen that is involved in the majority of bacterial pneumonias and is the major cause of meningitis, septicemia, otitis media and sinusitis. All wild-type strains are able to form biofilms, in which state they are more invasive for lungs and brain [

 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Lyd-1, Lyd-2 and Lyd-3), Lyd-3 aptamer was reported as an effective preventative therapy with anti-biofilm activity, and in combination therapy with appropriate antibiotics, could prevent bacterial colonization. Lyd-3 aptamer at the concentration of 1 μM could reduce the biofilm formation from 100 to 35.8% [

Therefore, aptamers can offer a tremendous opportunity for effective treatment of chronic infection, and also, serve a better eradication of biofilm formation bacteria. In general, using aptamers with anti-biofilm activity can lessen the dose and duration of antibiotic therapy in chronic and resistant infections, thus, reduce the risk of abuse and misuse of antibiotic administration [
