<p id="Par5">Aptamers have applied in diverse valuable fields of life sciences, for example, they have been developed as new drug, diagnostic and a bio-imaging agent, drug delivery agent, analytical reagent, food inspection and hazard detection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, aptamers functionalities are diverse, including their ability to block the interaction of receptorâ€“ligand or activating the function of target receptors, as well as they can also act as promising targeting carriers to selectively deliver therapeutic agents to the target cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, several disadvantages have been also reported for aptamers. They are sensitive to enzymatic degradation by nucleases in cells and blood circulation. Correspondingly, there are challenges regarding the topical or systemic administration of these drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Low molecular weight and short time of aptamers residence in the circulation emerge significant challenges regards to renal filtration control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Some drawbacks can be overcome by appropriated strategies, for example aptamers can be formulated with a large moieties to increase the molecular weight and reduce the renal filtration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The chemical modifications or adding specific functional groups in order to improve aptamers lifetime and their stability in the body, can occur primarily in the SELEX protocol or through post-SELEX modification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One of the challenge resolving strategy is to conjugate the aptamer with nanomaterials that can decrease various of the challenges ahead [
