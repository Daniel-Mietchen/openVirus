<p id="Par10">To validate virus detection in STGG, we simulated clinical specimens using two different media, STGG or gelatin, lactalbumin hydrolysate, yeast extract in Hank’s medium (GLY) virus transport medium (gold standard) spiked with virus. First, serial 10-fold dilutions of specimens containing IV A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B-Victoria lineage, B-Yamagata lineage, RSV-A and RSV-B were prepared in GLY. Duplicate specimens from each dilution were prepared by mixing 2 μl of diluted specimen with 200 μl STGG or GLY. All specimens were also spiked with control equine arteritis virus (EAV). RNA was extracted manually (Total RNA kit, Roche). The duplicate specimens were subjected to real-time RT-PCR for IV, RSV and EAV.</p>
