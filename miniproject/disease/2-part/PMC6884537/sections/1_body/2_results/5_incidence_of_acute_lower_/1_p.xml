<p id="Par23">There were 303 cases of ALRI associated with at least one of the target viruses observed among the 519 selected resident patients (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>). Simulation of the expected number of cases in all patients with ALRI during the observation period took into account the random monthly sampling and found an expected 1543 cases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13</xref>). The expected incidence of ALRI associated with RSV, PIV or IV was 140 cases per 1000 population per year (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>); that is, we estimated that 14% of 2–23 month old children in the population presented with virus-associated ALRI in 2015. The incidence of RSV-A associated ALRI was 112 per 1000 population per year; we therefore estimated that 11% of the 2–23 month old population presented with ALRI associated with RSV-A. Incidence of viral-associated ALRI was substantially greater in the first compared to the second year of life (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
