<p id="Par31">Phylogenetic sequence analysis of RSV-A and RSV-B G-protein genes showed that the Gambian viruses belonged to the recent globally spread clades ON1 and BA respectively and clustered with viruses from other continents, similar to the analysis of Kenyan RSV isolates, and suggesting intra- and inter-continental circulation of RSV strains

 </sup>. Separate analysis using less complete Kenyan G-protein gene sequences indicated no strong link between RSV-A viruses circulating in West and East Africa in 2015 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Only for Gambian RSV-B did we notice some association with Kenyan RSV-B from 2015 and 2016 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The subgroups of ON1 and BA to which the Gambian RSV belonged had specific patterns of gain and loss of potential O-glycosylation sites that might affect antigenicity and therefore allow repeat infection

 </sup>, an aspect relevant to the development of vaccines targeting pre-fusion F-protein. As site Ø of Gambian RSV has the wildtype profile, vaccines under development are expected to accurately target Gambian RSV. Nevertheless, observed differences in the G-protein and F-protein nucleotides and amino acids (Supplementary Material p. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">31)</xref> indicate that prospective monitoring of F-protein antigenic sites would be required to monitor for the emergence of escape variants following the introduction of RSV immunization in The Gambia.
