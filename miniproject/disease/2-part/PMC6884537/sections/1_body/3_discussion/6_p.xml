<p id="Par30">Similar to previous evaluations of the use of swabs collected in STGG for the detection of respiratory viruses, we showed that this is feasible

 </sup>, which is important for other investigators wishing to generate results from specimens stored in STGG. However, we also found some loss of sensitivity compared to the gold standard virus transport medium. As the children were sampled at the acute phase of disease when virus shedding is high, this was however not a significant problem for our study. Our data confirm that collection of both OP and NP specimens is associated with greater sensitivity

 </sup>. Use of NP swabs alone would result in slight under-reporting of all pathogens. We found greater detection of RSV in NP compared to OP specimens (TableÂ
