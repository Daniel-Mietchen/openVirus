<p id="Par28">Our finding of 46% prevalence of RSV-A in children with ALRI is higher than in most other studies, suggesting that we observed a particularly intense RSV epidemic in 2015. In coastal Kenya the prevalence of RSV in children aged &lt;5 years hospitalized with pneumonia from 2002–2007 was 15% (20% among infants) and 27% during epidemics (32% among infants)
