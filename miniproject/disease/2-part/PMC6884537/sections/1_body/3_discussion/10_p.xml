<p id="Par34">In conclusion, the very high incidence of RSV among young children with ALRI confirms the significant burden of RSV disease, being eight times that of IV or PIV, and the potential for RSV transmission causing disease for up to 9 months of the year. Ongoing surveillance will improve our understanding of seasonal variation and the clinical impact of viral-associated ALRI. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that surveillance for viral pathogens is possible using STGG media, and so may easily be combined with studies of bacterial colonization. With several RSV vaccines in the late stages of development, our insights into intra- and inter-continental transmission of RSV, continental and local genetic variability and evolution, transmission and disease burden, will be critical to the design of vaccines and their evaluation in the future. Similarly, local baseline data are important to support deliberations about future national vaccine introductions. The novel methods and data generated by our integrated clinical, epidemiological and microbiological surveillance can guide the introduction of suitable RSV vaccines, by providing an essential baseline to assess their potential impact and guide future vaccination strategies, including the vaccination of women in pregnancy.</p>
