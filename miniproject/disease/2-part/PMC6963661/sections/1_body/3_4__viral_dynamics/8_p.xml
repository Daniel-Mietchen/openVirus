<p>However, it has been suggested that some amino acid substitutions fixed by chance during purifying selection, i.e., not positively selected, could actually be associated with a fitness advantage when an

 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], cross-protection between serotypes has been reported for a short period after a DENV infection [

 <xref rid="B153-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. In support of this hypothesis a study in Thailand in the late 1990s found that a new DENV1 clade replacement was associated with an overall decline in DENV1 prevalence, but increase in overall DENV4 prevalence, suggesting that the surviving DENV1 clade may have had initial less cross-protective immunity with DENV4 than the preceding DENV1 clade [
 <xref rid="B144-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. In further support of this, they found that amino acids changes between the two DENV1 clades were not under positive selection [
 <xref rid="B144-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the replacement of DENV1 and 2 in Iquitos with DENV3 was due to low population immune protection against DENV3, which lead to increased DENV3 infections, which in turn lead to short-term cross-protection against DENV1 and 2 [
