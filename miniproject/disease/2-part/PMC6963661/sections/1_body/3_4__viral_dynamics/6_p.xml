<p>Positive selection of mutations is not surprising since RNA viruses lack a proofreading RdRp and are estimated to introduce one mutation per replication [

 <xref rid="B150-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. However, paradoxically and controversially, most the DENV genome has been shown to be under purifying selection, shown by low non-synonymous (dN/dS) substitution rates [

 <xref rid="B164-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. It is hypothesised that having to replicate alternately in two hosts puts significant genetic restraints on the virus, hence purifying selection. In support of this a group showed that the virus, cycling in 10 alternating passages between insect and mammalian cells caused an increase in fitness in their respective cells [
 <xref rid="B163-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. This was not seen with one cycle alternating culture, indicating that using two hosts restricts fitness to balance effective replication in both hosts [
 <xref rid="B142-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. This suggests that mutations are deleterious to survival and therefore ‘purified’ [
 <xref rid="B152-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Consequently, this provides support for use of a conservation-based approach to design a vaccine.
