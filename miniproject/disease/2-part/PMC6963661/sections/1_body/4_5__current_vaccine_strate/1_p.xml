<p>Early attempts at vaccinating against dengue have failed due to the risk of disease enhancement, where pre-existing antibodies from an earlier serotype cross-react with poor neutralizing ability against different serotypes in a subsequent infection [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The reason for this is the inclusion of B-cell epitopes and the use of tetravalent approaches. The recently and only approved tetravalent live attenuated chimeric dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur [
 <xref rid="B173-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>], also known as Dengvaxia
 <sup>Â®</sup> is believed to suffer from the enhancement phenomenon as it showed an increase in the risk of severe dengue in infants below five years [
