<p>Understanding the correlates of protection for complex pathogens is critical to successful vaccine design in the modern era. They help us to engineer and tailor vaccines to specifically elicit these protective aspects of the immune system in a memory response. Consequently, a rudimental understanding appears only successful for some cases (e.g., smallpox [

 <xref rid="B50-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Unfortunately, dengue falls within the latter group [

 <xref rid="B54-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Furthermore, infection with each serotype elicits long-term protection to the respective serotype, but only short-term (~2 monthsâ€“3 years) protection to other serotypes [
