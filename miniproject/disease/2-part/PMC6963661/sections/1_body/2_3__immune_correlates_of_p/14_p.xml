<p>Most of the literature report dengue specific CD8 T-cells during the acute phase [

 <xref rid="B128-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] and thus before the onset of severe disease, providing the premise that they could cause pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B69-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] who only detect dengue specific CD8s after the onset of vascular leakage. Although tempting, this does not necessarily mean that CD8s play no role in pathogenesis as they may be sequestered in tissues or enhance vascular leakage in late stages [
 <xref rid="B69-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Alternatively, these differences may reflect host genetic backgrounds as all use the same NS3 epitope and HLA-A11 MHC [

 <xref rid="B127-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B128-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. This does highlight the restraints of using only a restricted number of HLA and epitopes to draw conclusions.
