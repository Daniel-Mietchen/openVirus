<p>The predicted detrimental effects of CD8 T-cells have been referred to as antigenic sin and is defined as 
 <italic>the domination of cross-reactive memory CD8 T-cells from the original serotype during a heterotypic infection which have low avidity</italic> [
 <xref rid="B105-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This proliferation of cross-reactive CD8s instead of naïve CD8s in secondary infection is likely as memory T-cells have a lower activation threshold and are present in higher frequency [
 <xref rid="B132-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. The detrimental effects of antigenic sin are theorised to be mediated by the released of vasodilators leading to vascular leakage [

 <xref rid="B134-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. For example, T-cell secretions such as IFNα and IL-2R have been correlated with disease severity [
 <xref rid="B80-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], however the concentration of blood products due to plasma leakage may confound such results [
 <xref rid="B69-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Furthermore, although TNFα has been implicated in disease [
 <xref rid="B135-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>], it has also been implicated in disease in primary infection of mice with maternal antibodies [
 <xref rid="B78-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This data suggests that pre-existing cross-reactive CD8s may not be a predisposing factor.
