<p>During human infection DENV has an assorted cell tropism, with a particular preference for dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Binding and entry of these cells is mediated by the viral E protein [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and although many host binding proteins have been suggested (heparan sulfate, DC-SIGN, mannose receptor, TIM/TAM receptors, laminin, HSP90/70) the receptor mediating DENV entry remains elusive [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The virus enters host cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, although there may be alternative entry methods in some cell types [
 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Acidification of the endosomes and the E protein are critical to fusion with the host membrane and release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. The E protein is a three-domain protein (EDI, EDII, EDIII) and acidification causes it to trimerise to reveal a fusion loop within EDII which mediates this fusion [
