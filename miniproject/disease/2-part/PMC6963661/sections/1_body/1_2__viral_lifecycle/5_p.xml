<p>The capped RNA is then packaged with the capsid protein and localises with E and prM heterodimers which bud from the ER [
 <xref rid="B31-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] as immature virions made from 180 prM/E dimers in 60 trimeric complexes [
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. prM acts to prevent the fusion loop from being revealed while in the host [
 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], however as virions traverse the Golgi prM is cleaved into the pr fragment and M by host furin followed by a realignment of the E proteins into anti-parallel dimers [
 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Following budding from host cells the pr fragment is released, mediated by the change in pH forming mature virions [
 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furin cleavage is however inefficient, leading to a mixture of prM containing virions [
 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The roles of the remaining non-structural proteins are less well characterised. NS4A is believed to be important in formation of replicative complexes [
 <xref rid="B44-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], structures where viral RNA replication occurs [
 <xref rid="B45-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. NS1 functions in RNA replication and virion production [
 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. NS2A and NS4B are also important in replication [
