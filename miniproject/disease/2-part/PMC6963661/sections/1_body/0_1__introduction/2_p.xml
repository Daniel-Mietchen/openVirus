<p>Current interventions rely mostly on generic vector-based control [
 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], therefore there is a need for effective interventions specifically targeting the virus. Whilst there are many antiviral therapeutics in development [

 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] they are less attractive as an intervention as viral loads are already declining in symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The most desirable intervention is an effective vaccine against the virus. However, due to the complex patho- and immuno-biology of the disease this has proven extremely difficult [

 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, in natural infections pre-existing immunity to a serotype enhances the infection of subsequent serotypes [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As a consequence of this the current and only licensed dengue vaccine was found to enhance the disease in infants [

 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,

 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is therefore critical that we work towards a better understanding of the correlates of protection that a next generation dengue intervention must elicit and the dynamics of dengue infection they must target.
