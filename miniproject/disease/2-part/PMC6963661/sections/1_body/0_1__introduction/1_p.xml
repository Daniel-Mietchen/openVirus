<p>Infecting over 390 million people each year [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the dengue virus (DENV) is found worldwide covering over 100 countries (WHO), with either epidemic or endemic occurrence [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its transmission is dependent on the key mosquito vectors, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The DENV itself is a positive sense RNA flavivirus which exists as four circulating serotypes [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The effects of DENV infection are subclinical in approximately 75% of cases. However, the remainder (over 96 million per year [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) experience a spectrum typified initially by acute dengue fever (DF) that after defervescence can develop into severe haemorrhagic dengue fever (DHF), characterised by dangerous plasma leakage and hypovolaemic shock which can progress to organ failure and vascular haemorrhage [

 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, besides mitigation of symptoms there is no effective treatment for the severe disease [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-07-00203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and consequently is a major cause of paediatric death and debilitation in many countries (WHO). With cases increasing yearly and steady geographical expansion there is urgent need for effective long-term prophylaxis [
