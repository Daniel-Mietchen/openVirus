<p>The ZIKV cases have been sporadically reported in many countries in the world [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 87 countries of the world had evidence of ZIKV infection until July 2019 [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Because of such increasing incidence of ZIKV infection throughout the world, severe pathological manifestations and lack of vaccine and treatment, Zika became a serious public health emergency of international concern [
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Presence of ZIKV infection in Bangladesh has been reported in 2013 and 2014 by the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation from serum sample [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, there is no evidence of the current outbreak of ZIKV in Bangladesh that might be due to very limited information regarding surveillance, detection, and reporting systems for new cases. According to recent reports, Bangladesh is endemic for Dengue which is also transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes as well [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. ZIKV might follow the path of spreading Dengue and Chikungunya throughout the world [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate Zika throughout the country with proper diagnosis so that effective prevention and control measures can be adopted before an endemic occurs. In this short review, we have discussed the Zika outbreaks in the context of Bangladesh and neighboring countries and future perspective of ZIKV surveillance, diagnosis, prevention measures, and research need to be taken in Bangladesh.
