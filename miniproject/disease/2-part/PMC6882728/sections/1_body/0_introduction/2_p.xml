<p>Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV is an enveloped virus containing a single stranded 10-kb positive sense RNA genome with icosahedral capsid [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During biting, ZIKV present in the saliva of mosquitoes infects the epidermal keratinocytes, skin fibroblast, and Langerhans cells. Then, the virus spreads to lymph lodes and blood stream. The RNA genome is directly translated into a long polyprotein within the cell cytoplasm which further cleaved and processed by viral or host proteases into three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural proteins play important roles in viral genome replication and manipulating host responses, whereas structural proteins involve in viral particle formation [
