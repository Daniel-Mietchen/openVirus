<p>Clinical symptoms of ZIKV infections are very similar with Dengue and Chikungunya with few distinguished features [
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In ZIKV, there is low grade fever, while fever is high in Dengue and Chikungunya infection. On the other hand, edema of limb is very common in ZIKV, which is absent in Dengue and Chikungunya. In addition, unlike Dengue and Chikungunya, arthralgia is very less common in ZIKV. The asymptomatic pregnant women should be tested according to CDC guideline [

Confirmatory diagnosis of ZIKV is based on reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and laboratory tests are useful to distinguish Zika from other flaviviruses. ELISA and immunofluorescence assay of serum samples 5–7 days onward of clinical symptoms appeared are useful to detect ZIKV specific IgM. It is recommended to test the serum samples again for the second time from 1 to 2 weeks after the first sampling as ZIKV-specific IgM may persist up to 12 weeks of post symptoms. In special circumstances such as with specific history or disorder, cerebral spinal fluid, urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, nasopharyngeal swabs, placenta, umbilical cord of infant, etc., can be used for diagnostic purpose [

Recently, several rapid diagnostic kits such as Zika NS1 Rapid Test (Biopanda Reagents, The United Kingdom), Zika Rapid Test (Maternova, USA), and Artron’s One Step Zika Virus Test Kit (Bio-Connect Diagnostics, The Netherlands) specific for ZIKV have been developed which can be used for primary detection in the field level [
