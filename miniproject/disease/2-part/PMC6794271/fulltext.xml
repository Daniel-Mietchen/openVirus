However, detailed information on the epidemiology and evolution of viruses co-circulating in human and animal populations in the absence of significant outbreaks or epidemics is generally lacking. To help overcome this deficiency, the Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic InfectIONS (VIZIONS) project ran between 2011 and 2016 with the overall aim of improving understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of zoonotic virus infections (particularly emerging infections) in Vietnam in south-east Asia.</p><p id="Par6">VIZIONS was a Wellcome Trust-funded collaboration between the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, the Sanger Institute and the University of Edinburgh in the UK, and Metabiota Inc. in the US, working closely with seven Vietnam hospitals, Hanoi Medical University, and Vietnam regional medical centres and sub-departments for animal health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">VIZIONS supported studies in hospitals, communities and animal populations throughout Vietnam covering mainly enteric, respiratory, CNS infections and jaundice and generating data on clinical symptoms and outcomes, diagnostics, epidemiology and risk factors, virus identification, and virus genome sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The data reported here comprise metagenomic sequence data and linked metadata for 2100 enteric samples from humans and animals and come from two major components of the VIZIONS project, one hospital-based and one community-based.</p><p id="Par8">The first component was a large hospital-based surveillance study: a retrospective case series of hospitalised patients presenting with enteric disease believed to result from an infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The main aims of the study were to obtain high resolution data on all viruses present in these patients; to identify viruses of possible zoonotic origin causing severe disease (resulting in hospitalisation); and to estimate the disease burden due to viruses of zoonotic origin. This component contributed two additional sub-studies: a small study of only patients who tested positive for rotavirus A infection using a PCR test; and another small study of patients with undiagnosed enteric disease at four hospital sites.</p><p id="Par9">The second component was a high-risk sentinel cohort: a prospective longitudinal cohort of people who have frequent occupational contact with animals and are thus perceived to be at high risk of developing zoonotic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This component contributed two sub-studies: the high-risk sentinel cohort itself; and a parallel study of non-human mammals with which the human subjects were in close contact. The main aims of the study were to characterise the diversity of viruses circulating in high-risk human populations and in the animals with which they were in contact (including those that were asymptomatic or caused only mild illness that would not be picked up in a hospital-based study), estimate the incidence of virus infections in the human cohort, and identify possible instances of cross-species transmission. Subjects were selected based on high levels of exposure to animals (mainly on farms, in wet markets or slaughterhouses) and were sampled routinely at regular intervals over a three-year period and during episodes of diarrhoea.</p><p id="Par10">A metagenomic sequencing protocol using random primers and a reverse transcription step was used to identify viruses in faecal samples and rectal swabs from these studies. This method was considered to be less biased towards common pathogens and to yield more information than a battery of diagnostic PCRs targeting specific, known pathogens. Metagenomic sequence data would allow in-depth characterisation of virus diversity in the study populations. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis would provide insights into the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the identified viruses, including their spatial and temporal spread through human and animal populations and the inference of any zoonotic transmission events.</p><p id="Par11">The great majority of the data reported here were obtained from Dong Thap, a province in the south of Vietnam that is regarded as a potential hot-spot for the emergence of novel zoonotic viruses. Dong Thap province is in the Mekong Delta region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Due to its mostly flat terrain, the Mekong Delta is one of the most important agricultural centres in Vietnam, and it has high human and livestock population densities. Dong Thap has an area of 3,379 km<sup>2</sup> and is inhabited by just under 1.7 million people, approximately 4.7 million ducks, chickens and other poultry, 233,000 pigs, and 26,000 cattle and buffalo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Additionally, there is a vibrant rat trade, with many tonnes of live rats sold for human consumption each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

This part of the study is described in detail elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A subset of 842 these samples was selected for metagenomic sequencing. This subset comprised all available rodent and bat samples, and a representative selection from other mammals (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Bat and monkey species were not recorded during sampling, therefore this was predicted by querying the raw reads from bat and monkey samples against mitochondrial DNA databases containing Chiroptera (NCBI:txid9397, February 2017) and Simiiformes (excluding <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) (NCBI:txid314293, June 2018) sequences respectively. This was performed using Blastn (e value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1e-50) and selecting the species with the highest frequency of hits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Viral metagenomic sequencing</title><p id="Par41">A total of 2100 samples obtained from the 5 sub-studies were sent for metagenomic sequencing at the Sanger Institute, UK. Samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C after collection and maintained at this temperature until sample processing (up to a maximum of 12 months). Samples were processed according to a modified Virus Discovery by cDNA Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (VIDISCA) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This method enriches samples for viral genetic material, which is otherwise difficult to sequence as it is naturally present at much lower concentrations than host and bacterial nucleic acid. It then converts genetic material from both DNA and RNA viruses to dsDNA to allow for metagenomic library preparation, using a process that is sequence-independent and reduces contamination by host ribosomal RNA.</p><p id="Par42">Detailed procedures were as follows. Samples were suspended in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and 110&#x02009;&#x000b5;l were used for nucleic acid extractions. First, viral nucleic acid was enriched for by the removal of cellular debris, mitochondria and bacteria with a centrifugation step (10&#x02009;minutes at 10,000&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g), and subsequent digestion of any residual DNA with DNase (20 units TURBO DNase, Ambion) - viral nucleic acid was presumed to be protected from this treatment by encapsidation within virions. Protected viral nucleic acid was then extracted using the Boom extraction method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Viral RNA was converted to a cDNA intermediate using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) and a mixture of hexamer primers, designed to avoid binding to ribosomal RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Subsequently, cDNA and viral ssDNA were subjected to second strand synthesis with 5 units Klenow fragment (3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease defective, New England Biolabs), and the resulting dsDNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Library preparation and sequencing</title><p id="Par43">Isolated viral dsDNA was used to prepare metagenomic sequence libraries for deep sequencing, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Library preparation followed standard Illumina protocols, with up to 96 samples being prepared at a time for multiplex sequencing. Nucleic acids were sheared to 400&#x02013;500 nucleotides (nt) in length. Distinct 8 nt indexing barcodes were added to each sample&#x02019;s nucleic acid before pooling. Each pool was sequenced divided over two lanes. Sequencing was done on Illumina HiSeq. 2500 machines, yielding up to several million 250 nt paired-end reads per sample. Adapters were trimmed off with Biobambam2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. For ethical reasons, human-derived sequences were identified by aligning reads to the GRCh38 reference genome (without Epstein-Barr virus) with BWA-backtrack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and then removed. The resulting sequence data were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) in two batches, the first by Wellcome Sanger Institute as study PRJEB6505<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and the second by the University of Edinburgh as study PRJEB26687<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.
