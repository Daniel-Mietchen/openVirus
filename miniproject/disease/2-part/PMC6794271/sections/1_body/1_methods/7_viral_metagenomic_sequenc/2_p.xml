<p id="Par42">Detailed procedures were as follows. Samples were suspended in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and 110 µl were used for nucleic acid extractions. First, viral nucleic acid was enriched for by the removal of cellular debris, mitochondria and bacteria with a centrifugation step (10 minutes at 10,000 × g), and subsequent digestion of any residual DNA with DNase (20 units TURBO DNase, Ambion) - viral nucleic acid was presumed to be protected from this treatment by encapsidation within virions. Protected viral nucleic acid was then extracted using the Boom extraction method

 </sup>. Viral RNA was converted to a cDNA intermediate using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) and a mixture of hexamer primers, designed to avoid binding to ribosomal RNA
