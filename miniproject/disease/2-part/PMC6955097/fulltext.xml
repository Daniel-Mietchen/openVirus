Such events can result in disease epidemics or in some cases, clinically silent outcomes. These occurrences are likely relatively common and can serve as tools to better understand disease dynamics, and may result in changes in behavior, fecundity, and, ultimately survival of the host. Feline foamy virus (FFV) is a common retrovirus infecting domestic cats globally, which has also been documented in the North American puma (<italic>Puma concolor</italic>). The prevalent nature of FFV in domestic cats and its ability to infect wild felids, including puma, provides an ideal system to study cross-species transmission across trophic levels (positions in the food chain), and evolution of pathogens transmitted between individuals following direct contact. Here we present findings from an extensive molecular analysis of FFV in pumas, focused on two locations in Colorado, and in relation to FFV recovered from domestic cats in this and previous studies. Prevalence of FFV in puma was high across the two regions, &#x0223c;77 per cent (urban interface site) and &#x0223c;48 per cent (rural site). Comparison of FFV from pumas living across three states; Colorado, Florida, and California, indicates FFV is widely distributed across North America. FFV isolated from domestic cats and pumas was not distinguishable at the host level, with FFV sequences sharing &#x0003e;93 per cent nucleotide similarity. Phylogenetic, Bayesian, and recombination analyses of FFV across the two species supports frequent cross-species spillover from domestic cat to puma during the last century, as well as frequent puma-to-puma intraspecific transmission in Colorado, USA. Two FFV variants, distinguished by significant difference in the surface unit of the envelope protein, were commonly found in both hosts. This trait is also shared by simian foamy virus and may represent variation in cell tropism or a unique immune evasion mechanism. This study elucidates evolutionary and cross-species transmission dynamics of a highly prevalent multi-host adapted virus, a system which can further be applied to model spillover and transmission of pathogenic viruses resulting in widespread infection in the new host.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>feline foamy virus</kwd><kwd>retrovirus</kwd><kwd>cross-species transmission</kwd><kwd>puma</kwd><kwd>domestic cat</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">NSF-EEID</named-content></funding-source><award-id>1413925</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Transmission of domestic animal pathogens at the wildlife-urban interface is highly relevant to disease emergence in new host populations (<xref rid="vez058-B83" ref-type="bibr">Wiethoelter et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B18" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhary et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B19" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>), and is typically focused on virulent clinical outcomes in the new host. Enhanced ability to investigate the virome of an organism has improved our ability to evaluate transmission of viruses that do not result in acute death but result in chronic lifelong infection. Foamy viruses (FVs; family <italic>Retroviridae</italic>) are an ancient lineage of endemic animal-infecting retroviruses. Known to be largely host-specific, molecular evidence suggests FVs have co-evolved with their hosts, which include several non-human primate species, feline species, cattle, and horses (<xref rid="vez058-B80" ref-type="bibr">Switzer et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B73" ref-type="bibr">Rethwilm and Bodem 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B43" ref-type="bibr">Khan et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Although no overt diseases have been directly attributed to FV infection, coinfections and interactions with other viruses have been documented (<xref rid="vez058-B79" ref-type="bibr">Switzer et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B20" ref-type="bibr">Choudhary et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B2" ref-type="bibr">Alais et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B70" ref-type="bibr">Powers et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Numerous zoonotic transmissions of simian FV (SFV) from non-human primates to humans have been documented (<xref rid="vez058-B61" ref-type="bibr">Mouinga-Ond&#x000e9;m&#x000e9; et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B74" ref-type="bibr">Richard et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B12" ref-type="bibr">Buseyne et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Although not extensively investigated SFV transmissions have not been recorded from human to human. Endogenous relic FVs and FV-like elements have also been identified in numerous animals including the aye-aye (<italic>Daubentonia madagascariensis</italic>) genome (<xref rid="vez058-B34" ref-type="bibr">Han and Worobey 2012</xref>b), the ancient coelacanth fish (<xref rid="vez058-B33" ref-type="bibr">Han and Worobey 2012</xref>a), the Tuatara (<xref rid="vez058-B82" ref-type="bibr">Wei et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>) and several other species (<xref rid="vez058-B86" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>).</p><p>FVs have linear &#x0223c;11&#x02013;13&#x02009;kb ssRNA genomes, containing two long terminal repeat regions and three major canonical retroviral genes, <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic>, and <italic>env</italic>. At least two additional accessory proteins are encoded 3&#x02032; region to the <italic>env.</italic> Like all retroviruses, replication includes transcription from RNA to a DNA intermediate that integrates into the host genome. Although the viral entry receptor(s) for FFV has not yet been identified, studies have detected FVs in a broad range of tissue types and cells (<xref rid="vez058-B53" ref-type="bibr">Luther, Nuttall, and Gibbons 1978</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B11" ref-type="bibr">Bouillant and Ruckerbauer 1984</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B56" ref-type="bibr">Materniak, Bicka, and Ku&#x0017a;mak 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B63" ref-type="bibr">Murray and Linial 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B41" ref-type="bibr">Kehl, Tan, and Materniak 2013</xref>) with evidence suggests that the oral mucosa is the primary region for FV replication (<xref rid="vez058-B85" ref-type="bibr">Winkler, L&#x000f6;chelt, and Flower 1999</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B15" ref-type="bibr">Calattini et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Of all the FVs, the primate FVs have been the most extensively researched to date, with several genetically distinct species groups having been identified in both Old World and New World primates. Phylogenetic analysis supports virus&#x02013;host coevolution history, with additional evidence of occasional cross-species transmission mostly within the simian system (<xref rid="vez058-B78" ref-type="bibr">Switzer et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B74" ref-type="bibr">Richard et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>) and coinfection with multiple FV strains/genotypes (<xref rid="vez058-B52" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). Based on the notion that FVs have co-evolved with their hosts, long-term molecular clock investigation indicates primate FVs have a slower nucleotide substitution rate than other RNA viruses and are the slowest evolving RNA viruses documented (<xref rid="vez058-B80" ref-type="bibr">Switzer et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>). Recombination also plays an important role in FV evolution (<xref rid="vez058-B74" ref-type="bibr">Richard et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B27" ref-type="bibr">Ensser et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). A presumed result of ancient recombination is the presence of two circulating serotypes which differ in a highly variable receptor binding encoding, also referred to as the surface unit (SU) region in the <italic>env</italic> gene observed in FV of both felines and primates (<xref rid="vez058-B84" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et&#x000a0;al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bleiholder et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B30" ref-type="bibr">Galvin et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B74" ref-type="bibr">Richard et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B45" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>).</p><p>Unlike primate FVs, very little is known about the genetic diversity, evolutionary dynamics, and ecology of feline FV (FFV). FFV infection of domestic cats is broadly distributed globally, with prevalence studies in Europe (<xref rid="vez058-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bleiholder et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>), Australia (<xref rid="vez058-B85" ref-type="bibr">Winkler, L&#x000f6;chelt, and Flower 1999</xref>), Asia (<xref rid="vez058-B64" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et&#x000a0;al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B68" ref-type="bibr">Phung et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>), and the USA (<xref rid="vez058-B70" ref-type="bibr">Powers et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>), indicating FFV is endemic worldwide with these studies showing variable prevalence between 30 and 70 per cent. Although no consistent sex bias has been demonstrated, an increased prevalence is linked with aging of the animals (<xref rid="vez058-B85" ref-type="bibr">Winkler, L&#x000f6;chelt, and Flower 1999</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B64" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et&#x000a0;al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bleiholder et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Oral mucosa is known as a key site of domestic cat FFV active replication (<xref rid="vez058-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cavalcante et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>), with close social or conflict interactions such as grooming and/or biting likely primary transmission pathways (<xref rid="vez058-B85" ref-type="bibr">Winkler, L&#x000f6;chelt, and Flower 1999</xref>). This mode of transmission is also supported in simian populations, where biting and predation has been shown to be a major source of transmission within and between species (<xref rid="vez058-B14" ref-type="bibr">Calattini et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B52" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B6" ref-type="bibr">Betsem et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Only four complete FFV genomes have been described from domestic cats that is, two from the USA (<xref rid="vez058-B36" ref-type="bibr">Helps and Harbour 1997</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B84" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et&#x000a0;al. 1998</xref>), and one each from Japan (<xref rid="vez058-B35" ref-type="bibr">Hatama et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>), and Australia (<xref rid="vez058-B10" ref-type="bibr">Bodem et&#x000a0;al. 1996</xref>). In wild felids, FFV infections have been documented using serology in European wildcats (<italic>Felis silvestris</italic>) from Scotland (<xref rid="vez058-B23" ref-type="bibr">Daniels et&#x000a0;al. 1999</xref>) and leopard cats (<italic>Prionailurus bengalensis</italic>) in Vietnam (<xref rid="vez058-B64" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et&#x000a0;al. 2000</xref>). FFV has also been detected by partial genome sequencing in Iriomoteiriomote cats (subspecies <italic>P</italic><italic>.</italic>&#x02002;<italic>bengalensis iriomotensis</italic>) in Japan and leopard cats in Argentina (<xref rid="vez058-B68" ref-type="bibr">Phung et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>). A recent serologic survey of pumas in three USA states (California, Colorado, and Florida) is the first large-scale prevalence study in a wild felid species showing high levels of FFV seroconversion in the three areas, documenting &#x0223c;80 per cent positivity (<xref rid="vez058-B39" ref-type="bibr">Kechejian et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>). Additionally, two full length FFV genomes have been recovered from the North American puma (<xref rid="vez058-B40" ref-type="bibr">Kehl et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>), which genetically are highly similar to those found in domestic cats (<xref rid="vez058-B68" ref-type="bibr">Phung et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B40" ref-type="bibr">Kehl et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to gain important insights into the origin, molecular ecology, and transmission dynamics of FFV in wild and domestic felids, we undertook the first extensive molecular survey and genetic analyses of FFV in wild felids, focusing on puma from two geographically distinct regions in Colorado, USA. As top predators, there is accumulating evidence that this species is at higher risk for pathogen spillover from prey (<xref rid="vez058-B29" ref-type="bibr">Franklin et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B81" ref-type="bibr">Troyer et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B47" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al. 2017a</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B42" ref-type="bibr">Kellner et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>), including spillover of feline leukemia virus from domestic cats to the endangered Florida panther with significant clinical impact (<xref rid="vez058-B22" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B19" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>). We additionally undertook a comparative analysis to understand broader host&#x02013;virus dynamics, analyzing FFV sequences from free-ranging feral domestic cats from Colorado and Australia, and free-roaming pumas from Florida and California. Our analysis supports frequent cross-species transmission of FFV during the last century along with puma-to-puma transmission, resulting in wide distribution and high prevalence of FFV in Puma across Colorado. As a result of these virus&#x02013;host dynamics FFV sequences derived from puma living in Colorado, California, and endangered Florida panthers share high levels of similarity to FFV from domestic cats and do not form distinct species clades phylogenetically.</p></sec><sec><title>2.

Reported seroprevalence was even higher (77.3%) which is likely due to higher sensitivity of ELISA compared with PCR (<xref rid="vez058-B39" ref-type="bibr">Kechejian et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>). Identification of FFV positive pumas from Florida and California indicates this virus is not limited to Colorado puma populations, and is widely spread across free-ranging populations. We found little statistical support for increased infection rate with sex (GLMM pMCMC &#x0003e; 0.05) or age (GLMM pMCMC &#x0003e; 0.05), indicating that FFV is readily transmitted between the sexes, and is not age dependent&#x02014;providing strong support for social transmission mechanisms such as grooming. Although sex and age were not found to be risk factors for FFV infection, their inclusion in our GLMMs improved model fit suggesting they may still influence FFV transmission. Recent work by our research group has indicated age and/or sex to be risk factors that vary by population (<xref rid="vez058-B39" ref-type="bibr">Kechejian et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>), so the impact of these factors on risk of infection has yet to be fully elucidated. Juvenile-originating FFV sequences were dispersed throughout the phylogeny, and commonly nested most closely to those from adults, a pattern suggesting transmission from parent to offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Additionally, lack of phylogenetic stratification by sex indicates transmission between males and females occurs commonly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>4.2 Complex phylogeny of puma FFV indicates spillover and puma to puma transmission</title><p>The phylogenetic relationship of FFV from puma and domestic cats highlights a single virus&#x02013;dual host dynamic, supporting domestic cat to puma transmission and puma to puma transmission.

Both SU Env genotypes were isolated from domestic cats and pumas, and were found in the WS and FR of Colorado, and globally among domestic cats. This indicates both genotypes are adapted to both species and frequently co-circulate in populations, thereby suggesting a synergistic relationship. The dominant presence of both genotypes circulating among both host species indicates that despite the high level of amino acid variability in this SU region, these genotypes are well adapted to both host species. This observation parallels recent studies of two unique Env SFV subtypes in non-human primates (<xref rid="vez058-B74" ref-type="bibr">Richard et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B45" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). In domestic cats analyses clearly identified these two genotypes using serotype-specific PCR assays, sequencing and neutralizing assays (<xref rid="vez058-B84" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et&#x000a0;al. 1998</xref>). A later study targeted Env-specific antibodies using a ElpSU antigen ELIZA; however, this assay was unable to distinguish-specific serotypes (<xref rid="vez058-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bleiholder et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). It has been suggested that variance in SU allows the virus to utilize multiple receptors in a genotype-specific manner, or perhaps they have different cell tropisms relevant for the biology of FFV. Receptor interference studies however support that all FVs, despite having a broad host range, may gain viral entry via the same cell surface receptor (<xref rid="vez058-B37" ref-type="bibr">Hill, Bieniasz, and McClure 1999</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B5" ref-type="bibr">Berg et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>).

This would indicate that the two FFV genotypes also utilize the same receptor; however, additional studies of this interesting phenomenon are warranted to further explore this.</p></sec><sec><title>4.4 Recombination plays an important role in FFV evolution and adaptation</title><p>We identified FFV recombinant regions spanning the complete open reading frame of <italic>pol</italic>, whereas recombinant regions in <italic>env</italic> are concentrated in the 5&#x02032; and SU region.

Several factors likely contribute to this difference. First, a 425 nt region of <italic>pol</italic> was used in the SFV study (<xref rid="vez058-B80" ref-type="bibr">Switzer et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>) compared with the full &#x0223c;3,460 nt <italic>pol</italic> gene region analyzed here. Second, time dependency, which refers to the differences between short- and long-term studies, can alter estimates of FV evolutionary rates (<xref rid="vez058-B1" ref-type="bibr">Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B57" ref-type="bibr">Membrebe et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>). Tissue type sampled may also attribute to calculation of different substitution rates, as sampling of the virus from mucosa likely represents an active infection, whereas viral sequences sampled from the blood represent latent infection (<xref rid="vez058-B76" ref-type="bibr">Soliven et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). The frequent transmission events of FFV in this dual-host system may also be a factor in driving evolution rates. Nevertheless, FFV substitution rates appear to be falling between reported rates for DNA and RNA viruses, and in the range described for other retroviruses such as FIV (<xref rid="vez058-B67" ref-type="bibr">Peck and Lauring 2018</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B44" ref-type="bibr">Krakoff et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>4.6 Host and spatial movement patterns evident in FFV phylogeny</title><p>Puma isolates were grouped according to location, while domestic cat FFV isolates were analyzed as a single group in order to best mitigate the effects of sampling bias from puma. The BF supported transitions indicates a high probability of FFV spillover from domestic cats to puma, as well as puma to puma transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). It&#x02019;s worth noting a flexible non-parametric coalescent model was applied in these analyses, which assumes all organisms are part of the same population. Given the spatial/host dimensions of this analyses this prior although not optimal was the most appropriate currently available. Nonetheless, we found that whilst there was some support for puma to domestic cat cross-species transmission (BF = 20), overwhelmingly the model supported domestic cat to puma transmission (BF = 8,155) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). This is not surprising considering that interactions between the puma predator and domestic cat prey make puma to domestic cat pathogen transmission events for directly transmitted agents biologically implausible. Spatial movement of FFV via puma to puma transmission is strongly supported between urban (FR) and rural (WS) locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>), which is likely propagated by dispersal of individuals. Our findings support FFV transmission between domestic cat and puma in both urban (California and Colorado FR) and rural (Colorado WS) areas, although the latter appears to be much more strongly supported. There is potentially a high propensity for cross-species transmission in an urban area due to high densities of domestic cats kept as pets (<xref rid="vez058-B60" ref-type="bibr">Moss et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). High risks for transmission in rural regions may be related to the higher number of outdoor cats in these areas which are at risk for predation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>This study provides the first large-scale molecular analysis of FFV infection in a free-ranging wild felid, and presents an in-depth investigation of the viral dynamics and evolution within puma populations in comparison to domestic cats. We document a remarkably high number of puma infected with FFV (including sequences from California, Colorado, and Florida), approximating or exceeding seroprevalence rates in domestic cats (<xref rid="vez058-B85" ref-type="bibr">Winkler, L&#x000f6;chelt, and Flower 1999</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B68" ref-type="bibr">Phung et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>). Interestingly, phylogeny indicates that FFV from domestic cats readily infects pumas suggesting limited innate or adaptive immune barriers exist to prohibit FFV cross-species transmission between these hosts. Further, the differing phylogenetic patterns between Pol and Env maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees indicate a complex and dynamic evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Figs&#x000a0;2 and 3</xref>).</p><p>SFVs and FFVs share the unusual phenomenon of having two distinct and unique co-circulating genotypes which vary significantly in the receptor binding domain of Env. We show here that these two distinct FFV genotypes commonly infect both puma and domestic cats, though neither genotype exhibits species specificity. Although the biological implications and origin(s) are unknown, it appears this region of FV is highly prone to recombination in both felids and primates (<xref rid="vez058-B30" ref-type="bibr">Galvin et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B74" ref-type="bibr">Richard et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B27" ref-type="bibr">Ensser et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Further, the near equivalence of these two genotypes in prevalence suggests that the two genotypes may be synergistic and/or dependent upon one another, as a greater fitness of one genotype versus the other would be accompanied by disproportionate occurrence of one isolate (<xref rid="vez058-B62" ref-type="bibr">Moya, Holmes, and Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Candelas 2004</xref>).</p><p>Unlike another retroviral infection of puma, FIV<sub>pco</sub> (<xref rid="vez058-B46" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>), the phylogeny of FFV sequences displays little geographic structure. Interestingly, here we see domestic cat derived FFV sequences are interspersed throughout the phylogenetic trees, and are situated either basal to, or clustered within, clades comprised of both domestic cat and puma isolates from the USA. Further, internationally derived FFV domestic cat sequences from Europe or Australia are also sporadically located across the phylogenetic tree. This pattern is most easily explained by owners relocating with their pet cats and/or historical trade movements where cats were dispersed for the purpose of rodent control, both domestically and globally (<xref rid="vez058-B31" ref-type="bibr">Gehrt, Riley, and Cypher 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B65" ref-type="bibr">Ottoni et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>). Well-supported BF movements are congruent with a co-circulating history in these two host species, and strongly suggest that domestic cats may be an important factor for &#x02018;seeding&#x02019; FFV into puma populations, followed by subsequent spread from puma to puma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Genetic and historical records indicate the introduction of domestic cats to the New World occurred with early European settlers &#x0223c;1,600 (<xref rid="vez058-B51" ref-type="bibr">Lipinski et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). It is thought that settlers brought domestic cats to Colorado during the Pike&#x02019;s Peak gold rush of 1,858, and were well-established in the state by the 1870s (<xref rid="vez058-B75" ref-type="bibr">Ross 2016</xref>). In the early to mid-1900s, puma abundance throughout Colorado declined to a few hundred individuals, primarily due to unrestricted hunting and predator control. From 1965 to present, human-caused mortality in pumas was restricted (<xref rid="vez058-B3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), and as a result the puma population in Colorado have grown from as low as a few hundred in 1965 to a few thousand adult and sub-adult pumas (<xref rid="vez058-B13" ref-type="bibr">Cahalane 1964</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B4" ref-type="bibr">Apker 2017</xref>). When puma numbers were low, interactions between pumas and domestic cats would consequently be limited. Increases in free-ranging puma populations, concurrent with increases in domestic cat ownership have likely influenced prevalence trends recorded here that are congruent with general indications of FFV phylogenetic analysis. The very high level of contemporary FFV infection/movement among pumas indicates rapid fixation in the population. A similar pattern has been seen for other pathogens, such as the &#x0223c;1980 canine parvovirus pandemic, illustrating that a very contagious pathogen that does not cause high morbidity can rapidly become endemic (<xref rid="vez058-B66" ref-type="bibr">Parrish and Kawaoka 2005</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, although identified in domestic cats and puma, a homologous genotype of FFV is not known to infect bobcats or Canada Lynx (<italic>Lynx canadensis</italic>), both of which have overlapping geographic ranges with puma, and it has been shown that bobcats will predate on domestic cats (<xref rid="vez058-B21" ref-type="bibr">Clark 2010</xref>). This suggests that species-specific immunological or innate factors may limit FFV. FFV is present in the unique wild felid species which inhabits the island of Iriomote, Japan, an island that has been geographically isolated for 200,000 years (<xref rid="vez058-B55" ref-type="bibr">Masuda and Yoshida 1995</xref>). Despite harboring FFV the Iriomote wild cat population were negative for other major feline viral infections such as feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus (<xref rid="vez058-B59" ref-type="bibr">Mochizuki, Akuzawa, and Nagatomo 1990</xref>), thereby supporting an ancient ancestral origin. More extensive molecular investigations into FFV infecting other wild felid species globally would shed further light on the evolutionary history of what is believed to be one of the oldest known exogenous vertebrate RNA virus families (<xref rid="vez058-B73" ref-type="bibr">Rethwilm and Bodem 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given its high prevalence, and the unlikelihood that FFV would be transmitted from puma to domestic cats (since the domestic cats are unlikely to survive such an encounter), FFV provides an interesting and unique viral &#x02018;fingerprint&#x02019; that can map puma movements and augment studies of individual and population movements in this wide-ranging and secretive apex predator (<xref rid="vez058-B28" ref-type="bibr">Fountain-Jones et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Although FVs evolve slowly, we document FFV substitution rates that are more rapid than predicted by previous FV mutation rate estimates. This may be due to adaptation to a new host species and pervasive inter- and intra-species transmission, and provides an opportunity to better study transmission events within and between species. The information gained here elucidating the evolution and cross-species transmission dynamics of a highly prevalent but apathogenic virus can be further applied to model more virulent disease, such as that caused by feline leukemia virus, which is a major threat to the endangered Florida panther (<xref rid="vez058-B22" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="vez058-B19" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>vez058_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="vez058_supplementary_data.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank wildlife managers, scientists, veterinarians, and support staff at Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and National Park Service including Dave Onorato, Mark Cunningham, and Roy McBride.
