<p>Transmission of domestic animal pathogens at the wildlife-urban interface is highly relevant to disease emergence in new host populations (

Enhanced ability to investigate the virome of an organism has improved our ability to evaluate transmission of viruses that do not result in acute death but result in chronic lifelong infection. Foamy viruses (FVs; family 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic>) are an ancient lineage of endemic animal-infecting retroviruses. Known to be largely host-specific, molecular evidence suggests FVs have co-evolved with their hosts, which include several non-human primate species, feline species, cattle, and horses (

 <xref rid="vez058-B43" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al. 2018</xref>). Although no overt diseases have been directly attributed to FV infection, coinfections and interactions with other viruses have been documented (
