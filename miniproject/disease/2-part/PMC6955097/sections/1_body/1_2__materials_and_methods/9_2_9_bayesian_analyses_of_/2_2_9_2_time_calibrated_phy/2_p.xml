<p>A relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock with continuous quantile parametrization was specified, and Bayesian skyline with time-aware Gaussian Markov random field coalescent prior was utilized (
 <xref rid="vez058-B58" ref-type="bibr">Minin, Bloomquist, and Suchard 2008</xref>). We used default priors and ran two independent MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) analyses for 500 million steps and sampled every 500,000 states. Convergence of parameter estimates was assessed based effective sample size (ESS) (estimates with an ESS &gt; 200 were considered converged).
