<p>A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed from

 <xref rid="vez058-B54" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. 2015</xref>). This analysis was conducted using an Subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) branch-swapping heuristic search in PhyML 3.0 (
 <xref rid="vez058-B32" ref-type="bibr">Guindon et al. 2010</xref>) and 1, 000 bootstrap replicates were used to estimate node robustness in the phylogeny. As part of this analysis, we specified the smart nucleotide selection model (
 <xref rid="vez058-B49" ref-type="bibr">Lefort, Longueville, and Gascuel 2017</xref>), which identified GTR + Γ4 model of nucleotide substitution model as most appropriate for this dataset. Using this tree, we performed a linear regression of root-to-tip divergences using the TempEst routine to check for temporal signal in the FFV sequences (
