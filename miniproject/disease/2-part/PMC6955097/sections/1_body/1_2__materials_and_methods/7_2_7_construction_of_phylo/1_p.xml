<p>The full genomes and Pol and Env amino acid datasets were used to construct maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. The best fit substitution models were inferred in MEGA 5.3 for the full genomes (GTR+I+G) using jModelTest (
 <xref rid="vez058-B69" ref-type="bibr">Posada 2009</xref>), and for the Pol and Env datasets (JTT+G) using ProtTest (
 <xref rid="vez058-B24" ref-type="bibr">Darriba et al. 2011</xref>). Trees were constructed using PhyML (
 <xref rid="vez058-B32" ref-type="bibr">Guindon et al. 2010</xref>) with approximate likelihood branch support. Branches presenting &lt;80 per cent support were collapsed in TreeGraph2 (
 <xref rid="vez058-B77" ref-type="bibr">Stöver and Müller 2010</xref>). Trees were all midpoint rooted. Editing of trees was undertaken using FigTree V1.4.3 (
 <xref rid="vez058-B71" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut 2012</xref>) and demographic illustrative data were overlaid onto the Pol phylogenetic tree using ITOL v4.2.3 (
