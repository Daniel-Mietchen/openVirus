<p>qPCR screening of FFV in 169 pumas from two locations in Colorado revealed a higher prevalence of FFV in the FR of 55/71 (∼77%) compared with the WS which had a 48/98 (∼48%), and with a prevalence of 103/169 (∼60%) across both regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Nucleotide similarity of FFV full genomes isolated from domestic cats and puma (including those from Florida, Australia, and USA, and international isolates available in the public database GenBank) range from 93 to 100 per cent pairwise nucleotide similarity (

 <xref rid="vez058-B84" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et al. 1998</xref>), two distinct Env genotypes were identified, with amino acid identity ranging from 93 to 100 per cent within genotypes, and 82 to 85 per cent identity between genotypes (

 <italic>env</italic> gene, within each Env genotype group, is similar to that across the rest of the genome; ∼94–100 per cent (data not shown).
