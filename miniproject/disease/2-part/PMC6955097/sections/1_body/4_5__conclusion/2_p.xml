<p>SFVs and FFVs share the unusual phenomenon of having two distinct and unique co-circulating genotypes which vary significantly in the receptor binding domain of Env. We show here that these two distinct FFV genotypes commonly infect both puma and domestic cats, though neither genotype exhibits species specificity. Although the biological implications and origin(s) are unknown, it appears this region of FV is highly prone to recombination in both felids and primates (

Further, the near equivalence of these two genotypes in prevalence suggests that the two genotypes may be synergistic and/or dependent upon one another, as a greater fitness of one genotype versus the other would be accompanied by disproportionate occurrence of one isolate (
