<p>Substitution rates in FFV 
 <italic>pol</italic>, ∼2.5 × 10
 <sup>−</sup>
 <sup>4</sup> substitutions per site per year (s/n/y), are considerably higher than rates reported for SFV 
 <italic>pol</italic> (∼1.7 × 10
 <sup>−</sup>
 <sup>8</sup> s/n/y; 
 <xref rid="vez058-B80" ref-type="bibr">Switzer et al. 2005</xref>). Several factors likely contribute to this difference. First, a 425 nt region of 
 <italic>pol</italic> was used in the SFV study (
 <xref rid="vez058-B80" ref-type="bibr">Switzer et al. 2005</xref>) compared with the full ∼3,460 nt 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene region analyzed here. Second, time dependency, which refers to the differences between short- and long-term studies, can alter estimates of FV evolutionary rates (

 <xref rid="vez058-B57" ref-type="bibr">Membrebe et al. 2019</xref>). Tissue type sampled may also attribute to calculation of different substitution rates, as sampling of the virus from mucosa likely represents an active infection, whereas viral sequences sampled from the blood represent latent infection (

Nevertheless, FFV substitution rates appear to be falling between reported rates for DNA and RNA viruses, and in the range described for other retroviruses such as FIV (
