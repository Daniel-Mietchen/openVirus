<p>The phylogenetic relationship of FFV from puma and domestic cats highlights a single virus–dual host dynamic, supporting domestic cat to puma transmission and puma to puma transmission. This is displayed in both the Pol and Env protein phylogenetic trees independently (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Figs 2 and 3</xref>) with the presence of 1) puma only clades and 2) domestic cat isolates cluster throughout the tree, basal to or within puma dominated clades. Viral spillover resulting from trophic interactions has been demonstrated for other retroviruses, including feline immunodeficieny virus - FIV

 <xref rid="vez058-B19" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et al. 2019</xref>), and also for other pathogens such as 
 <italic>Mycoplasma haemominutum</italic> from bobcat and domestic cat to puma (
 <xref rid="vez058-B42" ref-type="bibr">Kellner et al. 2018</xref>). Recent reports that domestic animals are increasingly preyed upon by puma near human populated areas, including the FR study site examined here (
 <xref rid="vez058-B60" ref-type="bibr">Moss et al. 2016</xref>), is a strong indicator that increases in viral spillover from domestic cats to pumas are likely to be observed with intensified urbanization. Clades that are predominantly comprised of isolates from one geographic area in Colorado (FR or WS; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez058-F2">Figs 2 and 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), but include a single isolate from the other location in Colorado (FR or WS), could represent either introductions from a migrant puma, or domestic cat spillover events.
