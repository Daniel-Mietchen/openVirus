  <p>FFV phylogeny indicates puma FFV originated from cross-species transmission followed by efficient puma-to-puma spread. Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree of pol showing location and host movement of the virus over time. BF supported movements across the tree show supported movements between 1, domestic cats (green) and California puma (purple); 2, domestic cats (green) and WS puma (yellow); and 3, puma from the FR (red) and WS (yellow). Posterior probability indicated by circles as indicated in legend (white, 0.7–0.8; gray, ≥0.8–0.9, black; &gt;0.9).</p>
