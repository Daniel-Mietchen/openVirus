  <p>Association between experimental and estimated virus seed transmission of the 2 TuMV and 3 CMV isolates in 18 
   <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions. (A to D) Correlations of the number of TuMV-infected seeds derived from the TuMV-specific model (A and B) and from the global model (C and D) to the corresponding experimental values. (E to J) Correlations of the number of CMV-infected seeds derived from the CMV-specific model (E to G) and from the global model (H to J) to the corresponding experimental values. Data for JPN1-TuMV (black), UK1-TuMV (gray), LS-CMV (green), Fny-CMV (blue), and De72-CMV (red) are represented.
