<p>The efficiency of CMV and TuMV seed transmission was estimated both as a percentage of infected seeds and as the total number of infected seeds that gave rise to infected progeny per plant in grow-out tests. For each virus, 100 seeds per replicate were washed in a 10% bleach solution to ensure that any viral infection that occurred was not simply the result of the presence of virus on the seed coat but rather was the result of embryonic infection. Next, seeds were placed into petri dishes containing Murashige-Skoog medium, stratified for 3 days at 4°C, and germinated in a growth chamber at 22°C, under 16 h of light (intensity,120 to 150 mol s/m
 <sup>2</sup>). According to methods described previously (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), seedlings at 15 days poststratification were pooled in groups of 2 for a total of 50 groups per replicate. These groups were tested for the presence of TuMV or CMV via qRT-PCR as described above. Because we knew the proportion of samples that tested negative, we used a Poisson distribution to estimate the probability that more than one seedling would test positive in the same sample. The percentage of virus-infected seeds (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1 − (1 −

 <italic>p</italic> is the probability of virus transmission by a single seed, 
 <italic>y</italic> is the number of positive samples, 
 <italic>n</italic> is the total number of samples assayed (
 <italic>n</italic>  =  50), and 
 <italic>k</italic> is the number of seedlings per sample (
 <italic>k</italic>  =  2). To calculate the total number of infected seeds per plant (
