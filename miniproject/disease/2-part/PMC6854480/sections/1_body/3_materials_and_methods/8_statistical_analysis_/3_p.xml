<p>We analyzed the explanatory power of the best-ranked models using data derived from the 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions and the 5 virus isolates for which the efficiency of seed transmission was initially quantified. For this set of accessions, we quantified all the variables considered in the best-ranked models except for 
 <italic>SM</italic>, 
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sub>24</sub>, and 
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sub>48</sub>. We estimated 
 <italic>SM</italic> using values from the six-accession experiment. To do so, we calculated bivariate correlations between 
 <italic>SM</italic> and all other variables. Because 
 <italic>SM</italic> was an accession-specific trait, we used average values per accession. Based on these analyses, we identified the variable with the highest association with 
 <italic>SM</italic>, and we used the equation of the linear relationship to estimate 
 <italic>SM</italic> in the 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions. We could not follow the same approach for 
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sub>24</sub> and 
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sub>48</sub> as they were quantified for each individual plant, and no other trait significantly correlated with these two variables. Because these variables generally had very low relative importance in the best-ranked models, we considered them a constant in our simulations. 
 <italic>ST</italic> and 
 <italic>IS</italic> for the 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions were simulated using the best-ranked models (R package glmmTMB [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]), and their association with real values was analyzed by linear regressions.
