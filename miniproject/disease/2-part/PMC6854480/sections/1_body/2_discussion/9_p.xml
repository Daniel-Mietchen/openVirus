<p>In summary, by using a multivariate approach, this work provides a highly detailed analysis of the infection traits linked to the efficiency of plant virus seed transmission and identify virus within-host speed of movement and multiplication in the plant reproductive organs as major determinants of this process. We also show that a greater contribution of vertical transmission to virus fitness is associated with lower virus virulence. These results support theoretical predictions and contribute to shedding light on the mechanisms by which plant viruses achieve vertical transmission and optimize their fitness.</p>
