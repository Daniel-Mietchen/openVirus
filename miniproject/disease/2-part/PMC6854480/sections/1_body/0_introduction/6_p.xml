<p>To address these questions, we utilized 
 <italic>Turnip mosaic virus</italic> (TuMV) (
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic>), CMV (
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic>), and 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> (Brassicaceae) (referred to here as 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>). Both viruses are commonly found in natural populations of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> at a prevalence of up to 80% (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), indicating that 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-TuMV and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-CMV interactions are significant in nature. In 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, CMV has been shown to be seed transmitted (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and the high TuMV prevalence in natural 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> populations early in the spring (before aphid flights) suggests that this virus may also be seed transmitted (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In addition, TuMV and CMV infections in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> differ in traits proposed to be associated with the efficiency of seed transmission. For instance, TuMV multiplies at lower levels than CMV, whereas TuMV is more virulent (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>; N. Montes, V. Vijayan, and I Pag√°n, submitted for publication). Also, both viruses differentially affect the survival of infected seeds (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Thus, our experimental system allows testing of theoretical predictions on the host and virus traits that determine seed transmission under different infection conditions. To do so, in six 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions, we measured (i) TuMV and CMV speed of within-host movement and multiplication, as proxies of the ability of the virus to reach and invade gametic tissues, respectively; (ii) the effect of virus infection on plant growth and progeny production, as a measure of virulence; and (iii) short-, medium-, and long-term survival of infected seeds. Using multivariate mixed models, we investigated which of these infection traits are associated with the efficiency of virus seed transmission, quantified both as a percentage and as the total number of infected seeds, and their relative importance. We constructed global models that considered data for both viruses together as well as virus-specific models, such that we could differentiate traits broadly associated with seed transmission from virus species-specific determinants of this process. We validated the resulting models by measuring, in a larger set of 18 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions, seed transmission and the most relevant estimators of these traits, and we compared the values predicted by our models with experimental quantifications of seed transmission.
