<p>In general, plant viruses achieve seed transmission in two ways according to the distribution of the virus in the seed. The first is through contamination of the seed coat. In this case, during germination, the virus infects the seedling through abrasions caused by soil particles (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This mechanism of seed transmission has been reported for a few viruses and is relatively well understood only for tobamoviruses (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The second, and most common, method of virus seed transmission is through invasion of the seed embryo (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Embryo invasion may occur in two non-mutually exclusive ways: indirectly by infection of plant gametes prior to fertilization, either the ovules or the pollen, or directly from the mother plant to the embryonic tissue after fertilization (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Hence, for seed transmission to occur, it is crucial that the virus reaches and invades plant reproductive organs before gametogenesis and/or while the embryo is still accessible from mother cells, without affecting gamete/embryo viability. Plant defense responses that regulate virus virulence may enhance or prevent embryo invasion, for instance, by altering the virus distribution in the plant, which may modify the efficiency of seed transmission (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that the efficiency of seed transmission would be determined by (i) the ability of the virus to reach gametic tissues, which would be determined by the speed of within-host movement; (ii) the ability of the virus to invade gametic tissues, which would be associated with virus multiplication in reproductive organs; (iii) plant progeny production upon infection (i.e., virus virulence); and (iv) gamete and embryo survival in the presence of the virus (
