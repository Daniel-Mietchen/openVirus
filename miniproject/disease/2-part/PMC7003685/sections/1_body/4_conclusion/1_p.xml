<p>The present study reveals that the prevalence of dengue cases in the State of Manipur with differential pattern of distribution with respect to geographical, age wise and season wise. The findings in the present study extend the knowledge of the geographical distribution and seroprevelance of dengue in the state of Manipur for the last three years. This study is the first to provide a consistently derived overview of dengue seropositivity data for the state. Given that the majority of dengue infections are clinically asymptomatic, and that the disease is greatly underreported, these results provide distinctive information on dengue transmission per age group in the different districts of the state, and will be invaluable in future modeling studies that explore the temporal and spatial distribution of dengue infection.</p>
