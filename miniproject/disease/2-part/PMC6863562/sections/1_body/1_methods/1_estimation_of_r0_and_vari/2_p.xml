<p>With the range of serial intervals used to initiate the model of 1â€“2 weeks, we assumed a binomial distribution for the serial interval for all municipalities [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The analysis determined the probability of having a 1- or 2-week serial interval for each municipality and assigned the serial interval with the highest probability (

Additionally, given the 2-week maximum serial interval, case counts were included in the determination of the epidemic curve per municipality if new cases occurred within two weeks of the previous case. If a case occurs outside of this two-week window, it was considered sporadic or possibly the results of a new introduction and not included. Having shaped the epidemic curve for each local epidemic, the estimation of
