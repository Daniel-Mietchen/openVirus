<p>One of the metrics used to describe the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is the basic reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>), which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case introduced into a fully susceptible population [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been suggested for vector-borne pathogens that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the expected number of people that will be infected by one person initially infected by a vector [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is theorized that an epidemic occurs when 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is greater than or equal to 1, although an outbreak is possible even with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> lower than 1 [
