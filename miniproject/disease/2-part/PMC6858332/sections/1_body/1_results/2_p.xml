 <italic>reaction</italic>, defined by the epidemioloigcal model (see the section Materials and Methods for details and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref> for a schematic overview), where disease transmission takes place in each grid cell; (ii) the phase of 
 <italic>diffusion</italic> where agents are moved from one grid cell to another according to the mobility model under consideration: the mobility flows aggregated at census district level for the different mobility models are reported in Fig.
