 </sup>, we assume mosquitoes to have a fixed location, i.e. there is no interaction between mosquito populations in distinct grid cells. For this reason, humans are treated as distinct agents, while the values for mosquitoes are aggregated at the cell level. The transitions on the proposed epidemiological model depend on temperature dependent parameters as reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and described in the Supplementary materials (see also Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref> in the supplementary materials). The constant parameters are described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.
