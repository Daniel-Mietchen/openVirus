   <bold> IONzymes compromise the lipid envelope and neighboring proteins of IAVs through lipid peroxidation. (A-B)</bold> The level of lipid peroxidation (MDA detection) when liposomes were treated by IONzymes, 
   <bold>(C)</bold> or when IAVs (H5N1 SY strain) treated by IONzymes. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> TEM image of IAVs treated by IONzymes (4 mg/mL). The left image: untreated IAVs. The asterisk: the destroyed lipid envelope of virion. Scale bar: 50 μm. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Western blot analysis of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, matrix protein 1, and nucleoprotein protein of IAVs treated by IONzymes. All experiments were repeated in triplicate with a representative image shown. Results are as means±s.d. Statistical significance is assessed by unpaired Student's two-sided 
   <italic>t</italic>-test to the control group.
