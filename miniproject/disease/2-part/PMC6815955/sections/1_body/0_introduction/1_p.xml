<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are characterized by a particulate morphology with the size at 80-120 nm in diameter, consisting of segmented RNA, a typical glycoprotein-studded lipid envelope overlying a matrix protein 1 (M1). IAVs infect a broad range of species, including wild birds, poultry, and humans, resulting in annual flu epidemics and global pandemics
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Although various vaccines have been developed against IAVs, antigenic shift and drift accelerate the diversity and emergence of novel stains, rendering timely vaccine development a considerable challenge
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Antiviral drugs represent an alternative anti-AIVs strategy, however drug-resistance rapidly renders those drugs ineffective
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Moreover, the presence of multiple influenza subtypes renders developing a universal anti-IAVs strategy difficult. In contrast, all types of IAVs possess a lipid envelope as a conserved component essential for maintaining virus integrity and infectivity. Therefore, compromising the viral lipid envelope should result in inactivation of the virus, potentially representing an antiviral strategy against multiple subtypes of IAVs.
