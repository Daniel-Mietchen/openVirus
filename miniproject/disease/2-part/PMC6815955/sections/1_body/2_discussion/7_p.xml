<p>Although IONzymes demonstrated high antiviral activity in our study, the catalytic efficiency should to be further improved to allow its use in practical applications. Currently, high concentration of IONzymes and long incubation times are required in viral inactivation, indicating the activity may not be sufficiently high. Therefore, the activity of IONzymes need to be improved through adjusting nanoparticle size, component or surface modification, or designing a novel single-atom nanozyme
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> in the future study. In addition, biosafety of IONzymes must be assessed prior use for practical applications.
