<p>Our work provided a promising antiviral strategy using IONzymes to inactivate IAVs. As a potential antiviral alternative, IONzymes demonstrate the following features: (i) IONzymes inactivate IAVs by catalyzing viral lipid envelope and neighboring structure proteins through lipid peroxidation. (ii) IONzymes possess a broad spectrum anti-IAVs activity. (iii) IONzymes can be integrated into facemask to improve protection efficacy. These features together provide potential advantages for practical applications of IONzymes in biomedicine and consumer healthcare.</p>
