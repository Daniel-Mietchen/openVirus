<p>We found that IONzymes themselves rather than their supernatants destroyed viral particles (Figure

The non-specific adsorption of IAVs on IONzymes may provide false-positive antiviral data because we analyzed virus titers using the samples after IONzymes being removed. To check it, IONzymes were mixed with DyLight 488-labeled IAVs for 2 h and the supernatant and sediments were collected to perform immunofluorescence detection, respectively. We found that fluorescent-labeled viruses were largely existed in supernatants rather than in sediments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S18</xref>), suggesting that the decrease of virus titer in supernatants was not due to that IONzymes adsorbed viral particles. Therefore, these analyses confirmed that the viral inactivation was from IONzymes themselves.
