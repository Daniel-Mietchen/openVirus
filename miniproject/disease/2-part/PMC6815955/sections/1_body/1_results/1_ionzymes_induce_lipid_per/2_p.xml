<p>To investigate whether IONzymes are capable to induce lipid peroxidation, we measured maleic dialdehyde (MDA) produced by incubating our IONzymes with liposome constituted with egg phospholipid. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, IONzymes at 4 mg/mL with 2 h incubation resulted in increased MDA levels up to 2 folds compared to untreated liposome. In addition, the generation of MDA presented a dependence on IONzymes dosage at neutral pH conditions (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) and reached a peak value at 1 h (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).
