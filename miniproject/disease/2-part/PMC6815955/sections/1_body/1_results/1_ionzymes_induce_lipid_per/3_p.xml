<p>Together, these results indicated that IONzymes have the ability to induce lipid peroxidation in liposomes. Importantly, lipid peroxidation occurred under neutral condition rather than acidic pH, indicating that catalytic performance resembles lipoxidase activity rather than peroxidase, which requires acidic pH and the presence of hydrogen peroxide.</p>
