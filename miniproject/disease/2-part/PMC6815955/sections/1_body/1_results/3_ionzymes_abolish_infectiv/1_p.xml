<p>Next, we evaluated the infectivity of IAVs treated with IONzymes. To exclude possible interference from other components present in either the allantoic fluid or cell lysate, we purified H5N1 virus using a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The purified H5N1 virus was incubated with IONzymes and then collected for the assay of 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, the value of Log
 <sub>10</sub> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per 0.1 mL was reduced from 4.33Â±0.00 (without treatment) to below the detection limit (with 4 mg/mL of IONzymes under 2 h), indicating that H5N1 virus treated by IONzymes lost its infectivity.
