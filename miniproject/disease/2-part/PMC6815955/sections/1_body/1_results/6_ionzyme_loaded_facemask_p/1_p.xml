<p>Given the fact that IONzymes effectively abolish virus activity, we hypothesized that it might represent a suitable candidate to prevent the spread of active influenza virus, especially for representative IAVs that have a serious threat to human, including H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 subtype. To test this hypothesis, we added IONzymes as an antiviral component into facemasks (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B, in the control area, the HA titers (Log2) were 4.0±0.0 when allowing H1N1 virus sample (the titer at 6.0±0.0) to spray on the facemask for 0.5 or 1 h. Using a TCID50 assay, we measured the value of Log10 TCID50/0.1 mL as 2.2±0.2, which was comparable to the original H1N1 virus sample whose Log10 TCID50/0.1 mL was 2.4±0.1. These data and the results from H5N1 and H7N9 virus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C, D) demonstrated that IONzyme-unloaded facemasks only offer a limit virus interception. In comparison, the IONzyme-added area of facemask showed effective inactivation of H5N1 virus. When IONzymes were added at 0.1 mg/cm2, both HA titers and TCID50 titers became undetectable after 1 h. If IONzymes were added above 0.2 mg/cm2, we detected no viral titers after 0.5 h (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). If increased IONzymes up to 0.4 mg/cm2, both H1N1 and H7N9 virus were completely inactivated after 1 h (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B, D). Together, our results show that IONzymes greatly improve the protective function of facemasks, namely by abolishing viral activity. Importantly, storing masks for up to four weeks failed to diminish antiviral efficacy (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S16</xref>). Therefore, IONzymes represent an ideal antiviral additive that improves the protective efficiency against IAVs in personal protective equipments (PPEs) such as facemasks, bioprotective suits, as well as air/water filters applied in high-risk areas.
