<p>We next evaluated the virulence and pathogenicity of H5N1 virus treated with IONzymes. Influenza virus infection induces apoptosis in multiple cell types, subsequently resulting in cellular and organ damage, leading to lethal pathogenicity 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. To determine cell damage, we inoculated MDCK cells with H5N1 virus with or without prior treatment with IONzymes. We identified cellular apoptosis by double staining with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) for flow cytometer assay. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A-C and S15, the infection of H5N1 virus primarily induced cell apoptosis rather than necrosis. H5N1 virus led to 20.6± 0.4 % cells with late apoptosis. In contrast, IONzyme (4 mg/mL)-treated H5N1 virus induced 15.1± 0.7 % cells with late apoptosis which is close to the same level in mock cells (without virus infection), indicating IONzymes treatment reduced the virulence of H5N1 virus
