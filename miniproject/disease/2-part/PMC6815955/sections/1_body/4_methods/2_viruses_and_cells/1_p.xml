 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, other H5 clades, and different hemagglutinin subtype IAVs (H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H4N6, H6N2, H7N9, H8N4, H9N2, H10N3, H11N2, and H12N5, list in Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>) were isolated and identified by our laboratory. All IAVs were propagated in 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonic chicken eggs. The SY strain was also prepared in MDCK cells. One part of the SY strain was purified on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient according to our previously described method
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. Fluorescent labeling of influenza virus was performed using our established method described previously
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. Briefly, viruses were labeled with the fluorescent probe DyLight 488 NHS Ester (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Unincorporated dye was removed by using commercial fluorescent dye removal columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Labeled viruses were stored at 4 ℃ and used within 2 days. Newcastle disease virus (NDV, envelope virus) 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> and Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2, non-enveloped virus) 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> were also isolated, identified, and stored by our laboratory. MDCK cells, and porcine kidney (PK-15) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco, New York, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Foundation, Gemini) at 37 ℃ under 5% CO
