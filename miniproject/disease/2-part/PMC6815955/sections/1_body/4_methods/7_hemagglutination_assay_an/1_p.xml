<p>In order to assess the antiviral activity of IONzymes against IAVs, different concentrations of IONzymes were mixed with IAVs for different time. The magnet was placed under the pipes to pull down IONzymes and then supernatant was collected to detect viral titers by hemagglutination (HA) assay and 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay. Briefly, for HA assay, 25 μL of PBS was added into all of the experiment's 96 “V”-shaped wells. 25 μL of each supernatant was dispensed into the first well (column 1) and thoroughly mixed, and then the 25 μL mixture in column 1 was transferred to column 2. Two-fold serial dilutions of the samples from column 2 to column 11 were performed. The last 25 μL of fluid was discarded, with column 12 serving as PBS control. Subsequently, 25 μL of PBS was again added into all of wells. 25 μL of 1% chicken red blood cells (cRBCs) suspension was added and mixed to all of the wells. The viral HA titers were evaluated after the plates had been incubated for 10 min at 37 ℃.
