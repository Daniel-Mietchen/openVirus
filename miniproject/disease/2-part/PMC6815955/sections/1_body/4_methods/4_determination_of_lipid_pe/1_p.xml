<p>MDA levels, a reliable marker of lipid peroxidation, were measured using thiobarbituric acid (TBA). Different concentrations of IONzymes were mixed with liposomes (3 mg/mL) for 2 h, or IONzymes (4 mg/mL) was mixed with liposomes (4 mg/mL) for different times. After centrifugation, supernatant was collected. In addition, IONzymes were mixed with IAVs (H5N1, SY strain) for 2 h. The magnet was placed under the pipes to pull down IONzymes and then supernatant was also collected to detect the levels of lipid peroxidation using a commercial MDA detection kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). MDA concentrations were calculated on the basis of the absorbance of TBA reactive substances (TBARS) at 530 nm.</p>
