<p>IONzymes were prepared according to our previously described method
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. IONzymes were synthesized in one-step in a solvothermal system by combining FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> and sodium acetate (NaAc) in ethylene glycol. The size distribution of these IONzymes has been characterized previously
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. Briefly, 0.82 g of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> was dissolved in 40 mL of ethylene glycol to form a clear solution. Next, 3.6 g of NaAc was added to the solution with vigorous stirring for 30 min. The mixture was then transferred to a 50 mL teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and left to react at 200 ℃ for 12 h. After the autoclave cooled to room temperature, the black precipitate was collected, rinsed several times using ethanol and then dried at 60 ℃. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai 12, Philips, Netherlands). The enzyme kinetics for peroxidase-like activities of IONzymes were also evaluated.
