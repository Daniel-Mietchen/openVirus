<p>After 2004, when the indispensable role of UL128L genes for endothelial cell-tropism was reported, several research groups investigated their role in epithelial cell-tropism. First of all, it was shown that the UL131 ORF, and presumably the entire UL128L, was required for efficient infection of Retinal Pigmented Epithelial Cells (ARPE)-19 retinal pigmented epithelial cells by the rescued UL131 gene of the laboratory strain AD169, as well as by recent clinical HCMV isolates [

Thereafter, the same authors documented that, while the envelope of the laboratory strain AD169 virions contains only the gH/gL/gO glycoprotein complex, the AD169 virus with a repaired UL131 gene carries two distinct gH/gL-containing complexes: gH/gL/gO, mediating infection of fibroblasts, and gH/gL/pUL128-131, which is likely to mediate the infection of both epithelial cells and endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], both of which use two gH/gL-containing complexes interchangeably to infect different cell types. Furthermore, it was shown that HCMV entry into epithelial cells and endothelial cells depends on genes belonging to the UL128-UL150 cluster and occurs by endocytosis and low pH-dependent fusion, unlike the pH-independent fusion of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane that occurs in fibroblasts [
