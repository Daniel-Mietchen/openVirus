<p>The mechanism of virus entry was definitively clarified in 2008 when, using HCMV mutants lacking UL128-131 gene products and non-replicating adenovirus vectors expressing gH, gL, pUL128, pUL130, and pUL131, it was shown that the export of gH/gL-containing complexes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and cell surface was significantly increased when all three UL128, UL130, and UL131 gene products were co-expressed with gH/gL. Thus, it was concluded that all three gene products must bind to gH/gL in order to produce the gH/gL/pUL128-131 pentameric complex (PC) utilized for entry into epithelial cells and endothelial cells [
