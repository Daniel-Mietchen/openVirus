<p>Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based knockdown of Nrp2 in ARPE-19 also markedly reduced HCMV infection. On the contrary, Nrp2 knockdown had only a limited effect on MRC-9 infection, which is consistent with the evidence that both Nrp2 and PDGFRα receptors can mediate fibroblast infection, with PDGFRα playing a major role.</p>
