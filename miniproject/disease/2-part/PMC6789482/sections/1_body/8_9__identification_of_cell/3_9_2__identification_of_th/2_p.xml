<p>The identification of Nrp2 as an HCMV receptor was carried out by means of a new high-throughput methodology that allowed Ciferri and colleagues to study the interactions of human surface-expressed single transmembrane receptors with recombinant viral proteins, such as HCMV TC and PC, within a wide range of affinities (nM–µM) and with a high signal-to-noise ratio [

To this end, nearly all (n = 1297) single transmembrane receptors were cloned as extracellular domains and fused to a C-terminal human IgG1 Fc tag to allow binding of recombinant receptors to a ProteinA surface-coated or sensor-coated solid phase. To enhance the binding avidity, the C-terminal region of gH was replaced with the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) scaffold to allow for TC/PC oligomerization, and an enzymatic reporter (β-lactamase) was used to detect viral protein binding to the immobilized single transmembrane panel. The subsequent methodological steps leading to the final identification of cellular receptors for both the TC and PC are as follows.
