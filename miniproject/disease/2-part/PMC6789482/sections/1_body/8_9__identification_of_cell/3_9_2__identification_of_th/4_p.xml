<p>Following the isolation of Nrp2 from membranes of ARPE-19 epithelial cells, affinity purification (AP) and mass spectrometry (MS) were employed to confirm its binding to the PC complexed with the anti-gH-specific mAb 3G16 [
 <xref rid="B59-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Furthermore, a flow cytometry analysis showed that an Nrp2 receptor (as well as TGFβRIII and CD46) was expressed on the cell surface of both epithelial cells/endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Thus, fibroblasts expressed similar levels of PDGFRα and Nrp2, which made fibroblasts more susceptible to HCMV infection compared to epithelial cells.
