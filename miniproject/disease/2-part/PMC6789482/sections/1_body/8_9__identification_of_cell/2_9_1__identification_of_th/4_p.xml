 <xref rid="B72-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], was further investigated by size-exclusion chromatography and EM. Size-exclusion chromatography revealed a high molecular weight complex formation when PDGFRα was added to the TC, which was blocked by a Fab fragment of the anti-gH human mAb 13H11 (

SDS-PAGE confirmed the composition of different complexes, which were then analyzed by transmission EM and negative staining with two-dimensional averaging. This approach revealed that the TC has a boot-shaped conformation, where gH/gL has an elongated vertical structure with gO being placed in the horizontal angled extension [

In addition, it was shown that the 13H11 Fab bound to a site of gH far away from gO, thus documenting that the neutralizing activity of mAb 13H11 did not target the TC–PDGFRα interaction, but was likely to interfere with the capacity of the complex to trigger the fusogenic activity of gB at the plasma membrane [

 <xref rid="B74-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], i.e., virions produced in epithelial cells are thought to preferentially enter by fusion at the plasma membrane, whereas virions produced in fibroblasts enter by endocytosis.
