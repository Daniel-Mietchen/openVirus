<p>In this study, the role of PDGFRα in virus entry was confirmed by two independent observations. Firstly, both gH-specific antibodies and the recombinant soluble TC inhibited viral infection of fibroblasts by AD169. Similarly, the mechanism of viral entry into epithelial cells was inhibited by anti-PC antibodies, as well as by the soluble PC. In addition, it was found that the anti-gO antibody was able to reduce ARPE-19 cell infection, thus suggesting that the TC may exert a dual function of viral ligand and activator of gB fusogenic activity [
