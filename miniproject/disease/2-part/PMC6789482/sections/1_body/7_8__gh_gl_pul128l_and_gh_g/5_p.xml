<p>TC and PC were repeatedly confirmed as mutually-exclusive viral entry complexes required for infection of fibroblasts and epithelial cells/endothelial cells, respectively. However, the gH/gL/gO complex was also found to be necessary for entry into epithelial cells/endothelial cells, as well as fibroblast cells [

 <xref rid="B67-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This was documented by the observation that virions that were rich in PC, but poor in TC were poorly infectious also for epithelial cells/endothelial cells. This finding was interpreted as the result of the missing fusion machinery activation in the absence of gH/gL/gO, which promotes the gB-mediated fusion of the virus envelope and cell membrane in fibroblasts, as well as the viral envelope and endosomal cell membrane in epithelial cells/endothelial cells [

At that time, the trigger for the interaction between gH/gL/gO and gB was assumed to be the binding of the PC to an as yet unknown cellular receptor. However, another group reported that HCMV gB and gH/gL alone form stable gB-gH/gL complexes [
