 <xref rid="B52-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] prompted us to investigate whether human antibody response to natural HCMV infection displayed different levels of neutralization potential against the infection of these two cell types. Results showed that in the convalescent phase of primary HCMV infection, the reciprocal geometric mean neutralizing antibody titer was &gt;30-times more potent in neutralizing infection of epithelial cells/endothelial cells than that of fibroblasts [
 <xref rid="B55-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The primary candidates for this differential neutralizing activity appeared to be antibodies directed against UL128L proteins, as indirectly suggested by murine and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the individual components of pUL128L [

In addition, results of vaccination with either the Towne vaccine or recombinant gB adjuvanted with MF59 (gB/MF59) showed that both vaccines elicited epithelial cell-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), which were on average about 30-fold (Towne) or 15-fold (gB) lower than those induced by natural infection [
 <xref rid="B58-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These results were due to the presence of a mutation in the UL128L of Towne, while gB was found to possess a much lower potency in eliciting nAbs compared to PC [
