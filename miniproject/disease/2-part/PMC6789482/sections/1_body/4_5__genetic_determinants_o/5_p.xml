<p>On the other hand, gain-of-function was documented by two experimental findings. The first consisted of the phenotypic reversion of multiple HCMV natural variant strains to both endothelial cell-tropism and leuko-tropism following reversal of mutations within the UL128L. This was routinely achieved through the propagation of fibroblast-passaged mutated strains in endothelial cells, with the rescue of the original coding sequence. Conversely, none of the three HCMV mutants with a complete knock-out (KO) of individual UL128L genes was able to re-acquire the ability to grow in endothelial cells, thus proving the essential role of the entire UL128L. The second finding was the partial rescue of both properties by trans-complementation with each of the three individual genes of UL128L. Partial rescue refers to the finding that, of the three single-gene KO mutants of the UL128L, only ∆UL128KO showed selective inactivation of UL128, and was rescued by the autologous gene in trans-complementation experiments, whereas ∆UL130 and ∆UL131 appeared to behave functionally as UL128-131 KO mutants. The reason for this apparently unexplained result came from the Northern blot analysis, showing that the three genes of the UL128L are all part of a single transcriptional unit [

Thus, deletion of UL131 also impairs the transcription of the downstream genes UL130 and UL128, and deletion of UL130 impairs transcription of UL128. Conversely, deletion of UL128 preserves the transcription of the upstream genes UL131 and UL130 and can be rescued by trans-complementation with UL128.
