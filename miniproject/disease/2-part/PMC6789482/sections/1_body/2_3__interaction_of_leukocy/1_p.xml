<p>The in vivo findings reported above, as well as previous reports claiming bidirectional transmission of infectious cytomegalovirus between monocytes and vascular endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], prompted us to investigate the transmission of HCMV from infected endothelial cells to leukocytes (both PMNLs and monocytes) in vitro. However, our efforts to reproduce in vitro antigenemia failed repeatedly for five years, during which time we were using laboratory-adapted HCMV strains such as AD169, Towne, or even Toledo. The first successful attempt occurred in 1998, when, based on previous observations that endothelial cell-propagated strains maintain endothelial cell pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we used recent clinical isolates instead of laboratory strains to infect endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00070" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. From the technical standpoint, PBL from healthy blood donors were co-cultured with HCMV-infected endothelial cells (or fibroblasts) and then separated by means of a transwell migration assay, in which purified leukocytes (PMNLs and monocytes), attracted by the potent chemoattractant N-formylmethionine leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), migrated to the lower chamber of the transwell device. In parallel with antigenemia, also viremia, DNAemia, and RNAemia were experimentally reproduced in vitro. In other words, leukocytes positive for pp65 were also positive for viral DNA and RNA, as well as the infectious virus [
