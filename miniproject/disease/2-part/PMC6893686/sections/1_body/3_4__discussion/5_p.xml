<p>While the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for the five viruses considered in this study has been largely examined, European native mosquitoes (
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Culiseta</italic>, 
 <italic>Coquillettidia</italic>, 
 <italic>Uranotaenia</italic>) were poorly investigated. The role of ornithophilic species, such as 
 <italic>Cs. morsitans</italic>, and opportunistic species (mosquitoes that feed on mammalians as well as on birds or amphibians) like 
 <italic>An. plumbeus</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic>, is still unknown, especially in the transmission of USUV and WNV. 
 <italic>An. plumbeus</italic>, however, was tested competent for WNV, and 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> for CHIKV and WNV [
