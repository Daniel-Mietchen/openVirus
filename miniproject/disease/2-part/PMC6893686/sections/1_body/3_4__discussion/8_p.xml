<p>These recent episodes recall our knowledge gaps on the vector competence of native and invasive species such as 
 <italic>Ae. vexans</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> and other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species for ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV; 
 <italic>An. plumbeus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cs. annulata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. torrentium</italic> for USUV and WNV. In the future, attention should be given to ubiquitous species which could be of importance if their vector competence happens to be demonstrated.
