 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], the virus was only detected again in the 2000s [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Outbreaks were noted from 2004 to 2018 in mainland France [

 <xref rid="B118-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. USUV emerged in Germany in 2011 [

 <xref rid="B119-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. In 2016, an epizootic has globally affected France, Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The species involved in these outbreaks were probably members of the genus
