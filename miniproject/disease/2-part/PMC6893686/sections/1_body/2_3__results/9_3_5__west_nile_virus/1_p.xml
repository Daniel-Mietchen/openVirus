<p>West Nile virus (genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, family Flaviviridae) was first recorded in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In natural conditions, it circulates between birds and bird-feeding mosquitoes. Mammals (mainly horses and humans) are considered dead-end hosts [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In Europe, WNV is mainly transmitted by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. The first documented introduction of WNV in metropolitan France dates from 1962, in Camargue [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The vector incriminated in 1964 was

 <xref rid="B99-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. During the following 40 years, WNV did not cause any human cases in France, and a low prevalence of antibodies was observed in human and equine populations during the 1970s [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The number of cases reported to the ECDC for 2018 was exceptionally high [
