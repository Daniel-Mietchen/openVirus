<p>Usutu virus (genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, family Flaviviridae) was initially isolated in South Africa in 1959 [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. USUV was considered as exclusively transmitted in Africa until the first European outbreak occurred in Italy in 1996 [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Since then, USUV emerged in five countries studied in this paper (Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, and The Netherlands) [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. USUV antibodies have been detected in resident and migratory birds in each country of our area of concern [

 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The first human cases were reported in Africa in 1981 [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and the first human neuroinvasive cases were reported in Italy in 2009 [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. USUV is transmitted in Europe by 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The reservoir hosts of USUV are migratory and resident birds. USUV or antibodies have been detected in 58 bird species belonging to 26 families and 13 orders [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Blackbirds (
 <italic>Turdus merula</italic>) seem to have the highest mortality rate among bird species affected by USUV [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. An exhaustive review about WNV and USUV has been published [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-01059" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens s.l.</italic> from The Netherlands and the UK have been tested as competent for USUV strains, Bologna 2009 and SAAR-1776 [
