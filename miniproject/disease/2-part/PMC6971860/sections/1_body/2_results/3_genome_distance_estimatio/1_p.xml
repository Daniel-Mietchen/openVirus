<p id="Par27">The similarities between the gene sequences are shown via three parameters, including Mash-distance, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value, and matching hashes. The lower the distance (Mash-distance), the higher the number of k-mer (matching-hashes) groups, implying a greater level of nucleotide similarity between the 2017 DENV1 genomes and reference genomes. The data of Mash-distance, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value, and matching hashes were presented in the box chart of Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). The results of comparing similarity between 72 DENV1 with 47 reference samples showed that the DENV1 viruses in the present study were at the lowest distance from the DENV1 in Vietnam in 2007 and 2008 (distance, 0.013–0.017), followed by DENV1 strains circulating in Cambodia in 2006, 2008, and Thailand in 2001 (distance, 0.018–0.021), and other DENV1 strains in Southeast Asia and South Asia (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). Several DENV1 strains circulated in distant geographic areas, such as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, the USA, and Columbia and exhibited a large gap with the DENV1 strains in Vietnam in 2017. Especially, DENV1 strains causing diseases in some neighboring countries, such as China (2006), Indonesia (1998), Brunei (2005, 2006), Malaysia (1972), Singapore (2004, 2013), and Myanmar (1976), revealed very high distances with the strains of the present study.
