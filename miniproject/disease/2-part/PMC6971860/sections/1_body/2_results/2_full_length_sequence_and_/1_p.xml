<p id="Par25">The sequencing results of the 72 DENV1 virus are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1. The average coverage of each segment of the gene encodes for 10 highly valuable viral proteins. The smallest value falls to around 300×, whereas the maximum value reaches to more than 20,000×. The gene segment encodes for three structural proteins, especially the E protein, with repeatability above 1000×. This increases accuracy when analyzing small changes in the gene. In addition, the rest of the genome encodes seven non-structural proteins that were completely sequenced. In particular, the gene segment of NS1 plays an important role in the replication of DENV RNA with wide repeatability, ranging from 800 to 8000 × .
