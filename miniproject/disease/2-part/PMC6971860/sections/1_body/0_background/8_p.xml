<p id="Par16">Here, we sequenced the complete genome of 72 DENV-1 strains circulating in the unusual outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever 2017 in Northern Vietnam. We also analyzed the genetic variants and genetic relationships of these strains with others that circulated in Vietnam as well as in Southeast Asia and around the world previously. We believe the data obtained from this research will provide significant evidence to enhance our knowledge on the circulation and genetic evolutionary characteristics of DENV in Vietnam.</p>
