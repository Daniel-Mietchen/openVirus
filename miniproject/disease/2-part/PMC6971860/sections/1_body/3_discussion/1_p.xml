<p id="Par30">Previous studies involving genome analysis on the DENV revealed that genetic alteration may lead to a change in the properties and characteristics of the virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We aimed to investigate the amino acid substitutions in the genome of the DENV that caused the large and unusual dengue outbreak that occurred in Hanoi in 2017. We enrolled 300 dengue patients who tested positive for NS1 and had clinical dengue. Our results revealed that 92% (276 viruses) of patients were positive with DENV1, 7.3% (22 viruses) were infected with DENV2 and only 0.7% (2 viruses) was infected with DENV3 and 4. Thus, the serotype distribution of DENV in the epidemic of 2017 was different from the dengue outbreaks in previous years in the same area. The stereotype distribution in the dengue outbreak in 2011 was only DENV1 (11,3%), DENV2 (88,7%) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The distribution of DENV types in each of the different epidemics may have the prevalence of multiple dengue serotypes, but only one serotype is dominant [
