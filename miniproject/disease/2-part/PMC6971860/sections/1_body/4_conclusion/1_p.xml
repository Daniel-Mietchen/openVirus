<p id="Par38">The present study is the first of its kind to describe the complete genome sequence of 72 DENV type 1 viruses circulating in the unusual dengue outbreak in 2017 in Northern Vietnam and their genome characteristics compared to several DENV type 1 strains distributed in Vietnam and other parts of the world previously. We believe that these results constitute an important database to elucidate the mechanism of dengue hemorrhagic fever, genetic characteristics of the virus, and the development of dengue vaccine in Vietnam.</p>
