  <p>Optimization of cell-based influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay in a high-throughput screen system. 293T cells transiently expressing viral RdRp proteins (PB2, PB1, PA) and NP, together with a minigenome RNA carrying the firefly luciferase gene, were seeded into 96-well plates (16 replicates) and subjected to a luciferase assay at the indicated times post transfection. The signal-to-background (S/B) ratios, coefficient of variations (CVs), as well as the Zâ€™ factors for each batch of data, were calculated.</p>
