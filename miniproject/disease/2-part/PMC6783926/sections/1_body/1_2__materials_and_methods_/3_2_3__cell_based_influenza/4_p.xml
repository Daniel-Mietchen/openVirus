<p>For dose-response analysis, 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and the firefly luciferase gene-encoding influenza viral minigenome. After 4 h of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, re-suspended with fresh DMEM, and seeded into white, flat-bottom, 96-well CulturPlate (PerkinElmer) at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 80 µL assay medium, followed by adding each compound in 20 µL assay medium per well, resulting in final concentrations of 20–2.5 µM (0.2% DMSO) for each compound by 2-fold dilutions. After 24 h of incubation, the firefly luciferase expressions were determined as described above.</p>
