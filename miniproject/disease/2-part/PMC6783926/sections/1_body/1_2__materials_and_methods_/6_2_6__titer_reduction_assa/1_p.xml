<p>Monolayers of MDCK cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with the influenza A PR8 virus at an MOI of 0.01. After 2 h of incubation, Opti-MEM containing 2 µg/mL of TPCK-trypsin as well as various concentrations of JL-5001 or JL-5002 were added. DMSO and baloxavir acid were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and supernatants were harvested for virus titration.</p>
