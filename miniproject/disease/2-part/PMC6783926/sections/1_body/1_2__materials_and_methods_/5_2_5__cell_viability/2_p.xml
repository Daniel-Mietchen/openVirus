<p>Cell viability was assessed by using the ATPlite 1step cell viability assay kit (PerkinElmer), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Briefly, a volume of ATPlite reagent equal to that of the culture media was added to cells in each well. Plates were shaken on a plate shaker for two min to induce cell lysis, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and subjected to luminescence measurement.</p>
