<p>In summary, our study reports a simple and robust parallel HTS strategy by performing a target (RdRp)-based and a phenotypic (by employing a reporter influenza virus) screen sequentially, to identify influenza inhibitors targeting virus RNA transcription/replication. A pilot screen of a compound library from natural products has identified JL-5001 as a candidate antiviral targeting RdRp. Our work demonstrates that this strategy is a powerful approach to identify influenza A virus inhibitors targeting RdRp and other steps in viral replication. </p>
