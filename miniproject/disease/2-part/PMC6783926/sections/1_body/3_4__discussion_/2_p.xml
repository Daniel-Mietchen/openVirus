<p>For the influenza A virus, either phenotypic screens and target-based approaches are routinely employed for identification of novel antivirals against viral infections [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Traditionally, phenotypic screens usually use cytopathic effects (CPE) protection as the major assay, while recently replication-competent reporter IAVs have been developed to assess virus replication, providing simple and robust approaches for HTS campaigns [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although these target (RdRp)-based screens are convenient and reliable, there are several potential pitfalls. First, the reconstituted vRNP may not perfectly reflect the nature of the infection process. Second, hits based on these screening systems may interfere with the PolI transcription machinery. Therefore, some hit candidates may fail when tested using infectious IAVs.
