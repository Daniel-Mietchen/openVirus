<p>The influenza virus RdRp is a heterotrimer (comprised of PA, PB2, and PB1), which plays an essential role in viral transcription and replication. The major role attributed to PA during influenza virus infection is the endonuclease activity upon “cap-snatching” for viral transcription initiation in the nucleus of a host cell [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PB2 contains the cap-binding domain, which recognizes the capped structure on nascent host mRNAs to be cleaved by PA [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PB1 is the RNA polymerizing subunit of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase [

It is thought that the RdRp activity is a promising target for novel antivirals, and recent progress in understanding the structure and functions of influenza polymerase complex has facilitated the identification of inhibitors targeting either individual component of the complex or subunits interactions [
