<p>The effects of JL-5001 and JL-5002 on the in vitro replication of the wild-type IAV PR8 strain were further assessed, in order to exclude the possibility that JL-501 and JL-5002 were luciferase inhibitors. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f005">Figure 5</xref>d shows, both JL-5001 and baloxavir acid significantly inhibited virus replication, while JL-5002 reduced virus replication by only twofold at 5 Î¼M (
