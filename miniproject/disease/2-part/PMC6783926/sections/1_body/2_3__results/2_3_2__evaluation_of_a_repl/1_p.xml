<p>A phenotypic screening assay was developed using a replication-competent recombinant influenza A virus expressing the 
 <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase (Gluc), PR8-Gluc [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To determine the dynamic range of the Gluc signal in the reporter assay, various MOIs were used to infect the MDCK cells, and luciferase signals of the infected cells were measured at 24 h and 36 h p.i.. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00826-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, upon infection with an MOI of 0.01 (tested at 36 h p.i.), this assay produced an S/B ratio of 18.0 Â± 1.7, which is comparable to that of the other HTS assays reported [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although infection at MOIs of 0.1 or 1 could achieve higher S/B ratios (43.6 to 65.4), we observed that infection with higher MOIs often led to less sensitivity in inhibitor identification. Therefore, infection at an MOI of 0.01 for 36 h was chosen for HTS development.
