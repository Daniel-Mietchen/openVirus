<p>A similar unbiased study investigating the proteome of ZIKV-infected iPSC-derived human neuronal progenitors, confirmed specific downregulation of neuronal factors upon ZIKV infection, as well as activation of general antiviral response pathways, such as upregulation of type-I interferon stimulated genes (e.g., STAT1, MX1, OAS3, IFIT1) [

Interestingly, this approach was also used to investigate early changes occurring in ZIKV-infected or NS4B-transduced hNPC at the onset of neuronal differentiation, revealing specific downregulation of factors involved in neuronal differentiation as well as proteins associated with neurological diseases, such as DOK3 and SUMO2, thereby revealing potential targets deregulated during neurogenesis. Importantly, in line with previous studies pointing to a role of NS4A and NS4B in inhibition of neurogenesis and deregulation of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], this study also identified shared targets deregulated both by ZIKV infection and NS4B expression (e.g., MAP2, -6, DPYSL3, -5, CNTN2).
