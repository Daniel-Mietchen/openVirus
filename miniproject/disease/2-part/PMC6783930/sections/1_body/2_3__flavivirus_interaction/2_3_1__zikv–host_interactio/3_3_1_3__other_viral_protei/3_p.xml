<p>An important aspect is that AP-LC-MS/MS often identifies protein complexes rather than binary proteinâ€“protein interactions. This is also illustrated in an interactome study of DENV-NS1 [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] in the context of a fully replicating virus. The authors employed three different cell lines (Raji, Hela and HAP1) to exploit similarities and specificities of 
 <italic>bona fide</italic> interactors in diverse cellular backgrounds as a selection criterion to pinpoint targets relevant for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infections. This study identified a strong enrichment of the CCT complex (cytosolic chaperonin-containing T complex), and subunits of the OST (oligosaccharyl transferase) complex such as DDOST, STT3A, STT3B and RPN2, in the NS1 interactome. Previous reports identified some of these proteins as host-dependency or druggable targets in genetic [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and drug-based screens [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and the interactome study now provides potential mechanistic insights into the underlying mechanisms of anti-viral activity. However, in light of cumulative evidence on ZIKV and WNV, it is tempting to speculate that this interaction might also require additional viral binding partners (e.g., NS4A and NS4B) or a productive virus infection, since ectopic expression of NS1 does not recapitulate this interaction [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this respect, mass spectrometry has also been instrumental to identify interactions between viral proteins and that could explain some of their cooperative functions. NS1 of WNV, for instance, interacts with NS4B (WNV, [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]). Likewise, DENV NS1 associates with an unprocessed viral precursor NS4A-2k-NS4B (DENV, [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]) and NS4B of DENV has been reported to bind NS3 (DENV, [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). Proteomic analysis, in addition to identifying functional protein complexes, fosters identification of yet unreported viral gene products (e.g., NS4A-2K-NS4B). Such information is helpful to extend our view on the function of viral proteins and the mode of action of therapeutic drugs.
