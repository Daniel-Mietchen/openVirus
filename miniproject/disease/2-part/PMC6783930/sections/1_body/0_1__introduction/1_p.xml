<p>Viruses are highly adapted intracellular pathogens that co-evolved with their hosts over millions of years. This resulted in a sophisticated adaptation that allowed viruses to engross cellular machineries for their own replication, with the benefit to encode their genetic information with high efficiency. However, this strict dependency on cellular factors comes with the obligation to replicate intracellularly and the requirement of intimate interactions between viral and cellular proteins. Moreover, most pathogens are preferentially replicating in specific organs and cause virus-associated pathologies. Technological developments in the fields of genomics and proteomics became available in recent years, allowing to systematically map interactions between viruses and their hosts in an unbiased manner. Such interactions are of particular interest especially when uncharacterized pathogens strike in a na√Øve population.</p>
