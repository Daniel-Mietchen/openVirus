<p id="p0085">Total RNA was extracted from each tissue sample by using a High Pure Viral RNA Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). JEV RNA was quantified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with Fast Virus One-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The JEV genome was amplified using primers JE-Multi-f (5′-AGAACGGAAGAYAACCATGACTAAA-3′) and JE-Multi-r (5′-CCGCGTTTCAGCATATTGAT-3′), and probe JE-Multi (5′-FAM-ACCAGGAGGGCCCGG-MGB-3′) (
