<p id="p0075">For sample collection, groups of mice (n = 5 or 6) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU (100 μL) of JEV solutions. Serum, brain, and spleen were collected from the mice, and the titer and RNA levels of the infectious virus in the samples were measured as described below. Tissue weights were determined, and the tissues were homogenized in 500 μL of MEM with 2% FBS and the homogenate was used for further analyses.
