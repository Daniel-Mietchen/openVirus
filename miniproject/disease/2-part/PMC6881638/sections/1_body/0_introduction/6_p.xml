<p id="p0030">In the present study, we attempted to determine the region in GV JEV responsible for its higher pathogenicity in mice. For this purpose, recombinant intertypic chimeric and missense mutant JEVs in the backbone of the GI JEV Mie/41/2002 strain were produced using a reverse genetics system that we previously established, and these were then used for virulence analysis.</p>
