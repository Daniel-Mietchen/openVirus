<p id="p0160">The number of JE patients has rapidly increased in Korea since 2010. GV JEV was first identified in Korea in 2010, and most of the JEV identified thereafter are GV strains (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kim etÂ al., 2015</xref>). It is unclear whether this rise in the number of JE patients is related to the spread of GV. Invasion of GV has not been confirmed in Japan and other JE-endemic areas besides Korea. In most areas where JE epidemics occur, GI JEVs are persistent, as they were in Korea before 2010; however, GV invasion may cause a rapid shift to GV in these areas, which can increase the number of patients with JE. To prepare for a global epidemic of GV, it is important to further analyze and improve our understanding of GV JEV.
