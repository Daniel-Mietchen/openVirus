<p id="p0100">To identify the genes involved in the high virulence of Muar, additional intertypic viruses, 5NCM
 <sup>Muar</sup> and E
 <sup>Muar</sup>, which contain the 5′-NCR-C-prM region and only the E region of Muar, respectively, were produced and inoculated into mice (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mouse) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1, Experiment 2). Seven out of eight mice inoculated with 5NCM
 <sup>Muar</sup> and E
 <sup>Muar</sup> died, and the mean times to death of the two groups were very similar, indicating that both the 5′-NCR-C-prM and E regions are involved in the virulence of Muar.
