<p id="p0120">We previously reported that the amino acid at position 123 of JEV E (E123) is involved in the pathogenicity of JEV in mice (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tajima et al., 2010</xref>). An amino acid substitution of E123 from serine to arginine increases the virulence of Mie/41/2002, whereas a serine-to-asparagine replacement at that site does not alter the virulence (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tajima et al., 2010</xref>) (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). In most of GI, GII, GIII, and GIV JEV strains, the E123 was serine or asparagine (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), whereas a histidine residue at E123 was conserved in the GV JEV strains. To assess whether the histidine residue at E123 in the Muar and XZ0934 strains is associated with their virulence, a mutant virus E
 <sup>S123H</sup> was prepared in which only the serine at E123 in the Mie/41/2002 was substituted with histidine, and the virus was then inoculated into mice (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mouse) (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1, Experiment 2). Five out of the eight inoculated mice died, and the mortality rate of the mice group was significantly higher than that of the Mie/41/2002-inoculated mice. The amount of inoculated virus was also changed to examine the virulence of the E
 <sup>S123H</sup> mutant in mice (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1, Experiment 3). None of the mice died at low concentrations (1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/mouse) of the mutant, but all 10 mice inoculated at high concentrations (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse) died, and the number of dead mice in the group was significantly higher than in the Mie/41/2002-inoculated mice group. Additionally, the time to death of the E
 <sup>S123H</sup>-inoculated mice was about half as long as that of the Mie/41/2002-inoculated mice. These results suggest that the histidine residue at E123 on GV JEV E protein is associated with the higher virulence of GV JEV.
