<p id="p0130">To clarify whether the C or prM protein of Muar is responsible for the high pathogenicity of this strain, the two mutant viruses, C
 <sup>Muar</sup> and prM
 <sup>Muar</sup>, were produced and the virulence of these mutants in mice was examined (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mouse) (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1, Experiment 5). Six out of eight mice inoculated with 5NCM
 <sup>Muar</sup> and prM
 <sup>Muar</sup> died, and the mortality rates of the two groups were higher than that of C
 <sup>Muar</sup>-inoculated mice although no clear statistical significance was observed in the survival rates between C
 <sup>Muar</sup>- and 5NCM
 <sup>Muar</sup>-inoculated mice groups (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.021). This indicates that the prM protein of Muar is also associated with the higher virulence of this strain.
