<p>RT-PCR positive samples were also subtyped as 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 with subtype-specific primers and probes. Each gene segments were further amplified using several PCRs targeting overlapping fragments with cycling conditions set at 95°C for 2 min, 95°C for 45 s, 46°C for 1 min, 72°C for 4 min, 72°C for 10 min and 4°C (hold; infinity) for 40 cycles (PCR primers used for fragment of each gene segments are provided as supplementary material. Following amplification, PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT to remove unwanted primers and dNTPS.</p>
