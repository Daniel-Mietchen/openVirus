<p>Influenza virus surveillance at the human-animal interface was carried out between July 2010 and June 2012 in a multi-complex commercial piggery operation located in a peri-urban zone in Lagos, southwestern Nigeria. Samples were collected from 227 pigs showing upper respiratory signs compatible with influenza-like infection and were screened for the presence matrix gene by real-time RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. The study site, sampling strategy, molecular detection and virus isolation methods and results have been previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Out of 227 samples analysed, 31 (13.7%) were positive for influenza A matrix gene by real-time RT-PCR. Virus isolation yielded 29 (12%) isolates out of which 18 (18%) were identified as influenza A/H1N1 by Heamaglutination Inhibition test against H1 antisera.
