<p>Though the observation of host-induced selection of variants was reported for Q226R or D225G of earlier human H1N1pdm09 viruses, this study observed Q240R substitution. Previous studies found four important positions (204, 239, 240 and 242) to be involved in the specific binding capacity of HA to the host cell receptor [

Thus the glutamine to arginine substitution at the receptor-binding site of HA could also have been positively selected for preferential binding to alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid also found in swine respiratory tract. Whether the Q240R substitution is a natural substitution or avian host induced can be further investigated by culture in mammalian cells or animal experimental studies. However, if the Nigerian swine isolates have preference for alpha 2,3 receptors also found in pigs in addition to alpha 2,6, given the presence and interaction of avian species with pigs in farms investigated, the risk of transmission of H1N1pdm09 to other susceptible host and the emergence of novel and reassortant strains is high and need to be monitored. In a recent investigation of slaughtered pigs at abattoir in Nigeria, avian H5N1 was confirmed to have been transmitted to pigs that are also subclinically exposed to H1N1pdm [
