<p>The pandemic Swine influenza virus that were isolated from the piggery complex in Nigeria and used in the phylogenetic study has earlier been reported [
 <xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. The GenBank basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) of sequenced genes showed that the virus strains with the closest identity to Nigerian isolates with 100% query coverage was A/SanDiego/INS14-49-104, 2009(H1N1) and related sequences with above 99% sequence homology for HA, PB1, PB2, PA and NP genes while NA, MA and NS genes with 100% query coverage showed above 99% homology with A/California/VRDL113/2009(H1N1), A/Malaysia/2,089,302/2009(H1N1) and A/HongKong/H090-693-v20/2009(H1N1), respectively. Phylogenetically, the nucleotide sequences of the H1N1pdm09 isolates from Nigeria were identical and clustered together with global H1N1pdm09 viruses from San Diego, Singapore and Germany (
 <xref rid="F0001a">Figure 1</xref>) for HA, NA and all the internal genes. The full gene (complete genome) sequences of (A/swine/Nigeria/12VIR4047/2011) has been deposited in the GenBank with accession number JX442481- HA, JX4442482- NA, JX482555-PB2, JX482556-PB1, JX482557-MA, JX482558-NP, JX482559-PA and JX48260-NS (
