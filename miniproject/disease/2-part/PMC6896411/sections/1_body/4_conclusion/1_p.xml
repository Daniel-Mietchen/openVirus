<p>Given the genetic characteristics of influenza viruses, the continued circulation of H1N1pdm09 viruses in pigs in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa provide opportunities for antigenic drift and shift and co-circulating with human, avian or swine influenza viruses. This increases the risk of emergence of influenza virus variants with enhanced intra and interspecies transmission and pathogenicity in a region recognized as a zoonotic hotspot. This thus warrants continued ecological and molecular surveillance.</p>
