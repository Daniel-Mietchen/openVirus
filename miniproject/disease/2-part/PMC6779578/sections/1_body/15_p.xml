<p>In summary, we report a case of measles occurred in a nurse who had been considered to be immune to measles based only on documentation of having received 2 doses of MCV. Isolating her preemptively, prevented further exposure among non-immune individuals. We suggest that immunity of HCW to measles be confirmed by screening them for anti-measles IgG.</p>
