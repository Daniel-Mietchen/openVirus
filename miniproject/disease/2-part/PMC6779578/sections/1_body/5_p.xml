<p>We interviewed each of the exposed HCWs to check their measles history and confirmed their MCV history based on infant scheduled immunization and checking the immunization records provided by the KCDC, and tested them for anti-measles IgG (Liaison, Saluggia, Vercelli, Italy) using a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA, Saluggia, Vercelli, Italy). The characteristics of the exposed HCWs are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Of the 62 exposed HCWs, 12 (19%) had a history of measles, and 27 (44%) had received 2 doses of MCV. All except one HCW had detectable anti-measles IgG.
