<p>The index patient was a previously-healthy, 33-year-old male. He had traveled to Suzhou, China on August 28, 2016 and returned to Cheonan, Korea on August 31. On September 10, 2016, he visited the emergency room (ER) of Soonchunhyang university hospital, an 899-bed tertiary hospital in Cheonan, Korea. His symptoms, which had started 5 days prior to admission, included fever, sore throat, and a rash on the back of his neck. Before he was admitted to the hospital, he was found to have lesions suggestive of Koplik spots inside his mouth, but he did not have cough, coryza or conjunctivitis, the specific symptom combination that is characteristic of measles. During the patientâ€™s initial ER visit, a doctor suspected that he had hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and isolated him in a negative-pressure room. However, the doctor in charge of the ward disagreed with this diagnosis, and the patient was released from isolation and admitted to a general multi-bed hospital room. Two days after admission, an infectious disease doctor made a clinical diagnosis of measles, and recommended that the patient have a measles laboratory test included measles polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-measles IgG test. The test result was positive, and the infection control team screened all exposed HCWs, to prevent measles transmission.</p>
