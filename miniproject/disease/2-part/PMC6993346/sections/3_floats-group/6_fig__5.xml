  <p>miRNAs inhibits the replication of H1N1 influenza A virus in A549 cells. 
   <bold>a</bold> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> values were used to assess the effects of miRNAs on replication of A/FM/1/47(H1N1) in A549 cells. Data were determined in triplicate at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h post infection (hpi). 
   <bold>b</bold> Western blotting was used to detect the effects of miRNAs on PB2, PB1 and NP expression in A549 cells at 48 hpi. Densitometry depicting the ratio of PB2, PB1 or NP to β-actin for equal protein samples is indicated. 
   <bold>c</bold>-
   <bold>e</bold> Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression level of the PB2 (
   <bold>c</bold>), PB1 (
   <bold>d</bold>) and NP (
   <bold>e</bold>) mRNA in A549 cells overexpressing miRNAs at 48 hpi. * (
