  <p>Four miRNAs may bind to the potential target sites. 
   <bold>a</bold> Circular map of the pGL3-cm vector. The potential target sites of these 5 miRNAs were inserted into the Bgl II and Kpn I sites. pRL-TK vector was cotransfected to keep the balance of each group. 
   <bold>b</bold> The relative luciferase activity from pGL3-cm reporter vector and pRL-TK vector. The relative luciferase activity of negative control miRNA transfected group was normalized to 1. The miRNAs which downregulated luciferase expressions by 30% or more, compared to the negative control group, were selected for further research. * (
