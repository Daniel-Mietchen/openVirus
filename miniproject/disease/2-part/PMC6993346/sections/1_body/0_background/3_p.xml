<p id="Par21">In summary, some cellular miRNAs may have direct antiviral effects in addition to its known cellular functions, indicating that miRNAs can be developed as a new effective therapeutic strategy to subdue viral infections. However, the broad-spectrum antiviral property of miRNAs had not been studied before. Here, we developed a broad-spectrum antiviral miRNA screening strategy to screen cellular miRNAs that both effectively and universally inhibited the replication of IAV. miRanda software was used to predict the potentially bindings between all human mature miRNAs (2656 records) and all human IAV strains (28,124 records). Five cellular miRNAs that universally target PB1, PB2, PA or NP gene of IAV were selected. To determine the antiviral effectiveness of these miRNAs, the performance of inhibiting target viral protein expression and virus replication was evaluated. Finally, we found miR-188-3p, potentially targeting 99.96% of human IAVs, could effectively repress IAV (H1N1, H5N6 and H7N9) replication in infected A549 cells by targeting PB2 mRNA, suggesting that cellular miR-188-3p may be a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit IAV infection.</p>
