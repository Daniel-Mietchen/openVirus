<p id="Par20">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of ~ 22 nucleotides (nt) small regulatory non-coding RNA that are conserved expressed by animals, plants and viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. They were reported to play a pivotal role in gene regulation by repressing or degrading target mRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and participate in various cellular process, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, homeostasis, and tumorigenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recently, it has been found that miRNAs also implicated in the regulation of virus invasion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Lecellier et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] reported that miR-32 effectively restricted the accumulation of the retrovirus primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) in human cells. Huang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] reported that the 3′ ends of HIV-1 messenger RNAs were targeted by a cluster of cellular miRNAs including miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223 and miR-382, contributing to HIV-1 latency. Song et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that miR-323, miR-491, and miR-654 inhibit replication of the H1N1 influenza A virus through binding to the same conserved region of the PB1 gene. Let-7c [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] was found to regulate influenza virus replication through the degradation of viral gene (+) cDNA by matching the 3’UTR of the M1(+) RNA. Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> miR-204 and miR-4331 negatively regulate swine H1N1/2009 IAV replication by targeting viral HA and NS, respectively. miR-127-3p, miR-486-5p and miR-593-5p were found to target at least one viral gene segment of both the human seasonal influenza H3N2 and PR8 (H1N1) virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. miR-122 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] is essential for hepatitis C virus replication in liver, and Lanford et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found that treatment of chronically infected chimpanzees with anti-miR-122 leads to long-lasting suppression of HCV viremia, with no evidence of viral resistance or side effects in the treated animals.
