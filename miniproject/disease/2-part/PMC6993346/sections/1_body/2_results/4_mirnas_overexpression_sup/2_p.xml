<p id="Par36">In recent years, more and more highly pathogenic avian IAV crossed the interspecies barrier causing sporadic infections in humans with high fatality rate, such as H7N9 and H5N6. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the typical human-infected strains, A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9), A/Shanghai/1/2013(H7N9), A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9) and A/Yunnan/0127/2015(H5N6) showed a higher binding strength with miR-188-3p than FM47. Because these human strains were not available in the present study, a quail H7N9 and a chicken H5N6 [

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1, miR-188-3p significantly lowered QA07 and CK918 titers by 1.09 units (12.3 times) and 1.02 units (10.5 times) at 48 hpi in A549 cells, indicating that miR-188-3p may also suppress the replication of emerging human-infected influenza A virus, such as H7N9 and H5N6 subtype.
