<p id="Par34">To further investigate whether miRNAs could regulate the expression of corresponding viral protein, we constructed pcDNA3.1-PB2, pcDNA3.1-PB1 and pcDNA3.1-NP vectors carrying CDS of PB2, PB1 and NP, respectively. HEK-293 T cells were contransfected with pcDNA3.1, miRNA mimics or the scramble control. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> (bottom), viral protein expression was significantly downregulated when transfecting miRNA mimics, as compared with control miRNA or no treatment group, indicating that the four miRNAs could effectively inhibit the expression of viral protein. In addition, we utilized real-time PCR to detect the level of viral mRNA in HEK-293 T cells overexpressing miRNAs. The results showed that viral mRNA was significant reduced compared to the negative control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> top), indicating that the four miRNAs downregulated viral gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels in HEK-293 T cells.
