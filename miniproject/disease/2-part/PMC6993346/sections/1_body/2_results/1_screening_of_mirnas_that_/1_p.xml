<p id="Par32">It is well known that IAV is characterized by pronounced genetic variation. To predict of miRNAs that broad-spectrum targeting human IAV, we first extracted all the sequence of IAV that can infected human from NCBI influenza virus Resource, 28,124 records in total. Human mature miRNAs sequence was downloaded from miRBase database, 2656 records in total. Then miRanda software was used to predict miRNA targets with the parameters mentioned in materials and methods. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts the flowchart in the present study. miRNAs targeting polymerase gene (PB2, PB1 and PA) and nucleoprotein (NP) gene were considered for further study, because the four genes were relatively conservative and important to virus replication. Targeting rate of each miRNA was defined as the number of IAV strains that can be potentially targeted dividing by the total number of strains. Five miRNAs with high targeting rate were chosen for further research (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). miR-345-5p and miR-188-3p potentially bind to PB2 gene with targeting rate of 95.31 and 99.96%, respectively. miR-3183 potentially bind to PB1 gene with targeting rate 92.90%. miR-15a-3p potentially bind to PA gene with targeting rate 94.58%. miR-769-3p potentially bind to NP gene with targeting rate 97.24%. The typical binding information was shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The putative binding sites were further verified using the RNAHybrid programs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The results of this search suggested that it may exist cellular miRNAs broad-spectrum targeting IAV strains and may be developed to a universal antiviral therapeutic drug.
