<p id="Par38">Furthermore, we investigated whether miR-188-3p inhibit PB2 expression through binding to the predicted sites. The seed region binding site of miR-188-3p in PB2 gene was mutated in reporter vector (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Treatment with miR-188-3p mimics reduced the reporter activity of the wild-type (WT), but not mutant (mut), luciferase reporter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). These results suggested that miR-188-3p binds to the predicted site in the PB2 gene and the conservation of binding sites are very important for inhibitory activity.
