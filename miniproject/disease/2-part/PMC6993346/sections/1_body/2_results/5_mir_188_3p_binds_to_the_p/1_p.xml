<p id="Par37">To further confirm the inhibitory effect of miR-188-3p on PB2 expression, specific miRNA inhibitors were contransfected into HEK-293 T cells with the miRNA mimics and dual-luciferase reporter vectors. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, the relative luciferase activity in transfected HEK-293 T cells with overexpressing negative miRNAs and miR-188-3p inhibitors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, bar 2) was higher than that of control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, bar 1), which might cause by suppressing the endogenous miR-188-3p in HEK-293 T cells. Moreover, miR-188-3p inhibitors reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-188-3p on PB2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, bar 1,3,4). These results reversely validated that miR-188-3p could effectively inhibit PB2 expression.
