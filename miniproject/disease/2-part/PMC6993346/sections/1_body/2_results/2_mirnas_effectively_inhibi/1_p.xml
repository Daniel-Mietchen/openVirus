<p id="Par33">In order to determine whether predicted miRNAs target potential sites in IAV genome, the potential target sites of miRNAs were cloned into reporter vector pGL3-cm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). HEK-293 T cells were cotransfected with reporter vector, control vector pRL-TK, miRNA mimics or the scramble control. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, miR-188-3p and miR-345-5p reduced the PB2 luciferase activity by 45.3 and 47.0%, respectively. miR-3183 reduced the PB1 luciferase activity by 44.3%, miR-15a-3p reduced the PA luciferase activity by 28.8%. miR-769-3p reduced the NP luciferase activity by 36.5%. We set 30.0% downregulation or more as cut-off, so miR-188-3p, miR-345-5p, miR-3183 and miR-769-3p were selected for further research.
