The sequence of strains whose host was human and all eight segments had full-length was extracted for further analysis. Computer program miRanda software 3.3a [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] was used to scan the genomes of human Influenza A virus for the presence of target sites for the human miRNAs listed in miRbase (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>). The cutoff values for miRanda score and minimal free energy of binding were set to 140 and − 15 kcal/mol. An exact matching to 5′ end seed region (positions 2–8) of the mature miRNA was used and the G:U base pairing was not allowed. Other parameters of the software were kept as default. miRNA-target gene pairs were confirmed using RNAHybrid at
