<p id="Par39">IAV is well-known infectious disease that affects individuals of all ages in annual seasonal epidemic and uncontrollable periodic pandemic forms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is urgent to develop novel strategies for prophylaxis and treatment of the diseases. In recent years, cellular miRNAs that control IAV infection and replication has been well studied [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the broad-spectrum property, one of the key parameters to be developed as antiviral agents, had not been determined. In this study, we combined bioinformatics analysis and bio-experimental verification to screen cellular miRNAs that both effectively and universally inhibited the replication of IAV. With this approach, miR-188-3p was finally identified, which potentially targeted 99.96% of the human IAV strains and effectively suppressed IAV replication by binding to PB2 gene in A549 cells. Our work may therefore provide a comprehensive screening strategy of miRNA-based antiviral therapeutic interventions.
