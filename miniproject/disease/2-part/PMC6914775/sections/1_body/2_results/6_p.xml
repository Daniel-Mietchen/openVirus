<p id="Par25">To clarify the distinct roles of early and succeeding spreaders in the outbreak expansion process, we compared the distributions of Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>

  <italic>j</italic>
 </sup> between different types of spreaders in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>. We found that all the super spreaders (Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sup> &gt; 10) are early spreaders and most of succeeding spreaders have low Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sup>. To examine the generalization of this pattern, we estimated Adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sup> of dengue cases in top five largest dengue epidemics since 1990 in Taiwan, including KH2002, TN2007, KH2014, KH2015, TN2015, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>. Non-adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sup> were used as the baseline to control for the fluctuations across different stages of the outbreak. The figure showed consistent patterns among these large-scale dengue outbreaks, which means early spreaders with high transmissibility can be generally highlighted by the spatially adjusted method.
