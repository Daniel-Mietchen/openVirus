<p id="Par24">In order to profile the roles of different spreaders in detailed spatial transmission/expansion process, we classified the cases into two types, early spreaders and succeeding spreaders. Early spreaders are regarded as the sources of new emerging clusters, and succeeding spreaders are those that come after early spreaders. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> presents a succeeding spreader 
 <bold>
  <italic>a</italic>
 </bold> (panel A) and an early spreader 
 <bold>
  <italic>b</italic>
 </bold> (panel B). In each panel, we also compared different methods (spatially adjusted and non-adjusted) that estimate the transmission probability from a spreader to its potential infectees. The time of the incident cases on these maps is the 30
 <sup>th</sup> day after the onset day of the given spreader. Infectees labeled with darker colors have a higher probability of becoming infected by spreader 
 <bold>
  <italic>a</italic>
 </bold> or 
 <bold>
  <italic>b</italic>
 </bold>. By the non-adjusted method, the two spreaders have identical transmission probabilities and individual reproductive number because of the homogenous mixing assumption (Non-adjusted

  <italic>a</italic>
 </bold> (the succeeding spreader) occurred in an ongoing cluster; thus, this case is unlikely to be the primary source that triggered this local outbreak. Spreader 
 <bold>
  <italic>b</italic>
 </bold> (the early spreader), on the contrary, initiated a new cluster where no case had occurred before, and the following cases that emerged were centered on spreader 
 <bold>
  <italic>b</italic>
 </bold>. Thus, a subsequent local outbreak can be logically attributed to spreader 
 <bold>
  <italic>b</italic>
 </bold> as the primary ancestor. The adjusted method (left-side maps in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), which takes into account the spatial-temporal relationships of incident cases, differentiates the individual reproductive numbers of early and succeeding spreaders (Adjusted
