 </sup>. The 
 <italic>generation interval</italic>, defined as the infection time interval between a potential infector and an infectee, is the major component of the process of determining the temporal weights of possible transmission. A major pitfall of the renewal equation method is that it automatically assumes homogeneous mixing of individuals. In effect, the temporal weight assumes that transmission probability is determined only by the temporal difference in onset of illness between the infector and infectees, regardless of possible variations due to geographical and social proximity. Human mobility and contact patterns are highly structured in the real world

 </sup>. Recent studies have also shown that spatial distance between cases strongly influences short-term movement

 </sup> and, hence, the spread of these diseases. Moreover, short-range transmission has served the essential mode of disease transmission
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, i.e., patients typically have a higher chance of infecting others nearby. Although this spatial effect has been considered in the aforementioned studies and in the transmission tree reconstruction of some diseases
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>, the effect of spatial distance on the estimation of the effective reproductive number has not yet been explored. The spatial relationship between individuals can be utilized to calculate the discriminative transmission potential for each individual (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; see the methods section for details). Neglecting the spatial variation, conversely, may smooth out heterogeneities in transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hamper the effectiveness of control measures. In summary, the effect of spatial proximity or distance should be accounted for in the estimation of effective reproductive numbers.
