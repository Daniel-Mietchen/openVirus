<p>The DENV-2 sequence BJI29-2/2016 obtained in this study was analysed with 32 reference sequences from six genotypes of DENV-2, namely the Asian I, Asian II, American/Asian, American and Cosmopolitan genotypes and included sylvatic strains isolated in Malaysia. Based on this analysis, we can confirm that the DENV strain sequenced from an

 <italic>albopictus</italic> larva collected from Kuala Lumpur in 2016 belonged to serotype 2. However, we are unable to conduct any further analysis to determine the genotype of the sequence due to the short sequence length.
