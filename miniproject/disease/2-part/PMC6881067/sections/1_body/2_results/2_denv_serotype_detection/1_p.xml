<p>Overall, DENV was detected in 30 (2.2%) samples out of the 1,389 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae (Tables 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>) tested. Out of the 52 adult 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes screened, only one (1.9%) out of 52 samples was positive for DENV (Tables 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). All four DENV serotypes were detected during the study period, where the most common serotype was DENV-4 (n = 18), followed by DENV-3 (n = 13) and one sample each that were RNA-positive for DENV-1 and DENV-2. The DENV-1 sequence (USJT8G/2017) was detected in an adult

 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the sole positive sample (1.92%) out of the 52 adult mosquitoes screened for DENV. The DENV-2 sequence (BJI29-2/2016) was detected in an 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> larva from Kuala Lumpur, which was also co-infected with DENV-4 (BJI29-4/2016). Another 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> larva from the same area was also positive for both DENV-3 (BJD2-3/2016) and DENV-4 (BJD2-4/2016). Out of the 18 larvae positive for DENV-4, 3 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> larvae in December 2016 as well as another 3 in April 2016 were collected from the same ovitrap set within site SJ-A. The rest of the 24 positive larvae were collected from different individual traps over the field collection period.
