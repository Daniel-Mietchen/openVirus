<p>The A549 cell is a transformed adenocarcinoma cell line derived from an explanted tumor from a 58-year-old Caucasian male. While this study provides some important information about how multiple IAV strains induce changes in the cellular proteome of these cells, it will be important to perform similar assays in more physiologically-relevant primary cells to allow the comparison and possible identification of common cellular processes that might be amenable to therapeutic intervention.</p>
