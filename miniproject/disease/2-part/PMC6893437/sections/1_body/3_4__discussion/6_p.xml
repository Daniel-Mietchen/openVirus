<p>Some of our observed dysregulated proteins also were observed in a clinical analysis using the SOMAscan platform. Marion and colleagues found some of their most significantly differentially expressed proteins were CTSD, KLK7, MFGE8, MAPK9 and CD27 [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. MFGE8 (Lactadherin) was significantly downregulated only by H5N1 and H7N9 in our study. Although CTSD (cathepsin D), KLK7 (Kallikrein-7), MAPK9 (Mitogen activated protein kinase 9) and CD27 antigen were not significantly affected by any of our tested viruses, other cathepsin isoforms, CTSV (cathepsin L2) was significantly downregulated by H7N9, and CTSS was significantly upregulated by PR8, KLK5 was upregulated by pdm09, but only 1.4-fold, These differences probably relate to study design; Marion assessed clinical nasal swabs and we examined A549 cell extracts.
