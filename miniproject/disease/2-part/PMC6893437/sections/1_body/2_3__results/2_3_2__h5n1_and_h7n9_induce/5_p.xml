<p>We then used IPA to compare various cellular canonical signaling pathways (

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while H5N1 uniquely inhibited gluconeogenesis and glycolysis I, and all three strains had significant effects upon multiple pathways, including acute phase response signaling, neuroinflammation, role of pattern recognition of viruses, the complement system, and autophagy. The avian strains had the most dramatic effects upon multiple canonical pathways, including Notch signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, epithelial adherens junction signaling and regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, collectively and overall, the H5N1 and H7N9 avian IAV strains induced more profound inhibitory cellular responses than any of the H1N1 strains, consistent with our [
