<p>Expression values for all 1310 proteins in each infection were uploaded into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool. For this we expanded consideration of dysregulated proteins to those significantly dysregulated &gt;1.33-fold to increase the number of analyzed molecules to nearly 100. As reflected by the numbers of dysregulated proteins induced by each virus (
