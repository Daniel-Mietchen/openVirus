<p>RFU values for each of the 1310 analyzed proteins in each biologic replicate were imported into Excel. Values were Log
 <sub>2</sub>-transformed and fold-changes determined for each protein in infected samples compared to mock samples. Fold-change significances were tested both by Students t-test (2 tails) and by Z-score analysis, as described [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01028" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, all fold-changes found not to be significant by the 
 <italic>t</italic>-test were re-tested by the Z-score. This was done by determining the number of standard deviations each protein′s value was from the population mean. Any protein′s Z-score was deemed significant if the average Z-score was &gt;1.96σ or &lt;−1.96 σ, the Z-score satisfied this criterion in at least 2 replicates and trended &gt;½ the same direction in one or fewer replicates. Thus, Z-scores had to be beyond the ±1.96σ limit in both of the PR8 and RV733 analyses. After compiling all proteins deemed significant, we also analyzed levels of fold-changes of the significant proteins, and as described below, applied a fold-change cut-off of 1.50-fold dysregulation (≥1.50-fold if up-regulated, or ≤0.667-fold if down-regulated) to these proteins for added stringency and to maintain workable numbers of proteins for subsequent bioinformatics and pathway analyses.
