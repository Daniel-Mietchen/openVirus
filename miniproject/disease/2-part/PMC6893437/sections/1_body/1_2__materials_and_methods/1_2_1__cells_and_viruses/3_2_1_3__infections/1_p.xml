<p>A549 cells were infected, or sham (mock)-infected with diluent, with each of the above viruses at an MOI of 5 when cells were ~90% confluent. Mock and infected cells were harvested at 24 h post-infection (hpi). Aliquots of all infections were saved for plaque titration or TCID
 <sub>50</sub> determination to confirm infection. Mock and infected cells were washed, lysed in MPER solubilization buffer (Pierce, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 1 Ã— HALT Protease Inhibitor (Pierce) and protein concentrations determined using the bicinchoninic acid method.
