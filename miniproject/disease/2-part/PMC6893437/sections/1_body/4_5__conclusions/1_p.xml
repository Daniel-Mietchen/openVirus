<p>In conclusion, we used a targeted aptamer-based approach to complement earlier quantitative MS approaches to compare host cell responses to viruses that have differential host pathology. We found that the culture-adapted PR8 strain had an overall activation of immune molecules, the mild seasonal and pdm09 human strains had little effect upon the molecules targeted by the SOMA panel, and the avian H5N1 and H7N9 strains, that are much more pathogenic in humans, had the most dramatic proteomic responses, these upregulating a few tested molecules, but inhibiting many more key cellular processes.</p>
