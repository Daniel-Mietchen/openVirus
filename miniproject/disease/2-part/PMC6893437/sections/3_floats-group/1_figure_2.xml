 <caption>
  <p>Global dysregulation of A549 proteome by various IAV. All significantly dysregulated A549 proteins altered by &gt;1.33-fold were uploaded to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool and each virus’ “Disease Functions” mapped. Orange color represents upregulated proteins within specific disease clusters, blue represents downregulated proteins, grey and purple represent proteins not significantly regulated, and white were not measured by the SOMAmers.</p>
