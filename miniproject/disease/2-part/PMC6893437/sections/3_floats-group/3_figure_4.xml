  <p>IPA-predicted most affected bio-functions by differentially-expressed proteins by each IAV strain. The default IPA Z-score settings for activation (+1.96σ) and inhibition (−1.96σ) were used. Z-scores are indicated on upper X-axes of each graph and by horizontal bars, and −Log

   <italic>p</italic>-values (bottom X-axes) are depicted by ●. There were no significantly dysregulated bio-functions by RV733 or pdm09.
