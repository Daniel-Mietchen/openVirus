  <p>Significant differentially regulated A549 protein networks. (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) correspond to indicated IPA-defined Networks. Proteins and their levels of regulation were imported into the IPA
   <sup>®</sup> tool and interacting pathways were constructed under default settings. Four of the top dysregulated A549 cell networks that contain 12 or more “focus” molecules (molecules significantly up- or downregulated) and that have network scores ≥20 are depicted. Red: Significantly upregulated proteins; Pink: moderately upregulated proteins; Gray: proteins within the SOMAscan panel, but whose expression was not significantly up- or downregulated by indicated infection; Light Green: moderately downregulated proteins; Dark Green: significantly downregulated proteins; White: proteins known to be in network, but not covered within SOMAscan panel. Dashed lines represent predicted or indirect interactions; solid lines represent direct known interactions.
