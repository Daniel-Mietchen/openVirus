<p>Albino C57BL/6 mice were used for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging studies. Mice that were previously fed the different diets for 8-weeks were infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU MAYV expressing nLuc in the hind left footpad. Following infection, mice were monitored for viremia and luminescence. Mice anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine were intraperitoneally injected with furimazine (20 Î¼g/mouse, a gift of Yves Janin, Institut Pasteur) and imaged within 5 minutes of furimazine administration for 15 seconds. Photon flux (photons/second) was quantified using Living Image software (Perkin-Elmer). All images contained at least one uninfected control animal. For data analysis, we selected the hind left footpad as the region of interest (ROI). We then normalized the flux values within the ROI of each infected mouse to the flux of the ROI of the uninfected mouse present in the same image. These normalized data were then log-transformed to produce a normal distribution before performing statistical comparisons.
