<p>To evaluate the effect of diet on virus replication in mice, we infected mice with either MAYV, CHIKV, or RRV and then measured serum levels of virus over time either by qRT-PCR or plaque assay. On Day 1 post-MAYV infection, we observed increased levels of viremia and RNAemia for obese and LP mice compared to lean controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>; for viremia; obese vs. control—p = 0.0002 and LP vs. control—0.0128; for RNAemia; obese vs. control—p = 0.0008 and LP vs. control—0.0350). Obese mice displayed lower levels of both infectious virus and viral RNA 3 days post-MAYV infection compared to lean controls (viremia; p = 0.0293 and RNAemia; p = 0.0007). No differences were observed in viral RNA levels in the blood of mice infected with CHIKV except for day 3 post-infection where obese mice had significantly lower RNAemia than lean controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, p&lt;0.0001). There were no differences in replication at any time post-infection following RRV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Given the similarities observed between CHIKV, MAYV, and RRV replication and pathogenesis in mice, we proceeded only with MAYV for all future studies.
