<p>We made viral fitness comparisons using both indirect measurements, genome to PFU ratio (GE:PFU), and direct measurements, competitive fitness assays. We observed no differences in GE:PFU among the groups on either day 1 or 2 post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). However, we noted a significant increase in GE:PFU ratio between days 1 and 2 for the obese group, while the other two groups remained consistent (p = 0.0169 for day 1 vs. day 2 for the obese group, p&gt;0.9999 for day 1 vs. day 2 comparison for the other two groups). Because viral fitness is dependent on the replication environment, we next sought to determine fitness differences of viruses isolated from mice fed on different diets when faced with new replication conditions, na√Øve lean mice. To assess fitness, we mixed a marked reference virus (REF) at a 1:1 ratio (PFU:PFU) with virus from serum isolated 2 days post-infection with MAYV. The marked reference virus contains seven synonymous mutations introduced in the hypervariable region of the nsp3 gene, which facilitates differentiation from the wild-type (WT) sequence. Fitness was measured using a Taqman qRT-PCR based assay that distinguishes between WT and REF sequences (
