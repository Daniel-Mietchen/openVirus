<p>We next assessed the genetic diversity of virus isolated from mice fed different diets. Virus isolated from obese mice had both significantly lower total and non-synonymous Shannon entropy, a measure of information content that is maximum when all alleles are equifrequent, compared to lean mice. Furthermore, obese mice displayed a significantly lower variation rate, which identifies the specific accumulation of mutations in a population that may be associated with selective pressures, than lean controls. The difference between virus isolated from undernourished and lean mice approached but did not meet statistical significance for these metrics. Finally, we assessed region heterogeneity, a marker of replication fidelity not associated with selection, and found no differences among any of the groups. Collectively, these observations led us to hypothesize that there may be some selective pressure in obese mice that reduces viral genetic diversity. A previous study with Sendai virus in mice fed different diets found no differences in genetic diversity in virus isolated from bronchiolar lavage fluid [

For example, positive sense viruses have greater variability in mutation rates than negative sense counterparts [
