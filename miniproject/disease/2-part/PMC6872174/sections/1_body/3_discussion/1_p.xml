<p>Obesity is a global issue, with rates tripling since 1975 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. At the same time, roughly 10% of adults globally are underweight [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Obesity has been associated with increased disease severity upon infection with CHIKV in humans [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In contrast, no information exists regarding the relationship between alphavirus infection/disease and undernutrition. In this study, we sought to clarify the relationship between nutrition and alphavirus infection. More explicitly, we aimed to examine the role of both obesity and undernutrition on infection, transmission, and evolution of arthritogenic alphaviruses, focusing on MAYV but including other important human pathogens, CHIKV and RRV. We fed mice different diets leading to either obesity or undernutrition and compared them to lean control mice. Obese mice experienced more severe morbidity upon infection for all three arthritogenic viruses tested. These results are consistent with previous studies showing an association between body-mass index (BMI) and more severe disease sequelae in humans following CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In these studies, undernutrition did not result in more severe morbidity in acute arthritis models of infection with either CHIKV or MAYV. Our use of only one type of undernutrition, protein-energy malnutrition, limits our ability to generate definite conclusions on undernutrition generally since undernutrition also includes micronutrient deficiencies or general energy deficits. It is possible that other forms of undernutrition alter infection differently than protein-energy malnutrition. To our knowledge, no studies have specifically looked at the relationship between undernutrition and alphavirus disease severity. However, several conflicting studies with dengue virus (DENV) have shown that undernutrition may be associated with both protection [
