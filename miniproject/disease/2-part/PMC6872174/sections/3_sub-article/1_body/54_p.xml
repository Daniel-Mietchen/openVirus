<p>Reviewer #2: 1) In the introduction, the authors refer to four different diets (Line 90), but only discuss three diets in the feeding methodology described on lines 140-141. Please consider revising for consistency. The remainder of the paper only refers to the 45% diet. If data is available for the 61% diet, please include in the paper.</p>
