  <title>Virus from obese mice decreased infectivity to mosquitoes and lower transmission rates.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N mice (7 mice per group) were fed either a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or control (Lean) diet for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV), and two days later were individually used to feed groups of 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Serum was also collected to measure viremia two days post-infection by plaque assay (A). Mosquitoes were dissected ten days post-feeding on the viremic mice, at which point bodies (for infection, B and D) and saliva (for transmission potential, C and E-F) were collected for individual mosquitoes. The infection and transmission rates were calculated for the mice individually within a group (B-C) and for all individual mice combined within a group (D-E) based on the presence or absence of infectious virus tested by plaque assay. The number of RNA copies were calculated by qRT-PCR (F). The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. Statistical analyses for A-C and F were performed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. For comparing rates in D and E, a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used. The level of significance is represented as follows—* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01.
