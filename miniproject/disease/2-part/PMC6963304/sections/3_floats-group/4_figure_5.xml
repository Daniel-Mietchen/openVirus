  <p>Germacrone treatment does not affect PRV attachment or entry. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) Vero cells were exposed to the complex of virus particles (MOI 10) and germacrone or DMSO for 1 h at 4 °C at the attachment stage. After the unbound virus particles were washed with serum-free DMEM, the viral genome load was quantified by Q-PCR by amplification of the PRV gB gene. (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) Vero cells were inoculated with PRV at MOI 10 for 1 h at 4 °C, and then germacrone (150 μM) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS (pH = 2.5), the viral genome load was quantified by Q-PCR by amplification of the PRV gB gene at 6 hpi. Values are represented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Ns represents no significant difference. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The effect of germacrone on the nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155 was measured by Q-PCR.
