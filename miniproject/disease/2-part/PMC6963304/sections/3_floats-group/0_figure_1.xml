  <p>Nontoxic concentrations of germacrone on Vero and PK-1 cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of germacrone. (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>) Percentage cell viability after treatment with different concentrations of germacrone (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 μM) in Vero (
   <bold>B</bold>) and PK-1 cells (
   <bold>C</bold>). The cell survival rates under different concentrations of drugs are given, and 90% above cell survival rate (over dotted line) is regarded as a nontoxic concentration of drugs. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Cell morphology of Vero and PK-1 cells in the negative control (NC)-, DMSO-, and germacrone-treated groups. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
