<p>Germacrone is a monocyclic sesquiterpenoid compound. Recently, it was found that germacrone has strong antiviral activity, as well as anti-inflammatory and other pharmacological effects potentially useful for clinical applications [

 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In particular, the germacrone and oseltamivir combination has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of influenza virus. On the other hand, there are no reports on potential antitumor activity in vivo [
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The main possible reasons for this phenomenon are: (1) germacrone is mainly extracted and isolated from plants with relatively low yield, therefore the purchase price is high, while the dosage for animal experiments is large; (2) the water solubility of germacrone is relatively poor; and (3) the lack of an antitumor and antivirus mechanism. For all the above reasons, we need to conduct in-depth research on the antiviral mechanism of germacrone, modify the extraction and separation methods to increase the yield, and improve it to make it safer for animal use.
