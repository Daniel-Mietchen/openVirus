<p>Vero or PK-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After the cell confluence reached 90%, cells were incubated with different concentrations of germacrone (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 μM) or DMSO at 37 °C for 36 h. At the end of the incubation period, cell cytotoxicity was determined using the LDH cytotoxicity assay kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The optical density (OD) value of each well at a wavelength of 490 nm was determined using an automatic microplate reader (TECAN Infinite
 <sup>®</sup> 200 PRO).
