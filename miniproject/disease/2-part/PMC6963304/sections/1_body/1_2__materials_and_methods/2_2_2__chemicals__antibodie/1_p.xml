<p>Germacrone (CAS 6902-91-6) was purchased from Weikeqi (China) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 mM. Lithium chloride (LiCl) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) (TargetMol, USA) were diluted in DMEM at 1 M and 10 mg/mL concentration, respectively, and filter-sterilized. The following primary antibodies were purchased from commercial resources: rabbit anti-β-Actin pAb from HuanBio (China); mouse anti-PRV-gB mAb (LD-DW-Z0022-2) from lv du (China). The secondary antibodies used in western blotting, including DyLight 800 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (074-1806) and DyLight 800 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (074-1506), were purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Secondary antibody used in confocal microscopy, including goat anti-mouse–FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) (172-1806) was obtained from KPL.
