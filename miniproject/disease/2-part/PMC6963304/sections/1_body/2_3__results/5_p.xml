<p>Next, we investigated the effect of germacrone on virus attachment and entry. Germacrone (150 μM) and PRV (MOI 10) were added together to cells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The viral genome load was then quantified by Q-PCR via amplification of the PRV gB gene. We found no difference in drug-treated and negative control-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B), suggesting that germacrone does not affect viral attachment to cells. Next, cells were inoculated with PRV at a MOI of 10 for 1 h at 4 °C, and then germacrone (150 μM) was added for 1 h at 37 °C to allow virus entry. The cells were then washed three times with PBS (pH = 2.5) to remove bound virus [

We also tested the effect of germacrone on nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155, which are believed to be the PRV receptors, by quantitative PCR. Germacrone had no influence on nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155 gene levels [
