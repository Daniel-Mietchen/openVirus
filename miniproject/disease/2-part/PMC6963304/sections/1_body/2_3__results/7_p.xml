<p>We also explored the antiviral activity of germacone against PRV vaccine strain Barth K61. Vero cells were infected with PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h and treated with 150 μM germacrone. The recovered virus yields were determined by TCID
 <sub>50.</sub> As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B, germacrone treatment significantly suppressed the growth of PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 in Vero or PK-1 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B). In IFA, the fluorescence signals declined after treatment with 150 μM germacrone (
