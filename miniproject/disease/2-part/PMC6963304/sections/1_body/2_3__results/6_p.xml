<p>It has been reported that DG and LiCl inhibit PRV infection of Vero cells [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Compared with LiCl, DG did not inhibit PRV infection after virus adsorption, and it seemed that this drug was only viricidal to PRV. Therefore, we explored the antiviral effects of germacone, DG, and LiCl after PRV variant strain infection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the antiviral effect of germacone is better than that of DG and worse than that of LiCl, measured by western bolt and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> at the nontoxic concentration.
