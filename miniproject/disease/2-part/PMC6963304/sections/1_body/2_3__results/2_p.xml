<p>To evaluate whether germacrone could inhibit PRV replication, Vero or PK-1 cells were infected with PRV at a MOI of 0.01 or 0.1 for 1 h and treated with 150 μM germacrone for 24 h. Germacrone significantly inhibited viral replication compared with control cells and DMSO treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). In order to identify if germacrone has a direct negative effect on virions, we incubated virions with 150 μM of germacrone for 2 h at room temperature and determined the infectious titer by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> on Vero cells. Germacrone did not influence PRV infectivity at a MOI of 0.01 or 0.1, indicating that germacrone is not viricidal (
