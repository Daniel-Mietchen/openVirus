<p>Germacrone is one of the main constituents of volatile oil from

 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The structure of germacrone is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. The concentration of germacrone that reduced cell viability by 50% was considered the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>). The cytotoxic effect of germacrone on Vero and PK-1 cells was determined using the LDH cytotoxicity assay kit. For both cell lines, the CC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 233.5 and 184.1 µM germacrone in Vero and PK-1 cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). The relative cell viability was above 90% after treatment with 150 μM germacrone. No changes in cell morphology were detected at 150 μM germacrone (
