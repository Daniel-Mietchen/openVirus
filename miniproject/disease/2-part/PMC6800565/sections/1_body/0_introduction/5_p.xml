<p>In Iran, little research has been conducted on this issue, because ocular viral diseases are treated on the basis of clinical appearance.
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Because different types of conjunctivitis cannot be diagnosed or especially differentiated by clinical approaches
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and no specific treatment for conjunctivitis has yet been offered, early diagnosis can greatly contribute to accelerating the process of recovery. Considering that identifying the causative agents of conjunctivitis in a specific geographic region can help select appropriate treatment protocols and that few studies have yet been conducted on the etiology of this disease in Hamadan, west Iran, this study was conducted to investigate epidemiological patterns of conjunctivitis in this region. In addition, the frequency of viral conjunctivitis (due to adenoviruses, HSV1, HSV2, varicella zoster virus [VZV], and 
 <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>) diagnosed by PCR and seasonal variations and association with certain socioeconomic and health factors were studied. The findings of such a study can help health-care systems manage and plan for controlling and preventing conjunctivitis, as well as selecting appropriate treatment strategies for this disease.
