<p>It seems that the main reason for high prevalence of this viral agent among the patients was lack of health care and diagnostic facilities in suburban and rural areas, as well as the high prevalence of animal husbandry and agriculture in west Iran compared to other regions of the country. Given that viral infection is associated with environmental factors, such as hand contact, early detection of pathogens has a significant effect in reducing the spread of conjunctivitis and promoting eye health. On the other hand, adenoviruses are usually spread from contaminated ophthalmic instruments, such as eyedrops shared by patients and the tonometer used to measure ocular pressure. Nosocomial-spread inpatients may even necessitate temporary closure of an ophthalmic unit, and outpatient clinics may be the cause of community epidemics. Tese factors together with low personal hygiene may play a role in the high prevalence of ocular adenovirus infections.</p>
