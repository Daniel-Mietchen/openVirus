<p>An epidemiological study in Saudi Arabia investigated 65 patients with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis with clinical complications of sudden redness, irritation, tearing, and eye pain, and found seven adenovirus serotypes to be the causes of keratoconjunctivitis. This study found no significant association between patient sex and acquisition of this infection.
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The findings of the cited studies and the current study indicate that adenoviruses are the most common viral causes of conjunctivitis, while a study on 18 patients with suspected conjunctivitis in Egypt using real-time PCR indicated that none of these patients carried adenovirus and 17 carried enterovirus.
