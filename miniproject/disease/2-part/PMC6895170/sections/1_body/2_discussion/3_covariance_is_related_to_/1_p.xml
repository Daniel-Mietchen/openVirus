<p id="Par19">The general pattern in node-degree distribution was that some networks are scale-free with powerlaw distribution and others are random networks. In fact, it was seen that two different classes of covariance, scale-free and random component, were simultaneously present and the scale-free component became significant at higher thresholds (
