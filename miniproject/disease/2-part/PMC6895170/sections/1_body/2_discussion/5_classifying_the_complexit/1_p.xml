<p id="Par23">One might also have a similar feeling for which viruses are complex: either by examining the phylogenetic trees of the evolved sequences (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>) or even simply by knowing the time since when they infected the hosts: Influenza and hepatitis infections go back to thousands of years, the youngest among dengue serotype strains is about 200 years old and HIV and avian influenza are relatively younger with less than hundred years of exposure to their human hosts.

 </sup> have clustered viruses based on the shape of phylogenetic tree and found HIV and hepatitis C virus clustered together while dengue and human influenza A appeared in another cluster along with many other viruses. Thus introducing the network based analysis may at first seem redundant. However, the present work aims at developing several comparative measures between different viruses. Three different metrics were used, two of them qualitative: (1) are the amino acid covariance relations primarily intra-protein or mixed? (2) Is the node degree distribution scale-free or does it form a random network and (3) a quantitative measure of the network density. The complete genomic data from the five different viruses can be classified according to these metrics, and an anticorrelation with the viral Richter scale and the network density could also be observed. The standard deviation of the pairwise identities in the sequence data was also found to be negatively correlated with virus richter scale (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>). The work thus raises questions on whether these statistical parameters can be used for describing the whole genome level viral evolution, distinguishing the viruses and the possibility to correlate these statistical metrics to the complexity of the viruses. When more data on viruses becomes available, it remains to be seen whether these three metrics are sufficient to classify the genomic complexity of viruses. The work also raises the possibility that by a suitable choice of target amino acids from the networks of covariance, it may be possible to destabilize the networks of even the complex viruses, with possible implications for drug discovery.
