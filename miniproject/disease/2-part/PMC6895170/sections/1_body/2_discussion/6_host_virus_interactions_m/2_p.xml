<p id="Par25">By studying the host-virus protein interactome, we could observe (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) that dengue and human influenza have host proteins which interact with more than one viral protein. The evolution of the viral proteins under the influence of multple proteins may thus lead to a higher level of randomization in the interactions compared to HIV, where a very large number of host proteins interacted mostly with a single viral protein.
