<p id="Par17">We further verified the statistical significance and reliability by (i) halving the number of sequences, which did not change the conclusions (ii) evaluating the

Although the number of connections drastically increased compared to that when the cleaned matrix was used, the statistical characteristics such as powerlaw dependence and the anticorrelation with the virus Richter scale did not change (data not shown). Understanding that several eigenvalues, not just the first one could be contributing to phylogenetic effects

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref> suggest that the qualitative patterns of powerlaw and random network did not change. We thus believe that the covariance connections observed in our analysis were statistically significant.
