<p id="Par26">By using a network representation of amino acid covariance we had seen three different characteristics in the large scale complete genome data -a differentiable clustering with significant intra-protein or inter-protein couplings, the node degrees which have a structured power-law or random origins and the network density parameter. When genomic data from more viruses becomes available, it will be interesting to see if these three different measures of statistical complexity of genomes can be used to classify viruses into different categories, with a possible mapping to their biological or pathogenic complexity. Further it will be interesting to see if the inter-protein or intra-protein couplings are related to the host adaptation (HIV) or the host being a neutral carrier (avian influenza) and how such patterns evolve with time as the viruses adapt from being pandemics to epidemics.</p>
