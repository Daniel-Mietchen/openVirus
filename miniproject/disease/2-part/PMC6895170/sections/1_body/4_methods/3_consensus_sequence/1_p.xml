<p id="Par29">The consensus sequence for each virus was generated using the most occurring amino acid at every given position. Using this sequence as a reference, the entire complete genome dataset was converted into a binary format: 1 if the amino acid in a given sequence matches amino acid at the corresponding position in the consensus sequence. This binarization or creating boolean strings is similar to the method used in Statistical Coupling Analysis
