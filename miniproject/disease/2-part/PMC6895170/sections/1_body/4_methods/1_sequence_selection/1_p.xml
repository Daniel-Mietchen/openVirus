<p id="Par27">The complete genome data was curated from publicly available databases. With the two constraints that the complete genome data has to be available, and the number of sequences have to be more than 1000, we identified five viruses from the NCBI servers (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?opt=virus&amp;taxid=10239&amp;host=human#). The individual protein data from different samples are available at the NCBI servers. However it was convenient to work with sources where the data curated by patient identity. The complete genome datasets available in the protein format were downloaded from different sources: HIV (
