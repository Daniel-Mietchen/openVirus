<p>We searched the Global Initiative for the Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) on 28 March 2018 for all available haemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled in India between 2009 and 2017 inclusive [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We identified 930 out of 1025 openly available sequences with collection date and location metadata publicly available or available upon request from the uploading authors (Acknowledgment 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00791-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of those, we considered only 625 to be of sufficient length for analysis (&gt;1600 bp). We removed 12 sequences across five State and Union Territories (S/UT) of India due to low sampling frequencies defined as less than two sequences per 10 million population within the study period. This cut-off was selected through trial and error with the purpose of maintaining sufficient sampling across the study period, without excessively removing valuable data-points (sequences and locations). We aligned the final dataset of 613 sequences using MUSCLE v.3.8 [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in Geneious v10.1.2 [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and manually inspected and trimmed the HA coding regions for further analysis.

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> shows the spatial and temporal distribution of the Indian sequence dataset. For comparative analyses with globally circulating sequences we searched GISAID for all full length (&gt;1600 bp) A/H1N1pdm09 HA sequences sampled during the same period with complete region and date of sampling metadata. Excluding India, we identified 23,144 records. We removed 1935 records with duplicate isolate sources resulting in a final global dataset of 21,209 sequences aggregated to one of ten regions roughly similar to a previous study [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]: Northern Asia (Mongolia and Russia), China, Japan/Korea, Southern Asia/South-East Asia, Middle East/Western Asia, Africa, Europe, North America (Central America and USA/Canada), South America, and Oceania. The spatial and temporal distribution of the complete global A/H1N1pdm09 sequence dataset can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. To reduce computational burden and limit the impact of sampling bias we created two independent sequence subsets (S1 and S2), randomly sampling up to 50 sequences per region-year as per previous studies [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Each subset was aligned using MAFFT v1.3.7 [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and manually inspected and trimmed as before.
