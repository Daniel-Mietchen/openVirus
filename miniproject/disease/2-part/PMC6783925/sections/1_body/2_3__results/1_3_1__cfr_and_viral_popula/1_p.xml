 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00791-f001">Figure 1</xref>a we show the inferred past population demographics of A/H1N1pdm09 in India between 2009 and 2017 alongside the observed cases and deaths recorded each year [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and calculated the CFR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00791-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The largest epidemic peak inferred as the effective population size (N
 <sub>e</sub>) of A/H1N1pdm09 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00791-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) can be seen in 2009 (Median N
 <sub>e</sub> = 36.24; 95 BCI = 11.93 to 152.25) concurrent with the global pandemic at the time. The second largest peak N
 <sub>e</sub> can be seen in early 2015 (Median N
 <sub>e</sub> = 25.58; 95 BCI = 13.74 to 54.90) with epidemic activity estimated to have begun in late 2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00791-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). A low N
 <sub>e</sub> is seen in mid-2011 (Median N
 <sub>e</sub> = 12.60; 95 BCI = 4.20 to 45.10) consistent with the observed case data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00791-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) before consecutive N
 <sub>e</sub> waves of similar height can be seen in the years 2012 to 2014. Less than 1000 cases of A/H1N1pmd09 were reported nationally in 2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00791-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), however results of the demographic reconstruction suggest a typical seasonal epidemic beginning in late 2013 before declining in mid-2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00791-f001">Figure 1</xref>a Arrow). A widening 95% BCI can be seen in mid-2016 onward likely due to the reduction in taxa available for accurate demographic inference (
 <italic>n</italic> = 28).
