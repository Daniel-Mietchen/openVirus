<p>Emerging methods of data integration in Bayesian phylogenetics have provided new insights into the evolution and dynamics of influenza A viruses [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], however the use of these methods have yet to be applied to A/H1N1pdm09 in India. In this study, we aim to utilize these methods to explore possible genetic explanations for the high severity and mortality of A/H1N1pdm09 in India. We also aim to understand the temporal, population and transmission dynamics of A/H1N1pdm09 in India to estimate potential case under-ascertainment and opportunities for outbreak control. Our results have potential implications for predicting the future risk of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 severity and spread, both within India and around the world.
