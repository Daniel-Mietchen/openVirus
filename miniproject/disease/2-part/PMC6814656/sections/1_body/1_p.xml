<p id="Par1">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the etiologicÂ agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating enteric viral disease in pigs (Lee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>). PEDV is a coronavirus that mainly infects and replicates in villous enterocytes of the small intestine in pigs (Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>). PEDV can infect pigs in all age groups, with symptoms of varying degrees, such as watery diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and growth retardation. Particularly, PEDV is most detrimental to neonatal pigs, and the mortality rates can reach 100% (Stevenson

PED outbreaks occur periodically in many countries and have resulted in great economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Effective infection prevention and control of PEDV can only be achieved through the use of vaccines. However, current field epidemics are complex and heterogeneous because of the rapid variation and evolution of PEDV. The genetic diversity between epidemic field strains and vaccine strains could compromise the effectiveness of vaccinations (Li
