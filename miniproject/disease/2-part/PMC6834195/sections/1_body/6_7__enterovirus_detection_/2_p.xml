<p>Usually, EV-A71 is difficult to detect from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and PCR tests are often possible from feces and throat swabs. Fecal and throat samples can also be frozen and stored until molecular testing [

Nevertheless, simultaneous viral testing in the acute phase from throat swabs and feces is useful for the identification of causative pathogens [

In the case of post-mortem studies, the lesion inferred from the imaging diagnosis is collected from the peripheral tissue responsible for the brain function. After harvest, it is rapidly divided into nucleic acid extraction (frozen), virus isolation culture (frozen at −80 °C) and histopathological examination (10% neutral buffered formalin-fixed at room temperature) for storage. In cases of EV-caused encephalitis, sampling of the brainstem regions, such as the thalamus and medulla oblongata, is mandatory.
