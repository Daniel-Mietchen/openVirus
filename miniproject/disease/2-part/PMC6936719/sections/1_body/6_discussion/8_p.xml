<p>Although not mirrored at the population level, our 72 pairwise tests did detect the existence of positive interactions among 8 pairs of viruses, including strong statistical support for AdV/PIVB following Holm’s correction for multiple comparisons. This finding is consistent with a recent, smaller-scale clinical study of children diagnosed with pneumonia, which detected 2 pairs of positively associated noninfluenza viruses (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Plausible mechanisms of positive virus–virus interactions include enhanced viral growth through syncytia formation of a coinfecting virus (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the virus-mediated down-regulation of IFN, which may promote invasion by opportunistic viruses (
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and the virus-induced release of cytokines such as interleukin 10, which prevents the detrimental effects of dysregulated immune responses and might lead to immunosuppression and enhanced susceptibility to secondary viral infections (
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). That most interactions detected at the host scale were not supported at the population level is not surprising given that interaction effects are reliant on coinfection, or sequential infections, occurring within a short time frame. The relative rareness of interaction events might thus limit their detectability and epidemiological impact.
