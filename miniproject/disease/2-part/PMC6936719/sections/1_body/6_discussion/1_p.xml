<p content-type="flushleft">In this study, we demonstrated the presence, and examined the nature, of virus–virus interactions at both the epidemiological and individual host level by examining the diagnostic results of patients that were simultaneously tested for 11 respiratory viruses. Our study provides the most comprehensive quantitative support to date for the existence of interactions among taxonomically broad groups of respiratory viruses, building on earlier work on pathogen–pathogen interactions in the context of wildlife (

 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and community ecology (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We reveal statistical support for the existence of both positive and negative interspecific interactions among respiratory viruses at both population and individual host scales. Our findings extend the established paradigms that have focused on bacteria–bacteria and bacteria–virus relationships (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) to the virus–virus case and demonstrate that respiratory virus interactions are not only restricted to previously described competitive interference forms (
