<p>By studying the coinfection patterns of individual patients, our analyses support an interference between influenza and noninfluenza viruses operating at the host scale. This finding supports the potential role of innate immunity, such as through the antiviral action of IFN, as early discussions on virusâ€“virus interactions had postulated (

 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Capturing this potentially immune-mediated interference in mathematical simulations representing the cocirculation of a seasonal influenza-like virus and a ubiquitous common cold-like virus, we demonstrated that a short-lived protective effect, such as that induced by IFN (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), is sufficient to induce the observed asynchronous seasonal patterns we observe for IAV and RV (

 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Such effects will likely act on a timescale (on the order of days to weeks) that is similar to our proposed biological mechanism and might therefore act alternatively or in tandem to generate epidemiological interactions.
