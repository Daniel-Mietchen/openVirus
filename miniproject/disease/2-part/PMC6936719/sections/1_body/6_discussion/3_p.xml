<p>We detected a further negative interaction at the population level between IBV/AdV which was not corroborated at the individual host scale. While IBV has a (albeit inconsistent) seasonal pattern, typically peaking in winter months, AdV typically peaks around May. However, because our Bayesian hierarchical model adjusts for virus seasonality on a month-by-month basis, it is not seasonal differences that explain the negative relationship between this virus pair. In the absence of a seasonal driver or a host-scale mechanism, it is possible that the lack of cooccurrence of IBV and AdV is explained by other ecological drivers. For example, convalescence or hospitalization induced by one virus may reduce the susceptible pool at risk of exposure to other viruses, as previously discussed by others in the context of childhood diseases (
