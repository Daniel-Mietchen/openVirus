<p>Both IAV and IBV viruses exhibited only negative interactions at both host and population levels, although the specifics differed. That they differ in their exact pairwise interactions is unsurprising when considering that these viruses are antigenically distinct, constitute different taxonomical genera, and exhibit different viral evolutionary rates (

 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), as well as differences in their respective age distributions of infection and some aspects of clinical presentation (

 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Furthermore, these viruses exhibit inconsistent patterns of cocirculation (
