<p>Individuals were assumed to acquire primary infections at rate β (days
 <sup>−1</sup>), assuming frequency-dependent transmission, and subsequently transition from susceptible (S) to an infectious refractory phase (I). Infected individuals were assumed not to be susceptible to further infections with the primary infecting virus. Our assumption is that multiple exposures to similar virus strains are unlikely to alter the within-host dynamics during this short period. At the end of the infectious period, individuals entered a noninfectious refractory phase (J) at rate 1/γ (days
 <sup>−1</sup>). This second refractory phase was designed to reflect immune effects that may persist for a period beyond viral clearance (
 <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). During both refractory phases, viral interactions are captured via reduced susceptibility of influenza-like virus infected individuals to either coinfection with the common cold-like virus (during phase I) or, alternatively, a secondary infection with the common cold-like virus (during phase J). The strength of the interaction was determined by an interaction parameter 
 <italic>φ</italic> applied to the transmission rate, whereby 
 <italic>φ</italic> = 0 induced complete susceptibility (equivalent to transmission dynamics in the absence of an interaction), 0 &lt; 
 <italic>φ </italic>&lt; 1 induced a partial reduction in susceptibility, and 
 <italic>φ</italic> = 1 induced a complete loss of susceptibility.
