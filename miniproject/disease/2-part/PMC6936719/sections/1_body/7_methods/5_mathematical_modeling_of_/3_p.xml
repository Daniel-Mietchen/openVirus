<p>At the end of the second refractory phase, infected individuals developed long-lasting immunity to infection due to antibodies generated at rate 
 <italic>φ</italic> (days
 <sup>−1</sup>) (R). During this phase, individuals were not susceptible to the primary infection but could acquire secondary infections if previously unexposed. Following a period of long-term immunity individuals reverted to susceptible (S) at a rate σ (days
 <sup>−1</sup>) representing the waning of antibodies against the primary infection.
