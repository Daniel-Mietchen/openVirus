<p>Our analyses adjusted for key predictors of respiratory virus infections: patient age (AGE.CAT), patient sex (SEX), hospital vs. GP patient origin (ORIGIN), and time period of sample collection with respect to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic (PANDEMIC). In addition, we ensured that virusâ€“virus associations were not simply explained by independent monthly fluctuations in the response virus infection risk. To do so, we adjusted the total number of infections with the response virus (VCOUNT) and the total number tested (TCOUNT) within a 15-d window either side of each (earliest) sample collection date for each individual observation. Model variables were either binary or categorized; see
