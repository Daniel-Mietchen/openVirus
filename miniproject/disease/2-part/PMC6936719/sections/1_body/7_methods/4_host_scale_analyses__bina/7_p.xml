<p>Applying Holm’s method to control the probability of one or more false discoveries arising among the family of 72 tests [using the p.adjust function in R version 3.4.4 (
 <xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>)] yielded strong evidence (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 following correction) of the existence of both negative (IAV/RV) and positive (AdV/PIVB) interactions (see

 <italic>P</italic> values (

 </ext-link>), although we expect nonindependence between these tests. We therefore accounted for nonindependence among the pairwise tests by using permutations to simulate the null distribution of combined 
 <italic>P</italic> values. Each generalized linear model was fitted to 10,000 datasets where the null hypothesis was simulated by permuting the response variable (virus Y). The significant tendency of the distribution of 
 <italic>P</italic> values toward zero (and away from the uniform distribution expected under the null hypothesis) was illustrated using a quantile–quantile (QQ) plot to compare the 20 observed 
 <italic>P</italic> values with the 10,000 distributions simulated under the global null hypothesis (
