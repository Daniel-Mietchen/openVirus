<p content-type="flushleft">Analyses were conducted using the glm function in R version 3.4.4 (
 <xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The quality of each model was assessed by the predictive power given by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Because these data do not allow for inferences of the directionality of the virus–virus interactions, we conducted all possible 72 pairwise statistical tests in the first instance to evaluate 36 virus-pair hypotheses and present results where ORs yield unadjusted
