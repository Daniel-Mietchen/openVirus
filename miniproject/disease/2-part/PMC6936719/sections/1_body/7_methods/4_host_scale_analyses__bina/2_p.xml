<p>We designed our analysis to minimize the potential influence of Berkson’s bias—a form of selection bias arising in studies aiming to infer disease–disease associations from hospital-based case-control data. This bias arises where there is an underlying difference in the probabilities of study inclusion between case and control groups (

Our approach was, for each study virus (Y) in turn, to restrict the analysis to patients positive for one of the other (explanatory) viruses, thereby eliminating the influence of the underrepresentation of the virus-negative “healthy” population, implicit in the patient-based study population. The study population comprised individuals infected with at least one other (non-Y) virus. Within that group, exposed individuals were positive to virus X, and unexposed individuals were negative to virus X. Cases were coinfected with virus Y, while controls were negative to virus Y. In this way, our analysis quantifies whether the propensity of virus X to coinfect with virus Y was more, less, or equal to the overall propensity of any (remaining) virus group to coinfect with Y. Our study therefore infers signatures of virus–virus interactions from the nonrandom patterns of virus mixing among the virus-positive population.
