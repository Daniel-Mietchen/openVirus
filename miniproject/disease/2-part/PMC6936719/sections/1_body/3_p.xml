<p>However, despite epidemiological, clinical, and experimental indications of interactions among respiratory viruses, quantitatively robust evidence is lacking. Such evidence has been hard to acquire, due to a paucity of consistently derived epidemiological time-series data over a sufficient time frame to provide well-powered analyses, and the lack of analytical approaches to differentiate true virus–virus interactions from other drivers of coseasonality, such as age-dependent host mixing patterns (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and environmental factors associated with virus survival and transmission (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). As a result, studies evaluating virus–virus interactions from epidemiological time series have thus far not accounted for such alternative drivers of coseasonality.
