<p>To infer virus–virus interactions at the level of individual hosts, we applied multivariable binary logistic regression to the diagnostic records of virus-positive patients. We designed our analysis to eliminate the influence of Berkson’s bias, which can lead to spuriously large or small odds ratios (ORs) when inferring disease–disease associations from hospital-based case-control data (
