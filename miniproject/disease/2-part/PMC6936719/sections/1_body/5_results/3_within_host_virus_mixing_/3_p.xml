<p>As our data did not allow us to infer the directionality of virus–virus interactions, and nor did we have an a priori basis to inform this, we first performed 72 statistical tests to evaluate all 36 virus-pair hypotheses in 9 virus models (IAV, IBV, RV, RSV, human coronaviruses [CoV], AdV, MPV, PIVA [PIV1 and PIV3], and PIVB [PIV2 and PIV4]; see 
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for details). Due to comparatively low infection frequencies, PIVs were regrouped into PIVA (human respiroviruses) and PIVB (human rubulaviruses). Of the 72 pairwise tests, 17 yielded ORs with
