<p>We also used a permutation method to test the global null hypothesis that there were no interactions among any of the remaining 5 virus groups (IBV, CoV, MPV, RSV, and PIVA). The distribution of 
 <italic>P</italic> values tended significantly toward zero, providing strong evidence for the existence of further interactions (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0021;

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Only 3 interactions (95% CI = 0 to 8) were expected when applying the permutation test of the global null hypothesis to all 72 tests. See
