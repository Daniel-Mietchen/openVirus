<p>We first evaluated the total monthly infection prevalences across all viral respiratory infections from 2005 to 2013. As typically observed in temperate regions, the proportion of patients with respiratory illness testing positive to at least one respiratory virus peaked during winter, with the exception of the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in the summer of 2009 (
