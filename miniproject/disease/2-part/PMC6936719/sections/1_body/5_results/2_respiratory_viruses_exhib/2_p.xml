<p>Traditional analytical methods are unable to address all of these limitations simultaneously, so we developed an approach that extends a multivariate Bayesian disease-mapping framework to infer interactions between virus pairs (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This framework estimates pairwise correlations by modeling observed monthly virus counts relative to what would be expected in each month. Patient covariates age, gender, and general practice versus hospital origin (as a proxy for illness severity) were used to estimate expected counts within each month for each virus independently, capturing age and typical seasonal variability in infection risk. For example, viral exposure events may be seasonally (anti-) correlated due to similarities (differences) in the climatic preferences of viruses (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and, in some cases, due to age-dependent contact patterns driven by extensive mixing of children in daycare centers and schools (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The remaining unexplained variation includes temporal autocorrelations and dependencies between viruses. Modeling temporal autocorrelation through a hierarchical autoregressive model (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), we were able to directly estimate the between-virus correlation matrix adjusted for other key alternative drivers of infection.
