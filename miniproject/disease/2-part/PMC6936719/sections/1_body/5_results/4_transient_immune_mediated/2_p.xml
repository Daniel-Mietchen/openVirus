<p>To address this question, we performed epidemiological simulations of the cocirculatory transmission dynamics of a seasonal influenza-like virus, such as IAV, and a nonseasonal common cold-like virus, such as RV, using ordinary differential equation (ODE) mathematical modeling (see

Our simulations show that a temporary reduction in host susceptibility to a secondary common cold-like virus infection, a “refractory period,” caused by a primary influenza-like virus infection is sufficient to produce an observable epidemiological impact. For example, a refractory period of just 2 d caused a 23% decrease in common cold-like virus incidence during peak influenza-like virus activity, while a refractory period of 7 d generated as much as a 61% decrease in common cold-like virus incidence (
