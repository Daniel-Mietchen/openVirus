<p>Our statistical analyses provide strong support for a negative interaction between seasonal IAV and the relatively ubiquitous RV, at both population and individual host scales. This negative interaction may be driven by virus competition for susceptible cells, for example as a consequence of influenza-induced destruction of cell-surface receptors (
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and/or cell death (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), or as a consequence of virus-induced innate immune responses, such as the secretion of interferon (IFN), which can cause noninfected neighboring cells to adopt a protective antiviral state (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Such biological mechanisms would render the host resistant, or only partially susceptible, to subsequent viral infection. This prompted us to ask whether a short-lived, host-scale phenomenon could explain the prominent declines in the prevalence of RV among the patient population during peak influenza activity (
