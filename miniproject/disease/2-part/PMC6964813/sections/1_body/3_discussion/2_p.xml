<p>The difference in refractory levels in the homozygous versus heterozygous mosquitoes also suggests that the refractory phenotype is particularly sensitive to scFv antibody expression levels, a phenomenon previously observed with anti-malarial scFv transgenes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and anti-ZIKV synthetic small RNA transgenes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. If this means that complete refractoriness is susceptible to positional effects, e.g., not refractory when the scFv antibody transgene is expressed from a different, possibly more weakly expressing genomic insertion position, the identification of more robust midgut-specific promoters may help to ensure sufficiently high expression levels from a single copy of the transgene regardless of insertion site, as can the use of multiple anti-DENV scFv antibodies in a single transgene [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Additionally, while we observed no significant reduction in multiple fitness parameters in transgenic mosquitoes when compared to WT, some differences in fitness were observed, and more extensive analyses on fitness of both infected and uninfected transgenic heterozygotes and homozygotes (possibly after introgression with a field-collected mosquito strain) would have to be performed before use of such mosquitoes in the field.
