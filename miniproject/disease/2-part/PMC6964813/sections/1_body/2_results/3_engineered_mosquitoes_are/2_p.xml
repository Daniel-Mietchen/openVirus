<p>For a more detailed study of the TADV-A DENV vector competence, the effect of transgene zygosity on the infection rate was determined by exposing additional adult females (WT or TADV-A) to serotype DENV-2 and analyzing the dissected midguts at 4 dpi. Results from three biological replicates revealed that none of the TADV-A mosquitoes homozygous for the transgene (n = 35) were positive for DENV-2 infection in the midguts (
