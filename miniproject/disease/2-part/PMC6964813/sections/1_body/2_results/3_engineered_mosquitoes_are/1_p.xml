<p>To determine the functional significance of anti-DENV 1C19 scFv expression on vector competence, the DENV-2 infection rates of the three transgenic TADV lines were first compared to that of WT. To do this, adult females (WT or TADV-A, B, or C) were exposed to serotype DENV-2 (isolate ET300, Genbank EF440433) via membrane blood feeding. At 4 days post infection (dpi), midguts from blood-fed mosquitoes were dissected, and DENV RNA copies were measured using RT-qPCR. All three lines showed a significant reduction in midgut infection rate (45 to 71%) and viral RNA levels (2 to 3 log lower) compared with WT control mosquitoes (infection rate 92%) (
