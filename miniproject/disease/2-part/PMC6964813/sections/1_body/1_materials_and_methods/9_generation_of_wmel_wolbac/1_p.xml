<p>Eggs of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> infected with the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel were obtained from the World Mosquito Program (Prof. Scott Oâ€™Neill, Monash University). WT mosquitoes infected with 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel were generated by crossing 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel+ females with males from the WT line, and the resulting offspring were used for DENV infection experiments. At the end of the experiment, the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection status of these mosquitoes was tested using PCR with primers specific for 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel detection [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008103.s007">S3 Table</xref>). The PCRs indicated the presence of 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel in &gt;90% of mosquitoes, and only results from these positive mosquitoes were used for further analysis.
