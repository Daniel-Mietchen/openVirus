<p>To generate vector OA984-HA (anti-DENV scFv with HA-epitope tag), the G(4)S linker and HAx3 tag were amplified with primers 984B.C1 and 984B.C2 from the 
 <italic>ninaE</italic>[SBP-His] vector containing these components [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and cloned into the PacI digested OA984 backbone using EA cloning. Annotated plasmid sequences and plasmid DNA are available via Addgene (plasmid #120362). All primer sequences used to generate these plasmids are listed in
