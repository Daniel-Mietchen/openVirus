<p>Both homozygous and heterozygous (generated by crossing out homozygous individuals to WT) mosquitoes were used for assays. To confirm the zygosity of tested transgenic mosquitoes, mosquito heads were homogenized using a bead-beater device for DNA extraction in 30 μL of extraction buffer (1x Tris-EDTA, 0.1 M EDTA, 1 M NaCl, and 2.5 μM proteinase K) and incubated at 56°C for 5 minutes and then at 98°C for 5 minutes. The first round of PCR was performed to test for the presence of the anti-DENV transgene using primers 991.3F1 and 1018.S19 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008103.s007">S3 Table</xref>) to amplify the WT insertion locus (i.e., locus lacking transgene insertion) and thus determine zygosity. For TADV-B, primer set 991.3R2 and 1018.S73 was used to amplify the anti-DENV transgene and primer set 1018.S73 and 1018.S74 were used to amplify the WT insertion site. For TADV-C, primer sets 991.3F2 and 1018.S80 and set 1018.S80 and 1018.S82 were used to amplify the anti-DENV transgene and WT insertion site, respectively. WT mosquitoes served as controls to ensure that the WT locus was successfully amplified in the genetic background. A PCR kit (ThermoFisher Scientific #F553S) with a 57°C annealing temperature was used for all PCRs following standard protocols.
