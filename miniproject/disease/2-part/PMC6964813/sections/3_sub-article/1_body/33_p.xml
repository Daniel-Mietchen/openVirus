<p>Reviewer #4: Strengths: This paper by Buchman et al builds on previous work by the group where they engineered miRNAs in Aedes aegypti for resistance to DENV1-4. In the paper under review, they have engineered Mab 1C19 as a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to build an effector transgene for resistance to multiple DENV serotypes. The key innovative aspect of this work is the development of the scFv from IC19 since the monoclone has broad neutralzing activity against the four serotypes. This type of approach (targeting all four serotypes) has been a 'holy grail' of geneticists/arbovirologists interested in designing Aedes aegypti for resistance to DENVs and furthers population replacement strategies/approaches. This research group also has a continued interest in developing antiviral transgenes in the context of gene drive so this might all come together. An important feature of this work is the IC19 scFv expression levels are increased with homozygosity generating apparent complete resistance to DENV1-4. It was a nice touch to compare DENV resistance of TADV-A vs wMel Wolbachia infected mosquitoes. The paper is well written and follows a logical experimental approach for developing transgenesis and characterizing transgene efficiency and a DENV 1-4 resistance phenotype.</p>
