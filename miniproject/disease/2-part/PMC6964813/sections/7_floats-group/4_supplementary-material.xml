  <title>Western blot analyses to probe for the presence of the 1C19 scFv antibody protein in WT and transgenic midgut samples.</title>
  <p>Western blots were carried out utilizing a custom antibody specific for the 1C19 scFv protein, as well as an antibody to recognize the 3xHA tag, on dissected midgut tissues from non-blood-fed or 16-hour post-blood-meal WT or TADV-A, TADV-B, or TADV-C mosquitoes. An anti-GAPDH antibody was used as a control. The presence of a 26.3-kDa band confirms the expression of the 1C19 scFv protein in transgenic, but not in WT, mosquito midgut samples. The presence of a 30 kDa band indicates the presence of the 3xHA tag in TADV-B and TADV-C but not in WT or TADV-A mosquitoes.</p>
