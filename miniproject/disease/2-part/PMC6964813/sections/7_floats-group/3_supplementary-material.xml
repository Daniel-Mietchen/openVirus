   <bold>Expression correlation analyses of gene expression levels (indicated by TPM [transcripts per million] values) in dissected midgut tissues from WT or transgenic (TADV-A, -B, or -C) mosquitoes without a blood meal (A) and 24 hours after a blood meal (B).</bold> The y-axis corresponds to TPM values in WT samples, and the x-axis corresponds to TPM values in respective transgenic samples. Blue-colored points represent endogenous genes, and red-colored points represent the 1C19 scFv. Comparisons between WT and TADV samples suggest that 1C19 scFv expression is transgene-dependent and does not appear to significantly affect global expression levels of endogenous RNAs. Pearson correlation coefficients (
   <italic>r</italic>) between gene expression levels in WT versus transgenic samples are reported in bold in their respective graphs.
