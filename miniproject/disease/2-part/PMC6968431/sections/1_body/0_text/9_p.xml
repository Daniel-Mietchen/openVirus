<p>In this study, we demonstrate the re-introduction of CHIKV-ECSA into Bahia between 2016 and 2018. Bahia was the introductory point of CHIKV-ECSA in the Americas and it is the region in Brazil that seems to have the highest genetic diversity of this genotype. Since the first registered cases in 2014, no new genomic surveillance data have been released. Our phylogenetic reconstructions show the persistence of local lineages in some municipalities and the re-introduction of new epidemiological strains from different Brazilian regions, highlighting a complex dynamic of transmission between epidemic seasons and sampled locations. Several factors including the high connectivity by air and land transport between different regions of the country, vector suitability, insufficient herd immunity and poor living conditions, might be shaping this complex viral spread between different Brazilian regions [

 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Focusing on the three main urban centres of Bahia, we also revealed the reconstructed transmission potential of CHIKV has remained reasonably stable throughout the years, such that the observed large reduction in incidence is likely a consequence of an expected, gradual accumulation of herd-immunity over the 4 years since its introduction in 2014.
