<p>Genotyping was conducted using the phylogenetic arbovirus subtyping tool available at

 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and then confirmed using Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogeny. To investigate the dynamics of the CHIKV infection at a larger spatial scale, we generated a dataset that included all CHIKV-ECSA sequences from Brazil (ECSA-BR dataset) (

 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] under the HKY nucleotide substitution model with four gamma categories (HKY+G4), which was inferred in jModelTest as the best fitting model [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The statistical robustness of tree topology was inspected using 100 bootstrap replicates. The ML phylogeny was used as a starting tree for Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using BEAST 1.10.4 [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Data of weekly confirmed CHIKV cases in Bahia were supplied by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and were plotted using the R software version 3.5.1 (The R Foundation).
