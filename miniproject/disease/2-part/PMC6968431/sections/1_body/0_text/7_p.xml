<p>Using freely accessible climatic data from the US National Climate Data Center [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] we estimated mosquito-borne viral suitability using the index P (transmission potential [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) for the three largest urban centres of Bahia; assuming 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-like priors as in Lourenco et al. 2019 and CHIKV-like priors with human incubation period of mean 3 days (standard deviation, STD 1) and human infectious period 4.5 days (STD 2). We estimated Higher potential in Salvador and Feira de Santana when compared with Vitoria da Conquista, with peaks in the latter mirroring the troughs in the other two urban centres (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> panel C). These differences reflected a more general spatial pattern of low transmission potential at high altitudes which typically present unfavourable conditions for the vectors (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> panel A); with Vitoria da Conquista at 950 metres (m), Feira de Santana at 200 m and Salvador at 2 m, above sea level.
