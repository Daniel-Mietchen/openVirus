<p>Serum samples obtained from 24 patients presenting symptoms compatible with arboviral infection were collected for molecular diagnostics and sent for testing at the Central Laboratory of Public Health (LACEN) in Salvador, Bahia. These samples were from several municipalities in Bahia and represented the main outbreak period of 2017 and 2018 (

Viral RNA was extracted from clinical samples using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) and submitted to real time RT-qPCR protocols for the detection of Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV 1-4), mayaro virus (MAYV), oropouche virus (OROV) and CHIKV as previously described [

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] using ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. Then, a multiplex tiling PCR was conducted using Q5 High Fidelity Hot-Start DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the CHIKV primers scheme, as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. DNA library preparation was performed using the Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT) and the Native Barcoding Kit (NBD103, ONT). A sequencing library was generated from the barcoded products using the Genomic DNA Sequencing Kit SQK-MAP007/SQK-LSK109 (ONT) then loaded onto a R9.4 flow cell (ONT).
