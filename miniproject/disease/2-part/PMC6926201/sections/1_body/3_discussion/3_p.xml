<p id="p0085">CPY Chan et al. showed in their study the elevation of serum neopterin concentrations from day 1 of fever onset with a mean neopterin value of 44.2 (2.3)nmol/l to a peak value of 54.3 (3.0) nmol/l on day 4 of fever, and neopterin remained at a higher level, with a mean neopterin value of 30 nmol/l [

Similarly, in our study, we observed that the serum neopterin concentration of the second sample with a mean value of 55.0 (10.55) nmol/l was elevated when compared with that of the first sample with a mean value of 49.77 (9.16) nmol/l. K. Babb et al. showed in their study that serum neopterin levels were significantly higher (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the first sample of our study, the mean serum neopterin level of 58.75 (4.91) nmol/l of severe dengue was significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> = .00001) higher than that of 48.11 (8.80) nmol/l of nonsevere dengue. In the second sample, the mean serum neopterin level of 65.32 (4.41) nmol/l of severe dengue was significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> = .00001) higher than that of 53.10 (10.25) nmol/l of nonsevere dengue but with insignificant raised serum neopterin level in severe dengue (median: 6.65 nmol/l) as compared to that in nonsevere dengue (median: 4.20).
