  <p>Flow cytometry neutralization test on A549 cells. The neutralizing ability of mouse serum specimens against ZIKV was determined by FNT on A549 cells. Samples of anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera were tested individually. Serum samples were two-fold serial diluted starting at a 1:50 dilution and mixed with an equal volume of virus sample containing 20,000 PFU of MR766
   <sup>GFP</sup>. The virus-antibody mixture was added on 20,000 A549 cells grown in 96-well plates. At 20 h post-infection, the percentage of positive cells for GFP expression was determined by flow-cytometry analysis. The number of GFP-positive cells without serum was considered 100% of infectivity. The results were expressed as the percentage of GFP-positive cells in assay relative to that calculated without serum. In (
   <bold>A</bold>), The immune sera of BALB/c mice inoculated with heat-inactivated ZIKBeHMR-2 served as a negative control (negative control). In (
   <bold>B</bold>), immune sera of BALB/c mice that received a single dose of ZIKBeHMR-2 (5 log PFU) (1
   <sup>st</sup> dose). In (
   <bold>C</bold>), immune sera of BALB/c mice that received two doses of ZIKBeHMR-2 (5 log PFU) with a 6-week interval (2
   <sup>nd</sup> dose).
