<p>New biological tests revisiting the conventional PRNT method are necessary for the rapid measurement of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies in large serum series. Consequently, several reporter gene-based methods for neutralizing assays have been recently developed for ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Given that reporter systems afford the ability to visualize viral expression inside the infected cells, we generated a GFP reporter ZIKV entitled ZIKV
 <sub>GFP</sub> [

 <sub>GFP</sub> is a performing tool for the monitoring of ZIKV replication in the host cell as well as the screening of antiviral compounds [

 <sub>GFP</sub> for the measurement of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies by flow cytometry analysis. The GFP reporter ZIKV-based flow cytometry neutralization test (FNT) was challenged with serum samples from mice inoculated with ZIKV. Results showed that our newly developed FNT generated ZIKV-neutralizing antibody titers that are equivalent to those obtained with conventional PRNT.
