<p>For the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT), Vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Serum samples were 2-fold serially diluted in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS with a starting dilution of 1:50, and incubated with an equal volume of a virus sample containing 100 PFU of MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup> for 2 h at 37 °C. The virus-antibody mixture was added on cell monolayers for 2 h at 37 °C and then incubated with 0.8% CMC in growth medium. After a 4-day incubation, cell monolayers were fixed with 3.7% FA in PBS and then stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol. Visible plaques were manually counted. The neutralizing antibody titers were determined as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution that resulted in a 50% residual of infectivity of negative-control serum samples. PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined from a nonlinear regression analysis.
