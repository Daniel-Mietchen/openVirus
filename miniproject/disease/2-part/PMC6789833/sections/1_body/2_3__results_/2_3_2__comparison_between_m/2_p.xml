<p>The neutralization assays were assessed with a selection of 29 immune sera from adult BALB/c mice that received one or two doses of ZIKBeHMR-2 with an interval of 6 weeks [

 <sup>GFP</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00066-f002">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, negative control immune sera exhibited no reduction of virus plaque number at the lower dilution tested (1:50). In contrast, immune sera from mice inoculated with ZIKBeHMR-2 showed neutralizing activity against MR766
 <sup>GFP</sup>. The serum samples reduced the number of virus plaques in a dilution-dependent manner. In mice that received a single dose of ZIKBeHMR-2, there was a PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> value of 130 (95% Confident Interval (CI): 93–182). After inoculation of a booster dose, the ZIKV-neutralizing antibody titers increased up to 3051 (95% CI: 2251–4136). Thus, a conventional PRNT confirmed the neutralizing activity of anti-ZIKBeHMR-2 immune sera against ZIKV.
