<p>We reported that immunocompetent adult mice that received intraperitoneally 5 log PFU of chimeric ZIKV clone ZIKBeHMR-2 developed high titers of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ZIKBeHMR-2 is a chimeric clone of ZIKV derived from historical African ZIKV strain MR766 in which the structural protein region was replaced with that of epidemic ZIKV strain BeH819015 of Asian lineage [
