<p id="Par25">Analyzing the genotypic changes according to the recent evolutionary studies reports, inter-genotype shifts appeared in Taiwan and Japan. The predominant strain of the 1998 outbreak in Taiwan was EV-A71 genotype C2 with 90% having recombination with coxsackievirus A8 (CV-A8) and the remaining 10% were genotype B4 isolates [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The genotype B4 isolates from the 1998 outbreak had similar sequences to those of the 2000 outbreak. In the 2000 and 2001 outbreak in Taiwan, the predominant strain was genotype B4, thus showing an inter-genotype shift from C2 to B4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The predominant genotype in 2004 and 2008 outbreaks changed from B4 to C4 and from C4 to B5, respectively. The same order of genotype shifts was observed in Japan with genotypes C2, B4, C4, and B5 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Contrary to inter-genotypic evolution, intra-genotypic evolution occurred in China. EV-A71 genotype C4, which was circulating in China, had shown the continuous evolution of the virus through non-outbreak years (2004–2007) to the outbreak years (2008–2012) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In China, genotype C4 had persisted through time, showing annual increase in the accumulation of non-structural protein substitutions. Continuous accumulation of amino acid substitution within the same genotype C4 through non-outbreak to the outbreak period might explain why the same genotype activity dramatically increased after 2008 in China. Similar accumulation of substitutions especially in non-structural protein region has been reported among the genotype B5 in Taiwan. Genotype B5 had also been found to accumulate evolutionary amino acid substitutions in non-structural proteins, thus causing a re-emergent outbreak in Taiwan in 2012 in the following of the same genotype outbreak in 2008 (Fig.
