<p id="Par27">For the last two decades, increasingly more effort has been placed in understanding EV-A71. Several virus virulence determinants have been identified for EV-A71. Since the generation of mouse-adapted EV-A71 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], an amino acid change in VP1 position 145 was identified for the adapted virulence. The change was identified as glycine (G) changing to glutamic acid (E) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Huang 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2012) had also found that VP1
 <sup>Q145E</sup> enhances binding of EV-A71 to mouse neuroblastoma (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. In a non-human primate model, VP1
 <sup>145E</sup> is responsible for the development of viremia and neuropathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Huang 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2012) observed that, in cooperation with VP1
 <sup>Q145E</sup>, an amino acid change in VP2 at position 149 from lysine (K) to methionine (M) (VP2
 <sup>K149M</sup>) is associated with the increase of RNA accumulation, viral cytotoxicity and uncoating in mice neuronal cells, and an increase in mouse lethality in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. In contrast, Chang 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2012) had observed that an amino acid change from glutamic acid (E) to glutamine (Q) in VP1 position 145 (VP1
 <sup>E145Q</sup>) was found in more severe cases of EV-A71 infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In addition, a VP1
 <sup>145G/Q</sup> mutation had been found to be associated with the virus’ ability to bind to the receptor PSGL-1 while VP1
 <sup>145E</sup> was associated with the inability to bind to PSGL-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. In a study done by van der Sanden 
 <italic>et. al.</italic>, (2018) they had found infectivity of the human airway organoids were EV-A71 strain-dependent. Coincidentally, the well-known position VP1–145 was also found to be a key determinant of infectivity of human airways. Van der Sanden 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> had identified VP1
 <sup>145Q</sup> as a key determinant of increased infectivity in human airway organoids. In addition, in the absence of VP1
 <sup>145Q</sup>, viruses with relatively high replication rates were found to have both VP1
 <sup>98K</sup> and VP1
 <sup>104D</sup> mutations in genotype C5 strains. Therefore, VP1
 <sup>98K</sup> and VP1
 <sup>104D</sup> may be potential infectivity markers in specific viral strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. More recently, Huang 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2017) had demonstrated the evolution of EV-A71 virus within a single autopsy case from the 1998 EV-A71 outbreak in Taiwan. EV-A71 viruses were isolated from various tissues and analyzed, thus showing the evolution of the virus within the host, as well as tissue tropism. They had identified a dominant haplotype switch from VP1-31D to VP1-31G, with VP1-31G being dominant in the central nervous system (CNS), indicating possible contribution to CNS invasion of the virus. The VP1
 <sup>D31G</sup> mutation was also found to enhance EV-A71 entry into neuroblastoma, increase virus growth rate and fitness in human neuronal cells, and had a higher proportion in the virus population in fatal patients than in HFMD patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Similarly, Cordey 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2012) had analyzed the EV-A71 genome from various tissues of an immunocompromised patient. They had found that the mutation VP1
 <sup>L79R</sup>, located in the BC loop region, plays a critical role in cell tropism and affects the viral binding ability and fitness in neuronal cells in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. In another recent study, VP1
 <sup>107A</sup> was found to regulate the maturation of EV-A71. Zhang 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> had discovered that VP1
 <sup>107A</sup> allowed greater flexibility of the VP1 BC loop and regulated the efficient cleavage of VP0, influencing maturation and viral uncoating, thus increasing viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Zaini 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2012) found that a VP1
 <sup>K244E</sup> mutation is critical in mouse adaptation and virulence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Nishimura 
 <italic>et. al.</italic> (2013) had also found that mutations at VP1–244 can abolish virus binding to PSGL-1, while mutations at VP1–242 can influence virus binding. They had also proposed that depending on the protein at VP1–145, by its influence to control the exposure of the side-chain VP1
 <sup>244K</sup>, VP1–145 can act as a switch which controls PSGL-1 binding [
