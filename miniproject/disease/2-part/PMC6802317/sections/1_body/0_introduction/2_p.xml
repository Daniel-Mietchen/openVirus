<p id="Par22">As a member of the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> and the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae,</italic> enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is a non-enveloped positive single strand RNA virus, containing 7.4-kb long RNA with a large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by the 5′ and 3′ untranslated region (UTR) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The 5′ UTR consists of stem-loop RNA structures I to VI, which forms the internal ribosome binding site (IRES). Through the use of cap-independent translation mechanism, 5′ UTR is involved in viral protein translation and RNA replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The large ORF is translated into a single polyprotein that is further cleaved into P1, P2, and P3 regions by viral proteases. The 2A protease (2A
 <sup>pro</sup>) of poliovirus can cleave the P1 capsid protein from the polyprotein. In contrast, the 3CD protease cleaved the P1, P2, and P3 precursors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The mature structural proteins can be used in virus assembly, and non-structural proteins for replication, apoptosis induction, innate immunity repression and in the shutting down of host cell translation (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). The P1 region encodes the capsid proteins VP1 to VP4. The VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 proteins form a symmetrical icosahedral structure. VP1, VP2, and VP3 are exposed on the external surface of viral capsid, whereas VP1 is the highest exposed protein among the capsids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. VP4, however, is the smallest of the P1 proteins and arranged within the icosahedral lattice. The structural protein VP1 contains the primary binding residues to two identified EV-A71 receptors, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and scavenger receptor B2 (SCARB2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Tyrosine sulfation in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 facilitates EV-A71 viral entry and replication in leukocytes, thus affecting viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. PSGL-1 alone was found to be insufficient in enhancing EV-A71 infection in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], while SCARB2 was found to be sufficient in causing neurological diseases in mice due to its roles in viral attachment, internalization, and uncoating [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, some of the residues such as VP1–98, − 145, and − 164 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], are antigenic sites for antibody recognition. The remaining P2 and P3 regions contain the non-structural proteins 2A to 2C and 3A to 3D, respectively. 3C
 <sup>pro</sup> can inhibit retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) -mediated interferon response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Also, 3C
 <sup>pro</sup> assists in the interaction of 5′ UTR with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (3D
 <sup>pol</sup>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The RdRp lacks proofreading abilities, thus resulting in the high mutation rates of RNA viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since the amino acid changes might contribute to the alternation of protein properties, the substitutions within the viral genome may affect the viral protein interactions and replication. Here we focus on the review of the epidemiology, genetic evolution, antigenicity, and virulence determinants in EV-A71 viruses.
