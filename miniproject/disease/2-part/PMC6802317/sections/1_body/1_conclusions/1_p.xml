<p id="Par30">Genotype shifts, changes in antigenic properties, and recombination events have shown to contribute to the evolution of EV-A71. Although there only genotype C4 available EV-A71 vaccine from China to date, increasing knowledge of the virus will better aid in the development of a vaccine that is able to protect against the different genotypes. Therefore, continuous surveillance of EV-A71 is required in order to better understand its epidemiology and viral evolution.</p>
