In this review, we aim to explore how genetic events such as spontaneous mutations could alter the genomic organization of RNA viruses in such a way that they impact virus replications and plaque morphology. The phenomenon of quasispecies within a viral population is also discussed to reflect virulence and its implications for RNA viruses. An understanding of how such events occur will provide further evidence about whether there are molecular determinants for plaque morphology of RNA viruses or whether different plaque phenotypes arise due to the presence of quasispecies within a population. Ultimately this review gives an insight into whether the intrinsically high error rates due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerases is responsible for the variation in plaque morphology and diversity in virulence. This can be a useful tool in characterizing mechanisms that facilitate virus adaptation and evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA viruses</kwd><kwd>quasispecies</kwd><kwd>spontaneous mutations</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>plaque phenotype</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-20-04657"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>With their diverse differences in size, structure, genome organization and replication strategies, RNA viruses are recognized as being highly mutatable [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Their high mutation rates make it very difficult for therapeutic interventions to work effectively and very often they develop resistance to antiviral drugs and antibodies elicited by vaccines [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This poses a real threat to how emerging infectious agents could be prevented or treated [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The success of the evolution of RNA viruses arises from their capacity to utilize varying replication approaches and to adapt to a wide range of biological niches faced during viral spread in the host. One of the factors affecting the emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases is the genetics of the infectious agents [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Only about 15 viral diseases can be effectively prevented through FDA approved vaccinations [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This attests to the urgency to understand the mechanisms by which viruses can overcome the different pressures applied to restrict their replications. In the last four decades, breakthroughs in molecular biology have favored in-depth analysis of virus isolates. Findings from other studies have suggested that populations of RNA viruses are divergent and favor an active evolution of RNA genomes. The quick evolution of RNA genomes could lead to variant sequences that differ by one or two nucleotides from the wild-type sequence in the population. It is further suggested that each viral RNA population of 10<sup>9</sup> or more infectious particles was always a mixture of various variants despite being isolated from a single clone [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Such heterogeneity within the virus population could be explained by the existence of not a single genotype within the species but rather an ensemble of related sequences known as the quasispecies [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Developed by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster, the concept of quasispecies was defined as a mutant distribution dominated by a primary sequence with the highest rates of replication between the components of the mutant distribution. The phenomenon of quasispecies was further supported by the &#x0201c;hypercycle&#x0201d; theory as a self-organization principle to include different quasispecies in a higher-order organization that eases evolution into more complicated forms such that the coding capacity and catalytic activities of proteins are taken into account [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Mutants with varying levels of infectivity generated from a mutated gene occurred regularly in a virus population due to the high mutation rates [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The error-prone replication ability of RNA viruses and the shorter generation times can be used to explain the variations in evolution rates between DNA and RNA viruses. While mutation rates for DNA genomes have been estimated to be between 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup> per base pair per replication [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed typically low fidelity whereby the mutation rate is of roughly 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> mutations per nucleotide copied, which is greater than that of almost all DNA viruses [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This characteristic of the RNA polymerase in RNA viruses led to the generation of diverse offspring with different genotypes in shorter generation times.</p><p>There is some general consensus regarding quasispecies that have been established. For instance, the presence of diverse mutants in a population of viruses is a reality which can affect the biological behavior of the virus in vivo due to the complexity and amplitude of the mutant spectra [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, interactions amongst variants of a quasispecies population was classified into three types namely&#x02014;cooperation, interference and complementation. Cooperative interactions arise from those variants exhibiting advantageous phenotypes compared to the wild-type while interfering interactions are those exemplified in variants with detrimental effects on the replication of the virus. However, complementation interactions have no positive or negative effects on the virus population [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Considerably less is known of the relationships between the evolution of RNA viruses with respect to virulence. The dynamics of quasispecies has explained the failure of monotherapy and synthetic antiviral vaccine but opened up new avenues for exploration [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Specifically, unanswered questions pertaining to quasispecies remain&#x02014;What are the underlying mutations responsible for long term tenacity compared to those of extinction? Are there any molecular determinants which are the root cause of higher virulence in a quasispecies population?</p><p>Frequent occasional outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral diseases such as Dengue fever, West Nile Fever, Zika virus disease, Chikungunya disease, Middle east respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease and many others have been targets for therapeutic interventions. Long lasting protection against viral infections is best achieved via vaccinations through live attenuated viruses (LAVs). In order to generate stable vaccine strains, the evolution of these viruses must be properly understood. This review is centered on the examination of the evidence for the heterogeneous nature of RNA genomes (quasispecies), the factors leading to quasispecies formation and its implications on virulence.</p><p>The phenomenon of quasispecies has been well reported for many viruses belonging to different families and genera [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There is no clear idea whether emerging viruses such as Zika virus, Ebola virus, West Nile virus, Dengue virus and many others owe part of their evolution to higher virulence conferred by the presence of specific quasispecies within the viral population. Exploring the underlying mechanism of virulence stemming from a quasispecies population remains of interest. In this review, we examine reported cases of quasispecies and their implications on virulence.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-20-04657"><title>2. Picornaviridae</title><p>Viruses of the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> can be classified into genera such as <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, <italic>Parechovirus</italic>, <italic>Aphotovirus</italic> and others. The virion is made up of a non-enveloped capsid of 30 nm surrounding a core positive stranded ssRNA genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The genome is approximately 7 kb in size and possesses a single long ORF flanked on both ends by the 5&#x02032;-non-translated region (5&#x02032;-NTR) and the 3&#x02032;-non-translated region (3&#x02032;-NTR) [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The 5&#x02032;-NTR has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which controls cap-independent translation. The ORF comprising 6579 nucleotides can be classified into three polyprotein regions, namely, P1, P2 and P3. They encode for structural proteins (VP1 to VP4) in the P1 region and non-structural proteins in the P2 (2A&#x02013;2C) and P3 regions (3A&#x02013;3D) following proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 are displayed on the external structures of the EV-A71 viral particle whereas VP4 is found within the internal structures of the capsid [<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-20-04657"><title>2.1. Poliovirus (PV)</title><p>Poliovirus is found within the <italic>Human Enterovirus C</italic> species of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family and can be classified into three distinct serotypes (1, 2 and 3). Most poliovirus infections cause an asymptomatic incubation period followed by a minor illness characterized by fever, headache and sore throat which mainly affects children. However, PV infections can lead to paralytic poliomyelitis which can result in death. Following the WHO 1988 polio eradication program, the number of poliomyelitis has been reduced by 99% worldwide but a small number of countries still have sporadic outbreaks of polio [<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The poliovirus population diversity was evaluated in the brain of the murine model during viral spread. It was observed that only a fraction of the original injected viral pool was able to move from the initial site of inoculation to the brain via the &#x02018;bottleneck effect.&#x02019; To determine the maintenance of the quasispecies during infection in vivo, 6&#x02013;10 weeks old mice were inoculated in the leg with individual viruses. Total RNA recovered from the brain tissues revealed that four viruses were shown to be capable of spreading to the brain with their introduced mutations unchanged. Therefore, it was postulated that the innate immune response reduced the viral pathogenicity by limiting the diversity of viruses during spread to vulnerable tissues [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Two mechanisms to explain the bottleneck effect have been speculated, namely&#x02014;the &#x0201c;tough-transit&#x0201d; model and the &#x0201c;burned-bridge&#x0201d; model. The &#x0201c;tough-transit&#x0201d; model suggests that virus trafficking within the murine model has a low probability of success passing the blood-brain barrier. However, once in the CNS, it acts as a founder virus and re-establishes a population with initial limited diversity. On the other hand, the &#x0201c;burned bridge&#x0201d; model stipulates that it is not tough for the virus to physically reach the blood-brain barrier. Thus, when the first few viruses reach the gateway to the brain, the host innate immune response triggers an antiviral state [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In order to verify whether limiting the genomic diversity of a viral population has any effect on its evolution, a study was conducted on a strain of poliovirus with a substitution of Glycine 64 to Serine (G64S) in the RNA polymerase of the virus. The outcome of one-step growth curves and northern blot analysis of genomic RNA synthesis confirmed that the G64S mutation showed greater fidelity without a considerable reduction in the overall efficiency of RNA replication. The study hypothesized that having greater heterogeneity within a viral population allows it to adapt better to changing environments encountered during an infection and indeed the finding showed that boosting the fidelity of poliovirus replication had a noticeable effect on viral adaptation and pathogenicity. The poliovirus strain with a mutated RNA polymerase carrying an altered amino acid residue (G64S) was observed to replicate similarly to the wild-type counterpart but produced lower genomic diversity and subsequently was incapable of adapting well under detrimental growth situations. This study showed that the diversity of the quasispecies was associated with increased virulence rather than selection of single adaptive mutations. Alongside previous observations, these findings indicated a rise in the error rate over the tolerable error threshold which induced viral extinction, suggesting that the rate of viral mutation was precisely modulated and most likely had been finely tuned during the evolution of the virus [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It was further revealed that curbing the diversity of a RNA viral population by raising the fidelity of the RNA polymerase had a direct effect on its pathogenicity and capacity of the viruses to escape antiviral immunity [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These findings support the fact that RNA viruses have developed minimal viral polymerase fidelity to facilitate quick evolution and adaptation to novel situations [<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-20-04657"><title>2.2. Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71)</title><p>EV-A71 belongs to the genus <italic>Enterovirus</italic> within the family of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. It was first characterized in 1969 in California, USA [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and is one of the main etiological agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) [<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Some cases of EV-A71 infections have been associated with neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In China, enteroviruses such as EV-A71 and CV-A16 have caused 7,200,092 cases of HFMD between 2008 to 2012. The mortality rate was highest among children below the age of five. It was further reported that 82,486 patients developed neurological complications and 1617 deaths were confirmed by the laboratory to be caused by EV-A71 [<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The course of evolution through which EV-A71 evolves to escape the central nervous system (CNS) was investigated by complete sequencing and haplotype analysis of the strains isolated from the digestive system and the CNS. A novel bottleneck selection was revealed in various environments such as the respiratory system and the central nervous system throughout the dissemination of EV-A71 in the host. Consequently, a dominant haplotype resulting from the bottleneck effect caused a change from viruses harboring VP1&#x02013;3D to VP1&#x02013;31G where the amino acid 31 was a favorable site of selection among the circulating EV-A71 sub-genotype C2. VP1&#x02013;31G was present at elevated levels amongst the population of mutants of EV-A71 in the throat swabs of subjects with severe EV-A71 infections. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that VP1&#x02013;31D virus isolates had higher infectivity, fitness and virion stability, which sustained the virus infections in the digestive system. Speculations were that such factors benefitted the virus in gaining added viral adaptation and subsequently enabled viral spread to more tissues. These beneficial abilities could also justify the reduced number of VP1&#x02013;31D viruses located in the brain following positive selection. The VP1&#x02013;31G viruses presenting the major haplotype in the central nervous system displayed increased viral fitness and growth rates in neuronal cells. This implied that the VP1&#x02013;31G mutations aided the spread of the mutant virus in the brain which resulted in serious neurological complications in patients. It was speculated that the fluctuating degree of tissue tropism of EV-A71 at diverse inoculation sites resulted in the bottleneck effect of the viral population having a mutant spectrum. Hence, the adaptive VP1&#x02013;31G haplotype became dominant in neuronal tissues and once the infection was achieved, VP1&#x02013;31G viruses expedited bottleneck selection and propagation into the skin and CNS. Among the three minor haplotypes (C to E) which co-existed in various tissues, the minor haplotype C was isolated in the intestinal mucosa and throat swab specimens. The minor haplotype D was isolated from specimens obtained from the respiratory and digestive systems. However, the minor haplotype E appeared in throat swabs and the basal ganglia but not the intestinal mucosa, hence, suggesting that the intestinal mucosa is the initial replication site of the EV-A71. Collectively, these data showed that the EV-A71 quasispecies utilized the dynamic proportion of varying haplotype populations to co-exist, sustained the ability of the population to adapt and enabled the propagation in different tissues. Lastly, the study concluded that the selection of haplotype(s) might be a driving factor in viral dissemination and severity of infections in humans as well as the virulence in EV-A71 infected patients [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-ijms-20-04657"><title>3. Flaviviridae</title><p>Of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family (genera <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, <italic>Pestivirus</italic>, <italic>Pegivirus</italic> and <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>), there are 89 animal viruses with a small, positive-sense, single stranded RNA genome [<xref rid="B31-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The virions are 40&#x02013;60 nm in diameter, spherical in shape and contain a lipid envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The majority of these viruses are arthropod-borne and transmitted via infected mosquitoes and ticks. They are considered as emerging and re-emerging pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Zika Virus (ZIKV) and these viruses pose a global threat to public health by causing significant mortality [<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The flaviviral genome is approximately 11 kb and has a single open reading frame (ORF), which is flanked by untranslated regions (5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; NTR). The ORF encodes three structural proteins (C, M and E) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS).

The global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades and about half of the world&#x02019;s population is now&#x02014;at risk [<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In particular, it represents a growing public health problem in many tropical and sub-tropical countries, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The viral etiology of dengue is characterized by biphasic fever, headache, pain in various parts of the body, prostration, rash, lymphadenopathy and leukopenia that affects young children and adults [<xref rid="B36-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, dengue infection can progress to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Severe dengue affects most Asian and Latin American countries and has become a leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths among children and adults in these regions.

Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, the infectivity of the two vaccine strains was investigated to assess the molecular determinants of plaque size. It was revealed that the small plaque displayed by the PGMK30 strain in BHK-21 cells was due to its reduced in vitro growth rate. On the other hand, the PDK53 strain which produced the small plaques was observed to grow rapidly but was unable to evade antiviral responses which restricted its ability to spread. The slow growth rates of the two strains were suggested to be due to two different key mechanisms&#x02014;the growth of PDK53 appeared to be modulated by antiviral responses while PGMK30 was slow to spread to surrounding cells but was able to evade immune detection. It was hypothesized that if the plaque size of PDK53 was hindered by the antiviral response, interfering with its activation by silencing pSTAT1 would be expected to alter the plaque characteristics of the PDK53 but not PGMK30 or the wild-type. In line with the hypothesis, a marked increase in pSTAT1 was shown in cells surrounding the foci of PDK53 infection but no increase was detected in PGMK30 and the wild-type. At least two different mechanisms dictate the plaque phenotype and elucidating the exact mechanism of how it caused the formation of small plaque size is an efficient way to choose future live-attenuated vaccine strains for clinical development [<xref rid="B38-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. </p><p>From another perspective, differences in the envelope (<italic>E</italic>) gene sequence was investigated using the plasma samples of six DENV infected patients. The first account of viral quasispecies of DENV in vivo was reported using clonal sequencing analysis whereby the simultaneous occurrence of diverse variant genomes was observed. The degree of genetic diversity was revealed to fluctuate among patients with the mean proportion being 1.67%. Moreover, out of 10 clones derived from dengue infected plasma, 33 nucleotide substitutions were detected, of which 30 were non-synonymous mutations. Of particular interest, mutations at amino acid residues 290 and 301 resulted in the presence of two stop codons which indicated that genome-defective dengue viruses (5.8%) were also present within the quasispecies population. It was hypothesized that this might have significant impact on the pathogenesis of the dengue virus [<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Recently, Parameswaran et al. profiled the intra-host viral diversity of samples from 77 patients via whole-genome amplifications of the entire coding region of the DENV-3 genome. A significant difference in the viral makeup between na&#x000ef;ve subjects and patients with DENV-3 immunity revealed that the immune repertoire of the host is responsible for the degree of diversity exhibited by the viral population. Subsequently, identification of the hotspots responsible for the intra-host diversity revealed that few spots were crucial for intra-host diversity. The major hotspots for diversity were revealed in more than 59% of the samples at three codon coordinates&#x02014;amino acid residues 100 and 101 in the M protein and residue 315 in the AB loop of the E Domain III. The residue E<sub>315</sub> was speculated to have arisen as an immune escape variant in response to the pressure exerted by the immune defense mechanism. These findings highlighted the importance of host-specific selection pressures in the evolution of DENV-3 viral population within the host and this could eventually lead to the intelligent design of a vaccine candidate identified from the prevalent escape variants such as those bearing the E<sub>315</sub> [<xref rid="B40-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It was reported that within the quasispecies population, amino acid substitutions occurred on the surface of the E protein which was involved in interactions with other oligomers, antibodies and host cell receptors. In particular, two amino acid substitutions at positions E452 and E455 were mapped to the E protein transmembrane domain, E450 to E472, which functioned as the membrane anchor for E protein. Intra-host quasispecies analysis using the <italic>E</italic> gene sequences also identified several amino acids on the surface of the E protein which altered the properties of the virus. The conformational rearrangements that led to the fusion of the virus and the host cell membrane was altered.

The large plaque variant was observed to have faster growth kinetics compared to the small plaque variant. Sequencing of the plaque variants showed that the large plaque variant had a guanine nucleotide at position 796 (230<sup>Gln</sup>) while the small plaque clone had an adenine at the same position. A recombinant clone carrying the G796A mutation was produced using an infectious molecular clone of the ZIKV MR766 strain. The plaque size produced by the recombinant clone was smaller when compared to the parental strain and its growth rate was significantly reduced in Vero cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that the virulence of the MR766 strain in IFNAR1 mice had decreased, showing that the mutation at position 230 in the - M protein is a molecular determinant of plaque morphology, growth property and virulence in mice [<xref rid="B48-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>The quasispecies distribution of a ZIKV strain (ZIKV-SL1602) isolated from a 29-year-old female traveler was investigated. Data obtained from single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing were aligned to a consensus sequence and 24,815,877 nucleotide sequences were read. Phylogenetic analysis was then performed and each nucleotide was analyzed to characterize the quasispecies composition of this clinical isolate. For each nucleotide position, the frequency of occurrence of each of the bases was determined and 3375 single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were detected. Interestingly, four variants of the quasispecies population were found to be present at a level of more than 1% of the total population. Mutations in the E protein accounted for 4.1% of the variants and other mutations in the non-structural region&#x02014;8.2% in the NS2, 1.6% in the NS1 and 1.4% in the NS5 were detected. The phylogenetic data analysis also disclosed that ZIKV-SL1602 clustered within the Asian lineage in close proximity to the WNVs currently circulating in America. Every South American isolate was found to share similar ancestry with the French Polynesian isolates.

Characterization of this variant in mammalian, avian and mosquito cell lines led to the discovery that the SP variant contained four nucleotides in its genome that differed from the wild-type genome. Two nucleotide changes led to non-synonymous mutations where there was a P54S change in the prM protein and a V61A change in the NS2A protein. Further analysis of the mutations revealed that deletion at the cleavage site of the prM site did not affect virus replication and its release from mammalian BHK cells. However, the progeny of this virus was no longer able to infect BHK cells. A mutation in the prM region of the TBEV was also reported to cause decreased secretion of virus particles with no effect on protein folding. Lower neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness were reported when mutation A30P occurred in the NS2A region of the isolate. Further sequencing of the isolate showed that most of the small plaque clones initially isolated reverted back to their wild-type sequence at position 625 in the prM region. Remaining isolates reverted at position 3707 in the NS2A region. These findings suggested that the mutation present in the prM region could be responsible for the phenotype of the small plaque. It is probable that the mutation in the NS2A region was responsible for the determination of the plaque size as the mutation in the prM region was sufficient to revert the isolate to the wild-type phenotype [<xref rid="B52-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>The genetic diversity of WNV in the avian host was also investigated using next-generation sequencing. The aim was to explore whether the genetically homogeneous cloned virus would go through genetic diversification after passages in young SPF chickens and wild juvenile carrion crows. Data collected revealed that the WNV population showed significant heterogeneity diverging from the quasispecies structure of the initial viral inoculum in both animal models. However, in-depth analysis enacted a comparison between the infection model (SPF chicken and wild juvenile carrion crows) to assess the variations in genetic diversity. It was demonstrated that the WNV genetic diversifications varied significantly from the inoculum in crows with 18 genetic variants but exhibited suboptimal levels of diversifications among the chickens with only 3 single nucleotide variants (SNV) being detected. Hence, natural WNV-susceptible avian hosts could provide a selective setting and contributed to genetic diversifications.

Up to date, the role of several of these mutations and the influence of disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes have been studied. Riemersma et al. investigated the intra-host genetic diversity of high and low-fidelity CHIKV variants using murine models. Both the high and low fidelity variants were expected to lower the virulence of CHIKV as compared to the wild-type (CHIKV-WT). However, the high-fidelity variant caused more acute levels of infection such that the onset of the swelling in the footpad exhibited earlier than the CHIKV-WT at 3- and 4-days post-infection (dpi). Moreover, the high-fidelity CHIKV (CHIKV-HiFi) infected mice also displayed higher peaks of disease severity when compared to the CHIKV-WT 7 dpi. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passages. In high-fidelity variants, nsp2 G641D and nsp4 C483Y mutations increased CHIKV virulence in the adult mice. The NGS data showed that the CHIKV-HiFi variant produced more genetically diverse populations than the CHIKV-WT in mice. However, the low-fidelity variant gave rise to reduced rates of replication and disease [<xref rid="B69-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>Plaque size is a common feature of viral characterization. Primary isolates of CHIKV containing variants with different plaque sizes were previously reported [<xref rid="B70-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Viral variants with different plaque morphology such as small and large plaques had been reported in the 2005 CHIKV outbreak isolates [<xref rid="B72-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It is curious how small plaque variants with lower fitness were maintained as a natural viral quasispecies. Plausible explanations indicated that the plaque size might not represent the in vivo growth conditions and that cooperation among variants with different plaque sizes might be required for optimal in vivo replication and transmission fitness. Jaimipak et al. reasoned that if the plaque size did not represent the in vivo growth conditions and the small plaque variants had a similar fitness as the large plaque variants, they would be similarly virulent in a murine model. In order to explore the virulence of the small plaque CHIKV variant in vivo, the pathogenicity of the purified small plaque variant of the CHIKV virus isolated from the sera of the patient in Phang-nga, Thailand in 2009, was tested in neonatal mice [<xref rid="B73-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The small plaque variant (CHK-S) showed stable homogenous small plaques after 4 plaque purifications. It also grew slower and produced lower titers when compared with the wild-type virus. After 21 days of infection in the suckling mice with the wild-type and CHK-S variants (injected 103 pfu/mouse), mice which received the CHK-S virus showed 98% survival rate while only 74% of mice survived after infection with the wild-type virus. The small plaque variant of CHIKV obtained by plaque purifications exhibited decreased virulence that makes it appropriate to serve as candidates for live-attenuated vaccine development. The CHIKV variant with the small plaque size formed a major subpopulation in the CHIKV primary isolate during multiple passages in C6/36 cells. This is in line with the reduction of virulence in the suckling mice and indicated that the small plaque variant had reduced in vivo fitness. This suggested that replication cycles in mosquito vectors might play an important role in maintaining the small plaque variant in natural infections. The persistence of the small plaque variant CHK-S clone after multiple passages in C6/36 cells showed that the CHK-S variant might be able to outcompete the large plaque variant when infecting the same cell by an unknown mechanism. Alternatively, small and large plaque variants might cooperate in a way that provided a selective advantage for maintaining the small plaque variant [<xref rid="B73-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>Comparative sequence alignment of large and small plaque variants of CHIKV primary isolates from the Comoros Island showed two amino acid differences in the nsp2 protease and the nsp3 protein.

NoLS is a region in the N-terminal part of the CHIKV capsid protein, between residues 58 and 110 and is rich in basic amino acids [<xref rid="B75-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

Sequence analysis of the P5 CHIKV-NoLS plaques showed that the two plaque variants had no mutations in the capsid protein. A single non-synonymous change in the nucleotide of the capsid caused an alanine to serine substitution at position 101 in the third plaque variant. However, the substitution did not cause any change in the small plaque phenotype or replication kinetics of the CHIKV-NoLS clone after ten passages in vitro [<xref rid="B74-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The in vivo study showed that the CHIKV-NoLS-immunized mice were able to produce long-term immunity against CHIKV infection following immunization with a single dose of the CHIKV-NoLS small plaque variant. Attenuation of CHIKV-NoLS through the NoLS mutation is most likely due to the disruption of the replication of viruses after viral RNA synthesis, however, the precise mechanism of reduced viral titer remained unsolved [<xref rid="B76-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

The impact of specific mutations on the role of each viral proteins and on the growth of recombinant EBOVs was analyzed by recently engineered virus-like particles and reverse genetics. A D759G substitution in proximity to a highly conserved region of the GDN motif in the enzymatically active center (amino acid 741 to 743) of the L polymerase was able to increase viral transcription and replication. On the other hand, a R111C substitution in the multifunctional region of the nucleoprotein which is essential for homo-oligomerization and nucleocapsid formation was found to reduce viral transcription and replication.

Approximately 35% of patients with MERS-CoV infection have died. </p><p>The nsp1 was reported to suppress protein synthesis by degrading the host mRNA but viral RNA could circumvent the nsp-1 mediated translational shutoff. Terada et al. showed that the double mutations (A9G/R13A) in the non-structural protein 1a (nsp1) affected viral propagation and the plaque morphology. The size of the plaque in the mutated MERS-CoV was smaller and the infectious titers and intracellular viral RNA were decreased in infected Huh7 or Vero cells when compared to the wild-type virus. The formation of the small plaque variant was due to impairment of viral replication via the disruption of the stem-loop (SL) structure of the RNA. In addition, analysis of the biological properties of the nsp1-A9G/R13A mutant showed that the mutant virus possessed low binding activity at the 5&#x02032;-UTR and promoted translational shutoff against reporter plasmids with or without 5&#x02032;-UTR [<xref rid="B102-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].</p><p>Alterations in the coronavirus spike glycoprotein by means of natural and experimentally induced mutations changed cell and organ tropism and virus pathogenicity. The wild-type MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein precursor contains 1353 amino acids arranged into two subunits&#x02014;an amino-terminal subunit (S1) carrying the receptor binding domain (RBD) and a carboxy-terminal subunit (S2) containing the putative fusion peptide (FP/IFP), two heptad repeat domains (HR1/HR2) and the transmembrane (TM) and intracellular domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Lu et al. isolated a diverse population comprising the wild-type and a variant carrying a deletion of 530 nucleotides in the spike glycoprotein gene from the serum of a 75-year-old patient in Taif, Saudi Arabia. The patient subsequently died. Analysis of the MERS-CoV sequence showed an out of frame deletion which led to the loss a large part of the S2 subunit. It contained all the major structures of the membrane fusion in the S2 subunit preceding the early stop codon [<xref rid="B103-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] and this also included the proposed fusion peptide (949&#x02013;970 aa) [<xref rid="B104-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The deletion resulted in the production of a shortened protein bearing only 801 amino acids. In the cell-free serum sample of the patient, mutant genomes with the S530&#x00394; were abundant with an estimated ratio of 4:1 deleted to intact sequence reads. The spike gene deletion would cause the production of a defective virus which was incapable of causing infections or with a lowered rate of infection. Losing the S2 subunit caused a disruption in the membrane holding the spike protein and halted the fusion of the virus to the host. However, in the case of the mutant bearing the S530&#x00394;, the mutation helped to sustain the wild-type MERS-CoV infection by producing a free S1 subunit with a &#x0201c;sticky&#x0201d; hydrophobic tail and the additional disulfide bonds caused the aggregation and mis-folding of proteins. In addition, the mutated S530&#x00394; could form steady trimer complexes that retained biding affinity for the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and acted as a decoy such that the spike-specific MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were blocked.</p><p>Park et al. analyzed the non&#x02013;consensus sequences of MERS-CoV derived from 35 specimens obtained from 24 patients and showed the heterogeneity of MERS-CoV among patients. The maximal level of heterogeneity was recovered from the super-spreader specimens. Moreover, this heterogeneity disseminated in close association with variations in the consensus sequences. It can be inferred that MERS-CoV infections were caused by multiple variants. In-depth analysis of heterogeneity among patients showed a link between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. The two mutations resulted in reduced RBD binding affinity to the human CD26. Moreover, the two mutations were observed to be mutually exclusive, implying that the mutants have the ability to significantly hinder viral fitness. However, variants with D510G and I529T mutations in the S protein demonstrated an increase in resistance against neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and reduced sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization [<xref rid="B105-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The frequency of each of the single mutant varied greatly but their combined frequency of mutations was elevated in the majority of the samples. Meanwhile, the frequency of the wild type was no more than 10% in the majority of the samples. Therefore, it can be deduced that the selection pressure applied by the host immune response played a crucial part in producing genetic variants and how they interacted with the immune system in humans in MERS-CoV outbreaks [<xref rid="B106-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>].</p><p>Scobey et al. reported the T1015N mutation in the spike glycoprotein during 9 passages of the virus was able to alter the growth kinetics and plaque morphology in vitro. The mutated MERS-CoV virus (MERS-CoV T1015N) replicated approximately 0.5 log more effectively and formed larger plaques compared to the wild type (MERS-CoV). The data suggested that the mutation T1015N was a tissue culture-adapted mutation that arose during serial in vitro passages [<xref rid="B107-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The whole genome sequencing of MERS-CoV revealed the presence of sequence variants within the isolate from dromedary camels (DC) which indicated the existence of quasispecies present within the animal. A single amino acid (A520S) was located in the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV variant. Strikingly, when detailed population analysis was performed on samples recovered from human cases, only clonal genomic sequences were reported. Therefore, the study speculated that a model of interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV whereby specific genotypes were able to overcome the bottleneck selection. While host susceptibility to infection is not taken into account in this setting, the findings provided insights into understanding the unique and rare cases of human of MERS-CoV [<xref rid="B108-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec7-ijms-20-04657"><title>7.

On the external surface of the virion, glycoproteins possessing hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and cell fusion activities are present. The middle component of the envelope is a lipid bilayer acquired from the host cell as the virus buds off the cytoplasmic membrane. The innermost surface of the envelope is a non-glycosylated membrane protein layer that maintains the outer structure of the virus. The paramyxoviruses can be characterized by the gene order of the viral proteins and by the biochemical characteristics of the proteins associated with viral attachment.</p><p>The L protein which is the catalytic subunit of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) is associated with the nucleocapsid protein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) to form part of the RNA polymerase complex. The RNA polymerase complex is covered by the viral envelope consisting of a matrix protein (M) and two glycosylated envelope spike proteins, a fusion protein (F) and cell attachment protein. Cell attachment protein is different based on the genera and it could be hemagglutinin (H in Measles), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN in Mumps and NDV viruses) or glycoprotein G (<italic>Henipavirus</italic>). Some genera within the <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family also contain various conserved proteins including the non-structural proteins (C, NS1, NS2), a cysteine-rich protein (V), a small integral membrane protein (SH) and transcription factors M2&#x02013;1 and M2&#x02013;2 [<xref rid="B111-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. </p><p>Fusion and cell attachment proteins are large glycoprotein spikes that are present on the surface of the virion.

The matrix protein organizes and sustains the virion structure. The nucleocapsid associates with genomic RNA and protects the RNA from nucleases. Extracistronic (noncoding) regions include a 3&#x02032; leader sequence with 50 nucleotides in length, which works as a transcriptional promoter and a 5&#x02032; trailer with 50&#x02013;161 nucleotides [<xref rid="B111-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>].</p><p>The genomes of viruses within the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> are non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment.

Passaging the MeV in these two different cell lines resulted in variants exhibiting different replication kinetics. Deep sequencing of the lymphocytic adapted variants demonstrated an increasing number of variants showing mutations within the 11-nucleotide region in the middle of the phosphoprotein (<italic>P</italic>) gene. This sequence mediated the polymerase split and caused an insertion of a pseudo-templated guanosine to the P mRNA, causing a replacement of polymerase cofactor (P) with a type I interferon antagonist (V). The two different variants (lymphocytic and epithelial adapted) had different levels of P and V expressions. It was suggested that the equilibration of the viral quasispecies in the population was based on different V protein expression. Lymphocytic derived MeV variants that exhibited V competent genomes were found at a low frequency for adaptation in epithelial cells. Moreover, a complete wipe out of the V-deficient genomes considerably reduced antiviral innate defense mechanism, suggesting that a good equilibrium of the V and P protein expressions is necessary within the quasispecies population [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec7dot2-ijms-20-04657"><title>7.2.

Mumps is an extremely contagious, acute, self-limited, systemic viral infection that primarily affects swelling of one or more of the salivary glands, typically the parotid glands. The infection could cause pain in the swollen salivary glands on one or both sides of patient face, fever, headache, muscle aches, weakness, fatigue and loss of appetite. Complications of mumps are rare but they can be potentially serious involving inflammation and body swelling in testicles, brain, spinal cord or pancreas. Infections can lead to hearing loss, heart problems and miscarriage. In the United States, mumps was one of common disease prior to vaccination became routine. Then a dramatic decrease was observed in the number of infections. However, mumps outbreaks still occur in the United States and there was an increase in the number of cases recently. Majority of those who are not vaccinated or are in close-contact with the viruses in schools or college campuses are at high risk. There is currently no specific treatment for mumps [<xref rid="B122-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>].</p><p>The strain Urabe AM9 is one of the mumps virus strains that was widely used in vaccines but this strain was associated with meningitis and was withdrawn from the market. Sauder et al. performed serial passaging of the strain Urabe AM9 in cell cultures and compared the whole nucleotide sequences of the parental (Urabe P-AM9) and passaged viruses (Urabe P6-Vero or Urabe P6-CEF) to investigate the attenuation process and to identify the attenuation markers [<xref rid="B123-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Passaging of the Urabe AM9 mumps virus in Vero or chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell lines caused changes in the genetic heterogeneity at particular regions of the genome through either changing of one nucleotide at locations where the starting material showed nucleotide heterogeneity or the presentation of an additional nucleotide to produce a heterogenic site. Virulence of the passaged virus was dramatically decreased in the murine model. Moreover, similar growth kinetics of the virulent Urabe P-AM9 and passaged attenuated variants in the rat brain suggested that the impaired replication ability of the attenuated variants was not the main cause of the neuroattenuation. However, in the rat brain, the peak titer of the neuroattenuated variant was almost one log lower than that of the neurovirulent parental strain. For instance, identical but independent induction of heterogeneity at position 370 of the <italic>F</italic>-gene by substitution of threonine to alanine in passaged virus in Vero and CEF cells suggested a correlation of this mutation to the neuroattenuation phenotype. There was lack of ability to identify heterogeneity for those regions with differences of more than 10% between the detected nucleotides in the consensus sequence. The heterogeneity could be the result of new mutations at these positions or the selection of pre-existing sequences within the minority quasispecies. In addition, passaging of the parental strain in CEF and Vero cells led to the observation of several amino acid alterations in the NP, P, F, HN and L proteins that could affect the virulence of the virus. Thus, the modifications of genetic heterogeneity at particular genome sites could have important consequences on the neurovirulence phenotype.

The fusion protein is expressed as an inactive precursor (F0) prior to activation by proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage of F0 is crucial for infectivity and works as a key virulence indicator for certain viruses such as virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus 1 (NDV). The F0 cleavage site contains several basic residues which cause the cleavage of the F protein by furin, an endopeptidase present in the trans-Golgi network [<xref rid="B110-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>].</p><p>NDV strains are categorized based on their pathogenicity in chickens as highly virulent (velogenic), intermediately virulent (mesogenic) or nonvirulent (lentogenic). These levels of pathogenicity can be differentiated by the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site in the fusion protein (F0). Lentogenic NDV strains have dibasic amino acids at the cleavage site whereas the velogenic strains contain polybasic residues. Meng et al. studied the changes in virulence of NDV strains, leading to a switch in lentogenic variant (JS10) to velogenic variant (JS10-A10) through 10 serial passages of the virus in chicken air sacs [<xref rid="B128-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. However, the lentogenic variants (JS10) remained lentogenic after 20 serial passages in chicken embryos (JS10-E20). The nearly identical genome sequences of JS10, JS10-A10 and JS10-E20 showed that after passaging, both variants were directly generated from the parental strain (JS10). Genome sequence analysis of the F0 cleavage site of the parental strain and the passaged variants revealed that the rise in virulence observed in the parental strain (JS10) stemmed from a build-up of velogenic quasispecies population together with a gradual disappearance of the lentogenic quasispecies. The decline of the lentogenic F0 genotypes of <sup>112</sup>-E(G)RQE(G)RL-<sup>117</sup> from 99.30% to 0.28% and the rise of the velogenic F0 genotypes of <sup>112</sup>-R(K)RQR(K)RF-<sup>117</sup> from 0.34% to 94.87% after 10 serial passages in air sacs was hypothesized to be due to the emergence of velogenic F0 genotypes. Subsequently, this led to the enhancement of virulence in JS10-A10. The data indicated that lentogenic NDV strains circulating among poultry could lead to evolution of the velogenic NDV strain. This velogenic NDV strain has the potential to cause outbreaks due to the difficulty in preventing contact between natural waterfowl reservoirs and sensitive poultry operations. </p><p>NDV quasispecies comprised lentogenic and velogenic genomes in various proportions. The change in virulence of the quasispecies composition of JS10 and its variants was investigated by analysis of viral population dynamics. The F0 cleavage site was reported to be the main region in which the majority of amino acid changes had occurred and resulting in an accumulation of variants exhibiting velogenic properties due to serial passages. Furthermore, passaging of the virus caused a transition in the degree of virulence of NDV strains from lentogenic to mesogenic and ultimately an increase of the velogenic type. Therefore, NDV pathogenesis could be controlled by the ratio of avirulent to virulent genomes and their interactions within the chicken air sacs and the embryo.

The in vivo analysis showed that both virulent and avirulent plaque-purified variants displayed a rise in the variability of quasispecies from 26% and 39%, respectively. The error rate in the viral sequences was observed to increase as well, such that one bird out of three displayed virulent viral characteristics (<sup>112</sup>-RRQRRF-<sup>117</sup>) after passaging of the PR-32 Avir variant.

Zhao et al. selected a PZ resistant virus by passaging of RSVA2 strain in the presence of PZ in HEp-2 cell culture [<xref rid="B136-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Utilization of PZ provided the opportunities to gain new insights into the transmission dynamics and the quasispecies nature of RSV. Protein sequence analysis of a single plaque (MP4) isolated from the fifth passage revealed the substitution of lysine by methionine 272. The mutation caused the cell culture-derived virus to be completely resistant to PZ prophylaxis in cotton rats. Dramatic reduction in replication of the parental strain A2 virus was observed at PZ concentrations ranging from 4 to 40 &#x000b5;g/mL. The replication of the MP4 mutant was not affected by PZ. The growth kinetics of both the parental strain and the variant were almost similar with maximum titers above 10<sup>7</sup> PFU/mL during the third and fourth day post infection. Hence, it was proposed that the fusion protein supported the entry of the MP4 mutants in HEp-2 cells in an early phase of the replication cycle through a fusion step. The A2 parental strain exhibited limited growth in HEp-2 cells due to its reactivity with PZ. However, the lack of reactivity of the MP4 mutants with PZ suggested that the F1 protein of the MP4 mutant caused a loss of antigenic reactivity with the humanized monoclonal antibody. Preclinical studies in cotton rats predicted the efficacy of PZ in humans. However, the usage of PZ up to 40 &#x000b5;g/mL, especially in immunosuppressed patients, could provide opportunities for the emergence of resistant viruses. Therefore, the PZ resistant viruses in humans could cause the PZ prophylaxis to be ineffective.</p><p>Deplanche et al. studied the BRSV and evaluated the genetic stability of BRSV in cell cultures by analyzing the consensus nucleotide sequences of the highly variable glycoprotein G. The BRSV strain W2&#x02013;00131 was isolated from a calf with respiratory distress syndrome (BAL-T) and was further propagated in bovine turbinate (BT) cells. The genomic region of the BRSV that encodes for the highly variable glycoprotein G showed constant genetic stability for the three variants (3Cp3, 3Cp9 and 3Cp10) after ten continuous passages in BT cells and after in vivo studies [<xref rid="B137-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. This led to further analysis of the quasispecies population derived from this field isolate. Genomic analysis of more mutants showed that the G-coding region displayed significant variability with mutations ranging from 6.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> to 10.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> substitutions per nucleotide in vitro and in vivo. </p><p>The majority of the mutations reported previously were present in the W2&#x02013;00131 RNA populations. A large dominance of non-synonymous over synonymous mutations was observed in all BRSV mutants. The non-synonymous mutations mapped preferentially within the two variable antigenic regions of the ectodomain or close to the highly conserved domain in the G protein [<xref rid="B137-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. These results suggested that BRSV populations might have evolved as complex and dynamic mutant swarms, despite apparent genetic stability.</p><p>Larsen et al. analyzed the nucleotides coding for the extracellular part of the G glycoprotein and the full SH protein of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) from several outbreaks from the same herd in different years in Denmark. Identical viruses were isolated within a herd during outbreaks but viruses from recurrent infections were found to vary up to 11% in sequences even in closed herds. It is possible that a quasispecies variant of BRSV persisted in some of the calves in each herd and this persistent variant displayed high viral fitness and became dominant. However, based on the high level of diversity, the most likely explanation is that BRSV was reintroduced into the herd prior to each new outbreak. These findings are highly relevant to understand the transmission patterns of BRSV among calves [<xref rid="B138-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec9-ijms-20-04657"><title>9.

The virion envelope originates from the cell membrane with the addition of one to three virus glycoproteins and one to two non-glycosylated proteins. The viral RNA polymerase (PB1, PB2 and PB3) is involved in the transcription of a single mRNA from every fragment of the genome. The transcription is triggered by cap snatching and the poly(A) tail is added by the viral polymerase stuttering on the poly U sequence. Alternative splicing of the MP and NS mRNA led to the mRNA coding for M2 and NEP proteins. PB1-F2 is translated by leaky scanning from the PB1 mRNA.

Current influenza vaccines have sub-optimal efficacy, as there was a lack of antigenic proximity between the vaccine candidate and the circulating seasonal influenza virus strains. During the 2016&#x02013;2017 influenza epidemic, the influenza A (H3N2) viruses from the clade 3c.2a were dominant and was associated with severe onset of the disease. The low vaccine efficacy of the 2016&#x02013;2017 egg-adapted H3N2 (clade 3c.2a) vaccine strain A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 was reported to be due to altered antigenicity [<xref rid="B142-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. To understand the pathogenesis of A(H3N2) viruses from the 3a.2c clade, it would be of great interest to consider if each infection was being caused by an individual strain or by a swarm of genetically related viruses (quasispecies). This would help to provide an insight into the vaccine coverage and efficacy.</p><p>A study investigated the impact of antigenic proximity, genomic substitutions, quasispecies, diversity and reassortment in order to understand the molecular evolution of the influenza A (H3N2) isolated directly from clinical samples. Of the 155/176 whole genomes analyzed, several amino acid substitutions were found to substantially affect the severity of the infection caused by the clade specific viruses. Within the sample, 121 viruses belonged to the genetic clade 3c.2a.1 and eight belonged to 3c.2a2, twenty-four belonged to 3c.2a3, one belonged to 3c.2a4 and one belonged to a different clade 3c.3a. Many distinct substitutions spanning across the whole influenza proteome, HA, NA and non-structural protein 1 were found to be responsible for causing mild and severe disease. Interestingly, two substitutions, V261I and K196E, were found in the NA and the NS1, respectively. These two mutations were found to be particularly significant as they showed the distinction between the strains causing mild and severe infections. Analysis of the clinical isolates showed a difference in a single amino acid residue, 160 K within the HA, whereby 14 cases of glycosylation loss was observed within the quasispecies population linked to severity of infection. Moreover, the degree of diversity within the quasispecies population was reported to be elevated in severe cases when compared to mild ones [<xref rid="B143-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>].</p><p>The epidemiology and molecular characterization of low and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strains (LPAIV &#x00026; HPAIV, respectively) isolated from Germany were investigated. The complete genome analysis of the two strains showed that both LPAIV and HPAIV had high nucleotide similarity with only ten mutations outside the hemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) which were spread along the six genome segments of the HPAIV. Of the ten mutations, five were previously identified as minor variants in the quasispecies population of the progenitor virus, LPAIV, with 18&#x02013;42% significant variable frequency [<xref rid="B144-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. However, studies focusing on the diversity of quasispecies of avian influenza in the human host are few. Watanabe et al. successfully demonstrated that infections caused by a single-virus in vitro produced an evident spectra of mutants in the H5N1 progeny viruses. Analysis of the genetic diversity of the hemagglutinin (HA) revealed that variants with mutated HA had lower thermostability leading to higher binding specificity. Both traits were deemed beneficial for viral infection. On the other hand, other variants with higher thermostability also emerged but were unable to thrive against mutants with lower thermostability [<xref rid="B145-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. The quasispecies population of influenza A virus was also reported to be in a state of continuous genetic drift in a given subtype population. A viral single nucleotide polymorphism (vSNP) was reported to be important and was shared by more than 15% of the variants within the quasispecies population of the subtype strain in a given season. However, between the season 2010&#x02013;2011, various vSNPs in the PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS segments were shared among variants with more than 58&#x02013;80% of the sample population and less than 50% of the shared vSNPs were located within the PB1 segment [<xref rid="B146-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>].</p><p>A study aimed to identify the key mechanisms contributing towards co-pathogenesis of BALB/c mice infected with the A(H1N1) quasispecies. It was revealed that the co-evolution of the quasispecies brought about a complex response due to different expressions of the biphasic gene. A significant upregulation of the Ifng was associated with an increased majority of mutants expressing a differentially expressed gene (DEG) named <italic>HA-G222</italic> gene.

Serial passages of the H1N1 virus was also carried out prior to the analysis of its sequential replication, virulence and rate of transmission.

Analysis of the immunodominant motifs of the HBV core region from the amino acids 40 to 95 indicated that the positions exhibiting peak rates of variability were found in the main core epitopes, thereby confirming their role in stimulating the immune system. Moreover, the distribution of the variability was observed to occur in a genotype-dependent manner. For instance, HBV isolated from genotype A had higher variability within the core epitope regions but no significant differences in genotype D were observed in the core epitopes and other positions. Further sequential analysis of the samples put forth the dynamic nature of the HBV quasispecies whereby a strong selection for a single baseline variant was linked to a lower variability within the core region pre- and post-treatment. Leucine (L) at position 76 was determined to be the most highly conserved residue and the role of this amino acid was assessed by substitutions of Valine (V) or Proline (P) at position 76. Proline at position 76 was shown to drastically lower the production of Hepatitis B core antigen protein (HBsAg), likely due to the chemical and physical properties of the amino acid. However, substitution with Valine (V) at a similar position brought about a four-fold increase in the Hepatitis B e antigen protein (HBeAg) production when compared to Leucine at position 76. The decrease in the variability observed was associated with a stable quasispecies population after positive selection of the variant exhibiting high fitness level [<xref rid="B154-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>].</p><p>Although a significant number of RNA viruses demonstrated the existence of quasispecies in their populations due to their low-fidelity polymerases, the phenomenon of quasispecies has been reported to exist in DNA viruses such as Hepatitis B virus (HBV) that replicates via a RNA intermediate. </p><p>In an attempt to elucidate the link between HBV quasispecies and the role of nucleotide analogues present in the quasispecies population, the heterogeneity and distribution of HBV quasispecies using the RT and S regions as a baseline to document the mutation sites were investigated. The quasispecies for the selected regions was analyzed using 608 sequences. In the RT region, no major differences in the composition and diversity of the quasispecies was identified at the nucleotide or amino acid level in patients who responded well to antiviral therapy and those who did not. Similar findings were observed when the S region was examined. However, sequence analysis within RT and S regions showed that the rtM204V/I resistant mutation was observed across the majority of samples prior to the rescue therapy. Interestingly, the frequency of this mutation was noted to drop six months post treatment. Moreover, 3 out of 5 stop codons consistently observed within the RT and S regions were reported to be associated with nucleotide analogue (NA) resistance and affected the HBsAg reading frame. However, the complexity and diversity of the quasispecies of HBV were similar between the CHB patients responsive to the treatment and those who did not. It can be inferred that the characteristics of the quasispecies in CHB patients at the start of the study was not associated to the various viral responses observed in the cohort. Hence, the RT and S regions might not be adequate sites to monitor the response of CHB patients to the rescue treatment [<xref rid="B155-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>].</p><p>Another challenge to overcome is to accurately determine the origin and spread of a founder population of the virus. Hence, the discrepancies in the evolution of HBV was investigated. Eight related patients with acquired chronic HBV through mother-to-infant transmission were selected and the viral genomes isolated were analyzed. Sequence analysis indicated that the samples originated from a single source of HBV genotype B2 (HBV-B2) which diverged from a tiny common ancestral pool regardless of the route of acquisition. Between individuals, viral strains obtained from a time point showed evidence that they originated from a small pool of the previous time point. This conferred the strain an advantage over other strains with regards to the recovery of the founder state shortly after transmission to the new host and the adaptation to the local environment within the host. Natural selection rather than genetic drift was hypothesized to be the root cause for the evolution of HBV, due to the observed varying patterns of divergence at synonymous and non-synonymous sites. This was in line with the higher rate of substitutions within the host rather than between hosts. Approximately 85/88 amino acid residues changed from common to rare residues. Since these changes were shown not to be a random process, it is concluded that the HBV was able to evolve and change but was limited to a defined range of phenotypes. It can be argued that the mechanism observed thus far suggest that the adaptive mutations accumulated in one individual would not be maintained in another individual and might revert after transmission. Hence, within the host, substitutions were higher than between hosts [<xref rid="B156-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>].</p><p>Sera collected from two remote rural communities of Nigeria showed that 11% of the population were actively infected with HBV despite limited contacts with other populations. The high prevalence of HBV infection suggested that the transmission of the parental strain introduced was very efficient within the two selected communities. Further analysis showed that the HBV variants belonged to either genotype A or E, with the predominant genotype HBV/E, having a higher prevalence of 96.4%. Subsequent analysis of HBV quasispecies from 24 residents showed that each individual was infected with many different HBV variants from genotypes D and G. This added complexity to the circulating population of HBV in each community. A large network of common sequences was observed among individuals of the community and this is considered as proof of transmission. Furthermore, this pattern of HBV transmission was hypothesized to be linked to recurrent infections with multiple HBV variants or widespread superinfection with varying HBV variants. The close link observed thus far between the HBV/E variants and the recurrent sharing of HBV sequences among individuals made it difficult to clearly distinguish between the HBV/E variants. This suggested that the population of variants could be considered as one swarm of HBV evolving in many different hosts. The coalescent analysis also suggested that the related HBV/E variants in the community originated from one individual HBV variant that was prevalent many years prior to the parental strain being introduced in that community [<xref rid="B157-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec11-ijms-20-04657"><title>11. Conclusions</title><p>RNA viruses are responsible for numerous outbreaks of viral infections with substantial levels of fatality. We discussed how genetic variants carrying spontaneous mutations could give rise to diverse plaque morphologies in different RNA viruses. How the specific mutations could affect viral replications and have an impact on the virulence of the plaque variants are reviewed. The existence of quasispecies in the viral RNA populations is also explored. Many of the RNA viruses displayed different plaque morphologies and these variants could have arisen from a genetically diverse quasispecies population. Such diverse quasispecies in a population could be a key contributing factor to elevated levels of virulence exhibited by the RNA viruses. Through an extensive analysis of different plaque variants and quasispecies within a population, this study could shed more light on the evolutionary pattern and virulence of RNA viruses. More intricate in vitro and in vivo examination of the phenomenon of quasispecies and the relationship between plaque size determinants and virulence should be undertaken to reveal if serious infections are caused by a single strain or through the combined action of diverse quasispecies carrying different mutations. This can be a valuable tool to characterize the mechanisms that led to viral evolution and adaptation in a host. Eventually, discovering an answer to these concerns might ultimately help to design effective vaccines against the ever-evolving RNA viruses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge that the figures in this paper were created using BioRender Software under the license of Sunway university.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>M.B.M. and M.M. wrote the manuscript.
