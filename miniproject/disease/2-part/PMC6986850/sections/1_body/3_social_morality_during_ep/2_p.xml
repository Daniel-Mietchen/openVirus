<p>Other films, however, have gone further and tried to examine some of the causes of this fear and panic; in many films, the roots lie in society’s response to perceived declines in social morality. One of the earliest examples is 
 <italic>Die Pest in Florenz</italic> [
 <italic>The Plague of Florence</italic>] (1918, Fritz Lang), which focused on the real outbreak of the Black Death in Florence in the mid-14th century and portrayed death from plague as a response to immoral behavior and sexual debauchery. The connection between disease and deteriorating social morality came from actual observations of contemporaries at the time, for example, the views of Giovanni Villani (
 <italic>Nuova Cronica</italic>) and Giovanni Boccaccio (
 <italic>Decameron</italic>). In several films, the plague became used as an explicit punishment for immorality and wrongdoing: 
 <italic>The Pied Piper</italic> (1972, Jacques Demy), 
 <italic>The Hour of the Pig</italic> (1993, Leslie Megahey), and especially 
 <italic>Anazapta </italic>(2002, Alberto Sciamma), in which plague was a supposed consequence of the brutal rape of a lord’s wife by the village.
