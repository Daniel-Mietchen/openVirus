RNA is much more than an intermediary between DNA and protein; it can adopt complex three-dimensional structures that may be altered by single nucleotide mutations, with consequent effects on its functions. Thus, since RNA structures are critical to the replication of many viruses, they are also substrates upon which evolution can act. This can include non-coding RNAs produced during replication, as well as genomic RNA and transcripts. Viral RNA is sensed by different pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune response, such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I). There is thus pressure on viral RNA to evade immune detection such as by nucleotide and codon usage bias (adenosine by HIV-1), the presence of specific secondary structures that restrict transcription to low levels, or the maintenance of single-stranded RNA regions to avoid PRR detection. In turn, viral RNA structures have influenced the human immune system, such as the evolution of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus.
