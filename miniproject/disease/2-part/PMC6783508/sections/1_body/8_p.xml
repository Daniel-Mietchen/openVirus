<p>Finally, ERVs can be upregulated in response to acute exogenous viral infections and this may contribute to the antiviral response. In the paper by

 <italic>Papio cynocephalus</italic> Endogenous Retrovirus (PcEV) was found to be upregulated in macaque plasma and tissues (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and spleen) in response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. Further, upregulation of the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG), STAT1, an important marker of the early antiviral response, correlated with the increased PcEV RNA levels (
