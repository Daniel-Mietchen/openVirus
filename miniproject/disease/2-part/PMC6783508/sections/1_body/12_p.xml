<p>From ancient germline infections to modern epidemics, outbreaks or emerging infections, our contributors explored the evolutionary interplay of human immunity and viruses at the molecular, individual, or population level. They offered thought-provoking hypotheses for further exploration, reviewed publications, and provided novel results in the field of human antiviral immunity field. This shows the power of integrating evolutionary theory with research of antiviral immunity and we hope that our special topic will further promote evolutionary thinking across fields of human pathogen research.</p>
