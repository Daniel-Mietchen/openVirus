<p>APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G, A3G) is a cellular cytidine deaminase that mutates retroviral genomes, thereby being a key host cell mechanism to debilitate viruses that embed in the genome. In an original article herein, the authors suggest that the action of A3G extends to adaptive immunity, suggesting that HIV-1 cytotoxic T cell (CTL) escape mutants are generated through A3G activity (

The authors use a bioinformatics approach to simulate A3G mutations and show that HIV-1 mutants are biased toward cytotoxic T cell (CTL) escape mutants. These results point toward an evolutionary adaptation of the HIV-1 genome that essentially “hijacks” human antiretroviral activity to counteract T-cell immunity.
