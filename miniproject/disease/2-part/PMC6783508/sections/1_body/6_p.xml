They show that transcription of HERV-K proteases varies according to the functional motifs, with two motifs (DTGAD, DTGVD) being more abundant among all HERV-K integrations, but also more active, compared to the less common motifs, in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and breast cancer. These results are important not only for understanding the interactions among HERV-K integrations evolutionarily, but also to appreciate the diversity of enzymatic targets when designing anti-HERV based treatments.
