<p id="Par44">The results of this study suggested that based on the abundance among the cases analysed, Rotaviruses were the main RNA viruses involved in neonatal diarrhoea in pigs. Although 
 <italic>Kobuvirus</italic> was the most common virus detected, probably it was the primary agent of diarrhoea only in a small number of cases. Similarly, 
 <italic>Sapovirus</italic> would be responsible of a single diarrhoea case. For the other examined viruses, the results indicated that many animals were infected in early life but the association with enteric disease was unclear. The NGS approach applied permit not only the detection RNA viruses present in a sample, but also to determine their relative abundances. This approach can be used for a more comprehensive diagnosis of neonatal diarrhoea and is useful for the examination of the RNA virome in faeces.
