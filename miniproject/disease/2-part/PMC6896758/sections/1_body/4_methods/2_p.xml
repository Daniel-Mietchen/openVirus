<p id="Par46">Faecal samples were kept frozen at − 80 °C until used. When needed, samples were thawed and diluted 1:5 in sterile distilled water. Then, to remove debris, diluted samples were sequentially clarified for 2 min at 2000 g, 5 min at 5000 g and 10 min at 10,000 g. Total RNA extraction was performed using the TRIzol reagent (ThermoFischer Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For each reaction, 250 μL of the diluted faeces was used.</p>
