<p id="Par48">In the cases where a presumptive aetiological agent could not be clearly established, further analysis to detect unknown RNA viruses were undertaken with the program rnaSPAdes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], an RNAseq de novo assembler included in the package SPADES [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Also, the RNAseq outputs were analysed with VirFind, a web-based bioinformatic pipeline specifically designed for virus detection and discovery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In both cases, the default parameters provided by the programs were used.
