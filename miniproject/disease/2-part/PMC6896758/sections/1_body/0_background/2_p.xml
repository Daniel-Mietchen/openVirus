<p id="Par25">Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) allows for an in-depth characterization of the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations by directly sequencing viral strains at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The technology has been successfully applied to identify the diversity in the viral genome of pigs’ faeces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The aim of the present study is to explore the diversity of RNA viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in Spain, applying a tailor-made NGS protocol using the total RNA extracted, without any amplification step, where the results obtained represent not only the RNA viruses present in a sample, but also their relative abundances.
