 <p id="Par50">Regarding the paper “High levels of unreported intraspecific diversity among RNA viruses in faeces of neonatal piglets with diarrhoea” (authors: Martí Cortey, Ivan Díaz, Anna Vidal, Gerard Martín-Valls, Giovanni Franzo, Pedro José Gómez de Nova, Laila Darwich, Héctor Puente, Ana Carvajal, Marga Martín, Enric Mateu) has been done on the basis of clinical testing. According to Directive 63/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council, on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes -Article 1, point 5(b) “non-experimental clinical veterinary practices”- the procedures carried out to obtain data are not within the scope of named directive. Hence, no authorization from the ethics committee on animal and human experimentation from the UAB and UL was necessary.</p>
