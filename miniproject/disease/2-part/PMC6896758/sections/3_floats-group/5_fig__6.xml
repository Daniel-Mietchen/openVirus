  <p>Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the p-distance among the nucleotide sequences of the VP7 segment for 
   <italic>Rotavirus C</italic>. Along the branches, percentage of bootstrap values based on 10,000 replicates. Only values equal or larger than 80% are shown. The dataset contains 34 reference sequences representing the 11 
   <italic>RVC</italic> VP7 genotypes described plus the 17 sequences – marked with a circle – reported in this work. The division of genotypes is based on the 85–86% nucleotide cut-off value proposed by [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; accordingly, two new genotypes (labelled as GX1 and GX2 in the Figure) are tentatively proposed
