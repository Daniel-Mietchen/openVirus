  <title>Pregnancy affects T cell response to 3′UTR-Δ10-LAV vaccination in A129 mice.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Experiment scheme. Top scheme: 12-week-old female A129 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 or 5)were mated with male mice; at E0.5, the pregnant mice were subcutaneously immunized with 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU 3′UTR-Δ10-LAV (Δ10) or PBS; at E18.5, they were sacrificed and splenocytes were harvested for T cell analysis. Bottom scheme: age-matched non-pregnant female mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 or 6) were immunized and analyzed for T cell response to Δ10 vaccination, as described above for the pregnant group.

   <sup>+</sup> or CD8
   <sup>+</sup>. Samples were acquired with BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer instrument. Total splenocytes were first gated to exclude, debris, cell fragments, and dead cells based on forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC). CD3

   <sup>+</sup> T cells were next gated for analysis of cytokine production.

   <bold>d</bold> Total numbers of CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. Splenocytes were stimulated by a ZIKV E peptide. Cytokines IL-2 (
   <bold>e</bold>) and IFN-γ (
   <bold>f</bold>) in cell culture media were measured after splenocytes had been stimulated by the viral E peptide for 3 days. An unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic> test was performed to analyze statistical significance between indicated groups. **
