<p id="Par35">The pregnant mice were immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of 3’UTR-∆10-LAV or PBS by subcutaneous route at E0.5. Age-matched non-pregnant mice were immunized at the same time to serve as controls. Eighteen days after immunization, the mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were harvested for analyses. Approximately 2.5 × 10

 </sup>. During the final 5 h of stimulation, BD GolgiPlug (BD Bioscience, Cat. no.: 555029; dilution 1:1,000) was added to block protein transport. Cells were stained with antibodies for CD3 (APC-conjugated; Invitrogen, Cat. no.: 17003182; dilution 1:10), CD4 (FITC-conjugated; BD Biosciences, Cat. no.: 557307; dilution 1:10), or CD8 (FITC-conjugated; BD Biosciences, Cat. no.: 11008182; dilution 1:10). Afterward, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin. Cells were then incubated with PE-conjugated anti-IFN-γ (Invitrogen, Cat. no.: 12731182; dilution: 1:10) and PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-TNF-α (Invitrogen, Cat. no.: 25732180; dilution: 1:10) antibodies or control PE-conjugated rat IgG1. Samples were processed with a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer instrument. Dead cells were excluded on the basis of forward and side light scatter. Data were analyzed with a Cflow Plus Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).
