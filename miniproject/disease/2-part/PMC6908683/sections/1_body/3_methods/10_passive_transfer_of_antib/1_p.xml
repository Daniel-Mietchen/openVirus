<p id="Par33">Mouse immune sera from 3’UTR-∆10-LAV immunized A129 mice were pooled and passively transferred into 12-week-old female A129 mice via the intravenous (I.V.) route. One day after serum transfer, the mice were bled and immediately challenged with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU ZIKV PRVABC59 via subcutaneous route. On day 2 post-challenge, the mice were bled for measuring viremia. All mice were sacrificed on day 8 post-challenge and organs were harvested for measuring viral loads by plaque assay as described above.
