<p id="Par3">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has recently emerged and caused major epidemics

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. The most devastating disease of ZIKV infection is congenital Zika syndrome, including microcephaly, congenital malformations, and demise fetuses from infected pregnant women

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. In adults, ZIKV infection is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease that can lead to paralysis

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. One out of seven infants born to mothers with laboratory-confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy has birth defects, most likely due to in utero transmission

 </sup>. Its teratogenic potential and explosive epidemics led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Since then, various ZIKV vaccine platforms have been developed, with the goal to control future epidemics and to prevent congenital syndrome. These vaccine platforms include inactivated, subunit, and live-attenuated vaccines

 </sup>. We previously developed a live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine with a 10-nucleotide deletion in the 3ʹUTR of viral genome (3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV). A single-dose immunization of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV protected against ZIKV infection and in utero transmission in mice and non-human primates

 </sup>. This vaccine candidate has an excellent safety profile, as evidenced by &gt;1000-fold lower neurovirulence than the two licensed, live-attenuated flavivirus vaccines (yellow fever 17D and Japanese encephalitis SA 14-14-2)
