<p id="Par15">The third experiment determined the minimal NT
 <sub>50</sub> level of maternally transferred immunity that was required to block in utero transmission when the female offspring became pregnant (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Six- to seven-week-old female offspring born to maternally vaccinated dams (subcutaneously immunized with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV at E0.5) were mated with male mice. At E10.5, the pregnant offspring were bled for NT
 <sub>50</sub> measurement and subcutaneously challenged with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU ZIKV PRVABC59. The pregnant offspring were quantified for viremia at E12.5 as well as for organ viral loads at E18.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Correlation analysis suggested that different minimal NT
 <sub>50</sub> titers are required to protect different organs against ZIKV infection during pregnancy: 1/200, 1/290, 1/290, and 1/430 for viremia, maternal brain, spleen, and placenta, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9b–i</xref>). Since IgG is the main trans-placenta antibody

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
