<p id="Par10">Taken together, the above safety results showed that maternal vaccination with 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV did not yield any detectable adverse effects on pregnancy, fetal development, or offspring behavior. We previously showed that a single immunization with 10 FFU of 3’UTR-∆10-LAV elicited sterilizing immunity (defined by no increase of neutralizing antibody titers after WT ZIKV challenge) in A129 mice

 </sup>. Thus, the dose of 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU that we used in the above safety experiments is 10,000-fold higher than the 10-FFU sterilizing dose, underscoring the excellent safety profile of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV.
