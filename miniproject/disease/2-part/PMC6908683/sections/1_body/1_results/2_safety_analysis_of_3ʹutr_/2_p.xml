<p id="Par8">The second safety experiment examined potential adverse effects when mice were immunized at E10.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). We chose E10.5 to vaccinate the mice after placenta has been formed at E9.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Infection of pregnant mice at this time point with WT or 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV did not increase fetal resorption (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). However, WT virus, but not 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV, caused significant fetal weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). Corroboratively, infectious virus was detected in maternal spleen (50%), brain (100%), and placenta (100%) from the WT ZIKV group; in contrast, no infectious virus was found in any organs from the 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV group (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4d, f</xref>). No infectious virus was detected in the fetal brains from WT and 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV groups under this experimental condition (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4g</xref>). Corroboratively, qRT-PCR showed that the WT virus-infected animals developed viral RNA in placenta (100%; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4h</xref>) and fetal head (100%; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4i</xref>). Although the 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV-infected mice also developed viral RNA in placenta, the viral RNA load was 673-fold lower than that in the WT virus-infected placenta (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4h</xref>). Furthermore, no viral RNA was detected in the fetal head from the 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV-infected animals (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4i</xref>). At E18.5 or E21, comparable neutralizing antibody titers were detected in dams from the WT and 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV groups (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4j</xref>). In contrast, no neutralizing activities were detected from the fetuses collected at E18.5, but low neutralizing antibody levels (~1/130) were found in the pups born at E21 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4k</xref>), suggesting that vaccination at E10.5 may not allow sufficient time to develop maternal IgG antibodies that are transferrable to fetuses
