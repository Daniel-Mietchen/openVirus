<p id="Par21">We explored the possibility of maternal vaccination to prevent in utero transmission during pregnancy. Our results indicate that 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV has an excellent safety profile for maternal vaccination: no detectable infectious virus or viral RNA in fetal heads after vaccination, and no detectable adverse effects on murine pregnancy, fetal development, or offspring behavior. Despite these promising results, we could not exclude the possibility that maternal vaccination may cause subtle adverse effect on fetal development that could not be detected by the current assays. Infection of placenta with WT ZIKV was recently shown to mediate pregnancy complications

 </sup>, suggesting that even a very low level of 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV replication in maternal organs might cause potential immunopathology in developing fetuses. Nevertheless, we showed that a single maternal vaccination of 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV probably conferred sterilizing immunity, prevented apparent in utero transmission, transferred maternal antibodies to pups, and protected neonates against ZIKV infection. However, the protection of offspring declined as the maternal neutralizing antibody titers waned. Altogether, the results suggest that 3ʹUTR-∆10-LAV may be considered for maternal vaccination. In support of this idea, maternal vaccination is recommended by the WHO for yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis vaccines during outbreaks in endemic regions or when the risk of viral infection is high
