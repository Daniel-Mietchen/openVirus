<p id="Par20">Developed in 1968, JE vaccine was largely unaffordable due to costs. The immunization coverage with the vaccine was low and had no significant impact on the JE pandemic. After inclusion into the EPI in 2008, the national JE incidence rate remained at a low level [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To estimate the immunization coverage, we used the number of the 1st and 2nd doses of JE vaccine (JE1 and JE2) administered through routine immunization in Yunnan Province each year as numerators, and the published data on number of new births reported in the Statistical Year Book for Yunnan Province as denominators.
