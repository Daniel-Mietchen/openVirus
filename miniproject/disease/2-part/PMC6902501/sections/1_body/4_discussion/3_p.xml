 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Shift of cases to adults (as opposed to children) indicate that the older age groups are now at more risk of JE than the target population. To combat this, it is important to continue strengthening the vaccination program among children, as this will ensure that their risk of JE remains low even as they grow into adulthood. However, focus should also now be put to ensure that adults at risk in the endemic areas get vaccinated for JE. As it is, the vaccine is out-of-reach for many adults as they have to pay out of their pockets. The vaccine should therefore be made more affordable and available to the at-risk groups in the endemic areas. It should also be integrated into routine EPI for adults at risk. Whether repeat vaccination is needed during teenage-hood and/ or adulthood also need to be evaluated depending on efficacy and long-term protection provided by the vaccine.
