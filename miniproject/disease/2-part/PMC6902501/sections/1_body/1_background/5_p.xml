<p id="Par17">Yunnan is one of the southwest provinces in China most affected by JE, bordering Myanmar, the Laos and Viet Nam. There is cross-border movement in this province with cases of JE reported in both locals and migrants. However, to-date there has been no publications analyzing cases of JE which include the migrant population in Yunnan. We thus set out, using case-based JE surveillance data from 2005 to 2017 in Yunnan Province, to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases before and after the inclusion of JE vaccination into routine EPI program.</p>
