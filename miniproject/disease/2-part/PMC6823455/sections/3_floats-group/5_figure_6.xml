  <p>Expression of ZIKV RNA and host innate immune genes in human DCs and macrophages infected with two recent Asian lineage ZIKV strains. Differentiated DCs and macrophages from four independent blood donors were separately infected with GWUH or HPF strains at MOI of 2 and analyzed for the expression of viral RNA (panel A) or host cell antiviral genes (panel B) at different times after infection during a 4-day infection experiment. (
   <bold>A</bold>) For viral RNA expression cells were collected at different times after infection, cells from different donors were pooled and total cellular RNA was extracted and qRT-PCR analysis for ZIKV RNA (using NS5 gene as a target) was carried out. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The DCs from different donors were collected, pooled and total cellular RNA was isolated followed by quantitation of IFN-λ1, IFN-β, CXCL10 and MxA mRNA expression by qRT-PCR. As a positive control cells were infected with influenza A/Beijing/353/89 virus at MOI of 1 for 24 h. The results are shown as fold induction over the mock sample and the data is representative of two individual experiments (altogether n = 8).
