<p id="Par5">In the present study, we have characterized Zika virus infection in primary human monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages. Firstly, we evaluated the susceptibility of human immune cells to a ZIKV infection. Secondly, we compared the infection pattern of Asian lineage fetal brain and blood ZIKV isolates and a historical African strain (initially a monkey isolate) in both cell types. We observed that the recent Asian/American lineage Zika viruses replicated well in DCs but poorly in macrophages, while the African lineage virus showed limited infectivity in both cell types. The ability of the virus to replicate correlated well with the magnitude of innate antiviral gene expression and cytokine production. However, all ZIKV strains analyzed induced innate immune responses in such a level that an antiviral state, as evidenced by enhanced expression of antiviral MxA protein, was established in both studied human cell types.</p>
