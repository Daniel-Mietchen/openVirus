 </sup>, several studies have thus focused on identifying the target cells of ZIKV infection in the placenta and the uterus. Several placental cell types have been shown to be permissive to ZIKV infection, including placental fibroblast, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), placental trophoblasts and placental macrophages (Höfbauer cells)

 <sup>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>, we also found out that human blood monocyte-derived macrophages can be infected with recent ZIKV isolates, even though the level of virus replication and host IFN gene expression remains at a very low level. Quicke and colleagues showed that placental macrophages were highly permissive to the epidemic ZIKV strains which induced the production of IFNs
 <sup>

 </sup>. In addition, the study by Foo and co-workers shows that during pregnancy, the primary target cells for ZIKV infection in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> whole blood cell infection are CD14+ monocytes

 </sup>. Furthermore, the same authors demonstrated that an Asian lineage ZIKV infection promoted the differentiation of non-classical M2-type, IL-10-expressing immunosuppressive monocytes by inhibiting the IFN pathway. However, the infection with an African ZIKV strain led to monocyte differentiation to M1-type inflammatory responses with increased IFN-induced CXCL10 production
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. This is well in line with our macrophage results, where the early African lineage virus was able to induce innate immune responses (IFN-λ1, IFN-β and CXCL10 expression) but innate immunity was more weakly induced by the Asian ZIKV strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These findings may provide insights into immunological differences between early African and recent Asian-American ZIKV strains which may be associated with increased frequency of congenital infections.
