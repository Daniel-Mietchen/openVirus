<p id="Par22">Surprisingly, we observed IRF3 and STAT2 degradation in macrophages at early times of ZIKV infection. This degradation was evident for both African and Asian strains. Macrophages are professional phagocytic cells, and viral recognition leads to an antiviral response including the activation of phagocytosis of the virus and phagolysosome activation. ZIKV NS5 has been associated with proteasomal degradation of STAT2, but this takes place only after viral NS5 protein is expressed

 </sup>. It was of interest that the degradation of IRF3 and STAT2 in macrophages took place at early hours of ZIKV infection, clearly before viral protein expression occurred (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). This suggests, that during the ZIKV entry process, the virus is likely activating the host proteasome/lysosome pathways. This finding could provide insights into a completely new evasion strategy of ZIKV where the early events of ZIKV entry trigger the degradation of innate signaling molecules. Other flaviviruses have been shown to utilize various immune evasion strategies in addition of inhibiting the signal transduction by non-structural proteins. For instance, Dengue and Tick-borne encephalitis viruses have been shown to use specific membrane vesicle structures to hide viral replication products in order to evade the host recognition

 </sup>. Further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms of degradation of host signaling molecules during the early phases of ZIKV infection in human macrophages.
