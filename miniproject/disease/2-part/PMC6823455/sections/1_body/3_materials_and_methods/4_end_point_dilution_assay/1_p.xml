<p id="Par30">For determining the viral titers from ZIKV samples Vero E6 cells were cultured in 96-well plates. A dilution series of up to 10
 <sup>âˆ’6</sup> was made from each sample, and each dilution was used to infect 8 parallel culture wells. The cytopathic effect was observed under the light microscope at day 7 post-infection, and each well was scored either positive or negative for virus infection. The Spearman-Karber method was used to calculate the results which are presented as log TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml and the detection limit for the assay was 0.499.
