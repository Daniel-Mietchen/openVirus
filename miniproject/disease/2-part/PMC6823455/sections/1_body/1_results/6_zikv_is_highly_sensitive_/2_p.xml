<p id="Par17">Since it was apparent that type I IFNs played an important role in inhibiting the replication of ZIKV, we conducted 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infection experiments in wild-type or type I IFN receptor chain 1 (IFNAR1) knock-out mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs were productively infected by the Asian lineage GWUH or HPF Zika viruses and the expression of ZIKV RNA, as analyzed by qRT-PCR, was very high in IFNAR1 KO cells as compared to the wild-type MEFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Viral RNA levels were approximately 50–100-fold higher in IFNAR1 KO cells compared to those seen in wild-type cells, indicating an important role of type I IFNs in restricting the infection in cell culture.
