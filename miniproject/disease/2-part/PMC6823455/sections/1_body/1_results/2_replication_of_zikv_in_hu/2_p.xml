<p id="Par9">In order to evaluate the capability of ZIKV strains to replicate and produce new progeny viruses, we challenged the cells with low doses of ZIKV GWUH and #976 viruses (MOI 0.2, 1 or 5 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell). To analyze the productivity of the infection, cell culture supernatants were collected at different time points after infection and viral titers were determined in Vero E6 cells with an end-point dilution assay. Already at 24 h after the infection, GWUH virus-infected DCs were found to produce high levels of infectious viruses and the viral titers ranged from 10
 <sup>4</sup> to almost 10
 <sup>7</sup>/ml depending on the input MOI values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). In #976 virus-infected DCs the virus production was slower and the amount of secreted viruses continued to increase up to 96 h after infection reaching TCID
 <sub>50</sub> values of 10
 <sup>3</sup> to 10
 <sup>5</sup>/ml (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). In macrophages, instead, the productivity of ZIKV infection was less efficient and secreted virus titers remained at low, similar to inoculum virus levels ranging from 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> values/ml (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Even though there were differences in the replication of ZIKV in cells obtained from different blood donors, ZIKV was able to replicate both in DCs and macrophages. However, clearly detectable increases in ZIKV production was only seen in DCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
