<p id="Par58">The recent YF outbreaks allowed the investigation of a variety of NHP outside the Amazon Basin. Following the pattern previously observed, most YFV-infected specimens belonged to 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> spp., and for the first time YF was described in 
 <italic>Leontopithecus rosalia.</italic> NHP are amplifier hosts for YFV but are not viral reservoirs since they die or develop cellular and humoral immunity against the virus. However, studies to better understand the duration of protective immunity against YFV in NHP are required.
