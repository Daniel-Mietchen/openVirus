<p id="Par36">Given the ecological plasticity and the ubiquitous environmental distribution of 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> (in urban, rural, and forest settings in tropical countries, including Brazil), this mosquito could be a bridge vector between sylvatic and urban environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Experimental studies have demonstrated that 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> can transmit YFV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], and it was found naturally infected with the virus, in a rural setting of Minas Gerais state, in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is widespread in all the tropical and subtropical regions. This mosquito has anthropophilic and endophilic habits and is the urban vector of YFV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Despite the sensitivity to YFV infection and the high infestation indices of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> in urban and periurban areas in Brazil [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>,
