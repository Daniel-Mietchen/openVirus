 <italic>Sabethes</italic> spp. share some ecological characteristics with 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp., such as the daily activity, primatophilia, acrodendrophilia, and preferential oviposition in tree hollows. While some species are widespread in Central and South America (
 <italic>Sabethes chloropterus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes cyaneus</italic>), others seem to be restricted to South America (
 <italic>Sabethes glaucodaemon</italic>, 
 <italic>Sabethes soperi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sabethes albiprivus</italic>) [

 <italic>.</italic> Within the genera, 
 <italic>S. chloropterus</italic> is limited to forest areas and considered the primary YFV sylvatic vector. Their eggs can persist through the dry season, which is probably a key factor in YFV maintenance through unfavorable dry periods [
