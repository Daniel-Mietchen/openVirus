<p>Currently, there are no specific antiviral therapies clinically available against PeV-A infection. Treatment options are limited to supportive care and occasionally passive immunization by the administration of IVIG [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The development of targeted antiviral drugs requires detailed knowledge of the virus lifecycle but this is poorly defined [
 <xref rid="B149-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Few studies have screened EV inhibitors against PeV-A but these have indicated that the capsid morphology, protease functions, and host factor dependency differ between these two genera [
 <xref rid="B149-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. For instance, pleconaril (an EV capsid inhibitor) was unable to inhibit PeV-A replication due to differences in the capsid structures, whereby large amino acid side chains block the hydrophobic drug binding site on the surface of PeV-A [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Similarly, EV 3C protease, EV 2C inhibitors, and golgi transport inhibitor (Brefeldin A, effective against EV) failed to inhibit PeV-A1 replication [

 <xref rid="B150-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Another host factor-targeting compound, the antifungal agent Itraconazole (ITZ), was shown to have antiviral activity against PeV-A3 but not against PeV-A1 [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. ITZ is highly interesting as it is a FDA-approved drug and has a favorable safety profile in pediatric patients. Thus, ITZ looks promising for PeV-A3 treatment but further research into the pathogenesis of PeV-A is needed to design targeted antiviral therapies.
