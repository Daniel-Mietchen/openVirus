<p>Given that maternal nAbs appear to be protective against severe disease related to PeV-A infection, the development of therapeutic mAbs is an unmet clinical need [

 <xref rid="B128-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. One of the mAbs is capable of neutralizing PeV-A3 but unfortunately only the antigenically distinct prototype strain and not the circulating clinical strains [
