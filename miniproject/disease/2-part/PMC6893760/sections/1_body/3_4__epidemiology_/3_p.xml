<p>PeV-A infection also shows a clear seasonality with a majority of infections recorded in late summer and fall [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Ultimately, epidemiological studies reporting PeV-A prevalence vary greatly between cohorts in age, clinical presentation, and sample types collected, hampering direct comparisons. Increases in sequencing efforts and standardization of diagnostic PeV-A testing will lead to improved insights on both PeV-A epidemiology and diversity.
