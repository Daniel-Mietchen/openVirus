<p>In parallel, seroepidemiological studies determine the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against a specific pathogen in sera of a defined population. Such studies provide a good estimate of virus prevalence, the potential immune status of different patient groups, and circulation in humans. Seropositivity of PeV-A1 nAbs sharply increases in children aged two to five years and is nearly universal in adults based on reports from Finland, the Netherlands, and Japan [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Recently, a high overall seroprevalence (68.9%) of PeV-A3 among Dutch, the USA, and Australian populations was shown, which is suggestive of widespread global circulation. Our age-stratified analyses indicated that the infection generally occurs in children younger than 10 years. However, since cross-neutralization among the genotypes PeV-A1/A2 and PeV-A4 to A6 has been observed, unequivocal conclusions about the epidemiology of these genotypes are difficult to base on this data alone [
