<p>The role of T-cell immunity in picornavirus infection is not well-defined. In a single study published on T-cell immunity against PeV-A infection, reactivity to the capsid proteins was observed in 20 adults by measuring T-cell proliferation upon exposure to recombinant VP0, VP3, and VP1 proteins [
 <xref rid="B125-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Increased T-cell proliferation in response to PeV-A1 capsids indicate that T-cell immunity could play a role during PeV-A infection.
