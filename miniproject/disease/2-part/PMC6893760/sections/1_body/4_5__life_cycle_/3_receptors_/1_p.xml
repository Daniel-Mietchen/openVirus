<p>For most PeV-A genotypes, the receptors involved in viral binding and entry have not been identified and it remains to be seen if there is a universal PeV-A receptor. Presently, nt divergence in the receptor binding capsid VP1-encoding sequence is used to subgroup PeV-A into the 19 detected genotypes [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Some of these genotypes contain an integrin-binding tripeptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif in the VP1 C terminus [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. 8 of the 24 known integrin (ITG) heterodimer combinations can bind cellular ligands via the RGD motif [
