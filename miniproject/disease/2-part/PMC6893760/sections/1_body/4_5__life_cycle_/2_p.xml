<p>Release can occur through different mechanisms in picornaviruses. Non-enveloped viruses have been traditionally thought to be released via cell lysis. However, several independent reports now point toward an alternative non-lytic egress mechanism. Hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, EV-A71, and coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3) have all been reported to exit infected cells within host cell derived vesicle structures [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The proposed mechanism involves hijacking autophagy pathway components to induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles, capable of fusing with the plasma membrane for exit [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-01062" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. These virus-containing extracellular microvesicles are speculated to facilitate virus dissemination and immune evasion [
