<p>Both the innate and adaptive immune responses have been shown to be different for PeV-A3 as compared to the other PeV-As. Our group showed on HAE cultures, PeV-A3 induced a much stronger activation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory signaling [

This is supported by the fact that elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and systemic inflammatory response have been linked to the severe pathogenesis of EV-A71 [
