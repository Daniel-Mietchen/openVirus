<p>Although the review has focused on the PeV-A species as a whole, special attention is warranted for PeV-A3 which is repeatedly observed as an exception amongst the PeV-A genotypes. For instance, the lack of a RGD motif and biannual circulation of PeV-A3 in comparison to other PeV-A genotypes are interesting. Furthermore, PeV-A3 rarely recombines with any of the other types but recombination does occur within the genotype [

The reason behind the severe clinical presentation of PeV-A3 as opposed to the more prevalent PeV-A1 remains a critical question. The clinical differences in PeV-A1 vs PeV-A3 could perhaps be linked to the immune response to these genotypes.
