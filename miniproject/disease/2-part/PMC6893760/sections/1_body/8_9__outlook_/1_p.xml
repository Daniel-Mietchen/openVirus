<p>In this review, we discussed the epidemiology of PeV-A and summarized the current understanding in PeV-A pathogenesis. However, information on the prevalence and pathogenesis of PeV-A is limited. PeV-A studies have relied on the use of immortalized cell lines that, while useful, are still poor models for pathogenesis studies. Animal models expressing virus-specific human receptors have been the gold standard in picornavirus research but no such model exists for PeV-A infection. Newborn mice and cynomolgus monkeys have been experimentally infected with PeV-A1 and newborn mice with PeV-A3 but with no apparent pathologies associated [
