<p>Alternatively, the use of complex organotypic human cell culture models could be a way forward in understanding PeV-A pathogenesis. One such model is the well-differentiated HAE cell culture system in which primary human epithelial cells from airway tissue are cultured on transwell inserts. Our group used this model for studying PeV-A infection and identified basal cells as the cell type that PeV-A1 and A3 infect in the airway. A recent breakthrough in similarly culturing the gut epithelium using stem cells from intestinal crypts could also be used for studying PeV-A [
