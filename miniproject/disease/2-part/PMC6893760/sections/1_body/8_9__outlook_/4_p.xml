<p>Perhaps, one of the most intriguing open question in PeV-A biology is the genotype specific disease association. Why is severe illness almost exclusively caused by PeV-A3 and not by other genotypes? We have hypothesized based on experimental findings in HAE models and observed humoral response that this could be due to the immune response against PeV-A3 infection. Further experiments are needed to assess whether this is indeed the case. Future research in this area should also aim to characterize the molecular and cellular determinants of PeV-A immune modulation across various tissues in both infants and adults.</p>
