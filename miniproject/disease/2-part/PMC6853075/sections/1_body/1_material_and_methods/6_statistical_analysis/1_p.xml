<p>The relationships between HI (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>), rainfall, and temperature were determined by Pearson’s correlation analysis, with the aid of Bioestat
 <sup>®</sup> package version 5.0 (Brazil). Descriptive analysis of clinical data was performed using the Microsoft Office Excel
 <sup>®</sup> 2007 program (USA). The minimum infection rate (MIR) was calculated by dividing the number of pools infected by specimens by the total number of immature phases tested for each specimen, multiplied by 1,000 (
