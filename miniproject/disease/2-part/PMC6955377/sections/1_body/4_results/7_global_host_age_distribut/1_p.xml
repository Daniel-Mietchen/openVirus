<p>Demographic data from 2008 to 2019 showed that the Victoria lineage was positively skewed toward a younger population (with a median age of 13 y), whereas the Yamagata lineage displayed bimodal distribution (with a median age of 32.5 y,

The kernel density indicates a higher probability of Victoria virus infections under the age of 15, with peak density in 5-y-old children, whereas Yamagata viruses had a higher probability of infection between 0 and 20 y, but with a broader density distribution beyond 30 y of age. The significant difference in age distribution between the Victoria and Yamagata lineages was consistent across all geographical localities (
