<p>We reconstructed the global phylogeography of influenza B viruses using the Markov fields model (

Multiple sources contributed to the 2011–2013 epidemics; however, East Asia constituted &gt;50% of trunk proportions in 2013, while South America, Southeast Asia, and North America appeared to be the major source populations in subsequent years. Consistent with trunk proportions, we observed significant diffusion rates from Southeast Asia (0.70–2.21) into all other geographical areas (

 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="t04" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), and from North America (0.74–1.59) into most regions including East Asia, Europe, Oceania, and South America. Geographic state transition counts and migration pathways further corroborate these results (

 </ext-link>). As such, this suggests that the seeding of Victoria lineage epidemics is driven by different geographic locations, where Southeast Asia and North America are major transmission sources. Notably, North America is the probable ancestral location for seeding HA deletion variants (including Victoria clade 1A.1–1A.3 viruses) (
