<p>The trunk proportions for the Yamagata lineage displayed more continuous virus circulation among multiple geographical regions through time (

Remarkably, Southeast Asia occupied a considerable amount of trunk proportions throughout 2011–2019, indicative of prolonged persistence of Yamagata viruses in human populations. Strongly supported diffusion rates have also occurred from Southeast Asia (0.70–2.72) into all other geographical regions (

While Oceania was less likely a significant source in any given year, interestingly the dynamics of Southeast Asia matched Oceania in the Southern hemisphere rather than a region in the Northern hemisphere. Furthermore, strong diffusion rates from Europe into most other regions are similarly observed. A greater global movement (∼13 decisive pathways) was observed for Yamagata viruses compared to Victoria viruses (∼8 decisive pathways) (
