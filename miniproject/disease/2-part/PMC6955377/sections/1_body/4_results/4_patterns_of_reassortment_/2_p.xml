<p>During periods of greater within-lineage genetic diversity (i.e., during periods when multiple clades of Victoria or Yamagata viruses cocirculated), we observed a greater rate of interclade reassortment. For example, Victoria viruses isolated during 2016–2019 have undergone reassortment at a greater frequency than in other years, when multiple clades with amino acid deletions emerged and cocirculated (

 </xref>) are monophyletic in the PA, HA, and NP phylogenies but segregate into different lineages in the PB2, PB1, NA, MP, and NS trees with segments repeatedly deriving from viruses without an HA deletion; clade 1A.2 viruses (green circles) are monophyletic in the PB2, PB1, HA, and NA phylogenies but are nonmonophyletic in PA, NP, MP, and NS trees; clade 1A.3 clade (magenta circles) are monophyletic in most gene segments except the PA and NS genes; and clade 1A.4 viruses (shown by blue circles) are monophyletic in most gene segments except the NS.
