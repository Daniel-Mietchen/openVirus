<p>Selection pressures for each gene segment were estimated for Victoria and Yamagata lineages separately, using globally representative datasets during 2008â€“2019 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 500). The ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to synonymous (d
 <sub>N</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub>) mutations was estimated using the Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) using DataMonkey (
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Branch-wise d
 <sub>N</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> ratios of the internal vs. external branches were estimated using the 2-model ratio in CODEML (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) in DataMonkey was used to identify codon sites undergoing positive selection, with the significance level of 
 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05. In addition, potential N-glycosylation sites (N-X-S/T sequons, where X is not P) on the HA and NA proteins of the Victoria and Yamagata viruses were predicted using the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) at a threshold of &gt;0.5.
