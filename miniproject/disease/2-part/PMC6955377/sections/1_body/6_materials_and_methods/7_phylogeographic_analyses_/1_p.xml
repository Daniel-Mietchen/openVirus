<p>To infer the spatial-temporal dynamics of each influenza B lineage, a Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) model (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) was applied in BEAST to estimate the asymmetric diffusion rates between localities coded as discrete geographical locations: Africa, East Asia, Europe, Middle East/West Asia, North America, Oceania, Southeast Asia, South America, and South Asia. The uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock, the SRD06 codon position model, and exponential coalescent tree prior was used for Markov chain Monte Carlo runs. At least 4 independent runs using 100 million generations were used, with sampling every 10,000 generations. Convergence was assessed, and the runs were combined after removing appropriate burn-in using LogCombiner. The estimated viral migration rates between locations were summarized using the resulting log files. Significant diffusion rates were identified using Bayes Factors (BF): ≥1,000 was deemed as decisive support, 100 ≤ BF &lt; 1000 as very strong support, 10 ≤ BF &lt; 100 as strong support and 3 ≤ BF &lt; 10 as supported. We also estimated the number of location state transitions (measure for the gene flow between localities) from Markov jump counts (
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and the total number of state counts in and out of each location were used to generate the plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>. Moreover, the trunk of phylogenies reconstructed from time-stamped HA sequences represents persistent lineages between epidemics (
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The duration the ancestral population occupies a particular location was estimated from the Markov rewards (
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), estimating the contribution of each location to the persistence of calculated trunk proportions for each discrete location. Occupation of the trunk by a single location would suggest a dominant source-sink population dynamic while multiple locations constitute metapopulation and rapid global migration.
