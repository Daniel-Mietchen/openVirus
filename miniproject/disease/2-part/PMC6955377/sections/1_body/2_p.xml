<p>Genome-wide analyses have suggested that, owing to the presence of greater genomic diversity, reassortment plays a crucial role in the evolution of influenza B viruses (

 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). While Yamagata and Victoria viruses diverged across all 8 gene segments, frequent reassortment between the lineages has been observed. Intriguingly, the polymerase basic 1 and 2 (PB1 and PB2) and HA proteins have maintained separate Victoria and Yamagata lineages, suggesting that distinct segments were maintained through limited compatibility (

Historically, influenza B virus epidemics have been characteristically low to sporadic in most countries during a year, with influenza A viruses predominant in most countries. Since the first reports of high influenza B virus activity in Europe in 2015, substantial epidemics have been reported globally, indicating major changes in the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of influenza B viruses (
