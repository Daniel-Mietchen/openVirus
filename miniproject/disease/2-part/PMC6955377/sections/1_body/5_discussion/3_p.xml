<p>We found that the NA of Yamagata viruses was evolving at a greater rate, with few mutations occurring in the HA, and cooccurring substitutions in the polymerase genes (PB2-PB1-PA). We also observed a marked change in population dynamics of Yamagata viruses that, from 2002 to 2013, were previously subject to weaker natural selection pressure with relatively low and constant levels of genetic diversity (

 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), consistent with the lack of amino acid substitutions in the HA of these viruses. Our results suggest that the NA of Yamagata viruses is under stronger immune pressure than the HA, and that NA antigenic drift may be responsible for the recent increase in epidemic activity.
