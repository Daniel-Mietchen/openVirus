<p>The observation of HA deletion variants is not unprecedented in influenza B viruses; the influenza B prototype strain B/Lee/1940 possessed an amino acid deletion at the same HA position, i.e., a 1-aa deletion at 163 residue (
 <sup>160</sup>IPK*DNN
 <sup>166</sup>) (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Subsequently, ancestral Yamagata viruses that circulated before 1988 also harbored double (
 <sup>160</sup>VPK*D*N
 <sup>166</sup>) or triple (
 <sup>160</sup>VP***KN
 <sup>166</sup>) deletions, while no deletions were observed in ancestral Victoria viruses (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). As such, the presence of HA deletions in recent Victoria viruses (
 <sup>160</sup>VP**DKN
 <sup>166</sup> or 
 <sup>160</sup>VP***KN
 <sup>166</sup>) is not surprising. However, as these deletions occur on the 160 antigenic loop of the HA protein, they may be crucial for antigenic properties of influenza B viruses (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). At the time of writing, the current influenza vaccine strain selected for the Victoria lineage was the B/Colorado/06/2017 strain, which was nested within clade 1A.1 with a 2-aa deletion. Antigenic characterization of Victoria viruses has shown that some 3-aa deletion strains reacted poorly with antisera raised against the Victoria clade 1A.1 vaccine strain (with a 2-aa deletion), but generally reacted better to sera raised against viruses with no deletion, suggesting that Victoria viruses are undergoing antigenic diversification (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This is reflected in the subsequent 2020 vaccine composition recommendation for the Southern hemisphere where a 3-aa deletion strain in clade 1A.2 (B/Washington/02/2019-like) was selected to replace the previous 2-aa clade 1.A1 (B/Colorado/06/2017-like) vaccine strain (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). With continued cocirculation of these HA deletion variants, this reduced cross-reactivity could potentially lead to the divergence of Victoria viruses into 2 antigenically distinct variants. The circulation of 3 or more distinct influenza B viruses would drastically complicate influenza vaccine formulation.
