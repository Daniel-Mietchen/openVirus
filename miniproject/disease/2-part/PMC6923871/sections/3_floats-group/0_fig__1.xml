  <p>Orientation of MARV nucleocapsid and its transport pathway. 
   <bold>a</bold> The viral genome is encapsidated by NP. Nucleocapsids additionally contain VP24, VP30, VP35, and L. Among them, NP, VP24, and V35 form the core structure of the nucleocapsid called a “nucleocapsid-like structure (NCLS)”. 
   <bold>b</bold> Nucleocapsids are formed in the perinuclear inclusion bodies and are subsequently transported along polymerized actin filaments to the plasma membrane, where budding and release of virions takes place. The nucleocapsid and VP40 protein forms filamentous virions together with GP
