<p id="Par23">Furthermore, we determined whether the immunogenicity of fusion antigens is influenced by the order of NP and M2e. Our data showed that RVJ-NPM2e and RVJ-M2eNP induced similar antigen-specific IgG response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, RVJ-NPM2e 
 <italic>vs</italic> RVJ-M2eNP). However, RVJ-M2eNP induced significantly more NP147–155- as well as M2e-specific SFCs than the former one (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, RVJ-NPM2e 
 <italic>vs</italic> RVJ-M2eNP), suggesting that M2e at N terminal of the fusion antigen is a favorable configuration to induce NP- and M2e-specific cellular immunity. Moreover, our data indicated that four copies of M2e preceding NP (4M2e-NP) is more robust toward inducing NP- and M2e-specific humoral immune response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, RVJ-M2eNP 
 <italic>vs</italic> RVJ-4M2eNP) and protection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, RVJ-M2eNP 
 <italic>vs</italic> RVJ-4M2eNP). In addition, we observed that only RVJ-4M2eNP immunization induced significantly higher levels of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines in mice when stimulation with the M2e pooled peptides (Fig.
