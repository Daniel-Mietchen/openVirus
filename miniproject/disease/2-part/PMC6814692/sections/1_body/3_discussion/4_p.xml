Vaccinia virus Tiantan strain, developed in China as a vaccine against smallpox, has also been used as viral vector in numerous studies to develop recombinant viral vaccines. In this study, the vaccinia virus Tiantan strain was used to construct recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing fusion antigens with different configurations. The recombinant vaccinia virus expressing 4M2e and full-length NP fusion antigen induced strong cross-protection (92%) against a lethal heterosubtypic PR8 challenge at 20 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> and thus regarded as the optimal one among the four constructs. In the previous study, we expressed the fusion protein NM2e in an 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> system, and determined its immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. However, it is inconvenient and time consuming to express and purify much more alternatives. Moreover, it is impossible to express target antigens in an 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> system successfully sometimes. Compared with an 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> system, the recombinant vaccinia virus system has characteristics such as high multiplication capacity, no requirement to purify proteins, and high-efficiency to determine the immunogenicity of target antigens in animal models (Coughlan

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>). In fact, we succeeded in constructing and determining the antigenicity of several fusion antigens of NP and M2e efficiently.
