<p id="Par17">To characterize the immunogenicity of fusion antigens expressed by the recombinant vaccinia viruses, five groups of BALB/c mice were immunized with 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU of recombinant vaccinia virus at week 0 and 4. Ten days after the second immunization, sera were taken to measure the antibody titer, and the spleens were removed aseptically to measure the cellular immune response. Mice immunized with the recombinant vaccinia virus RVJ-NPM2e and RVJ-M2eNP showed strong antibody responses against NP, with lower titers of antibodies against M2e (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). RVJ-4M2eNP induced strong antibody responses against both NP and M2e. While RVJ-4M2eNPs only induced a strong humoral immune response against M2e but not NP.
