 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>) were used in this study. Vaccinia virus (Tiantan strain) was amplified and titrated in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). The PR8 influenza virus was propagated in 9-day-old chicken embryos at 34 °C for 48 h, and the allantoic fluid was then collected and stored at − 70 °C until use. Mouse 50% lethal dose (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) titer of the influenza virus PR8 was assessed in BALB/c mice before conducting the challenge experiments.
