<p id="Par13">Two weeks after the second immunization, mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (10 mg/mL) at a dose of 60 mg/kg of body weight. Subsequently, 10–12 mice in each group were challenged with 20 times of mouse 50% lethal dose (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) of PR8 intranasally. Weight loss and mortality were monitored daily for 3 weeks after the challenge. Mice that lost 30% of their initial weight were euthanized and recorded as having died.
