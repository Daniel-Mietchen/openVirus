<p id="Par7">Plasmid pET30a-NM2e contains the fusion gene of full-length 
 <italic>NP</italic> (498 amino acids) and the succeeding 
 <italic>M2e</italic> (23 amino acids) from influenza A virus, A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2) (BJ95) (Wang
 <italic> et al. </italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). The 
 <italic>NP</italic> and 
 <italic>M2e</italic> fusion gene (referred to as 
 <italic>NPM2e</italic>) was amplified from plasmid pET30a-NM2e by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to introduce 
 <italic>Bam</italic>H I site at each end. The 
 <italic>NPM2e</italic> was digested by 
 <italic>Bam</italic>H I, and inserted into the linearized plasmid pJSC1175. The resulting plasmid carrying 
 <italic>NPM2e</italic> at the same orientation as the p7.5 promoter was designated as pJSC1175-NPM2e.
