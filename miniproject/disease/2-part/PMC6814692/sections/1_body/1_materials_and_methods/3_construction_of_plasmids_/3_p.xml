<p id="Par8">From plasmid pJSC1175-NPM2e, 
 <italic>M2e</italic> and 
 <italic>NP</italic> genes were amplified respectively, and fused (
 <italic>M2e</italic> preceding 
 <italic>NP</italic>) by PCR to generate a fusion gene, 
 <italic>M2eNP</italic>. DNA fragment containing four copies of M2e (from BJ95) was amplified from plasmid, pET9a-H4M2e, and fused to the 5′ terminus of full-length 
 <italic>NP</italic> gene by PCR, resulting in fusion gene, 
 <italic>4M2eNP</italic>. The DNA fragment containing four copies of 
 <italic>M2e</italic> was also fused to the 5′ terminus of a 
 <italic>NP</italic> gene (from BJ95) truncated at both ends (referred to as 
 <italic>NPs</italic>, encodes 314 amino acids) that was amplified from plasmid pET9a-NPsM2e by PCR. The resulting fusion gene was named 
 <italic>4M2eNPs</italic>. As the fusion genes 
 <italic>M2eNP</italic>, 
 <italic>4M2eNP</italic>, and 
 <italic>4M2eNPs</italic> were engineered with 
 <italic>Bam</italic>H I site at each end through PCR, they were cloned into linearized pJSC1175 as described above. The resulting plasmids were pJSC1175-M2eNP, pJSC1175-4M2eNP, and pJSC1175-4M2eNPs, respectively.
