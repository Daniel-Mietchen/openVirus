<p>NHBE cells were washed 10 times with PBS prior to infection in order to remove mucins. The virus inoculum was prepared in PBS, and 200 μl (or PBS for mock-infected samples) was added per well. After 45 min, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and the PBS was removed, so the infection progressed in an air-liquid interphase. The infections with the H3N2 virus were done in a 200-μl inoculum in combination with 20 μg/ml of anti-H1 neutralizing antibody 7B2, specific for the head of A/California/4/2009 (

Then cells were washed once with PBS and an additional 30-min incubation with 20 μg/ml of anti-H1 antibody in PBS was performed, after which the antibody was removed and cells were incubated in an air-liquid interphase for the appropriated times. This protocol was tested first to ensure the inhibition of the H1N1 replication. Also, we confirmed that the addition of the 7B2 antibody had no effect on the replication or the innate immune profile induced by the H3N2 virus. A pan-H3 monoclonal antibody, 9H10, was used to determine the titers of H3N2 viruses (

At the specified time points, 200 μl of PBS was added over the infected cells; PBS was collected after incubation for 15 min at 37°C for subsequent replication assessment by plaque assay. Cells were lysed and kept at −80°C for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis. All the NHBE cell infections were done in triplicate.
