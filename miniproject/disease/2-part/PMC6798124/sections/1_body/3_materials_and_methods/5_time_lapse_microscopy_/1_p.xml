<p>A Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan microscope was used for the collection of the PR8-GFP/A549 H2B-mCherry cell time-lapse microscopy images. A total of 25 images per well (in a 24-well plate) were collected every hour between 3 hpi and 12 hpi at a magnification of Ã—20. Automated quantification of the data was performed using custom-made MatLab scripts. Cells were segmented using the H2B-mCherry nuclear tracker as mask. We optimized the tiling and tile stitching strategies for the image acquisition, background reduction algorithms, and segmentation strategies. Data such as position (
 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic> coordinates), median of fluorescence intensity of GFP (normalized to the maximum fluorescence of each well), and infection status were extracted for each cell (&gt;25,000 cells/well). The graph and heat map in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> were generated using R v3.3.1 and Rstudio.
