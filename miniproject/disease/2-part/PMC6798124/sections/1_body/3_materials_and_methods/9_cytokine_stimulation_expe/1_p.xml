<p>A549 cells were stimulated with recombinant TNF-α (Gibco), IFN beta (PBL Assay Science), IFNL1 (PBL Assay Science), or different combinations of these cytokines for 8 h at 100 U/ml in EMEM supplemented with 5% NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Gibco), and 1% FBS. Also, some cells were infected with PR8-NS1-GFP at an MOI of 2 as a positive control. Cells were lysed and stored at −80°C for subsequent RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis.
