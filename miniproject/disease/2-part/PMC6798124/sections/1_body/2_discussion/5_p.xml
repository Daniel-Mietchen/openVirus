<p>The analysis of the distribution of expression of type I and III IFNs also provided very interesting observations. First, consistent with previous reports (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), only a small population of infected cells produced high levels of IFN. NS1 protein could differentially inhibit the IFN response across the infected cells in the culture according to the NS1 intracellular levels, which could be determined by the number of virions infecting the cells. Related to this, at the MOI of 2 we found that the cluster of cells expressing IFN at high levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) presented lower levels of the NS gene than the rest of the infected cells. Another possibility is the presence of low levels of defective interfering (DI) particles in the virus stock, which are known to be strong inducers of IFN (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). While virus stocks were carefully prepared to avoid the presence of DI particles, some presence of them cannot be ruled out. However, if a large deletion is present in one segment of a virus, mRNA for the proteins that segment encodes would not be successfully transcribed in the cell infected by that virus. Related to this, we found that at MOIs of 2 and 0.2, 100% and 99.9% of the infected cells, respectively, presented all the different RNA transcripts from the virus, suggesting a low probability for the presence of DI particles in the virus stock. Interestingly, a recent study that used an elegant approach to perform combined cellular and viral single-cell RNA sequencing in IAV-infected A549 cells found that increased proportions of viral defects or mutations, and specifically defects or deletions in NS, were highly associated with increased expression of IFN among infected cells (
