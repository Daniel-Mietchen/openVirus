<p>Our results show that IAV infection at a low MOI results in induction of antiviral ISGs in bystander cells that potentially protect them from viral infection. In order to address the magnitude and timing of the antiviral response induced in bystander cells during IAV infection at a low MOI using primary human respiratory epithelial cells, we established a model of staggered IAV H1N1/H3N2 coinfections in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells in an air-liquid interface (

Using two similar, but distinguishable, viruses to infect cell monolayers at different times allows the analysis of how the antiviral response induced after the first infection affects subsequent infection by the second virus. The design of the experimental protocol is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>. First, we infected NHBE cells with the H1N1 virus A/California/04/2009 at an MOI of 0.05, and then we characterized profiles of gene expression and virus replication throughout a 48-h time course. Using plaque assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>), we established that the initial release of H1N1 infectious particles was detected at 12 hpi, peaked at 24 to 36 hpi, and declined after 48 hpi. We next analyzed the kinetics of expression of a comprehensive panel of innate immunity-associated genes by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Notably, we detected early upregulation of IFNB1, at around 4 hpi, as well as upregulation of IFNL1, IFNL2, and IFNL3, while changes in IFNA expression remained undetected (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>]). Therefore, these results demonstrate an early expression of type I and type III IFN and ISGs during IAV infection in epithelial cells.
