<p>In the same experiment, additional samples were first infected with H1N1 virus, and then the H3N2 virus A/Wyoming/03/2003 was added at an MOI of 0.05 at selected times points post-H1N1 infection in the presence of the H1 neutralizing antibody 7B2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>), which is specific for the head region of the A/California/04/2009 isolate and restricts its subsequent rounds of infection. Washes from the apical chamber were collected to assess viral replication at 1, 12, 24, and 48 h after H3N2 infection. The viral titers (PFU) measured after H3N2 infection correspond with H3N2 replication only, since the anti-H1 antibody restricts infections with H1N1 viruses. We used changes in those H3N2 titers as an indicator of the functional antiviral response induced by the previously added H1N1 virus. As both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were added at a low MOI, numbers of coinfections were negligible. Control experiments demonstrated that the neutralizing antibody 7B2 inhibited H1N1 replication as measured by plaque assay and immunostaining (data not shown). Thus, in this experiment we measured levels of H3N2 replication in bystander cells exposed to paracrine effects from H1N1-infected cells. Analysis of the impact of the innate immune response induced by the initial H1N1 IAV infection on the replication of the subsequently added H3N2 virus showed that adding the H3N2 virus at 2 or 4 hpi resulted in a replication profile very similar to that obtained with the H3N2 single infection. Interestingly, we found a significant decrease in the H3N2 replication titers (48 h post-H3N2 infection) when this virus was added as early as 8 and 12 h post-H1N1 IAV infection. As expected, we observed a greater reduction of the H3N2 IAV replication as the time of addition post-H1N1 IAV infection increased to 24 h or 48 h. To confirm that after infection with the H1N1 virus there was still a sufficiently large number of uninfected cells that could be potentially infected by the H3N2 virus, we performed immunofluorescence staining of NHBE cells infected by H1N1 under the same conditions. Visualization and quantification of complete wells indicated the presence of 1.23% ± 1.32%, 3.2% ± 1.37%, and 6.01% ± 3.00% infected cells at 12, 24, and 48 hpi, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8F</xref>), indicating that most cells were available for infection upon exposure to the second virus. Therefore, these data indicate that early IFN responses elicited during initial viral infection are effective as early as 8 to 12 hpi and are critical for a functional antiviral response in bystander cells.
