<p>Quantification of the levels of expression of these type I and III IFN genes and comparison among the three clusters are also shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>. Interestingly, at an MOI of 2, the levels of expression of IAV NS were lower in the blue cluster than in the green cluster, both of them composed mostly of infected cells. The blue cluster again showed elevated levels of expression of all IFN genes, while the cells in the green cluster showed overall levels very similar to those of the red cluster of bystander cells. Consistent with the tSNE visualization, expression of IFNL1 in cells in the red and green clusters was higher than that of IFNB1, IFNL2, IFNL3, or IFNL4. At an MOI of 2, virtually all the cells in the culture expressed IFNL1, albeit to variable levels.
