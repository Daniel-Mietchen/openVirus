<p>To study the epidemiology of arbovirus infection, we, an international team of researchers in Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia, conducted arbovirus surveillance in our respective countries during 2016â€“2018 with the support of our governments. In each country, we collected mosquitoes in and around cattle or pig housing using sweeping nets and aspirators. We collected mosquitoes that had digested blood in their midguts. We identified their species and sorted them into pools, which we used for virus isolation. We also collected serum samples from pigs and wild boars from each country to use for virus isolation.</p>
