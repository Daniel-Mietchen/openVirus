 <xref rid="jia225361-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> have helped to align national‐level reporting of key STI indicators related to syphilis and gonorrhoea alongside those of HIV, but reported data are incomplete and many countries are challenged to collect verifiable data. WHO has supported the development of freely available modelling tools such as Spectrum STI

 <xref rid="jia225361-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> to allow the use of country‐reported data to conduct national‐level analysis of incidence and prevalence trends. WHO conducts global surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhoea, which captures proportions of resistant organisms from nearly 60 countries
