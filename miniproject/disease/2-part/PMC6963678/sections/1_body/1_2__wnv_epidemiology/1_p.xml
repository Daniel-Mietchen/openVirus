<p>In nature, WNV transmission is maintained in a cycle between 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, the major vector, and a variety of bird species, the major reservoir hosts. Humans, horses, and other vertebrate animals can be infected with WNV through the bite of an infected mosquito, but are considered as “dead-end hosts” because infection in mammals does not produce a viremia of sufficient magnitude to infect subsequent biting mosquitoes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people (80%) infected with WNV do not develop any symptoms, and about 20% infected people develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. About 1 in 150 people who are infected with WNV develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system (CNS), such as encephalitis and meningitis. The virus became recognized as a cause of human meningitis or encephalitis in elderly patients during an outbreak in Israel in 1957 [

 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and within three years spread to most of the continental U.S. and the neighboring countries in North America [
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of WNV isolated from the U.S. indicates that a single conserved amino acid change in the envelope gene (V159A) is shared by most of the strains isolated since 2002, but is also found in old-world strains of WNV [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This genotype has effectively displaced the genotype originally introduced to the U.S. [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. WNV has now spread across six of seven continents, including Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia (subtype Kunjin), North America, and South America. It is considered one of the most important causative agents of human viral encephalitis worldwide. Since 1999, WNV has been estimated to cause more than 6 million human infections [
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with over 24,000 neurological disease cases and 2300 deaths in the U.S. In addition, in 2018, a large outbreak occurred in Europe involving over 2000 human cases in 15 countries [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand in-depth the pathogenesis of WNV and develop specific treatment strategies.
