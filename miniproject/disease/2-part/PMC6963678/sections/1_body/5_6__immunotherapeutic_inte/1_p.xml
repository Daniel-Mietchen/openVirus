<p>Despite the development of four licensed veterinary WNV vaccines, there are still no approved vaccines or antivirals available for human use. Although several clinical trials have been initiated with multiple vaccine candidates, none have proceeded to the final phases of clinical testing or are even close to meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (reviewed in [

The general reasons for the lack of a human vaccine may include scientific challenges (mainly in obtaining protective immunity), safety concerns (including potential antibody-dependent enhancement responses to other flavivirus infections), difficulties in clinical study design (due to lack of enough WNV cases for a phase III vaccine efficacy study), and economic considerations [

While the development of new candidate vaccines and improvement of vaccination strategies remains a challenging task, clinical researches have reported that administration of intravenous high dose steroids may result in marked clinical improvement in WNV patients who suffer severe neuroinflammation.
