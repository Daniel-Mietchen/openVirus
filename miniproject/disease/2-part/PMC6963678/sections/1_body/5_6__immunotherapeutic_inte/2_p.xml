<p>Both experimental and clinical evidence suggest that pro-inflammatory mediators may contribute to the pathogenesis of WNV in the CNS. Treatment of infected neuronal cells with antibodies blocking these proinflammatory mediators can result in a significant reduction of WNV-mediated neuronal death in vitro [

 <xref rid="B161-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Accumulating clinical evidence also strongly suggests that a prolonged post-infection inflammatory state may promote persistent and recurrent symptoms, delayed neurological deficits, and de novo autoimmune disorders, and amplify preexisting autoimmune diseases long after clearance of the virus. At present, no specific therapy has been approved for human use against these post-infectious CNS symptoms. However, an in-depth understanding of the immune-mediated post-infectious pathogenesis of WNV infection has direct therapeutic implications and treatment strategies that suppress this pathogenic immune cascade may prove particularly beneficial. Indeed, in several case series administration of high dose steroids has been documented to improve the outcomes of patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease. In 14 patients with acute WNV meningoencephalitis, intravenous dexamethasone injection was suggested to play a critical role in shortening the acute phase of WNV disease and hastening patient recovery [

 <xref rid="B177-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Two patients with acute flaccid paralysis and brainstem involvement, including progressive seventh nerve palsies, showed clear improvement in brainstem symptoms and facial paralysis within 24 h of treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone [

 <xref rid="B178-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Although the use of steroids in patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease seems counterintuitive, with concern that immunosuppressive effects may promote viremia and worsen outcome, the evidence is compelling that WNV is rapidly cleared by immune responses in immunocompetent patients [
 <xref rid="B179-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. Additional evidence that immunosuppression does not worsen outcome comes from large scale trials in dengue, a related flavivirus. A comprehensive review that included 13 studies enrolling 1293 participants on the effectiveness of corticosteroids in the treatment of dengue, found no evidence that administration of high doses of oral or intravenous corticosteroids promoted viremia [
 <xref rid="B180-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Rather, therapeutic benefit was seen in multiple studies that used intravenous delivery of high doses and multiple doses of steroids. In contrast, studies without the administration of repeated high doses of steroids showed limited or no beneficial effect. Such clinical observations provide a compelling argument for the use of high dose steroids and possibly other immunosuppressive drugs in the treatment of WNV infection. The clinical experience warrants appropriate large-scale clinical trials to confirm the therapeutic benefit of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs in the treatment of WNV disease. This is particularly pertinent in light of the fact that there has been no successful development or marketing of a human WNV vaccine.
