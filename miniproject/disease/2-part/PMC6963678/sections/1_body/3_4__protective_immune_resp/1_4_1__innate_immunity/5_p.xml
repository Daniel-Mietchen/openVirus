<p>Besides DCs, macrophages as specialized phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells are early responders to control initial WNV replication and present the viral antigens to T cells. Macrophages efficiently ingest WNV through receptor-mediated endocytosis, then become activated to produce a large number of antiviral chemokines and cytokines, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and type I IFNs. These molecules are critical for the restriction of WNV replication and the recruitment of more innate immune cells to the site of infection [

Recently, it has been shown that defective WNV replication in Peli1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase)-deficient microglia and neurons directly contributes to attenuated neuroinflammation in the CNS and ultimately increases host resistance to lethal encephalitis [
