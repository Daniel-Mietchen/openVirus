<p>The RLR family of cytosolic RNA helicases, which include retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology gene 2 (LGP2), are expressed basally at low levels in most tissues and induced by type I (α/β) IFNs. While short dsRNA and 5′-triphosphate RNA are ligands for RIG-I, MDA5 mainly recognizes long dsRNA [

 <xref rid="B45-pathogens-08-00193" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Both RIG-I and MDA5 encode two amino-terminal tandem caspase activation recruitment domains (CARDs) that recruit mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS, also known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif), upon binding to viral RNA, activating IRF3/7 and NF-κB, leading to the production of type I IFNs and antiviral responses. In contrast, LGP2 (encoded by Dhx58) has a high RNA binding affinity and can recognize diverse dsRNAs, regardless of the presence of 5’-triphosphate or RNA length [
