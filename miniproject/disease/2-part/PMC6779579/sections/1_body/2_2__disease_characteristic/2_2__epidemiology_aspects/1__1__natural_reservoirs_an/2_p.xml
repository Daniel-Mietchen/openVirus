<p>Researchers in KNIH isolated 69 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> strains from rats between 1984 and 1987 in Wonsung, Hongchun, Yangju, Wonju, Cheolwon, and Gwangsan in Gangwon Province; from Gwangju in Jeonnam Province; and in Paju, Yeoju, and Yeoncheon in Gyeonggi Province. In particular, 64 strains were isolated from 
 <italic>A. agrarius</italic>, 2 from 
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, 1 from 
 <italic>Cricetulus tritonnestor</italic>, and 1 from 
 <italic>Crocidura lasiura</italic>. The carriage rate of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species from wild rats was 15.5% (7/45) in 1984, 14.9% (44/295) in 1985, 1.6% (4/247) in 1986, and 30.9% (13/42) in late 1987 in Yeoju and Paju, demonstrating notable regional differences [

In 292 native Korean cattle and 226 pigs in Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, Gangwon, and Gyeongsang Provinces, the seropositivity rate was 4.1â€“8.6% in cattle from Gyeonggi Province and 5.7% in pigs from Gyeonggi and Chungnam Provinces (17.6% in Cheongyang and Dangjin, Chungnam Province) [

 <italic>A. agrarius</italic>, are important natural reservoirs of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species in the Korea and that a correlation was found between years with epidemics and carrier rates in wild rats.
