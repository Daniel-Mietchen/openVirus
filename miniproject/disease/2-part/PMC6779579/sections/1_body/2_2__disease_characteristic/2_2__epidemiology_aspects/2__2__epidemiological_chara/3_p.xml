<p>Occurrence of cases showed a seasonal pattern that started in early August, peaked in September and October, and decreased in November. In particular, the past epidemics were associated with localized heavy rain, flooding, or typhoons just before the harvesting season [

In relation to the 1984 and 1987 epidemics, flooding occurred across the country around the harvesting season, which brought disaster and severe crop damages. Localized torrential downpours with 200 - 300 mm of daily precipitation were recorded in Wonju in Gangwon Province between September 1 and 3, 1984. In Jeonra Provinces, the daily precipitation was 100 - 200 mm between September 5 and 6, 1987. These numbers were much higher than the monthly precipitation of 63 - 96 mm and 41 - 71 mm in September and October of the previous year, respectively. Occurrence of cases following a flood during the harvest season in Jeonnam and Jeonbuk Provinces have been shown well in the epidemic curves in 1987 (

Nonetheless, there was a typhoon and heavy rain on October 5 during the harvest, followed by localized heavy rainfalls between October 10 and 13.
