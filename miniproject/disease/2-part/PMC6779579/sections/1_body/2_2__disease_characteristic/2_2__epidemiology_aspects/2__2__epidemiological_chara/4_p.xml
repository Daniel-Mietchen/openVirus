<p>When there was heavy rainfall in the central part of the country between September 8 and 11, 1990, with a total precipitation of 500 mm, an epidemic of leptospirosis was anticipated; an epidemiologic study was conducted in Yangpyeon-gun, Gyeonggi Province, where soldiers participated in post-flooding restoration of rice fields. When the participated 446 soldiers underwent primary and secondary serological tests, the rate of infection was 11.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.3% – 14.1%], the rate of symptomatic infection 1.8% (95% CI, 0.7% – 3.1%), and pathogenicity 16.0% (95% CI, 6.0% – 26.0%). The relative risk of attack rate revealed to depend on the type of work performed; 3.5-fold higher in those tied fallen rice plants for 3 days or longer, 2.7-fold higher in those tied fallen rice plants for 1–2 days, and 2.1-fold higher in those with other tasks [
