<p>The epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in the Korea were described during the epidemics in 1975 and 1984 [

Occurrence of cases was associated with rice threshing or long periods of rice reaping during harvesting season, or with post-flooding restoration of rice plants. A significant number of cases had skin abrasions or injuries on their hands or legs. The incubation period was between 2 and 15 days (average: 5 days). Many soldiers also contracted the disease after they participated in the group work of tying fallen rice plants following flooding; therefore, soldiers belonged to a high-risk group [

According to the field investigation on geographical characteristics of some areas, rain-fed rice fields resembling stairs between rice field ridges in mountainous valleys in Gangwon Province were found to provide an environment enabling for long-term survival of leptospires. Moreover, the presence of multiple rat holes in rice field ridges with rice grains scattered around indicated that these acted like a good habitat for rats [
