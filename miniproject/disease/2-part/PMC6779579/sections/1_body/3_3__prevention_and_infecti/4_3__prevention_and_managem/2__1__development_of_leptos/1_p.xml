<p>For the control of leptospirosis, the KNIH developed a formalin-killed cell vaccine using serovar Lai (HY-10 strain) isolated from a patient with fatal leptospirosis. The safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans were confirmed. The government then introduced a supplementary immunization program in 1988; every year, 400,000 vials were produced by national pharmaceutical companies (Green Cross, CheilJedang, Dongsin, and Boryung Pharmaceutical) and were administered to residents and soldiers in areas with endemic areas. Consequently, the number of cases decreased significantly between 1991 and 1997. Leptospirosis was excluded from the supplementary immunization program in 1997, based on the following reasons: Inactivated vaccines lack cross-immune responses among various 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species and offer only short-term protection. Moreover, the protective immunity are sometimes incomplete, and side effects may arise from contamination of media; therefore, the inactivated leptospirosis vaccine was discontinued.
