<p>In beginning the historical review of leptospirosis in the Korea, it is necessary to look back briefly on the early history of the disease in other countries. Since leptospirosis was first described as Weil's disease, by physician Adolf Weil in 1886 in Germany, a characteristic infectious disease accompanied by splenomegaly, jaundice, and nephritis [

After that, many cases and epidemics were reported in the army and other general populations in Western Europe. When Weil's disease spread among coal miners in Japan in 1914 – 1915, Inada et al. at Kyushu University successfully isolated the bacteria from blood of guinea pigs that were transmitted the infection [

The disease was recognized as an entity in ancient times as well, and was referred to as “rice-harvest jaundice” in ancient Chinese language and as “7-day fever” or “autumn fever” in Japanese language, with names associated with the season, occupation, and duration of symptoms. Since the causative bacteria, animal reservoirs, and the importance of environmental conditions were identified between 1920 and 1960, it became known that the disease transmission by working in dangerous environmental conditions rather than occupational exposure. Japanese researchers also described that rats served as carriers, opening the important way for understanding the epidemiological principles transmitted by carrier animals, and their management. Several years later, wide-ranging zoonotic characteristics involving wild and domestic animals were determined. The important basic knowledge of leptospirosis and
