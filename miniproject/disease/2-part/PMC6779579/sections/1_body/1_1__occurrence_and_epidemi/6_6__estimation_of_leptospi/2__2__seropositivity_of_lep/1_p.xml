<p>The KNIH performed a seroepidemiological study using the macroslide agglutination test for 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> antibody among residents of 17 Guns in 5 provinces (Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Chungbuk, Gyeongbuk, and Jeonnam) between February 1985 and July 1986. The overall seropositive rate was 11.69% (113/967). The percent frequency by region was 17.06% in Gangwon, 16.18% in Gyeonggi, 10.17% in Chungbuk, and 6.17% in Gyeongbuk. There was no notable sex difference, but the rates were significantly higher in people aged between 41 - 50 years (19.8%) and 51â€“60 years (19.2%). In the seroepidemiological study performed among residents of 17 cities and Guns in 9 provinces between February and May 1987, the seropositive rate was 5.9% (68/1162), and the regional positive rate was 14% in Chungbuk, 12% in Jeonbuk, and 8% in Jeonnam, reflecting the decreased number of cases of leptospirosis in 1986 compared to those reported in 1985. In the meantime, the study using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) conducted in 1,141 patients with suspected leptospirosis in Seoul, Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Chungbuk, Gyeongbuk, Jeonbuk, and Jeonnam between the spring of 1986 and June 1987, 132 patients (11.6%) showed titers above 1:80 [

Subsequently, between 1986 and 1990, several research laboratories and institutes analyzed and reported the yearly, monthly, and regional occurrence of leptospirosis in local residents as well as the patients with acute febrile illness through seroepidemiological investigation [
