<p>With the confirmation of epidemics of leptospirosis and scrub typhus in the Korea in 1984 and 1987, respectively, Ho Wang Lee, an expert in Hantaan virus, introduced the need for serology-based differential diagnosis of the acute febrile illnesses referred as “leptangamushi diseases” (leptospirosis, Hantaan virus infection, and tsutsugamushi disease) especially in seasons when the diseases were commonly prevalent. The reasons were included as follows: the diseases were febrile illnesses that showed early symptoms similar to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which had been endemic in the Korea; natural reservoirs were rodents; the diseases occurred each year; people at risk were soldiers, farmers, or outdoor workers. He reported the results of serological tests for “leptangamushi diseases” among the serum samples requested to the Viral Disease Laboratory at Korea University for antibody tests of HFRS between 1985 and 1987. Based on the serological diagnostic criteria alone, 697 of 2,135 patients (33%) tested in 1985 were diagnosed with HFRS, 435 of 1,554 cases (28%) with leptospirosis, and 129 of 1,230 (11%) with scrub typhus. The remaining 41% of patients had undetermined causes. In 1986, 34% (706/2,068), 4% (64/1,593), 31% (215/692), and 52% (1,083/2,068) of patients were diagnosed with HFRS, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, and undetermined causes, respectively [

Since some residents in endemic areas could retain residual antibodies of the diseases over long periods of time after asymptomatic infections, he emphasized the observance of extreme caution when performing serological differential diagnosis, and described the possibility of combined infections where antibodies of two diseases might be present in a small number of cases. The seroepidemiological view on “leptangamushi disease” was once introduced in Harrison's textbook, with providing an important approach currently in serological differential diagnosis of patients with febrile illnesses in fall.
