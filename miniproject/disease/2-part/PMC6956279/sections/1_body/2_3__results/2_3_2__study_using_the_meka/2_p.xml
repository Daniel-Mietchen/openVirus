<p>The limit of detection for 1 Ebola Mekambo genome copy per reaction was observed for all the tested assays except Panning et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For the latter, the results observed with concentrations ranging from 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 10
 <sup>3</sup> genome copies per microliter are similar to the other assays, but results are less satisfactory with 100 and 10 copies per microliter and missed the 1 copy per microliter. All other assays provided equivalent results suggesting that the Duo Gibb + Huang assay is an alternative to be considered compared with assays targeting a single region of the genome. The relative fluorescence unit (RFU) varied significantly between the tested assays with the highest values (&gt;20,000 at 10
 <sup>5</sup> and &gt;10,000 at 10) observed with the Gibb et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and Duo Gibb + Huang assays, whereas much lower values (&lt;5000 at 10
 <sup>5</sup> and &lt;3000 at 10) were observed with Panning et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Altona RealStar assay (
