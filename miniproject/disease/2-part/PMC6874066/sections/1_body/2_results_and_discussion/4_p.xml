<p>The HEV-3 positive mouse was captured nearby the Croatian capital, the city of Zagrebon the mountain Medvednica (Zagreb County, Nature Park Medvednica), on a location that is very attractive for hikers, cyclists, and tourists. Interestingly, the majority of HEV-3 infected patients in Croatia originated from Zagreb County[
