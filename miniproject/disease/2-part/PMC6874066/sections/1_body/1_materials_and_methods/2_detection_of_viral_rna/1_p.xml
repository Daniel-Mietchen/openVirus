<p>Total RNA was extracted from liver homogenate using MagMAX Pathogen RNA/DNA Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Tissue samples (100mg of each) were homogenized by using the FastPrep-24 machine, model 6004–500 (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, California, USA) and lysing matrix A, D, and for tonsils matrix M, with addition of 1ml sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The supernatants were decanted into sterile test tubes and stored at -80°C until further testing. For positive animals additional organ samples were tested (lungs, kidney, spleen, colon, heart and heart transudate). To identify HEV RNA carriers, an one-step quantitative real time RT-PCR protocol [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for detecting highly conserved fragment within ORF3 (open reading frame 3) was carried out. All positive samples (samples containing HEV RNA detectable in a cycle threshold value lower than 40) were re-tested by a nested RT-PCR protocol [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for detection of the variable fragment within ORF1. The amplification procedures for ORF1 and ORF3 regions are described by Jemeršić et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel stained with a fluorescent dye-GelStar (Lonza, Belgium) and visualized by UV transillumination. For positive control sequences of previously detected fragments of HEV RNA genotype 3 were used (derived from positive swine sera submitted to GenBank under accession no. KT583116, grouped into HEV3c subtype, with Ct-value 29). Negative controls were aliquots of ultrapure water.
