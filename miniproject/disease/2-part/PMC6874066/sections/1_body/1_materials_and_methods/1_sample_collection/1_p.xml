Sampling was done in 2008 and in the time period from 2010 to 2014 as part of the projects supported by Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (068-1430115-2119, „The forest ecoystems as natural foci of the hantaviruses and leptospira”) and by Croatian Science Foundation (IP-11-2013-4250, “The role of biotic agents on vitality of narrow-leafed ash (
 <italic>Fraxinus angustifolia</italic> Vahl.) in Croatian floodplain forests“), designed to assess the distribution of small rodents in diverse forest ecosystems in Croatia [
 <xref rid="pone.0225583.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The animals were labelled, weighted, measured, and then aseptically dissected. All rodents were morphologically characterized. Animal experimentation guidelines of the American Society of Mammologists were followed during all animal work [

Sampling was done in accordance with good veterinary practice that is fully complied with the Croatian Animal Protection Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia, No. 102/2017). Croatian legislation is harmonized with the Code of good veterinary practice. (
