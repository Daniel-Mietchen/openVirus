<p>In present study, the cytokine expression profile in the lungs of mice infected with a nonlethal dose (LD0) of the A/PR/8/34 virus (H1N1) was analysed and compared with that of mice infected with a lethal dose (LD100) of the same virus. The aim of the present study was to identify the cytokines with altered expression patterns following infection with LD100 when compared with LD0. The results provide novel insights into the pathology of influenza A infection and may have applications for the improvement of influenza diagnosis and therapy.</p>
