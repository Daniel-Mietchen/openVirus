<p>Female BALB/c mice (age, 4 weeks; body weight approximately 20 g) were purchased from the Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University (Czech Republic). A total of 30 mice in two groups of 15 mice were anesthetized with Zoletil (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and inoculated intranasally with 10
 <sup>3</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU; LD100) or 10
 <sup>1</sup> PFU (LD0) of virus (40 µl). To ensure that the mice were fully anesthetized, the monitoring of rear foot reflexes was made before infection, and continual observation of respiratory pattern, mucous membrane colour and responsiveness to manipulations was made throughout the procedure. The mice were monitored daily and humanely sacrificed at the experimental endpoint. The criteria for euthanasia were establish by using the total score for observation of possible animal distress. Weight loss exceeding 25% of the original body weight, decrease of appetite, weakness, shivering, depression and moribund state of animals were monitored twice per day. For the cytokine assay, all groups of 4 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the lungs were aseptically collected at 0, 2 and 4 days post-infection (p.i.). Experiment lasted for 8 days. Organ homogenates were pooled together, and aliquots were stored at −80°C.
