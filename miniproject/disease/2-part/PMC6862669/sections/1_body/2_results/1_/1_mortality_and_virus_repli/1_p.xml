<p>To determine the impact of viral infection on influenza-specific mortality, BALB/c mice were inoculated with either 10
 <sup>1</sup> PFU or 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of H1N1 virus. All animals rapidly developed severe signs of disease, including ruffled fur, huddling, lethargy and weight loss. Mice infected with LD0 exhibited body weight loss of up to 20% within 4 days of infection, followed by a gradual recovery by the end of the study (
