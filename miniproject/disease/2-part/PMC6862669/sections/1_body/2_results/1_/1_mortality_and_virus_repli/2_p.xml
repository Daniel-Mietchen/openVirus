<p>The results demonstrated that macroscopic changes in the lungs were associated with virus pathogenicity. Naked-eye observations of the lungs revealed that the most severe signs of damage were identified in mice infected with LD100 at 4 days p.i. (

In LD100-infected mice, the viral titer increased up to 4 days p.i. The maximum viral titer in this group of mice was five times higher than mice in the LD0 group.
