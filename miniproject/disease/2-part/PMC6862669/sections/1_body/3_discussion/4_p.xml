<p>The cytokine profile induced by LD100 was similar to the profiles previously observed in sera from patients with severe influenza infection and influenza virus-associated encephalopathy (

 <xref rid="b20-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-7, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12p40, IL-13 and IL-15 levels were increased only in the lungs of mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza. An interesting observation in our study was a switching in macrophage polarization from M1 to M2, evidenced by the increase in the M2 markers, Arg1 and Egr2, in the lungs of mice infected with LD100. IL-12 and IFN-γ are the main T helper (Th)1 cytokines. Th1 cells emerge in the presence of IL-12 and mediate their function by secreting IFN-γ (

 <xref rid="b22-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Th1 cytokines promote M1 macrophage differentiation, which serves important roles in the eradication of viral infection. M1 macrophages secrete chemokines, such as CXCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10 (

Anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 are the main Th2 cytokines. In addition, increased IRF4 and IL-4 levels promote the differentiation of naïve CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells into Th2 cells (

 <xref rid="b28-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Th2 lymphocytes release anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 (

 <xref rid="b32-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In addition, Th2 cytokines, such IL-4 and IL-13, promote differentiation of M2 macrophages. M2 macrophages which produce high levels of IL-10 are generally thought to function as anti-inflammatory macrophages and serve key roles in the suppression of Th1 cell responses, wound healing and tissue repair (

 <xref rid="b35-etm-0-0-8096" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Overexpression of chemokines and the Th2 phenotype serve central roles in influenza pathogenesis (
