<p>In the present study, infection of mice with a lethal dose of the virus induced the expression of cytokines associated with severe lung injury and pathology. Increased expression of cytokines, including leptin, LIF, M-CSF, PTX2, PTX3, WISP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, PCSK9 and TIM-1, correlated with extensive lung damage following lethal influenza infection. These proteins modulate infection response, inflammation and tissue repair. A previous study demonstrated that PTX2 reduces the severity of acute lung injury in an animal model and in humans and might be useful for a variety of disease therapy (

M-CSF promotes the differentiation and survival of macrophages, and preferentially induces anti-inflammatory M2 rather than pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. Increased levels of C-MSF promote the development of a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response (

However, it will be necessary to clarify the function of leptin, LIF, M-CSF, PTX2, PTX3, WISP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, PCSK9 and TIM-1 in influenza pathogenicity. It is possible that these factors are released due to extensive tissue damage caused by viral replication, the increased expression of other cytokines or due to induction of a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response.
