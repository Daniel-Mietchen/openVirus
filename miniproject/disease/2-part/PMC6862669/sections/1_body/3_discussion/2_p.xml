<p>In the present study, the virus titer in mice infected with LD0 and LD100 was similar at 2 days p.i.; however, the cytokine expression profiles induced were different. We repeated this experiment several times and we obtained the same results. As it was expected, 100% mortality was observed within animals infected with LD100. In LD100-infected mice, the virus titer increased up to 4 days p.i. and none of these mice survived until 8 day p.i. Many factors as virus input, immune response etc. influenced the virus replication in the lungs. The most severe sign of damage was observed in the lungs of mice infected with LD100 at 4 days p.i. Unfortunately, we did not examine histological changes in the lungs after influenza infection. We would like to do it in the future.</p>
