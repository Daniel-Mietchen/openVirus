<p>I miss a comment on the vasculature in the affected placentas (e.g. necrosis, vasculitis?). It is stated that…”blood vessels were found that stained positively for RVFV in the endothelium and/or smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel wall…”.in line 303/304. In addition, the prominent endothelial staining in figure 6 raises the question whether RVFV infection triggered morphologically recognizable or functional cell damage. Did these vessels also display necrosis (caspase 3, TUNEL-positivity?)?</p>
