<p>At imminent abortion at 7 dpi, placentomes showed extensive haemorrhages with varying degrees of separation of maternal and foetal parts. Histology and immunohistochemistry revealed similar results as those obtained from analysis of the 6 dpi group with haemorrhages and a neutrophilic inflammatory response in maternal villi, necrosis of maternal epithelium and strong positive staining for RVFV in maternal epithelial cells and foetal trophoblasts. In placentomes where foetal villi had already separated from the maternal caruncle, large areas of denuded maternal villi were seen. In addition in some maternal villi, blood vessels were found that stained positively for RVFV in the endothelium and/or smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel wall (
