<p>To study the pathogenesis of RVF in pregnant ewes, two experiments were performed. Ewes were infected at either one third of gestation (experiment 1) or at mid gestation (experiment 2). In both experiments, ewes were inoculated via intravenous route with a dose of 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of RVFV, an exposure route and dose that was used in previous studies with sheep [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the first experiment, a group of ten ewes was distributed randomly over two groups of five animals of which the first group was inoculated with virus and the second group with medium only (mock) (

Necropsy revealed a swollen, discoloured liver and signs of shock. Analysis of liver and spleen samples by RT-qPCR revealed high levels of viral RNA in both organs (

The remaining ewes were euthanized and necropsied as scheduled at 6 dpi. All ewes showed a multifocal necrotizing hepatitis which was most severe in the animal that died at 4 dpi. Although no abortions had occurred, all placentas revealed extensive haemorrhages in the placentomes and all foetuses had already died (
