<p>The most characteristic feature of RVFV epizootics are abortion storms in sheep herds. During these events, all pregnant ewes in an affected herd may abort their foetuses. Although the detrimental effects of RVFV infection on ruminant pregnancy are well-recognized, the route that the virus uses to cross the placenta and the pathogenic events that result in abortion have remained undescribed. Here, we report that maternal and foetal epithelial cells in the ovine placenta are highly susceptible and permissive for RVFV and that abortion results from severe pathology of the placenta. In some ewes, the rapid progression of placental demise caused foetal mortality before foetuses could be infected.</p>
