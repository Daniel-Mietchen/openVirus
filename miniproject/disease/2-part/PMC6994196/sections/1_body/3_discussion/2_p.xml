<p>During gestation, the progesterone hormone keeps the uterus and myometrium in a quiescent state to allow successful foetal development until parturition [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. During the first trimester of gestation in sheep, progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum which resides in the ovaries. During the second and third trimester, the developing placenta becomes an additional source of progesterone. Placental progesterone is produced by binucleate trophoblasts that migrate to the maternal epithelium to fuse with uterine epithelial cells to form so-called syncytial cells. At about 90 days of pregnancy, half of the progesterone in the pregnant ewe is produced by the corpus luteum and half by the placenta. Our study has revealed that both trophoblasts and (syncytial) epithelial cells are major target cells of RVFV. Widespread necrosis of these cells likely results in a drop of systemic progesterone levels. In addition, virus-induced necrosis of placental cells leads to the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines like TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-8, which stimulate prostaglandin (E2/F2α) excretion by the placental epithelium. Prostaglandins bring the corpus luteum in regression, resulting in a further drop in progesterone levels. In the absence of the inhibitory effect of progesterone, prostaglandins induce uterine contractions and cervical effacement resulting in abortion. Inflammatory cytokines, most notably TNF-α, are also known to reduce vascular integrity. In the face of lowered coagulation factors in maternal blood resulting from liver necrosis, this could explain the observed placental haemorrhages.
