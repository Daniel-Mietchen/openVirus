<p>Virus isolations from the supernatant of the human placenta explants were performed by a 10x serial dilution series of the supernatant in complete medium on Vero cells. At 24 hpi, infection was visualized with an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Briefly, cells were fixed and permeabilized 24 hpi with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min) and ice-cold methanol (5 min). After permeabilization the plates were incubated with RVFV specific monoclonal antibody 4-D4, which recognizes the Gn protein [
