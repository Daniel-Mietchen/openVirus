  <title>Experimental design and primary outcome parameters ewes.</title>
  <p>Ewes were inoculated intravenously with RVFV or mock inoculated at gestation day (gd) 55 (A) or day 78 (E) and euthanized at 4 (blue cross), 6 (green and purple crosses) or 7 (orange cross) days post inoculation (dpi). Purple numbers represent ewes that were mock-inoculated. Rectal temperatures (B, F), viremia by RT-qPCR (solid line, left y-axis), virus isolations (dotted line, right y-axis) (C, G) and the presence of RVFV in spleen and liver samples of the ewes (D, H) are depicted. Bars represent averages with SDs.</p>
