  <title>RVFV antigen in placentomes.</title>
  <p>Immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of RVFV antigen in cross sections of the placentomes at 4 dpi (experiment 2) and 6 dpi (experiment 1). At 4 dpi (A) only small foci of antigen positive cells are visible throughout the placentome while at 6 dpi (F) almost the entire placentome stains positive for RVFV antigen. Higher magnification of the synepitheliochorial placenta (SP) at 4 dpi (B) shows strong labelling of the maternal epithelial cells with only an individual positively stained foetal trophoblast (black arrowhead). At 6 dpi both maternal and foetal cell layers are strongly stained (G). In the haemophagous zone (HZ) at 4 dpi (C) only small clusters of foetal trophoblasts stain positive for RVFV antigen while at 6 dpi (H) the entire foetal trophoblast lining of the haemophagous zone stains positive. Panels D, E, I and J represent cross sections of uninfected placentomes corresponding to B, C, G and H, respectively, showing absence of background IHC staining. Red interrupted lines indicate the boundaries between maternal and foetal tissues. F; foetal villus, M; maternal villus, MB; maternal blood. Bar = 5000 μm (A, F) or 100 μm (B-J).</p>
