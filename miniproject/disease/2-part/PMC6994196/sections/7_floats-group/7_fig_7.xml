  <title>RVFV in human placental explants.</title>
  <p>Detection of viral RNA (A) and infectious virus (B) in human full term placental explants at different timepoints post infection. Viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR and infectious virus by virus isolation. (C, D, E) Immunohistochemical staining of RVFV with mAb 4-D4, counterstained with haematoxylin. (C) Single villus with syncytiotrophoblasts (black arrowheads) staining negative for RVFV antigen with cytotrophoblasts (brown staining, red arrowhead) staining positive. (D) Single villus in which no cytotrophoblasts are present, with positive staining of syncytiotrophoblasts (black arrowheads). (E) Single villus showing absence of background IHC staining in non-infected control placental explant. Syncytiotrophoblasts are indicated with black arrowheads. (F) Immunohistochemical staining of epithelial cells in a non-infected placental villus with a mAb to cytokeratin showing both the syncytiotrophoblast layer (black arrowheads) and the cytotrophoblast layer (red arrowheads). Bar = 20 μm (C, D, E) or 50 μm (F).</p>
