<p id="Par34">The emergence of H3N8 CIV in Florida during 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was unique. The high genetic homology of the emerging H3N8 CIV strain to the circulating H3N8 EIV of the Florida-1 clade and the geographic coincidence indicated that H3N8 CIV was likely a result of a host-range shift event. Interestingly, H3N8 EIV had been isolated from pigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], indicating the susceptibility of pigs to this virus. Interestingly, there was no seroconversion after the experimental inoculation of pigs with H3N8 EIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There is an apparent species-barrier for H3N8 EIV in pigs, although pigs have been implicated as a “mixing vessel” for influenza viruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, there were no phenotypic differences between H3N8 CIV and H3N8 EIV despite their diverged evolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Currently, H3N8 CIV is expanding in its geographic distribution and canine host breeds. In addition, CIV has evolved and diverged into multiple lineages and clades.
