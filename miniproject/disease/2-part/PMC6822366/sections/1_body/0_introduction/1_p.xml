<p id="Par31">Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>. The viral genome consists of eight negative-sensed RNA gene segments. According to the antigenicity of the two viral surface proteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), IAV is currently classified into 17 HA and 9 NA subtypes. All combinations of the 17 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been found in waterfowl, its natural host [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, only a few defined combinations of HA and NA subtypes circulate in mammalian hosts, e.g., H3N2 and H1N1 among humans and pigs and H3N8 among horses. The establishment of these mammalian influenza viruses, including human influenza A virus (hIAV), was the result of interspecies transmission of an avian influenza virus (AIV) in the past, either directly or through reassortment with circulating contemporary virus. Current evidence supports that interspecies transmission of influenza viruses occurs frequently; however, these occurrences usually result in “dead-end transmission”, possibly due to lack of viral adaptation to the new host species. The roles of the HA, NP, NS, PB1 and PB2 genes in adaption to mammalian hosts have been implicated [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, these studies mostly focused on the interspecies transmission of AIV to humans or experimentally inoculated mouse models.
