<p id="Par33">Prior to 2003, there was no evidence of circulation of a canine-specific influenza virus despite close contact with humans and with other mammalian species, such as swine and equines. Most influenza viruses can be cultivated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, indicating the potential susceptibility of dogs to influenza virus infection, at least at the cellular level. In fact, there were reports of isolation of H3N2 human influenza A virus (hIAV) from dogs during influenza epidemics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Natural and experimental transmission of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus to dogs has been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Notably, there were reports of H3N8 EIV infection in a British foxhound [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] as well as in dogs in the United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These reports suggest that dogs can be a host for influenza A virus. However, these influenza infections were “dead-end” infections, as there was no further sustained spread among dogs.
