 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Likewise, for the diverged sublineages of H3N8 CIV, different gene segment clustering in different clades was observed in several viruses, indicating intrasubtypic reassortment. Murcia et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] showed that intrasubtypic reassortment is common in H3N8 EIV, and reassortment results in enhanced virulence. Whether these CIV reassortments among these multiple clades have biological significance remains to be determined.
