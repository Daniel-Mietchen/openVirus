<p id="Par61">In conclusion, by conducting a phylodynamic analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary path of CIV, we have not only demonstrated that the interspecies transmission of H3N8 EIV to canine occurred in approximately 2002 but also shown that the progenitor virus was a reassortant virus involving an “ancestral NS1 gene segment”. Interspecies transmission of influenza viruses might occur more frequently than previously thought, but to adapt and remain in a new host species, that is, to undergo a host-range shift, unique combinations of gene segments plus critical mutations are required. Furthermore, H3N8 CIV has diverged into multiple sublineages or clades, possibly as a result of founder effect, in which the founder virus evolves within geographic or facility boundaries. Similar to other influenza viruses, frequent reassortment within and among these clades was observed. These findings provide a conceptual framework to understand the mechanism of interspecies transmission and host-range shifts of influenza viruses. Finally, although we utilized a computation-intensive genomics approach to reconstruct this host-range shift and the subsequent evolution and adaptation of CIV, phenotypic studies are still required to validate these results. These experiments are ongoing.</p>
