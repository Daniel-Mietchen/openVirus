<p id="Par55">In addition, the U content of each gene segment was analysed for both H3N8 CIV and H3N8 EIV. An increasing U content in viral gene segments is an indicator of viral adaptation to a new host species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. There was an increasing trend in the U content of each gene segment over time for both H3N8 CIV and H3N8 EIV (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), indicating that both viruses were adapting to their respective hosts. However, the rate of increase was significantly higher in the NS1 and M1 genes from H3N8 CIV. As discussed above, NS1 is involved in counteracting the host innate immune response, specifically downregulating interferon expression and interferon-induced antiviral responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Our results indicate that the adaptation of H3N8 CIV to canine species involved overcoming host innate immunity both at the pre-emerging and post-enzootic stages. Elucidating the underlying mechanism of this differential rate of increase in the U content between CIV and EIV for NS1 and M1 may shed light on this host-range shift from one mammalian host to another.
