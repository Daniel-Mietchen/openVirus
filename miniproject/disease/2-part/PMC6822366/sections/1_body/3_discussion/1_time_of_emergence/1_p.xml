<p id="Par52">Overall, our results indicate that the divergence time of H3N8 CIV was between 2002 and 2003. Interestingly, serological evidence of H3N8 EIV infection in British foxhounds was also determined to be approximately 2002 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the H3N8 EIV infecting British foxhounds was closely related to representatives of a sub-lineage of American viruses; this was a first incursion of this lineage into the region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Without viral isolation, it is difficult to determine if the virus infecting the British foxhounds was identical to that from Florida. Why did these two events of interspecies transmission by an apparently similar contemporary EIV result in different clinical outcomes? Our results indicated that the emerging H3N8 CIV was a reassortant virus that had fully adapted to the canine host when it emerged in 2002. However, whether there were multiple “attempts” by H3N8 EIV to establish in a canine host or whether there were “back-n-forth” progenitor viruses between the two host species, of which one successfully established, remains a major knowledge gap. That “successful” progenitor virus appeared to be a reassortant virus, as discussed below.
