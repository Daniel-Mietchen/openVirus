<p id="Par53">From the topology of the ML and MCC trees, we concluded that the emerged H3N8 CIV in Florida was a reassortant virus with an NS1 gene segment from an earlier EIV, which was also supported by the tMRCA of the NS1 gene segment to have emerged 1997–2005. The NS1 gene of influenza viruses, including H3N8 EIV, has been shown to counteract host innate immunity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Furthermore, NS1 of EIV was categorized into a pre-divergent lineage, Eurasian and American/Kentucky sub-lineages, and subsequently into Florida-1 and Florida-2 clades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Due to the segmented genome, the viral phenotype depends on the combination of the gene segments or its “gene constellation” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. It has also been shown that multiple EIVs have infected canines, and reassortment events have occurred in canines. The host-switch of EIV to CIV by the Florida-1 clade virus was “successful”, while the interspecies transmission event in England was not. Furthermore, during the spread of H3N8 EIV in Australia in 2007, dogs in close contact with infected horses developed clinical symptoms, with virus isolation from two index cases, but the virus did not spread further [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. One possibility is that in A/equine/Sydney/2007 (or “would be” A/canine/Sydney/2007), unlike A/canine/Florida/2003, the H3N8 EIV that crossed species to dogs in Sydney lacked the NS1 gene segment from a putative earlier H3N8 EIV and hence became a “dead-end” event, as shown by the phylogeny of the HA1 gene segment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. However, other factors, such as improved quarantine and a history of “back and forth” virus transmission, cannot be ruled out. Notably, the “donor” of the NS1 gene segment to the emerging strain of H3N8 CIV is particularly interesting and remains to be elucidated. It suggests that possibly its “evolutionary clock” differs from that of other gene segments, but this is unlikely. An alternative hypothesis is that there was a “frozen” virus strain in circulation. However, taking together, this “successful” interspecies transmission was a “rarity”, as a unique combination of gene segments was required, plus a unique amino acid substitution at the receptor-binding site in the HA gene (W222L) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Therefore, this interspecies transmission was not a “wholesale” event, but rather occurred during at least two events, one involving reassortment of a unique combination of gene segments and a mutation or adaptation at the receptor-binding site in the HA. However, whether these events were simultaneous or sequential remains unknown.
