<p id="Par37">After excluding partial sequences and non-full-length genome data, a total of forty-four (
 <italic>n</italic> = 44) complete genomes of H3N8 CIVs were included. The length of each gene segment was as follows: HA: 1695 nucleotides (nt); MP: 756 nt; NA: 1407 nt; NP: 1494 nt; NS: 690 nt; PA: 2148 nt; PB1: 2271 nt; and PB2: 2277 nt. For simplicity, only M1 and NS1 were included for analysis despite their alternative internal RNA splice sites. In all, a total of 12,738 nt for the eight gene segments were analysed.
