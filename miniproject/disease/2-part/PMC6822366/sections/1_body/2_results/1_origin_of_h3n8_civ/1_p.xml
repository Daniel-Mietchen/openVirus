<p id="Par42">In agreement with published reports, both temporal-spatial and molecular evidence suggest that H3N8 CIV originated from H3N8 EIV. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the phylogenies of the gene segments for the surface proteins, HA and NA; Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, B show the initial ML trees, and Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, D were generated by selecting subtrees that included all H3N8 CIVs and related lineages to identify the origin. Similarly, the phylogenies of the other six internal genes (M1, NP, NS1, PA, PB1, PB2), as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, further support the origin of CIV from EIV. In addition, the original ML trees also indicated that each gene segment of H3N8 CIV was closely related to the H3N8 EIV lineage (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), except for A/Florida/242/2003, A/Florida/15592.1/2004, and A/Florida/43/2004, which were not clustered with the other CIV segments in the NS1 gene tree (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). These isolates were among the “emerging clade”. Therefore, the emerging H3N8 CIV appeared to originate from a reassortant H3N8 EIV. Further evidence is provided below.
