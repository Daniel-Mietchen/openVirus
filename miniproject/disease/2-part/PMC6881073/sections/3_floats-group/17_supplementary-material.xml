  <title>Comparison of EV-A71 isolate sequences of primary specimens and passaged isolates.</title>
  <p>Strong heparin binders (denoted with asterisks) were more frequently identified from sequencing of passaged EV-A71 (at least one passage) than from direct sequencing of primary specimens, suggesting that the virus isolates have undergone heparin-binding adaptation in cell culture (
