  <title>Reversion of IEQ-244E
   <sup>+</sup> variant sequences after propagation in RD cells.
  </title>
  <p>A sequential reversion of VP1-244E to 244K was observed in IEQ-244E+ after cell culture propagation. Note that the 244T variant was also present in the mixed population. The mixed populations of K244 (red), T244 (pink) and E244 (maroon) are shown in different proportions. Only variants with frequency &gt;1% are reported. Note that samples B1 at P0 and B2 at P0 had poor sequencing coverages (between 110â€“5100). M indicates muscle, B indicates brain.</p>
