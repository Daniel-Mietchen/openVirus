  <title>Clinical scores and survival rates of suckling mice infected with EV-A71 variants.</title>
  <p>One-day old suckling mice (n = 9–12) were inoculated with 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of different EV-A71 variants by i.p. injection. (A) A litter of mock-infected mice was used as a control group receiving PBS injection. The clinical scores and percentage of survival of the infected mice groups were monitored daily for 13 days. The severity of clinical symptoms was scored as follows: 0, healthy; 1, weak or less active; 2 hunched posture and lethargy; 3, one-limb paralysis; 4, two-limb paralysis; 5, moribund or dead. Significant differences compared to KEQ are labelled as * (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and ***
   <italic>P</italic> (&lt; 0.001). KEQ, KKQ and KKE curves are identical to that of the mock-infected group. The representative VP1 sequence chromatograms of IEQ (B) and IEE (C) populations isolated from infected animal organs (n = 3) are shown, highlighting VP1-98, VP1-145 and VP1-244. The emergence of IEQ-244E virus isolated from brains and limbs of IEQ-infected moribund mice (n = 3) are shown.
