<p>Neurotropism and neurovirulence have been previously related to the virus binding to heparan sulfate (heparin), a negatively-charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) found abundantly on most cell surfaces. Strong affinity for heparin was reported to cause attenuation in viruses such as Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Japanese encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], Murray Valley encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], West Nile virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], yellow fever virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and tick-borne encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast, virus variants with weak heparin-binding resulted in higher mortality in mice, as shown for Sindbis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Interestingly, variants with strong heparin-binding can contribute to higher neurovirulence if inoculated directly into the CNS, as demonstrated with EEEV [
