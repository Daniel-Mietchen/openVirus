<p>EV-A71 also utilizes heparin as an attachment receptor [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Amino acids clustered around the five-fold symmetry axis, specifically VP1-98, VP1-145, VP1-242 and VP1-244 modulate positive charges required for heparin-binding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The VP1-145G/Q residues are associated with stronger heparin-binding, but not negatively-charged VP1-145E. The propensity of EV-A71 to acquire positively-charged residues at the five-fold axis is associated with increased heparin-binding upon
