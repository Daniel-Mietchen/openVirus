<p>In this current study, we sought to delineate the discrepancy exhibited between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytopathogenicity due to heparin-binding and association of weak heparin-binding with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence. We demonstrated that acquisition of negative charges at the five-fold axis reduced heparin-binding. This resulted in high viremia and enhanced lethality in mice.
