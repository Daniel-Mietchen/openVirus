<p>Simulated docking of 12-mer heparin to EV-A71 residues within a 4Ã… radius revealed no notable change in interaction energies between KEQ (-730.76 kcal/mol) and IEQ (-703.71 kcal/mol) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). The VP1-Q145E mutation of IEE resulted in a drop of 32.34 kcal/mol interaction energy when compared to KEQ. The IEQ-244E variant showed the weakest heparin-binding ability as the interaction energy drastically dropped to -476.32 kcal/mol. Compared to the IEQ-244E variant, the uncharged IEQ-244T variant exhibited higher interaction energies of -552.21 kcal/mol and -582.89 kcal/mol, respectively. The energy change was mainly contributed by the VP1-244 residue, with a descending energy order of 244K, 244T and 244E, which correlates with the scale of strong to weak heparin-binding (
