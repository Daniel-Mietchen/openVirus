<p>To investigate how the VP1-K244E mutation emerges during 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infection, 14 suckling mice were intraperitoneally infected with IEQ. The mice were sacrificed at days 3, 7 and 11 post-infection to harvest hind limbs and brains for NGS of the virus population diversity. At day 9 post-infection, two moribund mice were collected. We first screened all the harvested samples using RT-PCR. At day 3 post-infection, none of the collected organs were positive for EV-A71 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). All five muscle samples collected were positive for EV-A71 at day 7 post-infection, suggesting that viruses were replicating in skeletal muscles. Brain samples were negative suggesting that limited virus had disseminated to the brain at this time point. As expected, both muscle and brain samples collected from the moribund mice at day 9 post-infection were positive for EV-A71. None of the surviving mice collected at day 11 post-infection were positive for EV-A71 RNA in both hind limbs and brain.
