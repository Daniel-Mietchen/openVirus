<p>To characterize the impact of increased fidelity and recombination deficiency on 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence, one-day old suckling mice were infected with IEQ, IEQ-HF and IEQ-Rec
 <sup>-</sup>. Half of the IEQ-infected mice died by day 12 post-infection (

 <sup>-</sup> infection. Attempts to recover IEQ-HF and IEQ-Rec
 <sup>-</sup> viruses from all the surviving mice were unsuccessful. IEQ-HF and IEQ-Rec
 <sup>-</sup> did not result in any infections, and attenuated
