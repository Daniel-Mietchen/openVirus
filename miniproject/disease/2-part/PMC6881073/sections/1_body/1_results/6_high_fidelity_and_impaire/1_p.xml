<p>The emergence of a weak heparin-binding variant with VP1-244E mutation is the key determinant of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> adaptation and pathogenesis of IEQ. We hypothesized that IEQ is avirulent without the acquisition of the VP1-244E mutation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To reduce mutation rates and restrict generation of viral quasispecies, we engineered the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IEQ to harbor previously identified high-fidelity mutations G64R and L123F (abbreviated as HF in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and recombination-deficient mutation Y276H (labelled as Rec
 <sup>-</sup>) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We employed a luciferase-based replicon system to assess the impact of these mutations on genome replication. As demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, no significant differences in luciferase activities were observed between wild type EV-A71 Nluc Rep, EV-A71 Nluc Rep-HF and EV-A71 Nluc Rep-Rec
 <sup>-</sup>, suggesting that these mutated RdRp variants replicate as efficiently as the wild type. Next, we generated and rescued the IEQ-HF and IEQ-Rec
 <sup>-</sup> virus variants. These IEQ-HF and IEQ-Rec
 <sup>-</sup> variants were genetically stable with no reversion of mutations nor emergence of VP1-244E observed after a few passages, in addition to indistinguishable plaque morphology to IEQ (
