<p>The hind limb and brain samples from IEE and IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup>-infected mice were then processed for histopathological analysis, and results supported earlier findings. Immunohistochemical (IHC) examination revealed massive localization of viral antigens in both IEE and IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup>-infected muscles, indicating that skeletal muscle is an important replication site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Inflammation and extensive muscle damage were also observed in the haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained sections of muscle. Mild inflammation was detected in the cortex. Viral antigens were detected in neuron bodies and their axon dendrites mainly distributed in the pons and dentate nucleus (
