<p>We further investigated the heparin-binding of the EV-A71 variants. EV-A71 variants with VP1-145E (KKE, KEE and IEE) displayed significant reduction of 29.7%, 18.8% and 37.1% in heparin-binding, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Based on these heparin-binding results, the EV-A71 variants were categorized into two groups: strong heparin binder (KEQ, KKQ and IEQ) and weak heparin binder (KKE, KEE and IEE).
