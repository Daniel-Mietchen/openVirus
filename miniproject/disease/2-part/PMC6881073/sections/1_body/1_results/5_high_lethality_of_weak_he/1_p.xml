<p>Strong heparin-binding confers the advantage of promoting virus attachment on the cell surface, thus increasing the probability of virus-functional receptor interaction

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, we have demonstrated that a strong heparin-binding phenotype is deleterious to virus pathogenesis 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To unravel the discrepancy of cytopathogenicity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence, we investigated virus dissemination in mice. Following i.p. infection, five mice were sacrificed for viral load quantitation in brain and hind limbs. IEE and IEQ-244E
 <sup>+</sup> variants replicated to higher titers than IEQ in both hind limbs and brain, at day 2 and 4 post-infection (
