<p>As heparin-binding phenotype has been implicated in virulence of some neurotropic viruses, we studied the relationship between heparin-binding phenotype and mouse neurovirulence in EV-A71. Our data highlighted the key role of electrostatic interactions in shaping heparin-binding to confer virulence in mice. Among the weak heparin-binding variants used in this study (KKE, KEE and IEE), only IEE was associated with increased virulence and virus fitness 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Strikingly, IEQ, which should be a strong heparin binder, showed high virulence, and we showed that this was due to the mutation VP1-244E, which conferred weak heparin-binding. This VP1-244E mutation has been previously identified as a mouse virulence determinant [
