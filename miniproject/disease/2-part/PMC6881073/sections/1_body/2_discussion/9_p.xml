<p>Our current results have several limitations. We used i.p. and i.c. routes, and both are not the natural route of infection in humans. It would be interesting to use the oral route and examine the virulence in mice in future. The animal models used here were 1-day old suckling mice lacking of mature immune system, and both hSCARB2 and hPSGL-1 receptors. The use of hybrid mouse models such as hSCARB2/mSCARB2, hSCARB2 with 
 <italic>stat-1</italic> (interferon signalling) knock-out can provide efficient virus replication and mimics human pathogenesis [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> infection may help to mimic infection in human. Also in the study, only VP1 was sequenced, and there may be other genomic changes within the virus genome.
