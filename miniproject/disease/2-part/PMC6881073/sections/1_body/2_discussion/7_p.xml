<p>We speculate that our findings are not only limited to the murine model but may reflect neuropathogenesis in humans. Strong heparin-binding variants (KEQ and EGK) have been more frequently detected from sequencing of virus cultures than from direct sequencing of clinical specimens, suggesting that heparin-binding phenotypes are a consequence of adaptation to cell culture (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] further reinforces our view that weak heparin-binding is associated with virulence in humans, as we have shown in mice in the present study. EV-A71 infection is usually mild and limited to HFMD, with neurological complications seen in 0.1–1.1% and deaths in 0.01% to 0.03% [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The frequent reversion between heparin-binding and weak heparin-binding variants fulfils the trade-off hypothesis in which the virus juggles between the virulence and transmission. IEE and IEQ-244E are completely lethal whereas the IEQ variant demonstrated intermediate virulence in mice.
