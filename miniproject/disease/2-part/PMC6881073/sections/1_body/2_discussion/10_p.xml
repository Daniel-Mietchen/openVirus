<p>In summary, we showed that weak heparin-binding EV-A71 is highly virulent in mice, in contrast with strong heparin binders which show higher replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> due to culture adaptation. This study shows that weak heparin-binding EV-A71 is preferentially selected to disseminate via the bloodstream; in contrast, strong heparin-binding EV-A71 is adsorbed to peripheral tissues and rapidly cleared. The electrostatic surface charges at the VP1 capsid shape heparin-binding and hence EV-A71 virulence. Our findings provide the mechanistic action of heparin-dependent virulence, and have potential therapeutic implications for viruses which utilize heparin as an attachment receptor and are dependent on high viremia levels to cause infection.
