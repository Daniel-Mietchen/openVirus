<p>We proposed a hypothetical EV-A71 pathogenesis model to show the importance of heparin-binding in human infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007863.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Three determinant factors of EV-A71 virulence are virus entry, dissemination and neuroinvasion. Both strong and weak heparin binders could infect humans, probably at different susceptibility. Primary viremia is established upon virus entry in primary replication sites such as tonsils and oropharynx [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Strong heparin binders are absorbed to GAG-rich tissues and readily removed from blood circulation due to their high affinity to heparin, thereby reducing the viremia level. Weak heparin binders are not adsorbed into tissues, but remain in the bloodstream, undergoing further extraneural replication in skeletal muscles, giving rise to high viremia. Upon overcoming the immune system, the high viremia results in better replication and dissemination to skeletal muscles, and peripheral motor nerves, through which the virus invades the CNS by retrograde axonal transport [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. High viremia alone does not result in direct CNS invasion as the virus cannot traverse the BBB. Many research questions however remain. What additional host factors could alter the heparin-binding phenotypes? Could the host immune responses influence the fate of the viruses if activated early enough before the high viremia stage?
