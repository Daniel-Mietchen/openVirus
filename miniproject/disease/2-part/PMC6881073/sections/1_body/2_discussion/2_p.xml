<p>Six EV-A71 variants were engineered with different amino acids at VP2-149, VP1-98 and VP1-145. VP1-98 and VP1-145 also have important roles in binding to PSGL-1 found in blood cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both VP1-145 and VP2-149 have been implicated in mouse adaptation and virulence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The VP1-98 and VP1-145 residues also act as modulators of heparin-binding in cell culture [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Heparin-binding may impact virulence outcome through neuroinvasion or neurovirulence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Unlike SCARB2, heparin has not been showed to have roles in EV-A71 viral uncoating and internalization [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], suggesting that heparin-dependent virulence may not to be due to direct virus-functional receptor interaction. In mice, mSCARB2 and mPSGL-1 are known to poorly support EV-A71 infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, an unidentified mouse receptor could be utilized to achieve high viremia and dissemination. Many reports have shown that the mutations in our engineered variants could result in better binding to mouse cells after adaptation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007863.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As different cells may have different expression of EV-A71 receptors, tissue tropism and receptor availability will warrant further investigations. Also, KKE a poor heparin-binder, is avirulent 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Heparin-binding is not solely controlled by a single mutation, and compensatory or complementary mutations may change weak heparin binders to strong binders. Other unknown receptors and additional mechanisms may also be involved in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence.
