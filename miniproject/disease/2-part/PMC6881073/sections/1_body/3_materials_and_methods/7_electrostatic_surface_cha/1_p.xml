<p>The EV-A71 structure was visualized using Chimera software (UCSF Chimera version 1.10.1, USA). Electrostatic surface potentials of virus capsid were analyzed using the ‘Coulombic surface coloring’ function in which the capsid residues were labelled with different colors based on their electrostatic charges. Positively-charged residues were colored blue while negatively-charged residues were colored red.</p>
