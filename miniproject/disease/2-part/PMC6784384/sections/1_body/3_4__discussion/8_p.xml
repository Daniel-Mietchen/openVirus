<p>Vaccine licensure under the Animal Rule for the DOD VEEV vaccine initially will be requested only for protection against aerosol challenge with VEEV TrD strain. However, VEEV vaccine candidates demonstrating protection against the TrD strain will likely protect against other IAB and IC epizootic strains, based on phylogenetic/antigenic similarities among the epizootic strains [

While phylogenetic differences may be greater with VEEV IE and the former VEEV complex subtypes VEE IF and VEE complex subtypes II to IV, the highly conserved E1 protein among alphaviruses may potentially result in cross-immunogenicity of epizootic-based vaccines against these former VEE complex subtypes via vaccine-induced antibodies to E1 and E2 envelope proteins [
