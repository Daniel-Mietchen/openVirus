<p>A concern in the propagation of VEEV stocks and challenge material was a potential variation in virulence associated with the different sized plaques observed in cell cultures of wild-type VEEV (both large- and small-sized plaques). Variability in plaque size was also addressed by the FANG in the generation of Ebola virus challenge material under the Animal Rule, as the larger-sized plaques of 8U Ebola (attributed to virus adaptation in cell culture) were less virulent than the smaller-sized 7U Ebola virus plaques [

To address and avoid variations in the virulence of viral stocks due to 7U and 8U Ebola virus plaques, the Filovirus group developed a characterization, release, and stability test plan that would be used to evaluate master and working virus stocks generated using uncloned (wild-type) methodology and the cDNA-cloned methodology. However, the propagation of virus stocks using the cDNA-cloned methodology for Ebola virus was demonstrated not to be a viable option due to non-reproducibility of lots (different consensus sequences in each lot produced) and to the lower virulence of the cDNA clone-derived virus compared to the parent clone.
