<p>Guidance for virus strain selection for the animal model in the FDA document “Product Development under the Animal Rule- Guidance for Industry” notes selection of the virus strain should consider strain origin, virulence, passage history in cultures and animals, known disease progression in the animal model, and relevancy to human disease [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00807" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The strain must also result in similar disease and pathophysiology in the selected animal model as occurs in humans by the designated exposure route. Logistical issues (e.g., strain availability, replication characteristics to generate challenge material) and the sponsor’s objectives for vaccine protection must also be considered in strain selection.
