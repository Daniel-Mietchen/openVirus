<p>VEEV aerosol and IN challenge of several mouse strains (CD-1, BALB/c, outbred ICR, and C3H/HeN mice) in the literature were demonstrated to be lethal models, with death mainly due to encephalitis. Mice were challenged most commonly with wild-type VEE TrD strain or V3000 strain (VEEV derived from a cDNA clone of the VEE TrD strain with a passage history of once in guinea pig brain and 14 times in chick embryonated eggs) [

These studies demonstrated that, regardless of the exposure route, VEEV in mice entered the CNS mainly via the olfactory system due to the increased susceptibility of olfactory neurons to VEEV infection. Unlike subcutaneous (SC) challenge of VEEV that required a viremia before infection of the olfactory system, aerosol and IN challenge resulted in direct infection of the nasal mucosa and olfactory system with early neuroinvasion that occurred before the onset of viremia.
