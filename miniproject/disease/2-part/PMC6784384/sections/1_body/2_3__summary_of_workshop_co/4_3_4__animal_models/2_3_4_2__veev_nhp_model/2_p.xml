<p>Earlier NHP studies comparing aerosol/IN to parenteral VEEV challenge were often limited due to the absence of immunohistochemistry staining, electronmicrography, and VEEV strain characterization. Nevertheless, similar to mice, these NHP studies demonstrated earlier onset and more severe CNS disease after aerosol and IN challenge as compared to parenteral challenge. Unlike the mouse model, VEEV neuroinvasion and neurovirulence were more limited, resulting in a nonlethal infection. Similar to mice studies, studies in NHPs supported aerosol and IN challenge routes to be associated with early and direct CNS infection via the olfactory pathway, including studies that detected VEEV in the olfactory bulb within 48 h post-IN challenge (compared to 6 days after intraperitoneal challenge) and before the onset of viremia. Studies demonstrated that intratracheal challenge (bypassing the upper respiratory tract) or aerosol challenge of NHPs after surgical interruption of the olfactory tracts resulted in delayed and less severe CNS infection similar to parenteral VEEV challenge [

Although clinical and histopathological findings support both the rhesus and cynomolgus macaques as potential nonlethal animal models under the Animal Rule, most recent vaccine trials have used the cynomolgus macaque model to demonstrate vaccine efficacy against aerosol VEEV challenge [
