<p>The objective of the characterization of the VEEV challenge material from the virus stocks was to maintain purity, identity, potency, and uniformity of lots. The alphavirus workshop reviewed the pros and cons of three methodologies in regards to the generation of virus stocks and challenge material that would result in the reproducibility of potency (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00807-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The use of plaque-purified virus stocks carried the risk of not being able to replicate the performance of wild-type (uncloned) viral stocks if the selected plaque had suboptimal animal model fitness. The majority of experts felt that the cDNA clone-derived stock offered the most controlled pathway, as it would result in an unlimited supply of the virus derived from a well-characterized consensus sequence (expected to produce similar-sized plaques) and would avoid the potential for phenotypic changes associated with additional passages needed for the propagation of new master and working challenge material banks. Potential benefits from using uncloned (wild-type) VEEV to generate virus stocks were outweighed by identified disadvantages that included the lack of control of cell culture-adaptive mutations due to various passages, in vivo virus attenuation, and the potential need for additional culture passages to replenish the master and working challenge banks.
