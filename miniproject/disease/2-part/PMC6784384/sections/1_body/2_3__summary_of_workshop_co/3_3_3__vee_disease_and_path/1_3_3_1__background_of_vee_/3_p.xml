<p>Of note, the VEEV exposure doses in humans, whether laboratory-, vaccine-, or mosquito-acquired, were likely lower than aerosol challenge doses of NHPs which often were ≥1 × 10

The infrequent occurrence of CNS disease in adult humans by aerosol exposure may be species-related, with younger age and elderly being the major risk factors for CNS disease in humans. It is unknown if higher aerosol challenge doses in humans would result in increased CNS disease.
