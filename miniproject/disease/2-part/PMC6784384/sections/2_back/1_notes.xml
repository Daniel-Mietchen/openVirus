 <p>All authors attended and contributed to discussions at the alphavirus workshop, and also contributed to the writing and editing of the report. J.M.R. was the primary author of this manuscript. A.M.G. organized the workshop and committee meetings. P.J.G., S.C.W., C.L.S., and W.K. gave presentations at the alphaviral workshop on propagation methodologies for viral stocks, which were used to select the propagation methodology for the VEEV stocks. VEEV strains listed in the manuscript were based on literature review and isolates available at institutions with known VEEV repositories (P.J.G., A.M.G.). Comparison of animal challenge studies and human disease due to the selected VEEV isolates was based on review of the literature (J.M.R., P.J.G.) and from animal studies pending publication (P.J.G., C.L.S., S.C.W., W.K.). L.A.W., C.S.B., C.L.S., and F.N. provided technical oversight and guidance for challenge material preparation and testing strategies.</p>
