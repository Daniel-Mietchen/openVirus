<p> Furthermore, re-infection of macaques with the influenza virus has led to a rapid appearance of ADCC responses. Antibodies capable of inducing activation of NK cells were found in the bronchoalveolar lavages of the macaques, which correlated with a reduced virus shedding and decreased disease duration [

Moreover, elderly people who had previously been infected with viruses close to the strain that caused the 2009 swine influenza pandemic and who retained a significant amount of titers of the antibodies participating in ADCC but had no neutralizing antibodies were protected from the pandemic influenza virus. Thus, non-neutralizing HA stem-specific antibodies capable of inducing ADCC are directly related to the level of protection against an influenza virus [

In addition, according to published data, vaccines against seasonal influenza viruses weakly induce the production of antibodies that can participate in ADCC, while the presence of NK cell-activating antibodies with a broad spectrum of activity in elderly people suggests that these antibodies accumulate over a lifetime as a result of re-infection with various influenza virus strains [
