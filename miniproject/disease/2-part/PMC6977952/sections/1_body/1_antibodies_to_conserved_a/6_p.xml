<p> One of the main targets for the antibodies involved in ADCC is the conserved stem of HA, which is one of the most represented surface proteins of the influenza virus. For instance, it has been shown that antibodies with a broad spectrum of activity against the conserved HA stem protect mice from a lethal influenza infection through a mechanism that involves an interaction with Fc-FcγR. On the contrary, the protective activity of antibodies in relation to the variable head domain of HA has manifested itself both in the presence and absence of an interaction with FcγR [
