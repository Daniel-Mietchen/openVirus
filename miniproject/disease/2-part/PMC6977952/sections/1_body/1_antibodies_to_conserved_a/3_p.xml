<p> Neutralizing antibodies can bind with their Fc region to the specific Fc receptors exposed on the surface of most immune cells, including NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils

 </italic>. After binding to antibodies, these immune cells are activated and become involved in the defense response against a pathogen. A total of six different receptors involved in the activation (FcγRI, IIA, IIC, IIIA, and IIIB) or inhibition (FcγRIIB1/B2) of human immune cells have been described. Non-neutralizing antibodies can also activate the complement system
