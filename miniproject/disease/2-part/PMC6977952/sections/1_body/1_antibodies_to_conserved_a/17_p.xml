<p> A study of the ADCP mechanism in the influenza infection showed that both macrophages and neutrophils are quickly recruited to the lungs and are present in bronchoalveolar lavage, the respiratory tract, and alveoli, where they contribute to the rapid scavenging of infected and dead cells. Although the supernatant of influenza-infected cells can stimulate phagocytosis by monocytes regardless of the involvement of antibodies [
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], antibodies contribute to the effective clearance of viral particles and infected cells by interacting with the FcγRIa and FcγRIIa on immune cells. Antibody-mediated viral phagocytosis causes a decrease in the infection spread and severity, as well as it symptoms, and a reduction in virus shedding [
