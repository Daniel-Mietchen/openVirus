<p> Another conserved influenza protein found on the surface of infected cells is the M2 ion channel. Antibodies to this protein can protect mice from an influenza virus infection in laboratory experiments. Moreover, in the immunization of animals with the M2 ectodomain both in soluble form and as conjugated to various carriers, the protective ability depends mainly on the antibodies. Notably, the presence of NK cells was critical to protection. [
