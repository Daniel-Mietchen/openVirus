<p> Unlike neutralizing antibodies, the functions of which are implemented by the variable regions, the effect of non-neutralizing antibodies depends on the conserved Fc region. The Fc region is able to interact with various components of the immune system, while the variable part of the antibody binds to the antigen. The most significant antibody isotypes for the implementation of the effector functions of non-neutralizing antibodies are IgG and IgM, with IgG3 possessing the highest functional potential [
