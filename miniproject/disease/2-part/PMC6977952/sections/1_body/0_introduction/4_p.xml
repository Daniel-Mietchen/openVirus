<p> The key to evaluating the effectiveness of influenza vaccines is to determine the level of humoral response after vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies to the globular head domain of hemagglutinin are produced during viral infection and undergird the protective mechanisms of all the influenza vaccines available to date [
