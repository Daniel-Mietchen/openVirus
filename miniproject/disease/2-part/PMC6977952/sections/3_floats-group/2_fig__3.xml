  <p> Evaluation of ADCC in the laboratory. (a) Evaluation of ADCC using immobilized influenza virus antigens. Firstly, antigens are immobilized, washed, and incubated with serum or IgG isolated from the blood. Secondly, unbound IgGs are washed off and effector cells (peripheral blood monocytes or isolated NK cells) are added to the antigen-antibody complex. Thirdly, after incubation, activation of the effector cells is analyzed. Activation is evaluated by adding labeled antibodies to the surface and secreted marker proteins (as a rule, the surface membrane activation marker CD107a and interferon gamma are used). (b) Evaluation of ADCC using influenza virus-infected cells or target cells expressing the major viral antigens. Cells expressing viral antigens are incubated with serum or preliminarily purified IgG. Next, effector cells are added to the antibody-treated cells and ADCC is evaluated by counting dead target antibody-treated cells </p>
