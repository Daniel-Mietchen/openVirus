  <p> The mechanism of the protective action of the antibodies binding to the ectodomain of the influenza M2 ion channel. Respiratory tract epithelial cells infected with the influenza A virus expose the HA, NA, and M2 viral proteins on their surface. New viral particles are budding from the infected cells. On the surface of the budding virion, antibodies bind to the ectodomain of the M2 protein and opsonize the viral particle. These antibodies activate alveolar macrophages via Fcγ receptors. Activated macrophages are able to phagocytize budding virions and fragments of the cell membrane containing the M2 protein. Dying infected cells can be also opsonized by antibodies to the M2 ectodomain and phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages via the FcγR-dependent pathway. Activated macrophages also produce type I interferons, which possess antiviral activity and regulate the expression of chemokine CCL2, which attracts bone marrow macrophages promoting tissue repair </p>
