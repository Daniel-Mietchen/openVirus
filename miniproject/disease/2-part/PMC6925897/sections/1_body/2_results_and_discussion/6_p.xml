<p id="Par26">In order to investigate whether RNA structure affects NS1 expression, we studied NS1 protein accumulation in cells during the first 8–12 h.p.i. Cell cultures were infected at high dose (moi = 10), and cell samples were fixed every 2 h for evaluation of NS1 expression by ELISA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We observed that NS1 levels were significantly higher at 6 h.p.i. for viruses 1–1 and 1–0, both of which feature a hairpin-type secondary structure in the first NS region. The reduced NS1 protein expression/accumulation observed is likely due to the role of the structures designed (via mutations G123A and A132G in the 82–148 NS RNA region). We cannot, however, definitively rule out that the primary changes (DNA/RNA substitutions) may play some kind of role. The type of structure in the second region had no obvious effect. Observations were similar in MDCK cells and A549 cells.
