<p id="Par23">To confirm the presence of the predicted RNA secondary structure differences, we performed in vitro transcription of the regions of interest, followed by electrophoresis. Native electrophoresis provides an approach for identification of RNA structure differences in samples and has been used for this purpose in previous publications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We observed that the RNA fragments had identical mobilities under denaturing conditions, yet different mobilities under native conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As expected, sequences predicted to fold in more compact hairpin structures moved faster under native conditions. Thus, we confirmed the existence of RNA secondary structure differences in the NS RNA fragments 82–148 and 497–564 obtained from the constructed NS gene plasmids.
