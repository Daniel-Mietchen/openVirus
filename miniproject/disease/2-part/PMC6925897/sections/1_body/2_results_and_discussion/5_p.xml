<p id="Par25">Further, we evaluated the replication of the assembled viruses using multi-cycle growth curves in different cell cultures. Vero, MDCK, or A549 cells were infected at low multiplicity of infection (moi = 0.001), and the titers of viral progeny (from infected cell supernatants) were determined at 24, 36, 48, and 72 h post infection (h.p.i). No significant differences were identified between the viruses as a function of NS gene RNA structures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The only difference seen was between host cell types; infection in A549 cells developed more slowly, as indicated by the lower TCID
 <sub>50</sub> values for the first time point. Despite the observed uniformity of multi-cycle infection, the fact that viruses with various NS RNA structures differed from each other by infectious activity after transfection, led us to theorize that RNA structure may be important in the early stages of infection. Therefore, we continued our research, yet limiting ourselves to the first infection cycle.
