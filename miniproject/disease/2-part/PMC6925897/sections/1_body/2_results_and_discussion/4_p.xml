<p id="Par24">We next determined whether these RNA structure differences are involved in viral replication. We rescued 4 influenza viruses that have predicted combinations of NS gene RNA secondary structures. Using the four constructed NS gene plasmids and seven other plasmids encoding the remaining A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genes, we transfected Vero cells to obtain viruses by reverse genetics. Three days post cell transfection, we collected culture supernatants containing assembled viruses and determined their infectious activity by titration in Vero cells. Virus “1–1”, containing hairpin structures in both NS regions, had higher titers than other viruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In addition, the lowest infectious titer corresponded to virus “0–0”, which doesn’t carry hairpin NS RNA secondary structures at either region.
