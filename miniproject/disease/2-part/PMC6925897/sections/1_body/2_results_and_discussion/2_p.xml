<p id="Par22">In order to obtain four influenza virus strains that would differ only by NS RNA secondary structures in the regions of interest, we used the well characterized influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) laboratory strain as the backbone and performed site-directed mutagenesis on the NS gene. Mutations were introduced into a plasmid encoding the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) NS gene to obtain sequences at regions 82–148 and 497–564 identical to those of the selected sequences. We obtained 4 plasmids encoding the A/PR/8/34 virus NS with different RNA secondary structures in regions 82–148 (region 1) and 497–564 (region 2). The naming of the 4 plasmids, according to the structures present, is as follows: “1–1” (hairpin in both regions); “1–0” (hairpin at region 1); “0–1” (hairpin at region 2); and “0–0” (without hairpins).</p>
