<p id="Par28">Due to the fact that significant NS1 expression differences were seen by ELISA, but not by PCR, we assume that the observed effect occurs at the level of translation, not transcription. This result fits with previously published research wherein disruption of the 82â€“148 hairpin resulted in decreased NS1 protein expression in plasmid transfection experiments [

Our data also supports the suggestion that the RNA hairpin of the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (hairpin in first region) may promote the production of higher NS1 protein levels, potentially determining the pathogenic properties of that strain. Thus, we consider the hairpin RNA structure in the first NS mRNA region as a potential upregulator of NS1 expression.
