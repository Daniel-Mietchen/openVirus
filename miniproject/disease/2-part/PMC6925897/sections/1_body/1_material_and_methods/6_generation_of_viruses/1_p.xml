 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Plasmids encoding 8 gene segments of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) including mutated NS segments were transfected into Vero cells by Nucleofector technology (Amaxa #VCA-1003). Viruses were collected from the supernatant 72 h post transfection, and working stock was generated by one passage in Vero cells at moi = 0.01. Virus infectious activity was measured by titration in Vero cells. The 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) endpoint was calculated by the Reed and Muench method [
