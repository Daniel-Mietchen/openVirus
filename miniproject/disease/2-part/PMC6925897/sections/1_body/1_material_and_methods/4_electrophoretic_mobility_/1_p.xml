<p id="Par14">For analysis under denaturing conditions, 1 μg of each RNA sample was mixed with an equal volume of 2x RNA Gel Loading Dye (Thermo Scientific, #R0641), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then heated for 3 min at 95 °C. Samples were subsequently loaded onto a PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide/8 M urea) and run in TBE buffer at 55 °C. For analysis under native conditions, samples were incubated for 2 min at 90 °C, followed by slow cooling (approx. 2 degrees per 20 s) until 37 °C, and further incubated for 25 min at 37 °C, as described by the Moss group [

Samples were then mixed with 6x gel loading buffer without formamide (0.25% bromophenol blue (w/v), 0.25% xylene cyanol FF (w/v), 40% sucrose (w/v)), loaded onto a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and run in 0.5xTBE buffer at 37 °C. Gels were stained with silver nitrate [
