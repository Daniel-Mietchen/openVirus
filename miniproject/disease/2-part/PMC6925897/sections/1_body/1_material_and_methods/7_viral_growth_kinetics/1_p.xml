<p id="Par17">Multi-cycle viral growth kinetics were measured in Vero, MDCK, and A549 cells (overnight confluent, 6-well plate format, triplicates) by infection with virus at moi = 0.001 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell). After 1 h of virus adsorption at room temperature, medium was replaced. Serum free culture media (see above) was supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco) and TPCK-trypsin (Sigma) at: 2.5 μg/ml for MDCK; and 0.5 μg/ml for A549 and Vero. Viral progeny was collected from the supernatant at the indicated time points, and infectious titers were measured.
