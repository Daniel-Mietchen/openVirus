<p>For this study, we first abstracted from the system the numbers of symptomatic passengers and passengers who were tested for dengue infection, to calculate the proportion of dengue-positive cases among tested passengers during 2007–2012. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic affected passengers during 2009–2010. After further considering the data completeness and quality, we included all inbound passengers at TPE who were tested for dengue infection in 2011 and excluded those having indeterminate test results. We also abstracted the number of passengers who tested positive and negative for dengue infection in 2011 and calculated the proportion of dengue-positive cases among tested passengers by month.</p>
