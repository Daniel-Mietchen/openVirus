<p>For febrile passengers coming from dengue-endemic countries, quarantine officers collect blood specimens to enable testing for dengue infection. All serum samples are sent to the central laboratory of TCDC for analysis by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen rapid test, envelope membraneâ€“specific capture immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A diagnosis of dengue virus infection was confirmed by the finding of at least one of these criteria: NS1 antigen rapid test positivity; recent dengue infection, as indicated by ELISA results (a seroconversion in IgM antibody or a fourfold or greater change in IgG antibody titers in paired serum samples); and RT-PCR positivity for one of four serotypes of dengue viruses.</p>
