<p>To analyze the predictors of confirmed dengue virus infection among febrile passengers, we collected several key demographic and travel characteristics such as sex, age, purpose of travel, departure country, length of stay in dengue-endemic countries, and self-reported occurrence of mosquito bite within 2 weeks before entry. We asked each symptomatic passenger about having fever/chills, headache, myalgia/bone pain, fatigue, skin rashes, and any of the following upper respiratory symptoms: cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruction. We categorized passengers’ ages in four groups: 0–19 years, 20–39 years, 40–59 years, and ≥60 years. We classified the purposes of travel in five categories: group tourism, independent tourism, visiting friends and relatives, business, and other. We classified the lengths of stays in dengue-endemic countries in five categories: ≤7 days, 8–14 days, 15–21 days, 22–28 days, and ≥29 days. We categorized tympanic temperatures in two groups: ≤38.9°C and ≥39.0°C.</p>
