<p>Prompt recognition and isolation of inbound passengers with dengue at borders could prevent local transmission of diseases. A prospective study of adult short-term travelers from the Netherlands to dengue-endemic areas showed that seroconversion for antibodies to dengue virus occurred in 1.2% of travelers at risk [

Although the proportion of dengue-positive cases among tested febrile passengers was relatively low in this study, approximately half of imported dengue cases in Taiwan were identified at the airport border. Early diagnosis and recognition can prevent dengue virus transmission in the community. To improve the efficiency and decrease the overall cost of surveillance, it might be efficient to aim screening toward the specific risk groups identified in this study. This is extremely important in Taiwan because of the large number of inbound passengers from Southeast Asia, where dengue is endemic.
