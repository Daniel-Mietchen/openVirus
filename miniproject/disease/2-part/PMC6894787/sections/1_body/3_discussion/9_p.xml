A study reviewing dengue infection among international travelers visiting Bali, Indonesia, showed that the most common clinical manifestation was fever, followed by myalgia, headache, and malaise. Rash was found in only 9.8% of the patients [

Skin rashes could be a specific symptom for dengue, but the number of cases was relatively small. Therefore, when screening inbound passengers in a resource-limited setting, high fever may be the most important single symptom or sign for detecting dengue infection.
