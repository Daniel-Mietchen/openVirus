<p>This study showed an association between dengue virus infection in febrile incoming passengers and certain characteristics: older age, longer stays in dengue-endemic countries, self-reported fever, skin rashes, and tympanic temperature ≥39°C. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining data from active surveillance for dengue among all inbound passengers at an international airport. Dengue has been reported as the most common cause of febrile illness among people who seek medical care after travel to Latin America or Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0225840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but the epidemiological characteristics and clinical details of dengue patients among returning travelers remain unknown. The majority of previous studies analyzing the predictors of dengue virus infection among travelers were conducted in hospital settings, thus excluding those who were infected but did not seek medical attention. The current findings may be useful to public health workers for identifying imported dengue cases among inbound travelers and to clinicians for diagnosing travelers with suspect dengue infection and providing them with adequate treatment.
