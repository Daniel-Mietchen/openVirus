<p>The most commonly reported symptoms among dengue patients were fever/chills (35 patients, 47%), followed by headache (10 patients, 14%), myalgia/bone pain (7 patients, 9%), skin rashes (5 patients, 7%), and fatigue (3 patients, 4%). (

Results of univariate analysis revealed statistically significant association of dengue virus infection with passenger age, purpose of travel, length of stay in dengue-endemic countries, and self-reported fever, fatigue, skin rashes, and tympanic temperature ≥39.0°C (

The odds of being dengue-positive for those aged 20–39, 40–59, and ≥60 years were 3.2, 5.4, and 8.7-fold higher than those aged 0–19 years, respectively.
