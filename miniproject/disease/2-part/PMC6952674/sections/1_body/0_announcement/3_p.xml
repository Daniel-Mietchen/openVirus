<p>To support ongoing and enhanced CHIKV surveillance within Australasia and provide contemporary sequences for continued scrutiny of existing molecular diagnostic assays, we performed WGS as previously described (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from passage 1 C6/36 culture supernatants from each of the Bangladesh 2017 and Thail 2019 isolates using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Chadstone, Australia) without carrier RNA. Host and potentially contaminating microbial DNA was removed with DNase treatment (Heat&amp;Run kit; ArcticZymes, Scientifix, South Yarra, Australia). RNA was converted to cDNA using the ProtoScript II first-strand cDNA kit (New England Biolabs), and second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using an enzyme cocktail of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> DNA ligase, DNA polymerase I, and RNase H (New England Biolabs). The Nextera XT kit was used for cDNA library construction, and paired-end (2 × 151 nucleotides [nt]) sequencing was performed using the V2 midoutput kit on a NextSeq 500 machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
