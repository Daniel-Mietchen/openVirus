    <sup>#</sup>The numbers are based on an assumption that the subject had been infected with a single virus and it was the one against which the highest neutralising activity (darker shade) was observed. 
    <sup>∗</sup>The value is significantly greater (

    <italic>t</italic>-test) than the corresponding value in the same row.
