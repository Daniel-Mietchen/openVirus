  <p>Prevalence of neutralising antibodies against arboviruses 
   <bold>(Aâ€“H)</bold> in plasma obtained from blood donors. Analysis performed by plotting prevalence of neutralising antibodies against age groups: Line A (squares), neutralising antibodies against any virus considered to represent an infection with that virus; i.e., ignoring the possibility of serological cross-reactions; Line B (diamonds), including samples that neutralised only one virus; i.e., excluding all samples which may have contained cross-reactive antibodies; Line C (circles), each subject was infected with only a single virus and it was the one against which the highest neutralising activity was observed; i.e., all other neutralising activity was assumed to be due to cross-reactive antibodies.
