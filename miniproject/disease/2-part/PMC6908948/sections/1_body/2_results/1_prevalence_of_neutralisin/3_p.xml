<p>The prevalence of antibody to a virus increased with the age of the donor, except for ALFV, but only with RRV, EHV, and KUNV was there a significant linear association between antibody prevalence and age (

If it is assumed that each subject was infected with only a single virus and it was the one against which the highest neutralising activity was observed (assumption number 3, section ‘Materials and Methods’), the annual infection rate calculated for viruses among blood donors in Queensland were: RRV 1.3%, BFV 0.3%, EHV 0.15%, KUNV 0.15%, MVEV 0.1%, and STRV 0.05%.
