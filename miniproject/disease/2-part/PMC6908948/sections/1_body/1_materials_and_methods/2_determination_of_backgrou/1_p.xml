<p>Neutralisation tests with plasma from blood donors employed the following prototype strains of viruses: ALFV MRM3929 (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">French, 1952</xref>). Australian alphaviruses and flaviviruses were reported to produce plaques on monolayers of porcine stable equine kidney cells (PS-EK; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gorman et al., 1975</xref>) but BFV did not do so in our experience. As all alphaviruses of interest, including BFV, formed plaques on baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, the study employed PS-EK cells for neutralisation tests involving flaviviruses and BHK cells for tests involving alphaviruses.
