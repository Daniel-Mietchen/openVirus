<p>A modification of the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) of 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aaskov and Davies (1979)</xref> was employed to detect IgM antibodies against a range of alphaviruses (BFV, RRV, and SINV) and flaviviruses (ALFV, EHV, KOKV, KUNV, MVEV, and STRV) in sera from UFI patients. Briefly, 40 μL of a suspension of virus-infected C6/36 cells (approximately 1.25 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells) was aliquoted onto each well of a 12-well Teflon-coated IFA slide (Cell Line Diagnostic, Thermo Scientific, Dreieich, Germany). After allowing cells to settle, the liquid in each well was aspirated and cells were air-dried (at room temperature for 15 min) before being fixed in ice-cold acetone (2 min). Fifty μL of serum from each UFI patient was diluted 1 in 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and added to each spot on the IFA slide containing infected cells before the slide was incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Slides were then washed in PBS, three times for 10 min each. Secondary antibody [FITC-labelled polyclonal rabbit anti-human IgM (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)], was added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 30–45 min before undergoing three further washes in PBS. A glass cover slip was placed over the slide and cells were viewed under a UV microscope (Eclipse, Nikon, Minato, Japan) using phloem illumination. Cells were considered to be infected if a clear green fluorescent signal was observed in the cytoplasm.
