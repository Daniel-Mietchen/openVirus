<p>In order to exclude the possibility that the apparent anti-viral IgM reactions in IFAs were due to IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) attaching to anti-viral IgG, all IgM-reactive samples were tested for the presence of RF using a latex agglutination assay, performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Dutch Diagnostics, Zutphen, Netherlands). Briefly, 50 μL of the UFI sample and one drop of RF-latex reagent were mixed with a stirrer and then shaken at 100 rpm for 2 min. Semi-quantitative assays were performed by making twofold dilutions of serum in normal saline before being added to the RF-latex reagent. The approximate concentration of RF was calculated by multiplying the RF titre by 8 IU/mL, as suggested by the manufacturer.</p>
