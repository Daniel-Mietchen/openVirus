<p>Confounders of the observed seroprevalence of anti-flavivirus antibodies were the failure to test for anti-DENV antibodies and the possibility that blood donors had been vaccinated against either yellow fever or Japanese encephalitis. However, neither yellow fever nor Japanese encephalitis is endemic to Australia so immunisation would be recommended only in the event of international travel. Use of these vaccines among the Australian population, especially in regional communities, is assumed to be very low and this is unlikely to have influenced the results obtained. There are both locally acquired DENV infections and large numbers of Australian tourists returning with DENV infection acquired overseas. However, few, if any, of the levels of anti-flavivirus neutralising activity detected among plasma from blood donors could have been attributed to cross-reactive anti-DENV antibody from healthy blood donors.</p>
