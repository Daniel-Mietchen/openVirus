<p>Approximately 5.7% of UFI subjects had been infected recently (i.e., this proportion of sera contained anti-viral IgM) by one of the neglected Australian flaviviruses for which a diagnostic test was not requested or is not available in commercial laboratories. However, as these samples were collected during the wet summer months when the rate of transmission of the common arboviruses RRV, BFV, and DENV is highest, the annual value might be less than 5.7%. The detection of anti-RRV and anti-BFV IgM antibody in sera from a small number of these patients was unexpected because serology tests to determine the infection caused by these viruses might have been requested and performed on these samples using commercial ELISA. However, the ethical constraints on this study prevented retrospective access to any related serology that may have been conducted on these samples by a pathology laboratory. The PanBio ELISA kits, the only commercial tests for diagnosis of RRV and BFV currently available in Australia, have a sensitivity of 98.5% for IgM detection (
