<p>The annual RRV infection rate determined by our investigation (1.3%) is in close agreement with that observed by 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Doherty et al. (1966)</xref> (1.4 to 3.2% for residents of Cape York Peninsula, North Queensland), by 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Doherty et al. (1968)</xref> (1.5% for residents of Innisfail, Far North Queensland) and by 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aaskov et al. (1981)</xref> (1.4% for residents of Central and North Queensland). Taken together, these results suggest that there have been constant and continuous RRV infections in Queensland for decades. Furthermore, these findings also indicate that there was no major bias in the sampling of sera used in the current study.
