<p>Kunjin shares a number of epidemiological characteristics with MVEV, including reservoir hosts (wading birds, particularly the rufous night heron; 
 <italic>Nycticorax caledonicus</italic>) and mosquito vector species (particularly the common banded mosquito; 
 <italic>Culex annulirostris</italic>) (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Prow, 2013</xref>). However, in this study, antibodies against KUNV were more prevalent than those against MVEV among, predominantly, urban dwelling blood donors. This is in contrast to the observations of 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Doherty et al. (1959)</xref> in Far North Queensland, where approximately 50% of the residents of one aboriginal community had antibodies to MVEV but only 8% possessed anti-KUNV antibodies. Lower rates of infection with MVEV compared to those reported by 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Doherty et al. (1959)</xref> may reflect the transitory presence of the putative hosts of MVEV in nature, migratory water birds (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kingsford and Thomas, 1995</xref>). It may also reflect greater transmission of MVEV at the more northern latitude of Doherty’s study than that which occurs elsewhere in the state of Queensland, from where the samples for this study were acquired. The most northerly part of Queensland from which samples were collected for this study was Cairns, which is 500 km south of Doherty’s study site. In Western Australia also, MVEV transmission is more common in the northernmost Kimberley region than in the more southern central Pilbara region, where KUNV is most prevalent (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Prow, 2013</xref>). Moreover, both annual and longer-term alterations in rainfall and climate patterns in the 60 years since the publication of Doherty’s data may have altered the transmission rates of KUNV and MVEV in Queensland (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Prow, 2013</xref>). Further investigation is required to substantiate our finding of a potential emergence of KUNV in north-east Australia. The number of sera containing anti-ALFV antibodies were too small to detect an increase in the prevalence of anti-ALFV antibodies with increasing age of the blood donors, even if it was occurring, suggesting that ALFV infections may occur sporadically rather than on a regular basis.
