<p>For almost a decade after the identification of RRV (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Doherty et al., 1963</xref>), only small numbers of patients were diagnosed with a clinical infection with this agent because diagnostic testing was available only in a research setting and using an in-house methodology. Following the development and commercial release of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect anti-RRV immunoglobulin IgM (

A similar but smaller increase in the number of cases of BFV disease was observed when a commercial diagnostic assay for that infection became available (

Clinical infections with the viruses Edge Hill (EHV), Kokobera (KOKV), KUNV, and MVEV can be confirmed in some reference laboratories but only tests for suspected KUNV and MVEV are performed in these specialised facilities on a routine basis (
