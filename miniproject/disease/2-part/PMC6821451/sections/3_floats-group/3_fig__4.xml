  <title>IFN-β induction by inhibition of NS1</title>
  <p>(A) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding the NF-κB luciferase reporter construct, Renilla luciferase, NS1, and increasing amounts (0, 100, 200, and 400 ng) of aptamers. The value was calculated as the ratio between the NF-κB luciferase and the Renilla luciferase, corrected by naive and represented as a ratio at the y-axis. (B) HEK293T cells were transfected with NS1 and increasing amounts (0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 ng) of aptamers. Total mRNA was isolated, and the production of IFN-β mRNA was quantitated by real-time PCR. The measured 
   <italic>C</italic>t value by real-time PCR was converted to the amount of IFN-β relative to β-actin by the delta-delta 
   <italic>C</italic>t model equation, which is expressed on the y-axis as a ratio to the naïve. The data represents average values after 3 independent experiments. Naïve, HEK293T cells only; MOCK, cells transfected with only NS1. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. *
