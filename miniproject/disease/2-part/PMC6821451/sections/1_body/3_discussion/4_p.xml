<p>In the present study, we showed that the recovery of TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination is sufficient to induce IFN. Although it is not certain that the selected aptamers can inhibit the interaction of NS1 with dsRNA or protein partners of the host other than TRIM25 at present, we think that the binding of aptamers may cause a conformational change of NS1 and destroy the binding ability with binding partners, which will be the topic of our future study. Here, we simply focused on NS1-TRIM25 interaction and RIG-I ubiquitination. By selection of ssRNA aptamers specific to NS1, TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination was recovered, and subsequent IFN induction and inhibition of viral replication were observed. Therefore, based on our results, we expect that more elaborated aptamer-based therapeutic agent will be developed through further studies.</p>
