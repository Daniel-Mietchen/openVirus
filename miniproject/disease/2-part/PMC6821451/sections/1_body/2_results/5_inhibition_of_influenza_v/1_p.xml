<p>To determine whether the selected aptamers inhibit the viral replication, Raw264.7 cells harboring GFP were treated with the aptamers prior to viral infection, followed by measurement of fluorescence. 
 <xref rid="f5-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows that the selected aptamers can suppress the viral replication dramatically even in the presence of 100 ng of aptamers (approximately less than half of fluorescence unit compared to 0 ng treated). When we added 200 ng of aptamers, the fluorescence level already reached to level of a positive control (IFN-β). The GFP relative unit decreased in a hyperbolic manner with increasing amount of aptamers providing a 50% inhibitory concentration of 48.20 ± 6.47 ng/ml (R-1, equivalent to 1.66 ± 0.22 nM) and 55.07 ± 4.36 ng/ml (R-2, equivalent to 1.90 ± 0.15 nM), respectively. However, we were not able to detect any cytotoxicity regardless of the amount of aptamer used (data not shown).
