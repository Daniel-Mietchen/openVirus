<p>In order to ensure that the selected aptamers can inhibit the interaction between TRIM25 and NS1, the pull-down assays were performed. The MBP-TRIM25 coated amylose beads were incubated with NS1 in the absence or presence of aptamers, and analyzed by western blot (
 <xref rid="f2-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Lane 2 shows that TRIM25 interacts with NS1 in the absence of aptamer. However, the interaction between TRIM25 and NS1 was suppressed in the presence of aptamers (lanes 3–6). Whereas we were not able to detect any band intensity in the presence of 2 μg R-1 aptamer (lane 3), band intensities decreased as the amount of R-2 aptamer increased (lanes 5 and 6). RNA library was used instead of aptamer as a negative control (lanes 7 and 8). It indicates that the selected aptamers inhibit the interaction of TRIM25 with NS1 in a dose-dependent manner.
