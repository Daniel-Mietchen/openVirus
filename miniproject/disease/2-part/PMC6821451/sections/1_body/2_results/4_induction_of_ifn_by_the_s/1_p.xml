<p>Because TRIM25 mediated RIG-I ubiquitination was observed by suppressing the NS1, we performed cell based NF-κB luciferase reporter assay to determine whether the selected aptamers promote the induction of IFN. 
 <xref rid="f4-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows that NF-κB transcriptional activity was increased as the amount of the aptamers increased. HEK293T cells transfected with an NS1 vector (MOCK) showed about 60% decrease of luciferase activity compared to positive control (Naïve). However, dose-dependent increase of luciferase activity was observed after addition of the selected aptamers. Additional quantitative RT-PCR experiment showed that the induction of IFN was recovered by the selected aptamers. After HEK293T cells were transfected with an NS1 vector, various amounts of the selected aptamers were added and the total RNA was extracted. Then, qPCR was performed to quantify the cDNA using IFN-β and β-actin-specific primers. The result showed that mRNA expression level increased as the amount of the selected aptamers increased (
 <xref rid="f4-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), similar to the result of luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the selected RNA aptamers binds to NS1, and recovery of RIG-I ubiquitination by TRIM25 induces IFN production.
