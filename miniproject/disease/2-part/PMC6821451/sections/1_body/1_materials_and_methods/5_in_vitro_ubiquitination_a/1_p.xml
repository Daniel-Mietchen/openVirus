<p>Ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (
 <xref rid="b11-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Gack et al., 2007</xref>), with slight modifications. His-RIG-I was prepared as described in 
 <xref rid="s1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Materials</xref>. The 2 μg His-RIG-I, 2 μg polyI:C, 2 μg MBP-TRIM25, 2 μg GST-NS1 and 2 μg aptamer in 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl [pH 7.5], 2 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 4 mM ATP) were mixed with 5 μg ubiquitin (Boston Biochem, USA), 0.16 μg human recombinant E1 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 2 μg human recombinant UbcH5a (Pierce Biotechnology). The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 32°C, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-RIG-I antibody, anti-ubiquitin antibody, anti-MBP antibody, and anti-GST antibody, respectively.
