<p>To measure the viral replication inhibition by NS1 aptamer, various amounts of aptamers (0, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 ng in 1 ml culture media) were added to Raw264.7 cells and incubated for 6 h prior to infection of influenza virus containing PR8â€“green fluorescent protein (GFP) as described previously (
 <xref rid="b23-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2013</xref>). After 12 h, the GFP expression was observed using fluorescence microscope and the measured GFP relative units were fit to a hyperbolic decay equation.
