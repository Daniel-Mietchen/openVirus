<p>The RNA library was generated by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using 109 bp DNA library containing two primer regions and 40 random nucleotides as described previously (
 <xref rid="b14-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 2008</xref>). Recombinant GST-tagged NS1 was expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified as described previously (
 <xref rid="b23-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2013</xref>). For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> selection, 5 μg of the RNA library was incubated with 100 μl Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, USA) in 100 μl binding buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 2 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] and 1% [w/v] bovine serum albumin [BSA]). The nonspecific RNAs bound to bead were precipitated and discarded. Unbound RNAs were reacted with the 2 μg GST-NS1 for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with 100 μl Glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 30 min. NS1 complexed with RNA was dissociated from the Glutathione-Sepharose 4B by elution buffer (binding buffer + 10 mM glutathione). RNAs bound to NS1 was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and purified by ethanol precipitation. cDNA was synthesized from recovered RNAs by reverse-transcription and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Total 15 rounds of selection were performed and the resulting DNA was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA). After transformation into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, plasmid DNA was obtained from individual clones and sequenced. The secondary structures of selected RNA aptamers were predicted using the Mfold program as described previously (
