<p>For a luciferase reporter gene assay, 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> HEK293T cells were plated in a tissue culture dish (10 cm diameter) and then incubated for 24 h, after which they were transfected with 7.5 μg of p4xκB and 2.5 μg of pGL using Fugene HD (Roche, Germany) as described previously (
 <xref rid="b23-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2013</xref>) with slight modification. After 24 h incubation, cells were detached, plated in a 24-well plate (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>), and then further incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA6-AIV NS1 and the indicated amount of aptamers using lipofectamine
 <sup>TM</sup> 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). After 6 h incubation, NF-κB was induced by substituting the medium with DMEM containing 1% polyI:C. After 48 h, cells were lysed and the cell lysates were used to measure luciferase activities by Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). The luminescences of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase were measured using VICTOR X3 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer, USA), and the firefly luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase.
