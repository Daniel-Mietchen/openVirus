IF imaging to validate markers of apoptosis in A549 cells. Figure S2. Alphavirus RRV induces early and massive apoptosis compared to Zika virus. Figure S3. ZIKV-PF13 does not cause significant activation of apoptosis until late in infection in U251MG cells. Figure S4. ZIKV-MR766 does not cause significant activation of apoptosis until late in infection and ZIKV-MR766 is able to control cell death. Figure S5. A549 cells transiently expressing a ZIKV-MR766 replicon are protected against cell death by apoptosis.
