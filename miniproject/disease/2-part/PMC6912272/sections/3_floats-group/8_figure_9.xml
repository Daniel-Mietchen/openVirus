 <caption>
  <p>Model depicting the protective action of ZIKV infection against apoptosis. Intrinsic or extrinsic activation of cell death occurs through the formation of mitochondrial outer membrane pore (MOMP) via the BAX/BAK complex. The anti-apoptotic family Bcl-2 members Bcl-2/Bcl-XL interfere with the complex formation by sequestering BAX via their BH3 domain. ZIKV replication interferes with BAX relocalization at the mitochondria. ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic, which inhibits Bcl-2/Bcl-XL, abrogates the inhibition induced by ZIKV. Indeed, the virus delays apoptosis during infection by modulating the homeostasis of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL.</p>
