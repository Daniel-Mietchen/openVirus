   <sup>MC</sup> provides a protection against extrinsically induced cell death. A549 cells were infected with BR15
   <sup>MC</sup> at MOI of 1 for 8 h and treated with TNFα and cycloheximide (TNFα/CHX) 2 h post infection (2 hpi) or 2 h before infection (2 hbi). (
   <bold>A</bold>) The percentage of A549 cells immunolabeled with anti-BAX antibody was enumerated from images representative of immunofluorescence observations (panels on the right, white scale bar: 10µm). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Caspase 3/7 activity was measured after TNFα/CHX treatment 2 hpi and normalized to mock treated and infected cells. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Immunoblot of active caspase 3 during TNFα treatment 2 hpi and infection time course with BR15
   <sup>MC</sup>. Active caspase 3 band intensity was normalized with GAPDH. Western blotting (WB) is representative of three independent experiments. Values represent the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test with post-hoc Tukey’s test (**
