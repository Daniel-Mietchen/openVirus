<p>The production of HEK 293T expressing a stable ZIKV RNA replicon with GFP as a reporter protein, named Rep ZIKV-GFP in the study, was based on the sequence of ZIKV strain MR766 Uganda 47-NIID (Genbank access # LC002520) and the ISA (infectious subgenomic amplicons) method as described previously [
 <xref rid="B25-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As a negative control, HEK 293T cells were transfected with pSilencer-puro 2.6 (Ambion, Thermofisher, Les Ulis, France) and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Ozyme, Saint-Cyr-l’École, France) plasmids with a ratio of 1 to 10 using lipofectamine 3000 according to supplier’s instructions (Thermofisher, Les Ulis, France) and selected for 5 days in puromycin at 1 µg.mL
