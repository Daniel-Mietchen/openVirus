<p>Viral titers were determined by a standard plaque-forming assay as previously described with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, Vero cells grown in 48-well culture plates were infected with tenfold dilutions of virus samples for 2 h at 37 °C and then incubated with 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) for 4 days. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol. Viral titers were expressed as plaque-forming units per mL (PFU.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>).
