<p>The long delay in the onset of viral apoptosis induced by ZIKV infection, particularly in the case of Asian viral strains responsible for current epidemics, and the demonstration that, when the viral RNA is present and replicating there is an inhibition of apoptotic induction, suggest that cells have acquired with the virus a status in which anti-apoptotic activity prevails. The protective effect acquired with ZIKV could be at the level of convergence of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. As we followed BAX relocalization we could argue in favor of protection around the mitochondria events and the control of the outer membrane permeabilization (OMP). A prominent anti-apoptotic factor involved in the regulation of early apoptosis, by operating mainly at the mitochondrial level for the control of its permeabilization is Bcl-2 and the related Bcl-XL protein [

ABT-737 is a BH3 mimetic molecule that can bind to the hydrophobic groove of the members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and therefore inhibits their activity by shifting oligomerization mechanisms in favor of BAX/BAK dimerization [
