<p>Our research team had previously demonstrated that a South Pacific epidemic clinical isolate of ZIKV (PF13-25013-18) was able to infect A549 epithelial cells. These cells are particularly permissive to the virus and therefore constitute a suitable model for studying in cellulo host-virus interactions [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In order to characterize the cellular death profile that accompanies ZIKV infection more precisely, we conducted a study of the cytopathic effects induced with the viral molecular clone of the epidemic strain from Asian lineage, BeH819015 isolated in Brazil in 2015 (BR15
 <sup>MC</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B21-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We infected A549 cells with BR15
 <sup>MC</sup> at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and followed for 3 days, the characteristics of the viro-induced cell death (
