<p>The measurement of LDH activity in infected cell culture supernatants, which results from a loss of cell integrity mainly reflecting secondary necrosis or estimation of cell viability by measurement of mitochondrial activity by MTT assay, revealed that cell mortality was detected at 48 h post infection (hpi) to reach a high level 72 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B). At 24 hpi there was no detectable sign of cell death by apoptosis when we looked at the activity or presence of cleaved caspase 3 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). Relocalization of the pro-apoptotic factor BAX to mitochondria, an early marker of apoptosis (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-01338">Supplemental Figure S1A</xref>), was only observed at 48 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B) and only occurred in approximately 10% of the cells that were immunolabeled with an antibody directed against the viral envelope protein E (ZIKV-E; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Examination of another signal of engagement in apoptosis, namely the presence of cytosolic cytochrome-c (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, magnified image with (b) arrow on the cyt-c immunodetection panel), led to the same observation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). It should be noted that only some of the cells immunolabeled for ZIKV-E had apoptotic characteristics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The percentage of uninfected cells with signs of death by apoptosis was always equivalent to that observed in the controlled cell cultures over time (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-01338">Figure S1B</xref>). Analysis of apoptosis execution, such as the measurement of caspase 3/7 activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f001">Figure 1</xref>C), immuno-detection in infected cells of cleaved activated caspase 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,D) or by Western blotting (WB; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f003">Figure 3</xref>C) supported the delay in cell death with respect to the course of viral multiplication. Moreover, significant signs of engagement in apoptosis occurred when the released viral progeny have already reached their maximum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-01338-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). A late and low proportion of ZIKV-infected cells engaged in apoptosis were also retrieved during the infection of Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-01338">Figure S2</xref>). This apoptosis kinetics differed significantly from the one induced during the Ross River alphavirus (RRV) infection. Thus during RRV infection the maximum of caspase 3 activity was observed at 24 hpi and was at least 10 fold higher than the one measured in ZIKV-infected cells. These observations suggest a ZIKV-infection specific feature of the viro-induced apoptosis, together with a regulatory mechanism implemented by the ZIKV to delay apoptosis.
