<p>To drive an extrinsic apoptosis, we induced the TNF-receptor using its ligand, TNF-alpha (TNFα), inhibiting the cytoprotective NFkb response by the addition of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Between 6 and 8 h of treatment leads to an estimated 20% cell mortality in A549 cells, when counting BAX positive cells (
