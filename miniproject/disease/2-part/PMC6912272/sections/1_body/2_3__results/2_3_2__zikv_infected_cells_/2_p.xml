<p>The late onset of apoptosis in infected cells led us to postulate that ZIKV may modulate the apoptotic response of the cell, delaying it through transient inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether ZIKV could counteract the effect of death inducers added during the infection time course. We induced apoptosis through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and tested the addition of the inducer at 2 h prior-to and 2 h post infection (
