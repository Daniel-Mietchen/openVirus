<p>We also tested the effect of the cell line used for infection by repeating the procedure in Vero cells, in this instance using blasticidin to induce intrinsic apoptosis in response to the inhibition of translation instead of DNA damage with etoposide. Following cell death by MTT assay and caspase 3/7 activity again suggested that ZIKV infection represses apoptosis, regardless of cell type and death inducers (
