<p>To address a protective effect of the viral replication in a system consistent with the one in which the effect was revealed through infection, we adapted the ISA method to obtain A549 cells transiently expressing a ZIKV replicon with the non-structural sequences from BeH819015 (REP BR15). We used A549 cells transfected with an incomplete set of amplicons as a negative control (REP-NEG;
