<p>As with many other viruses, interactions between ZIKV and its host trigger a variety of host responses in the bodyâ€™s attempt to resolve the infection [
 <xref rid="B9-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among these responses, apoptosis plays an important role as a host defense mechanism [
 <xref rid="B10-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Apoptosis can quickly remove intracellular niches of viral replication and thus bypass the virus as it multiplies and spreads. As a result, many viruses have developed strategies to evade, delay or divert the cell death responses, often to their advantage [
 <xref rid="B11-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One example is the case of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arbovirus of the alphavirus family, which takes advantage of massive apoptosis to hide in disseminating blebs and thus optimizes its spread [
 <xref rid="B12-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Typically, alphaviruses such as CHIKV (but also Sindbis virus, Ross River virus and Semliki Virus) replicate extremely quickly and the infected cells are characterized by rapid and concomitant apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B13-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Unlike alphaviruses, flaviviruses replication is relatively slow. For several of them such as DENV, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and WNV, apoptosis has been shown to be inhibited during the early stages of the viral cycle [
 <xref rid="B14-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The role of viral proteins in the control of apoptosis has been extensively studied, with many observations in support of both pro-apoptotic activity and antiapoptotic effects. For WNV, a nuclear localization of the capsid was shown to induce a caspase-9-dependent apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B15-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Whereas the WNV capsid protein was shown to suppress the activation of caspases 3 and 8 via Akt through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent mechanism (PI3K) [
 <xref rid="B16-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Concerning ZIKV, in cellulo models have shown that infection can lead to cytopathic effects that are typical of apoptosis, and in previous work we observed late-onset apoptosis 48 h after infection of A549 cells with ZIKV isolate PF13 [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In some other cell types (human fetal astrocytes), moderate apoptosis can occur even later and possibly contribute to persistent infection [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-08-01338" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the particular case of Zika pathology, homeostasis disorder; involving a lack of apoptosis control, a persistent inflammatory response and even viral persistence in the brain has been reported to explain the microcephaly observed in infected newborns [
