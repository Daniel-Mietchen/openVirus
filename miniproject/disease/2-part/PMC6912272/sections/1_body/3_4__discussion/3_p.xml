<p>In a rather unexpected way, our work mainly shows that in the early stages of infection, ZIKV infection provides a solid protection against an exogenous induced cell death. We provided supporting evidence that protection is acquired both with the Asian epidemic strains and with the African strain (

This protection is effective against apoptosis mediated by an extrinsic death inducer (TNFÎ±) as well as by an intrinsic signal (provided by the action of etoposide or blasticidin). Resistance to these induction modes has also been found to characterize cells expressing replicons, either HEK 293 cells stably expressing a MR766 replicon or A549 cells transiently expressing BR15 replicons or MR766 replicons (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-01338">Figure S5</xref>). The data obtained with the use of these replicons are in support of a greater protection granted by BR15. This is consistent with the data obtained with the whole virus that is responsible for the longest delay in apoptosis entry. Cell death inhibition ability acquired with the ZIKV replicons would imply that the single presence of a viral RNA leading to the production of the NS proteins and allowing its self-replication is the driving force behind the protection acquired against apoptosis.
