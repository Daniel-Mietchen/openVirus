<p>All 21 of the influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses analyzed belonged to clade Y3. All seven B/Yamagata lineage viruses antigenically characterized were similar to the cell culture–propagated 2019–20 Northern Hemisphere vaccine virus component. Multiple genetically and antigenically distinct B/Victoria lineage viruses cocirculated. Viruses with a two-amino acid deletion (162–163) in the HA protein belonged to subclade V1A.1, and viruses with a three-amino acid deletion (162–164) in the HA protein belonged to subclade V1A-3Del. Among the 156 influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses analyzed, the HA gene belonged to clade V1A (six viruses; 4%), subclade V1A.1 (37; 24%), or subclade V1A-3Del (113; 72%). Among the 53 B/Victoria lineage viruses antigenically characterized, the V1A.1 viruses were similar to the cell culture–propagated 2019–20 Northern Hemisphere vaccine component. Ferret antisera raised to recent V1A.1 viruses, however, had reduced reactivity with many viruses expressing V1A and V1A-3Del HA proteins indicating some antigenic differences between viruses in the different B/Victoria lineage subclades. Nevertheless, sera from humans vaccinated with a V1A.1 virus cross reacted well with V1A-3Del viruses.</p>
