Dendritic cells (DCs) release interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines and promote adaptive immunity upon viral infection. In order to characterize the strain-specific effects of IAV NS1 on human DC activation, we infected human DCs with a panel of recombinant viruses with the same backbone (A/Puerto Rico/08/1934) expressing different NS1 proteins from human and avian origin. We found that these viruses induced a clearly distinct phenotype in DCs. Specifically, viruses expressing NS1 from human IAV (either H1N1 or H3N2) induced higher levels of expression of type I (IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2;) and type III (IFN-&#x003bb;1 to IFN&#x003bb;3) IFNs than viruses expressing avian IAV NS1 proteins (H5N1, H7N9, and H7N2), but the differences observed in the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) were not significant. In addition, using imaging flow cytometry, we found that human and avian NS1 proteins segregate based on their subcellular trafficking dynamics, which might be associated with the different innate immune profile induced in DCs by viruses expressing those NS1 proteins. Innate immune responses induced by our panel of IAV recombinant viruses were also characterized in normal human bronchial epithelial cells, and the results were consistent with those in DCs. Altogether, our results reveal an increased ability of NS1 from avian viruses to antagonize innate immune responses in human primary cells compared to the ability of NS1 from human viruses, which could contribute to the severe disease induced by avian IAV in humans.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause seasonal epidemics which result in an important health and economic burden.

The activation of the innate immune response, especially interferon (IFN) responses, is an important mechanism for controlling virus replication and represents an early barrier against viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV). Mammalian cells have developed sophisticated antiviral mechanisms based on sensing viral products and triggering of signaling cascades leading to secretion of type I IFN (IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2;), type III IFN (IFN-&#x003bb;s), and proinflammatory cytokines that inhibit viral replication and contribute to the initiation of more specific adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Specifically, IAV double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is recognized by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), and IAV single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is recognized by TLR7, two endosome membrane-associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Viral RNA products are recognized by cytosolic receptors such as the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Sensing results in the activation of transcription factors, such as IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B), that are responsible for the initiation of the transcription of type I/III IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). After secretion, IFNs act in a paracrine and/or autocrine way to induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which have antiviral activity.</p><p>Viruses need to evade innate immunity in order to successfully replicate, establish infection, and ultimately be transmitted to other hosts. The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV is a multifunctional protein able to antagonize host immune responses. It is highly expressed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of infected cells and interacts with many cellular and viral proteins counteracting cellular defenses, especially the IFN responses of the host (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). NS1 has two distinct functional domains: an N-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD) (residues 1 to 73) and a C-terminal effector domain (ED) (from residue 85 to the end), separated by a short linker region. The last amino acids (from residue 207 to the end) form a disordered and flexible tail, which is one of the most variable regions among different NS1 proteins (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Different mechanisms have been reported by which the influenza NS1 protein counteracts the innate immune responses (reviewed in references <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Briefly, NS1 can interact with different components of the RIG-I/IFN signaling pathway to efficiently inhibit IFN expression (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) either by direct binding of NS1 to RIG-I (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or by interaction with the E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25). In addition to that, NS1 can also interact with Riplet, preventing ubiquitination and activation of RIG-I (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). NS1 was also shown to inhibit IRF3 and NF-&#x003ba;B activation, which is necessary for the production of IFNs in infected cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The antiviral properties of protein kinase R (PKR) and 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-oligo(A) synthetase (OAS)-RNase L are also inhibited by NS1 as a result of the direct interaction with dsRNAs (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and, in the case of PKR, also in a dsRNA binding-independent manner (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition, NS1 proteins from some IAV strains can suppress the expression of cellular genes by blocking the maturation of cellular pre-mRNA through the interaction with the 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and with the poly(A)-binding protein II (PABPII) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Also, NS1 blocks the export of cellular mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), leading to a general inhibition of expression of the host&#x02019;s genes, including IFN genes, ISGs, and proinflammatory genes. In addition to counteracting the innate immune response, NS1 can also target some factors (eIF4GI, PABPI, and human Staufen [hStaufen]) to enhance viral mRNA translation in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and NS1 is also believed to be involved in regulation of the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by binding p85&#x003b2; subunit (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and limiting the apoptosis of the cell (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, since some functions are carried out in the nucleus and some in the cytoplasm, the localization of NS1 is highly regulated through two nuclear localization signals (NLS) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and one nuclear export signal (NES) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Importantly, most of these NS1 functions are not conserved among different strains (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), are crucial for the innate immune response against viruses and other pathogens. DCs express high levels of PRRs, which allows them to efficiently sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon sensing, DCs get activated and efficiently produce proinflammatory cytokines, IFNs, and chemokines, inducing an antiviral response in neighboring cells. Also, since they are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), they can process the antigens and present them by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to the T cells, inducing the initiation of long-term adaptive immunity. We have previously shown that the NS1 protein from IAV counteracts the production of type I IFN and the activation of human DCs (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Due to the intrinsic variability of the NS1 proteins among different strains, we hypothesized that the modulation of the innate immune responses in DCs by NS1 during IAV infection is strain specific. Using recombinant IAVs expressing NS1 proteins of different origins (human or avian IAV) in an isogenic backbone, we found that infection with viruses expressing NS1 from a human or avian IAV results in different patterns of innate immune responses and expression of viral mRNA in DCs and in human primary epithelial cells. Furthermore, imaging flow cytometry experiments suggest that these differences could be associated with differential cellular localization dynamics of the NS1 proteins from different hosts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Characterization of recombinant A/Puerto Rico/08/34 influenza viruses expressing different NS1 proteins.</title><p>To assess the impact of the expression of the NS1 from different strains on the innate immune responses induced by IAV in human DCs, we used a panel of recombinant viruses expressing different NS1 proteins in the same backbone (A/Puerto Rico/08/34, or PR8) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Recombinant viruses were engineered to express the NS1 and nuclear export protein (NEP) from two different, nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) to ensure that there were no changes in NEP (see the Materials and Methods section). The criteria for the selection of the NS1 proteins were the following: (i) host (human or avian), (ii) subtype of IAV (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, or H7N2), (iii) ability to interact with CPSF30, therefore inhibiting mRNA maturation of host RNA, and (iv) allele A or B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To ensure the appropriate representation of the diversity of NS1 proteins from different subtypes and species in this panel, we performed a phylogenetic analysis including a total of 58 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>; selected NS1 proteins are highlighted in red).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 1</label><caption><p>Generation and selection of PR8 recombinant viruses expressing different NS1 proteins.

At 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with a DI-rich SeV preparation for 16 h. Relative FF-Luc activity was normalized to the level of the empty vector plus SeV (set to 100%).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JVI.00999-19-f0001"/></fig><p>Next, we evaluated the replication kinetics of our NS1 recombinant viruses in susceptible human A549 lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). First, we found similar replication levels between wild-type PR8 (PR8-WT) and PR8 with the NS1 segment modified (PR8-Split), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, and when we compared the eight recombinant PR8 viruses expressing NS1 proteins from other selected viruses (PR8-NS1) in A549 cells, we also found very similar profiles of replication in A549 cells among them. These results suggest that viruses expressing the different NS1 proteins replicate efficiently in this human epithelial cell line.</p><p>Then, we analyzed the ability of these NS1 proteins to suppress the induction of IFNs in human cells. Human 293T cells were cotransfected with an IFN-&#x003b2; promoter-dependent firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) reporter construct and a constitutively active <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Ren-Luc) expression plasmid, together with plasmids expressing the NS1 proteins of interest (or an empty vector as a control). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, after infection with a defective interfering (DI) genome-rich Sendai virus (SeV) preparation, human 293T cells induced robust amounts of IFN-&#x003b2; promoter-driven FF-Luc activity when we transfected an empty vector or upon expression of a double mutant of NS1 from PR8 (PR8 R38A K41A) that was previously found to abrogate the RNA binding activity (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In contrast, IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activity in 293T cells expressing our selected NS1 proteins was strongly repressed, confirming that all the selected NS1 proteins are functional as they are able to efficiently inhibit the induction of type I IFNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Impact of different IAV NS1 proteins on the innate immune response in primary human DCs.</title><p>We along with others have previously shown that IAV can infect human DCs and that the NS1 can counteract the innate immune response in those cells (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). As mentioned above, not all NS1 proteins have the same functions present. Therefore, we hypothesized that infection with IAV expressing NS1 proteins from different strains might result in distinct innate immune profiles in human DCs.

Therefore, to study whether the differences in the induction of the IFN response are explained by differences in levels of intracellular replication, we measured the levels of nucleoprotein (NP) viral RNA (vRNA) by qRT-PCR specifically for the negative RNA strand of the segment in DCs after infection with our panel of recombinant viruses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, no significant differences were found at 6 hpi among the different viruses. At 12 hpi, A/Udorn/1972 showed statistically significant higher levels of replication than the rest of the viruses. Despite the fact that the differences among the remaining seven viruses are not statistically significant, viruses with hNS1 tended to show slightly higher levels of intracellular replication than viruses with aNS1. For a better understanding of the relationship between intracellular viral replication and IFN induction, we performed a correlation analysis of these variables. A low level of correlation was observed globally between vRNA levels and IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, or IFN-&#x003bb;1, as indicated by the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) (none of the <italic>P</italic> values indicated a significant association).

We also analyzed the expression of hemagglutinin (HA) and NEP mRNAs in cells infected by the different viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). In this case, a similar trend to the one we observed for M1 was found although differences across viruses were not significant in most cases. Surprisingly, A/Udorn/1972 did not show higher expression of M1, HA, or NEP in infected cells than the rest of the viruses, as observed for NP mRNA. In addition, we also analyzed the expression of NS1 protein by Western blotting to confirm that this protein is expressed during infection in DCs by all of the viruses tested. We found slight differences in NS1 expression levels across the samples infected with our NS1 recombinant viruses as measured by Western blotting. However, we did not find a different pattern between cells infected with viruses expressing hNS1 and those expressing aNS1 proteins. Since the sequences of all of the NS1 proteins are notably different (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>), the variations in the expression levels that we observed could be due to differences in the levels of stability of the protein itself or to differences in affinity to the NS1 antibody (polyclonal antibody 1-73 [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]).

Importantly, it is known that type III IFNs play an essential role in the innate immune defense in epithelial cells during IAV infection (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). IFNs are secreted molecules that interact with specific cellular receptors inducing the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several of these ISGs have antiviral and immune-modulatory properties and therefore have an important impact on the control of the spread of IAV in the respiratory epithelium. Consequently, we measured the expression of several ISGs by qRT-PCR. We found that the expression levels of IRF-7, IFIT1, IFIT2, and RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) showed statistically significant differences after infection with hNS1-expressing recombinant viruses or aNS1-expressing recombinant viruses at certain time points.

We confirmed the differences observed in IFN production after infection with aNS1- and hNS1-expressing IAVs by multiplex ELISA at 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).

Specifically, we considered residues (i) that are conserved in at least three of the four NS1 proteins within each group and (ii) that were different between the two groups. We observed that in the C-terminal region there were few positions (positions 196, 198, 207, 209, and 215) with striking differences between aNS1 and hNS1, which could affect the nuclear localization sequence NLS2. Because NS1 exerts multiple functions in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, the cellular localization of this protein could have important consequences during infection. Previous studies have shown that NS1 is early localized predominantly in the nucleus and that it is translocated into the cytoplasm at late stages of infection. These intracellular localization patterns vary depending on virus strain, expression levels of NS1, cell type, cell polarity, and time postinfection (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Therefore, we next hypothesized that hNS1 and aNS1 could have different nuclear localization dynamics, which could be associated with the differential innate immune responses induced during infection. To address this, we analyzed the localization dynamics of NS1 for our eight different NS1-expressing recombinant viruses during infection in DCs using imaging flow cytometry (ImageStream Mark II; Amnis). Cells were infected during 6, 9, and 12 h, fixed, and stained for NS1 and M1/M2 proteins and with DRAQ5 for nuclear staining. Infected cells were selected for subsequent analysis by gating in M1/M2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>). Then, a nuclear localization score for NS1 was calculated based on the colocalization of NS1 expression and nuclear signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). Based on this score, we determined the percentage of cells with a predominantly nuclear signal (highly nuclear) and the percentage of cells with a predominantly cytoplasmic signal (highly cytoplasmic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>) for samples infected with each of the viruses. As expected, we found a decrease in the nuclear localization over time for all of the NS1 proteins. However, the dynamics of this reduction in nuclear localization were clearly different between hNS1 and aNS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9D</xref>). hNS1 localization was readily reduced at 9 h, while the decay in the case of aNS1 was more pronounced from 9 to 12 hpi. When we grouped hNS1 and aNS1 for comparison, we found a significantly higher number of cells with nuclear localization in aNS1 by 9 hpi than in hNS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9E</xref>) as a consequence of their different dynamics. We also evaluated the percentage of cells with higher cytoplasmic localization. Similarly, these data indicated that hNS1 was translocated to the cytoplasm earlier than aNS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9F</xref>), which resulted in a higher number of cells expressing NS1 in the cytoplasm by 9 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9G</xref>).
Consistently, when we compared the rate of export to the cytoplasm during the two different time intervals, we found significantly faster and earlier kinetics for hNS1 from 6 hpi to 9 hpi, while aNS1 showed a faster decrease in the following time period, from 9 to 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9H</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 8</label><caption><p>Multiple sequence alignment of full-length NS1 proteins from IAVs.

As NS1 proteins are highly variable among different strains, we hypothesized that there is a strain-specific effect of NS1 in the modulation of the innate immune responses in human primary cells during IAV infection. Human infections by avian IAV often result in severe disease, characterized by high levels of cytokines and increased immunopathology (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The high virulence of avian IAV in humans involves multiple factors, including the NS1 protein (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Interestingly, we found that infection of human DCs and NHBE cells with viruses expressing NS1 from human or avian IAV results in different patterns of innate immune responses. These data suggest that avian influenza viruses might be more efficient at antagonizing innate immune responses in human primary cells since infection with aNS1-bearing viruses induced lower levels of type I and III IFNs than infection with hNS1-bearing viruses, supporting the hypothesis that intrinsic characteristics of the avian NS1 proteins contribute to the increased virulence of avian IAV in humans.</p><p>IFNs are widely expressed cytokines that act as the first line of defense against viral infections and possess the ability to induce an antiviral state in the producing as well as neighboring cells. Even though the signal transduction cascades are similar between type I and type III IFNs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), it has been reported that type III IFNs precede a type I IFN antiviral defense in the respiratory tract in mice (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Our results in infected DCs and NHBE cells also show that the amount of IFN-&#x003bb;1 detected in the supernatant is higher than the amount of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (also observed in mRNA levels), in agreement with the idea that type III IFNs are the first IFNs produced to suppress the initial viral spread without activating systemic inflammation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>In search of possible mechanisms for the differences in the innate immune responses between IAVs bearing hNS1 or aNS1, we analyzed their intracellular replication profiles (measuring vRNA) and expression of viral proteins (measuring mRNA and protein) in infected cells. In general, we found that in infected DCs differential levels of replication or protein expression did not correlate with the innate immune patterns elicited by viruses with human or avian NS1 proteins. This was also the case for NP mRNA expression. However, there was a specific gene, M1, that seemed to be greatly influenced by the host origin of the NS1 protein in infected DCs and NHBE cells. Expression levels of other genes such as HA and NEP were also altered by the host origin of the NS1 protein, but multicycle replication kinetics were similar between viruses bearing hNS1 and aNS1 in infected NHBE cells.</p><p>The alignment of the eight different NS1 proteins used in this study allowed the identification of residues that might be involved in the different innate immune responses. We identified amino acids at the following positions: 21, 22, 59, 70, and 71 in the RNA-binding domain; 95, 112, 114, 118, 127, 196, and 198 in the effector domain; and 207, 209, 212, and 215 in the C terminus or tail. Differences in specific amino acids can have implications during infection. For example, some amino acids can modify the structure of NS1, which could impact the interactions of the NS1 protein with other proteins. In our selected viruses only avian NS1 proteins (with the exception of the allele B) have an R in position 59. It is known that this amino acid is involved together with Q63 of the RNA binding domain and G168 and T170 of the effector domain in the formation of a hydrogen bond that interconnects the two domains, which stabilize the structure (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In addition to these four amino acids, the residue composition at position 71 (that is also different between hNS1 and aNS1) gives a different degree of flexibility/plasticity to the NS1 dimer, a fact that could influence the interactions of NS1 with some other proteins (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>).</p><p>Another major function of NS1 is to block activation of protein kinase R (PKR) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), a critical component of the cellular antiviral system. It has been shown that the inhibition of PKR activation by Udorn NS1 <italic>in vitro</italic> requires a specific amino acid sequence between positions 123 and 127 of the NS1 since mutants with alanine residues at positions 123 and 124 or at positions 126 and 127 fail in this inhibition (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In our selected NS1 proteins, amino acids at residue 127 are different between hNS1 and aNS1, which could potentially result in differences in their abilities to block PKR activation.</p><p>A report by Kuo and collaborators (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) demonstrated that a variation at amino acid position 196 (K or E) of the NS1 protein determines its ability to block the activation of IRF3 and IFN-&#x003b2; transcription. Specifically, the investigators observed that NS1 proteins from H3N2, H2N2, and some H1N1 IAVs do not block the activation of IRF3 or IFN-&#x003b2; transcription and that all contained a K196 residue, whereas the NS1 proteins from H5N1 and some H1N1 viruses, that are able to block these activations, contained E196 instead. Our results concur with this observation since H1N1 (with the exception of A/California/07/2009) and H3N2 viruses bearing hNS1 have K at position 196 and induce higher levels of expression of IFN mRNAs during DC infection than H5N1, H7N2, and H7N9 aNS1-bearing viruses, which have an E at position 196 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, NS1 can be regulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, SUMOylation, or ISGylation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We found that residue K70 is present in human NS1 proteins and that it can be SUMOylated (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), in contrast to avian NS1 proteins, which present E in the same position. Interestingly, alterations in NS1 SUMOylation have been shown to affect the ability of NS1 to inhibit the IFN response (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>); therefore, this amino acid difference could also contribute to the phenotype observed in DCs upon infection with aNS1- and hNS1-bearing viruses.</p><p>Since it has been suggested that subcellular trafficking of NS1 is a determinant of host adaptation (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), we also evaluated the cellular localization dynamics for these different NS1 proteins in human DCs during the infection. We found that viruses bearing hNS1 have different localization kinetics from viruses with aNS1. Specifically, hNS1 exits from the nucleus at a higher rate than aNS1. Multiple NS1 functions occur in the nucleus and cytoplasm during influenza infection (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>); therefore, its intracellular localization dynamics need to be highly regulated (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Given these results, we propose that there is an association between the differential immune phenotype observed in human DCs, the intracellular localization dynamics of NS1, and the expression of M1. Previous studies have reported that NS1 can bind M1 mRNA and regulate M1 mRNA splicing (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) and also that this process occurs through nuclear speckles (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p><p>NS1 proteins contain two nuclear localization signals (NLS), NLS1 and NLS2, and one nuclear export signal (NES) to regulate their nuclear trafficking of IAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). Despite the variability of the NS1 protein sequences, NLS1 is very conserved across different strains and is located in the RNA binding domain involving amino acids 34 to 38 (DRLRR) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). On the other hand, NLS2 is a very variable region located in the C-terminal domain of the protein. NLS2 was initially mapped between amino acids 203 and 237 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), with a putative nuclear localization motif between residues 216 and 221 (P-X-Q-K-R-K/E) (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). It has been proposed that NLS interacts with the cellular protein importin &#x003b1; (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) and induces rapid nuclear localization after its translation (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Also, it is thought that other amino acids less proximal to the C terminus might also be involved in the NLS2 signature (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>) since altering the NLS2 sequence for several human strains does not seem to have an effect on NS1 nuclear localization, while for avian viruses the presence of both (in mammalian cells) is required. In addition to that, a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) also has been described for some strains. NoLS is associated with basic amino acids at positions 219, 220, 224, and 229 and also at positions 231 and 232 in NS1 proteins with C-terminal extensions (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). However, the role of the nucleolar localization for NS1 and its contribution to viral replication are unknown. Finally, the NES is a quite conserved region, located in the effector domain, specifically, amino acids F138, L141, L144, and L146 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In addition, a previous study found that the region between amino acids 100 and 120, in which we found a small cluster of different amino acids, might also be involved in nuclear export (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). However, no major sequence differences were observed in NLS1 and NES regions between the NS1 sequences used in our study. In contrast, we found multiple differences between hNS1 and aNS1 in their NLS2 sequences and surrounding domains, which could be associated with their localization phenotypes. Additionally, we cannot exclude the possibility of other currently undescribed amino acids that could be responsible for this phenotype. Specific interactions between cellular and viral factors with NS1 proteins play key roles in determining the intracellular localization of NS1 by masking or unmasking specific subcellular localization signals (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, the different localization dynamics of human and avian NS1 proteins could result from specific interaction partners for hNS1 proteins in the nucleus that unmask the NES and allow faster transport to the cytoplasmic compartment than that of aNS1 proteins. Alternatively, aNS1 proteins may interact with specific proteins in the nucleus that retain them longer in the nucleus than hNS1 proteins. Further studies of the interactions between NS1 proteins and different proteins in the nucleus will help elucidate the mechanism behind the different localization dynamics.</p><p>Altogether, our results showed differential immune profiles in both human DCs and NHBE cells after infection with recombinant IAV viruses expressing the NS1 from avian or human viruses. These different phenotypes are characterized by higher expression of type I and type III IFNs in human DCs and NHBE cells and also by higher expression of ISGs in NHBE cells infected with viruses bearing human NS1 than with viruses bearing avian NS1. Remarkably, this phenotype is not due to differences in intracellular viral replication (DCs) or in viral particle release (NHBE cells). In addition, differences in the expression levels of some viral genes and in the cellular localization dynamics were found between human and avian NS1 proteins during infection in DCs, which might be associated with the immune phenotype of DCs upon infection with these viruses. Multiple amino acid changes are present between NS1 proteins of IAVs from human and avian origin, and some of them have been previously reported to participate in the immune-modulatory capabilities of NS1. Therefore, the phenotypic differences found between viruses expressing these NS1 proteins are likely a result of the combination of multiple factors. Further research will help to improve our understanding on the IAV NS1 functions at a global level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cells.</title><p>Human primary DCs were generated from CD14<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from buffy coats of healthy human donors (New York Blood Center) as described previously (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).

Antibodies were conjugated with a Zenon antibody labeling kit to Alexa Fluor 405 (AF405) and AF488, (Z-25103 and Z-25302, respectively; Thermo Fisher Scientific) before staining. Following staining, single-cell images of each cell were acquired at a magnification of &#x000d7;60 on an ImageStream Mark II flow cytometer (Amnis; EMD Millipore) and analyzed with IDEAS analysis software. Single-color controls were used for the creation of a compensation matrix that was applied to all files to correct for spectral cross talk. The &#x0201c;bright detail similarity&#x0201d; (BDS) feature of IDEAS was then used for measurement of the spatial correlation between the fluorescent signal emanating from Alexa Fluor 488-labeled NS1 and that of the nucleus and to obtain an NS1 nuclear localization score. The BDS score is the log-transformed Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient of the localized bright spots with a radius of three pixels or less within the masked area in the two input images (BDS score = ln[(1 + &#x003c1;)(1 &#x02212; &#x003c1;)]). The higher the BDS score is, the higher is the level of colocalization. BDS scores of &#x0003e;0 were considered highly nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This threshold for the BDS score was obtained by applying the similarity image analysis algorithm first to a negative set (bright-field image).</p></sec><sec id="s4.9"><title>Phylogenetic analysis.</title><p>NS1 protein sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm in MEGA7 (version 7.0.20).
