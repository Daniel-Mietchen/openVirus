  <p>Similar proinflammatory responses induced by recombinant viruses expressing NS1 proteins from human or avian IAVs in primary human DCs. (A) Levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β protein detected in supernatants of infected cells by multiplex ELISA at 12 hpi. (B) Analysis of the expression of mRNA levels for IL-6 and TNF-α at 6 and 12 hpi normalized to the level of RPS11 by qRT-PCR. DCs were infected at an MOI of 1 independently with 8 different recombinant viruses. Data from 7 to 8 different infected donors are shown. Statistical significance was determined using two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. Adjusted 
   <italic>P</italic> values are indicated as follows: ****, &lt;0.0001; ***, &lt;0.001; **, &lt;0.01; *, &lt;0.1.
