<p>Altogether, these data indicate that the host origin of the NS1 protein has a clear impact on the induction of the expression of type I and type III IFNs by infected DCs, where viruses expressing hNS1 induce a stronger global type I and III response than those expressing aNS1. Also, we found that IFN-λ1 was more highly released into the supernatants than IFN-α or IFN-β, highlighting a role for this cytokine in the innate immune response to IAV infections. Slightly stronger proinflammatory responses were found in cells infected by hNS1-bearing strains, indicating some differential effect between hNS1 and aNS1 also in NF-κB-mediated induction of cytokines.</p>
