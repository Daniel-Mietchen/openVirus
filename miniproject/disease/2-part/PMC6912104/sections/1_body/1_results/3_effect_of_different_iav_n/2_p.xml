<p>In order to investigate the effect of the different NS1 proteins on the expression of other viral proteins in DCs, we analyzed the levels of expression of multiple viral genes by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Analysis of the levels of NP mRNA showed similar results across all the viruses, except for A/Udorn/1972, which showed higher levels of vRNA NP expression in infected DCs than the rest of the viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, similar levels of NP protein and PB2 were found in cells infected with all viruses by Western blotting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). In the case of M1 mRNA, we found a different pattern between hNS1- and aNS1-bearing viruses, suggesting that the presence of different NS1 proteins in the cell could affect the expression of this gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). We also analyzed the expression of hemagglutinin (HA) and NEP mRNAs in cells infected by the different viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). In this case, a similar trend to the one we observed for M1 was found although differences across viruses were not significant in most cases. Surprisingly, A/Udorn/1972 did not show higher expression of M1, HA, or NEP in infected cells than the rest of the viruses, as observed for NP mRNA. In addition, we also analyzed the expression of NS1 protein by Western blotting to confirm that this protein is expressed during infection in DCs by all of the viruses tested. We found slight differences in NS1 expression levels across the samples infected with our NS1 recombinant viruses as measured by Western blotting. However, we did not find a different pattern between cells infected with viruses expressing hNS1 and those expressing aNS1 proteins. Since the sequences of all of the NS1 proteins are notably different (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>), the variations in the expression levels that we observed could be due to differences in the levels of stability of the protein itself or to differences in affinity to the NS1 antibody (polyclonal antibody 1-73 [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). In order to make sure that NS1 levels of expression were similar, we have also measured the NS1 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in infected DCs from four different donors by imaging flow cytometry at 6 and 12 h postinfection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Results showed similar MFIs (fold change in expression over mock infection level) for each NS1, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test performed reveled that differences in NS1 expression levels across the different viruses in infected DCs were not statistically significant.
