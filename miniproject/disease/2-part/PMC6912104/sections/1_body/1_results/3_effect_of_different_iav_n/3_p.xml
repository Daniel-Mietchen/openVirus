<p>Overall, we found that the different NS1 proteins expressed by our panel of recombinant viruses had no significant effect on NP vRNA and mRNA expression in infected DCs (except for A/Udorn/1972) or on HA or NEP mRNA or viral protein expression in those infected cells. However, different levels of mRNA for M1 were found between hNS1- and aNS1-expressing viruses, similar to the profile that we identified for the induction of IFN responses.</p>
