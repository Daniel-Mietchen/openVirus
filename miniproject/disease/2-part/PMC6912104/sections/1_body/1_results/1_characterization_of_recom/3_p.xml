<p>Then, we analyzed the ability of these NS1 proteins to suppress the induction of IFNs in human cells. Human 293T cells were cotransfected with an IFN-β promoter-dependent firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) reporter construct and a constitutively active

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, after infection with a defective interfering (DI) genome-rich Sendai virus (SeV) preparation, human 293T cells induced robust amounts of IFN-β promoter-driven FF-Luc activity when we transfected an empty vector or upon expression of a double mutant of NS1 from PR8 (PR8 R38A K41A) that was previously found to abrogate the RNA binding activity (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In contrast, IFN-β promoter activity in 293T cells expressing our selected NS1 proteins was strongly repressed, confirming that all the selected NS1 proteins are functional as they are able to efficiently inhibit the induction of type I IFNs.
