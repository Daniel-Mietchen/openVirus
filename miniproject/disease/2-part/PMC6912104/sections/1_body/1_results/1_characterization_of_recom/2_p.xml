<p>Next, we evaluated the replication kinetics of our NS1 recombinant viruses in susceptible human A549 lung epithelial cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). First, we found similar replication levels between wild-type PR8 (PR8-WT) and PR8 with the NS1 segment modified (PR8-Split), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, and when we compared the eight recombinant PR8 viruses expressing NS1 proteins from other selected viruses (PR8-NS1) in A549 cells, we also found very similar profiles of replication in A549 cells among them. These results suggest that viruses expressing the different NS1 proteins replicate efficiently in this human epithelial cell line.
