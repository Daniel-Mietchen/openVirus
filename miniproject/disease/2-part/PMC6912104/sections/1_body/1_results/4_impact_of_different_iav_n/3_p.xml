<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, NHBE cells infected with recombinant viruses expressing hNS1 showed higher expression levels of type I and III IFNs as measured by qRT-PCR than those bearing aNS1 proteins. However, these differences were statistically significant only for IFN- λ1 and IFN-λ3 at early time points (12 and/or 24 hpi). Importantly, it is known that type III IFNs play an essential role in the innate immune defense in epithelial cells during IAV infection (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). IFNs are secreted molecules that interact with specific cellular receptors inducing the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several of these ISGs have antiviral and immune-modulatory properties and therefore have an important impact on the control of the spread of IAV in the respiratory epithelium. Consequently, we measured the expression of several ISGs by qRT-PCR. We found that the expression levels of IRF-7, IFIT1, IFIT2, and RIG-I (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) showed statistically significant differences after infection with hNS1-expressing recombinant viruses or aNS1-expressing recombinant viruses at certain time points. Interestingly, these data reflected the dynamics of the IFN-mediated stimulation of these genes since in all cases the greater differences were found at later time points than in the case of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ3 (24 to 48 hpi versus 12 to 24 hpi). We confirmed the differences observed in IFN production after infection with aNS1- and hNS1-expressing IAVs by multiplex ELISA at 48 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). In this case, the differences for IFN-α and IFN-β expression levels were also statistically significant. Of note, the levels of IFN-α and IFN-β were strikingly lower than those for IFN-λ1. In this assay, accumulation of protein over 48 h is measured, which could result in increased sensitivity compared to that of a qRT-PCR assay.
