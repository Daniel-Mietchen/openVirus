<p>Next, we analyzed the levels of expression of multiple viral genes by qRT-PCR, and the differential patterns (human versus avian) previously observed in infected DCs were also observed in infected NHBE cells. NHBE cells infected with viruses bearing hNS1 proteins showed higher levels of expression of NP, M1, HA, and NEP mRNAs than NHBE cells infected with viruses bearing aNS1 proteins (
