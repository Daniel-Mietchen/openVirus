<p>Different mechanisms have been reported by which the influenza NS1 protein counteracts the innate immune responses (reviewed in references 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Briefly, NS1 can interact with different components of the RIG-I/IFN signaling pathway to efficiently inhibit IFN expression (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) either by direct binding of NS1 to RIG-I (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or by interaction with the E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25). In addition to that, NS1 can also interact with Riplet, preventing ubiquitination and activation of RIG-I (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). NS1 was also shown to inhibit IRF3 and NF-κB activation, which is necessary for the production of IFNs in infected cells (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The antiviral properties of protein kinase R (PKR) and 2′,5′-oligo(A) synthetase (OAS)-RNase L are also inhibited by NS1 as a result of the direct interaction with dsRNAs (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and, in the case of PKR, also in a dsRNA binding-independent manner (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition, NS1 proteins from some IAV strains can suppress the expression of cellular genes by blocking the maturation of cellular pre-mRNA through the interaction with the 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and with the poly(A)-binding protein II (PABPII) (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Also, NS1 blocks the export of cellular mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), leading to a general inhibition of expression of the host’s genes, including IFN genes, ISGs, and proinflammatory genes. In addition to counteracting the innate immune response, NS1 can also target some factors (eIF4GI, PABPI, and human Staufen [hStaufen]) to enhance viral mRNA translation in the cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and NS1 is also believed to be involved in regulation of the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by binding p85β subunit (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and limiting the apoptosis of the cell (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, since some functions are carried out in the nucleus and some in the cytoplasm, the localization of NS1 is highly regulated through two nuclear localization signals (NLS) (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and one nuclear export signal (NES) (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Importantly, most of these NS1 functions are not conserved among different strains (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).
