<p>Altogether, our results showed differential immune profiles in both human DCs and NHBE cells after infection with recombinant IAV viruses expressing the NS1 from avian or human viruses. These different phenotypes are characterized by higher expression of type I and type III IFNs in human DCs and NHBE cells and also by higher expression of ISGs in NHBE cells infected with viruses bearing human NS1 than with viruses bearing avian NS1. Remarkably, this phenotype is not due to differences in intracellular viral replication (DCs) or in viral particle release (NHBE cells). In addition, differences in the expression levels of some viral genes and in the cellular localization dynamics were found between human and avian NS1 proteins during infection in DCs, which might be associated with the immune phenotype of DCs upon infection with these viruses. Multiple amino acid changes are present between NS1 proteins of IAVs from human and avian origin, and some of them have been previously reported to participate in the immune-modulatory capabilities of NS1. Therefore, the phenotypic differences found between viruses expressing these NS1 proteins are likely a result of the combination of multiple factors. Further research will help to improve our understanding on the IAV NS1 functions at a global level.</p>
