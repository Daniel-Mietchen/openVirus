<p>IFNs are widely expressed cytokines that act as the first line of defense against viral infections and possess the ability to induce an antiviral state in the producing as well as neighboring cells. Even though the signal transduction cascades are similar between type I and type III IFNs (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), it has been reported that type III IFNs precede a type I IFN antiviral defense in the respiratory tract in mice (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Our results in infected DCs and NHBE cells also show that the amount of IFN-λ1 detected in the supernatant is higher than the amount of IFN-α/β (also observed in mRNA levels), in agreement with the idea that type III IFNs are the first IFNs produced to suppress the initial viral spread without activating systemic inflammation (
