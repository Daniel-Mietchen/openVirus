<p>In search of possible mechanisms for the differences in the innate immune responses between IAVs bearing hNS1 or aNS1, we analyzed their intracellular replication profiles (measuring vRNA) and expression of viral proteins (measuring mRNA and protein) in infected cells. In general, we found that in infected DCs differential levels of replication or protein expression did not correlate with the innate immune patterns elicited by viruses with human or avian NS1 proteins. This was also the case for NP mRNA expression. However, there was a specific gene, M1, that seemed to be greatly influenced by the host origin of the NS1 protein in infected DCs and NHBE cells. Expression levels of other genes such as HA and NEP were also altered by the host origin of the NS1 protein, but multicycle replication kinetics were similar between viruses bearing hNS1 and aNS1 in infected NHBE cells.</p>
