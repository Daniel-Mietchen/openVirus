<p>NS1 proteins contain two nuclear localization signals (NLS), NLS1 and NLS2, and one nuclear export signal (NES) to regulate their nuclear trafficking of IAV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). Despite the variability of the NS1 protein sequences, NLS1 is very conserved across different strains and is located in the RNA binding domain involving amino acids 34 to 38 (DRLRR) (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). On the other hand, NLS2 is a very variable region located in the C-terminal domain of the protein. NLS2 was initially mapped between amino acids 203 and 237 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), with a putative nuclear localization motif between residues 216 and 221 (P-X-Q-K-R-K/E) (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). It has been proposed that NLS interacts with the cellular protein importin Î± (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) and induces rapid nuclear localization after its translation (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Also, it is thought that other amino acids less proximal to the C terminus might also be involved in the NLS2 signature (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>) since altering the NLS2 sequence for several human strains does not seem to have an effect on NS1 nuclear localization, while for avian viruses the presence of both (in mammalian cells) is required. In addition to that, a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) also has been described for some strains. NoLS is associated with basic amino acids at positions 219, 220, 224, and 229 and also at positions 231 and 232 in NS1 proteins with C-terminal extensions (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). However, the role of the nucleolar localization for NS1 and its contribution to viral replication are unknown. Finally, the NES is a quite conserved region, located in the effector domain, specifically, amino acids F138, L141, L144, and L146 (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In addition, a previous study found that the region between amino acids 100 and 120, in which we found a small cluster of different amino acids, might also be involved in nuclear export (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). However, no major sequence differences were observed in NLS1 and NES regions between the NS1 sequences used in our study. In contrast, we found multiple differences between hNS1 and aNS1 in their NLS2 sequences and surrounding domains, which could be associated with their localization phenotypes. Additionally, we cannot exclude the possibility of other currently undescribed amino acids that could be responsible for this phenotype. Specific interactions between cellular and viral factors with NS1 proteins play key roles in determining the intracellular localization of NS1 by masking or unmasking specific subcellular localization signals (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, the different localization dynamics of human and avian NS1 proteins could result from specific interaction partners for hNS1 proteins in the nucleus that unmask the NES and allow faster transport to the cytoplasmic compartment than that of aNS1 proteins. Alternatively, aNS1 proteins may interact with specific proteins in the nucleus that retain them longer in the nucleus than hNS1 proteins. Further studies of the interactions between NS1 proteins and different proteins in the nucleus will help elucidate the mechanism behind the different localization dynamics.
