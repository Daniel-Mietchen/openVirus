<p>Infection efficiency was also evaluated in hiPSCs and in hiPSC-derived neurons (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05404-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In both cell types, WNV infection was more efficient than ZIKV and DENV-2 infection. In particular, 30% ± 7%, 80% ± 10%, and 25% ± 5% of hiPSCs and 40% ± 10%, 60% ± 15%, and 30% ± 8% of neurons showed positive anti-E immunostaining after infection with ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 at MOI 1, respectively.
