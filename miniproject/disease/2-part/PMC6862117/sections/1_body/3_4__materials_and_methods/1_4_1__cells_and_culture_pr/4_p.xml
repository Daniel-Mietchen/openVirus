<p>Embryoid bodies (EBs) formation was performed by plating hiPSCs in ultra-low-density attachment plates (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) in hiPSCs medium without bFGF. The medium was changed every 3 days. After 7 days, EBs were seeded on 0.1% gelatine- (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) coated 6-well tissue culture plate with DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the medium was changed every 3 days. After 7 days of growth adhesion, cells were harvested using Trypsin enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
