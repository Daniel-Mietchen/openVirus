<p>To model ZIKV infection during embryogenesis, ZIKV infection was performed during EB formation. Specifically, hiPSCs were infected at MOI 1 and, after 2 days, cells were detached by collagenase IV treatment in order to initiate differentiation of EBs. Detached infected hiPSC colonies were suspended in iPSC medium without bFGF supplementation to prevent stemness retention, and grown in suspension for 7 days. At day 7, growing EBs were plated on 0.1% porcine gelatin in order to allow them to grow in adhesion. Viral infection was monitored by viral titration in the supernatants of infected cells.</p>
