<p>In this study, we investigated the infectivity, tropism, and replication kinetics of ZIKV, in comparison with WNV and DENV in hiPSCs, hiPSCs-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and undifferentiated neurons, and the effect of viral infection on host innate antiviral responses. In addition, we exploited hiPSCs to model ZIKV infection in the embryo and during stem cell differentiation towards the neuronal lineage. The results of this study confirmed the tropism of ZIKV for NSCs, but showed that WNV replicated in these cells with much higher efficiency, inducing massive cell death. Although with lower efficiency, all flaviviruses could also infect pluripotent stem cells and neurons, inducing similar patterns of antiviral innate immune response gene expression. While showing the usefulness of hiPSC-based infection models, these findings suggest that additional virus-specific mechanisms, beyond neural tropism, are responsible for the peculiarities of disease phenotype in humans.</p>
