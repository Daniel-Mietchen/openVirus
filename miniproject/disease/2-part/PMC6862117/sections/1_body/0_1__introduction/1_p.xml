<p>The 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> includes several arthropod-borne human pathogens that may cause a spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from a mild febrile illness to severe hemorrhagic fever or neuroinvasive disease. Neurotropic flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), are maintained in nature in transmission cycles involving mosquito (mainly 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp.) or tick (mainly 
 <italic>Ixodes</italic> spp.) vectors and mammalian or bird amplification hosts, with humans serving as dead-end incidental hosts. Most human infections are asymptomatic or characterized by flu-like illness, while a severe and potentially fatal neuroinvasive disease occurs in a minority of cases, mostly immunocompromised and elderly individuals [
