<p>Previous studies demonstrated an antiviral function of IFIT2 in controlling viral replication in the CNS [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and IFIT2 has been suggested to have antiviral activity against WNV [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, WNV uses the 2′ O-methylation of the 5′ guanosine cap as a mechanism to evade the antiviral effects of IFIT1 and IFIT2 [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is consistent with our observations of a stronger upregulation of IFIT2 following WNV infection than ZIKV and DENV-2 infection. Also, IFIT2 triggers a mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis accompanied by the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak with the activation of caspase-3 [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-20-05404" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Accordingly, in our study we could observe overexpression of 
 <italic>IFIT2</italic> in infected NSCs and activation of caspase-3.
