<p>In conclusion, this study highlighted similarities and differences in ZIKV, WNV, and DENV mechanisms of infection of pluripotent stem cells and neural cells and induction of cell damage and antiviral response, which warrant further investigation. Several factors, both viral and cellular, are involved in the difference in infectivity, replication kinetics, and pattern of host antiviral response. These factors include, for example, expression levels of entry molecules on host cells and tissues and biding affinity with viral E proteins [

Other mechanisms are the specific interaction of viral nonstructural proteins with host targets, such as in the case of the secreted NS1 protein, which modulates endothelial barrier function in a tissue-specific manner for the different flaviviruses [
