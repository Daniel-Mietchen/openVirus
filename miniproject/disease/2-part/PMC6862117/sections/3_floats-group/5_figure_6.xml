  <p>Induction of cell death (

   <bold>b</bold>) in WNV, ZIKV, and DENV infected neural stem cells. (a) Cell viability was measured by MTT assay at 72 h and 96 post infection with ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 at MOI 1. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Caspase-3 activity was measured by flow cytometry in cells harvested at 72 h post infection with ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 at MOI 1. Data are shown as the means ± SD from three independent experiments in duplicate. *
