  <p>WNV, ZIKV, and DENV replication kinetics of hiPSCs, NSCs, and neurons. Cell were infected with viruses at MOI 0.01, 0.1, and 1. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Viral RNA load was measured daily in cell culture supernatant by qRT-PCR. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Infectious viral titer in cell culture supernatant measured by plaque assay or TCID50 assay in Vero cells. qRT-PCR data are shown as the means ± SD from three independent experiments conducted in quintuplicate. Viral load data are shown as the means ± SD from three independent experiments in duplicate. *
