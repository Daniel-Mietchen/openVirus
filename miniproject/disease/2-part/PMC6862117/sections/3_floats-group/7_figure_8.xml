  <p>Analysis of ZIKV infection in differentiating hiPSCs. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Cytopathic effect of ZIKV in differentiating hiPSCs (MOI 1) at 2, 4, and 6 dpi. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining assessing the expression of flavivirus E protein (green) and Pax6 (red) in ZIKV-infected differentiating hiPSCs (MOI 1) at 7 dpi; nuclei were stained with DAPI; 20× magnification. (
   <bold>c</bold>) ZIKV load in culture supernatants measured by TCID50 assay from 1 to 7 dpi. qRT-PCR data are shown as the means ± SD from three independent experiments conducted in quintuplicate. Viral load data are shown as the means ± SD from three independent experiments in duplicate. *
