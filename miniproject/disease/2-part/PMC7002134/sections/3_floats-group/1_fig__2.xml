  <title>Production of DENV2-derived siRNAs in human 293T cells.</title>
  <p>293T cells were infected with DENV2
   <sub>WT</sub> (
   <bold>A</bold>, 
   <bold>D</bold>, 
   <bold>G</bold>, and 
   <bold>J</bold>) or DENV2
   <sub>K135A</sub> (
   <bold>B</bold>, 
   <bold>E</bold>, 
   <bold>H</bold>, and 
   <bold>K</bold>), and 293T-NoDice cells were infected with DENV2
   <sub>K135A</sub> (
   <bold>C</bold>, 
   <bold>F</bold>, 
   <bold>I</bold>, and 
   <bold>L</bold>). RNA extracts were prepared at 3 dpi (MOI = 10) and subjected to deep sequencing. (
   <bold>A</bold> to 
   <bold>C</bold>) Size distribution and abundance [counts per million of total reads (CPM)] of total vsRNAs of indicated samples. Red, (+)-vsRNAs; blue, (−)-vsRNAs. (
   <bold>D</bold> to 
   <bold>F</bold>) Total pairs of complementary 22-nt vsRNAs in each distance category between 5′- and 3′-ends of a complementary vsRNA pair, shown as −2 for pairs with 2-nt overhang at the 3′-end of each strand defined as the canonical vsiRNAs; +20 indicates the distance between 5′- and 3′-ends of two consecutive vsiRNAs. The percentage of the 22-nt DENV2 vsRNA pairs with 2-nt 3′overhangs (i.e., vsiRNAs) or with 20-nt distance of two vsRNA pairs in the total 22-nt vsRNAs was indicated. (
   <bold>G</bold> to 
   <bold>I</bold>) The distribution and abundance of 22 ± 1–nt (+)- and (−)-vsRNA reads mapped to the (+)- and (−)-stranded DENV2 genomes are indicated. (
   <bold>J</bold> to 
   <bold>L</bold>) A close-up view of the distribution of 22 ± 1–nt vsRNA reads mapped to the 5′-terminal 200-nt region of DENV2 genome.
