<p>The 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> cell line Aag2 [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CCL-125] were cultured at 27.5°C in Schneider’s insect medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco). The 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> cell line C6/36 (ATCC CRL-1660) was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) medium containing 10% FBS at 27.5°C. HEK293T and BHK-21 cells were commercially obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The 293T-NoDice cell line was provided by B. R. Cullen (Durham, NC, USA).
