<p>RNA-IP was performed, as previously described with minor modification (

 </xref>). Briefly, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer [20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1% NP-40, RNase inhibitor (1 U/μl; Promega), and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. After centrifugation, the postnuclear lysates were precleared via incubation with protein-A/G agarose beads (Roche) together with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G at 4°C for 4 hours. Then, the precleared lysates were incubated with anti–pan-AGO antibody, together with protein-A/G agarose beads (Roche) at 4°C for 12 hours. The antibody-bound complexes were washed five times with the same lysis buffer except that NaCl concentration was raised to 600 mM. Last, RNAs or proteins were extracted from the complexes and subjected to Northern or Western blotting as described above.
