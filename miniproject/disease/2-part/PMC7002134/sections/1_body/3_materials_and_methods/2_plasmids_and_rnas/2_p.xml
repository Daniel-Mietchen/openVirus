<p>For the reversal-of-silencing assay in mammals, the plasmid pEGFP-C1 and the EGFP-specific shRNA were used, as described (

 </xref>). The flaviviral (DENV1-4, JEV, ZIKV, and WNV) NS2A were cloned into mammalian expression vector pRK-Flag/His (provided by H.-B. Shu, Wuhan, China). Plasmids for the purification of MBP fusion protein NS2A and its mutants were constructed by inserting NS2A ORF into a pMAL-c2X vector. The primers used in this study are shown in table S2.
