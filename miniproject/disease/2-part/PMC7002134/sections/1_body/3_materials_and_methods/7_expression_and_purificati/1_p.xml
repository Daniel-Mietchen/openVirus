<p>For expression and purification of recombinant MBP-fusion proteins, MBP-NS2A and its mutants as well as the negative control protein MBP were expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain TB1 at 27°C in the presence of 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell pellets were resuspended in binding buffer [20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1.5% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cells were lysed by sonication, and then debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 11,000
 <italic>g</italic>. The proteins in the supernatant were purified using amylose resin (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 filters (Millipore). All proteins were quantified via an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu).
