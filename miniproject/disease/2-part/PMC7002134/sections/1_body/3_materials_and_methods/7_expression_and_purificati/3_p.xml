<p>For the in vitro Dicer cleavage assay, 0.4 μg of 200-nt dsRNA was incubated with 0.5 U of a recombinant hDicer enzyme (T510002, Genlantis) and MBP-fusion proteins at 37°C for 12 hours. The Dicer-treated RNAs were purified by using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then separated on 7 M urea–15% PAGE; the RNAs were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide.</p>
