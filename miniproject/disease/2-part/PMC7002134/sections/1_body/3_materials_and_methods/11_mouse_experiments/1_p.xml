 <sup>−/−</sup> (AG6) mice or 1-day-old Balb/C mice were inoculated by intracerebral injection with 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> or 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of viruses, respectively. Animals were monitored for 15 days after inoculation. Any mice found in a moribund condition were euthanatized and scored as dead. Mouse brains were collected at 3 and 6 dpi, homogenized, and diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to make final 10% (w/v) suspensions. The viral RNAs in brains were measured by qRT-PCR. All animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Chinese Regulations of Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Science and Technology of China) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
