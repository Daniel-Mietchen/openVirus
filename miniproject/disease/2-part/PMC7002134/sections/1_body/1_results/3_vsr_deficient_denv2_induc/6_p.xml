<p>In addition, the production of DENV2 vsiRNAs in 293T cells was further confirmed via Northern blotting with RNA probe complementary to 3′-end 150 to 200 nt of the negative-stranded antigenomic RNA. Consistent with the sequencing data, DENV2 vsiRNAs (22 ± 1-nt) were readily detected in 293T or IFNAR1-KO 293T cells infected with DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> but not with DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>, and the ablation of hDicer mostly abolished the production of vsiRNAs in 293T-NoDice cells (
