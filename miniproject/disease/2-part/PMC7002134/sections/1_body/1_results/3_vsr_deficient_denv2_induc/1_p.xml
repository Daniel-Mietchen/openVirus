<p>The vsiRNA production is recognized as the prerequisite of antiviral RNAi (

 <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub> at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and then subjected to deep sequencing. As shown in

 <sub>WT</sub>-infected 293T cells did not cluster as the 22 ± 1–nt Dicer cleavage products (i.e., siRNAs) but instead were presented as predominantly nonspecific viral RNA degradation products with random size distribution and an overwhelming positive-strand bias, showing that no or very few vsiRNAs could be produced in DENV2
 <sub>WT</sub>-infected 293T cells, consistent with previous observations (
