<p>We found that the percentage of the 22-nt DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>-vsRNA pairs with 2-nt 3â€²overhangs (i.e., vsiRNAs) in the total 22-nt vsRNAs was higher in IFNAR1-KO 293T cells compared to that in normal 293T cells (30.7% versus 19.7%), suggesting that the IFN-I system may influence hDicer-mediated biogenesis of vsiRNAs.
