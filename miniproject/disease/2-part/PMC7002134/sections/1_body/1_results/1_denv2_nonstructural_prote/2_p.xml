<p>To further confirm the RNAi suppression activity of DENV2 NS2A, we adopted another canonical assay in S2 cells. In this assay, a VSR-deficient FHV replicon mutant (pFR1-Î”B2) was expressed to self-replicate in S2 cells (

 </xref>). Owing to the lack of B2, this mutant FHV replicon was unable to evade antiviral RNAi, resulting in the near clearance of self-replicated FHV genomic RNA1 and subgenomic RNA3 in S2 cells, while the presence of NS2A successfully rescued the replication of FHV replicon (
