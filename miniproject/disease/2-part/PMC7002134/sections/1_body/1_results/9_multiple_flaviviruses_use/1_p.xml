<p>Our previous sequence analysis revealed that NS2As from all the four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) and multiple other flaviviruses share high homology in amino acid sequences (fig. S2C), suggesting their commonalities in functions. Thus, we first examined whether NS2As from DENV serotype-1 to serotype-4 have the same VSR activities. Our data show that ectopically expressing any of the four NS2As showed similar in vitro RNAi suppression activities in both S2 (fig. S6, A and B) and Aag2 cells (fig. S6, C and D). After that, we further assessed the VSR activity of NS2A encoded by ZIKV, JEV, or WNV in 293T cells, in which RNAi is induced by an EGFP-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA), and found that NS2As encoded by these viruses had similar in vitro RNAi suppression activities to restore EGFP mRNA and inhibit siRNA production (fig. S7). Thus, our data show a conserved role of NS2A as a potential VSR for all the DENV serotypes as well as multiple other flaviviruses.</p>
