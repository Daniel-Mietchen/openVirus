<p>We aim to expand our investigations of the antiviral effects of RNAi in primary cells and mouse models. For this purpose, primary murine lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were isolated from 8-week-old WT or

  <sup>−/−</sup>

 <sub>WT</sub> or DENV2
 <sub>K135A</sub>. Our results showed that the deficiency of VSR substantially attenuated the viral RNA replication and virion production in WT or

 <sub>WT</sub> triggered the production of vsiRNAs, which were readily detectable via Northern blotting, in WT or

 </sup> MLFs (
