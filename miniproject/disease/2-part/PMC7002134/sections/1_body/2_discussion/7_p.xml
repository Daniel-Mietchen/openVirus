<p>To our best knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that a flavivirus can trigger abundant vsiRNA production and effective antiviral RNAi response in a Dicer-dependent manner in differentiated mammalian cells. Moreover, it provides the mechanistic insight into how flaviviruses act to evade antiviral RNAi in the context of viral infection of both mammals and mosquitoes. These findings extend our knowledge about the life and transmission cycles of mosquito-borne flaviviruses and shed light onto the interaction between this large group of pathogenic viruses and antiviral RNAi immunity, which may be amenable to antiviral therapy and would represent an exciting avenue for future studies.</p>
