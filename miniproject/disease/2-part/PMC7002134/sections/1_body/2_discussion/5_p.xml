<p>Although RNAi is conserved in all eukaryotes, a long-standing question is why infection with multiple WT viruses fails to trigger abundant vsiRNA production in differentiated mammalian cells but can readily do so in insect cells. A reasonable explanation is that insect has a stronger Dicer machinery to process vRI-dsRNA. However, previous findings using different insect viruses and mammalian viruses are inappropriate to be directly compared and cannot exclude a less likely possibility that mammalian viruses encode more potent VSRs to block vsiRNA production. Therefore, mosquito-borne flaviviruses, which have dual life cycles, are ideal models to study antiviral RNAi in the two distinct organisms. Moreover, it would be intriguing to know whether a flavivirus uses the same or different strategy to evade RNAi in mammals and insects. Our findings show that flaviviruses use the same strategy (NS2A as VSR) to antagonize RNAi in both organisms, and antiviral RNAi does seem more prominent in insect cells than in mammalian somatic cells.</p>
