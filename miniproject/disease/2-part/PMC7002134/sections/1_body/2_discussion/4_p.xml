<p>In addition to NS2A, an interesting question is whether flaviviruses encode another VSR(s). Previous studies have identified some flaviviral factors, including WNV subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) and DENV NS4B, that suppressed synthetic dsRNA- or shRNA-induced RNAi via in vitro assays (

Besides, Myles and colleagues genetically added a YFV capsid gene into the genome of Sindbis virus (SINV) and observed that the mutant SINV overexpressing YFV capsid exhibited enhanced viral replication and virulence in mosquito, while the mutant SINV overexpressing DENV NS4B or WNV sfRNA failed to do so (

 </xref>), suggesting that flaviviral capsid has the potential to be a VSR. However, these in vitro studies did not assess whether these flaviviral factors affect vsiRNA production or antiviral RNAi in the context of authentic flaviviral infection. Moreover, the assays relying on overexpressing a candidate VSR have an inherent caveat, as the overexpression of a protein with potent dsRNA-binding capacity may interfere with RNAi anyhow, which does not necessarily mean that it really works as a bona fide VSR during viral infection. On the other hand, it is expected that a virus can encode more than one antagonist of a given immune mechanism. For example, multiple flaviviral proteins have been found to be IFN antagonists (
