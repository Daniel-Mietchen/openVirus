<p id="Par12">Although amino acid sequences varied among the types, the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the viruses were rather conserved regarding HA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3A</xref>), which suggests that at least some positions were conserved. In fact, several positions were common to type A viruses; e.g., they were located at the core of the protein, the rod of the alpha helix (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3B</xref>). These positions seem to be important for the maintenance of the protein functions.
