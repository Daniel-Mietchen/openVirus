<p id="Par7">HA segments of Subtype H1 viruses were further separated into three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The separation was discrete, with no intermediates. For descriptive purposes, the three groups were termed R, M, and U. The R and M groups included the Russia 1977 and Mexico 2009 pandemic viruses, respectively, and the U group was most likely unfound from recent human records. The avian viruses were located inside the triangle formed by the three groups. Residues that contributed to the separation were a choice between the two, forming a hexagonal shape (Fig.
