<p id="Par6">The amino acid residues that contributed to the segregation of HA had certain flexibility; i.e., several choices were possible at the position. Therefore, PC for residues showed segregation into three directions in both cases, as even if a residue showed an extreme value in the PC for residues, the opposed residues would have diffused values. The three clusters did not run through the origin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1B,D</xref>). If the changes were a choice between the two, opposite directions would yield a point-symmetrical shape (for example, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1E,F</xref>). Separations among types appeared mainly in PC1 and PC2, so the contributions were concentrated on these axes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1G</xref>).
