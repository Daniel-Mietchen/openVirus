<p id="Par25">Drifts and spreading: the genomes of the R group of human viruses have been changing yearly (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A–C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4A</xref>). The changed residues covered almost the whole surface of the HA protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3C</xref>), showing the trajectory of the 30 years of battle against the human immune system. In the last few years, drifting was not observed in PC1, which records positions that changed only once (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, grey). It seems that few positions that were amenable to variation were left unchanged, and that spontaneous mutation failed to hit those positions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3C</xref>, positions located on the surface of HA and not marked). Even the viruses that almost exhausted the number of unchanged positions kept drifting in the lower PCs, where repeated mutations were recorded (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4A</xref>).
