<p id="Par33">Unfortunately, it is difficult to estimate the history of old viruses because of the shortage of data. Some of the segments of the 1930 strain exhibited interesting positions on the branches: i.e., some were R type, while others were located between the R and (M or U) types (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The segments would be those close to the branching point of the groups. However, this does not necessarily mean that the branching occurred recently; i.e., it could have been preserved among swine at least until 1930. Whether the 1918 and/or 1943 human strains are lineal ancestors of the 1977 pandemic virus remains uncertain. It should be noted that these viruses were included in different epidemic series on different memories of immunity among humans. These immune memories are changing because of the change of human generations, i.e., the return of the R group observed over recent years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, grey) might have been enabled by such changes.
