 </sup>, other segments that include proteins located inside the virus particle also drifted with a magnitude similar to that of HA, which suggests a common mutation frequency (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4C</xref>). This observation was unexpected because mutations may lead to malfunction; if they are not the target of immunity, they should be conserved, similar to those of livestock viruses. As the segments are displayed on the surface of infected cells, they will activate specific immune cells, which may play important roles in the human immune system.
