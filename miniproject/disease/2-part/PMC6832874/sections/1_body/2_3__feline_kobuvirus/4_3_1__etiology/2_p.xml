<p>FeKoVs were firstly discovered in diarrheic cats in South Korea [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Sequence analysis of the partial 3D region (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) revealed that feline strains shared the highest identities with strains previously detected in dogs (82.1% nt and 92.1% aa identities) [
