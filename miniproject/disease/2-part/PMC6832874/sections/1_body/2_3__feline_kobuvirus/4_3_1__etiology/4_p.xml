<p>Genetic distance calculations based on the analysis of the full-length polyprotein of the six FeKoV strains to date available on GenBank database revealed a high identity to each other (92.9%–93.4% nt and 96.8%–98.5% aa), that is consistent with the genetic similarities found for human AiVs and CaKoVs. More recently, further information on the genetic diversity of these group of kobuviruses has been obtained by Niu et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] in a molecular survey performed in Northeast China by analyzing the structural VP1 gene of eight FeKoV strains. VP1 protein is the most exposed and immunodominant part of the picornavirus capsid proteins, and it is also the most variable structural protein among the six kobuvirus species [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Upon sequence analysis based on the complete VP1 sequences, the Chinese FeKoVs formed a tight group, distinct from other strains previously detected in South Korea [

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Furthermore, three identical aa substitutions (182, 235, 241 are the aa positions referred to the VP1 protein) were present at the C-terminal of the VP1 protein of all FeKoV strains detected in China. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that VP1 could be employed as a molecular marker to acquire information on the geographical origin of the feline strains detected [
