<p>Replication in vitro of kobuviruses has been demonstrated only for AiV strain A846/88 [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], determining both a distinct cytopathic effect on BS-C-1 and Vero cells, respectively. By converse, in spite of several attempts on different cell lines, replication of FeKoV in cell cultures has never been successful [
