<p>Conventional RT-PCR is the primary assay for the detection of FeKoVs. The first identification of FeKoVs RNA was obtained by using the primers set 10f and 10r [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] targeting a 631 bp fragment of the 3D region highly conserved between bovine kobuvirus prototype strain U1 and human AiV strain A846/88 [

Currently, the RT-PCR strategy widely used to screen feline stool samples is performed by using generic kobuvirus primers (UNIV-kobu-F (Forward, 5′-TGGAYTACAAG(/R)TGTTTTGA-3′ and UNIV-kobu-R (Reverse, 5′-ATGTTGTTRATGATGGTGTTGA-3′) amplifying a region of 216 bp of the 3D region and able to recognize all the members of the genus
