<p>Except for one study in which GIV.2 NoV like-sequences were identified by the metagenomic approach analyzing pooled fecal samples from clinically healthy cats [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], NoVs were detected in animals with enteric signs with a prevalence rate of 6.2%, whilst they were not identified in samples collected from healthy cats used as the control study group. Furthermore, experimental inoculation of specific pathogen-free cats with the feline GVI.1 strain JPN/2012/M49 could induce enteritis signs, diarrhea and vomiting [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Taken together, these findings seem to indicate a possible role of these NoVs as feline enteric pathogens, although their pathogenic role in cats should be confirmed in larger epidemiological surveys and in experimental infections with other NoV genotypes.
