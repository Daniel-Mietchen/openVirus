<p>Serological studies of NoVs necessarily rely on the expression of synthetic antigens, and the baculovirus system appears to be particularly adequate since the baculovirus-expressed full-length VP1 of NoVs is assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable from wild-type NoVs [
