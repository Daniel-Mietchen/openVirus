<p>The icosahedral capsid surrounds a 7.5–7.7 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome covalently linked to Viral Protein g (VPg) at the 5′ end and polyadenylated at the 3′ end. NoV genome is organized into three Open Reading Frames (ORFs) [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. ORF1 is translated as a large polyprotein which is co- and post-translationally cleaved by the virus-encoded protease (NS6) to release at least six mature non-structural (NS) proteins, including NS6. The other NS proteins include the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; NS7), VPg (NS5), the putative NTPase/RNA helicase (NS3), and NS1/2 and NS4, which have both been implicated in replication complex formation [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein (VP1), while ORF3 encodes the minor structural protein (VP2).
