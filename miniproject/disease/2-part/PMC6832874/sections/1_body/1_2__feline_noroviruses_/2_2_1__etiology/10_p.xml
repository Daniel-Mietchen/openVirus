<p>Along with the accumulation of point mutations, recombination is a powerful mechanism strongly influencing the evolution and epidemiology of human NoVs [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recombination observed in feline NoVs has also been described for canine NoVs [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In all the cases, the site of recombination was mapped to the highly conserved ORF1/ORF2 junction region. Accordingly, a definitive characterization of the strains circulating in carnivores should rely on the sequence analysis of either RdRp region of the ORF2 gene.
