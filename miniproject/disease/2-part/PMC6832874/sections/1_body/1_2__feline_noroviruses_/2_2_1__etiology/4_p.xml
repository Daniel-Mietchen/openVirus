<p>Based on the full-length VP1 amino acid sequence, NoVs are classified into at least eight genogroups (GI to GVIII) and &gt;40 genotypes [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Only GI, GII, GIV, and GVIII NoVs infect humans, with GII.4 strains that are the most prevalent worldwide [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. NoVs detected in animals have been classified as GII (pigs) [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], GIII (small and large domestic ruminants) [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], GIV (lion, dog, cat) [
