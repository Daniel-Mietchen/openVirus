<p>The pathogenicity of FBoV has not been experimentally assessed and it is not clear if this virus may play a role in enteric or extra-enteric diseases in cats. FBoV DNA was first identified in multiple tissues, specifically in 26 (7.2%) of 363 fecal samples, six (1.6%) of 364 urine samples, three (0.8%) of 361 blood samples, one (0.3%) of 364 nasal samples, and one (2.0%) of 51 kidney samples collected from a total of 364 stray cats in Hong Kong, suggesting a wide tissue tropism [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a molecular study conducted in Japan [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], FBoV2 DNA was identified in four of 48 (8.3%) rectal swabs collected from healthy cats and in six of 53 (11.32%) animals with gastroenteritis, although no significant association was found between FBoV2 infection and clinical disease [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], out of 36 fecal samples assessed, FBoV DNA has been found in one of 13 cats with severe enteritis, while it was not detected in asymptomatic animals. In a second molecular survey conducted in China [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] a significant association was observed between FBoV infection and diarrhea. In most cases, FBoV-infected cats were also co-infected by other viral pathogens such as rotavirus, astrovirus, bocavirus, feline sakobuvirus, and picobirnavirus [

 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. These findings seem to indicate that FBoV are a common component of the feline fecal virome. The implementation of the diagnostic algorithm of feline enteritis with FBoVs specific tools could help to gain insight on the enteropathogenic role of these viruses. Although replication in vitro has been demonstrated for various human and animal bocaparvoviruses [

 <xref rid="B129-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], attempts to culture FBoV in different cell lines were unsuccessful [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Detection of FBoVs could be obtained by conventional PCR. A consensus primer set targeting a 141 bp fragment of the NS1 gene has been used for the first identification of FBoV DNA [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Subsequently, specific PCR strategies able to detect each of the three different FBoV types were developed, employing primer sets targeting regions of FBoV and FBoV2 NS1 genes [
