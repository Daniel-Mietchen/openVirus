<p>Common structural features of the bocaparvoviruses include the approximately 5.5 kb ssDNA genome and two main ORFs coding the NS1 (ORF1) and the capsid protein precursor VP1/VP2 (ORF2). A third additional ORF (ORF3), located between ORF1 and ORF2, encodes the NP1 [
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], a highly phosphorylated protein that is not similar to proteins of other parvoviruses and appears essential for virus replication, although its function is still poorly understood [

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Current ICTV guidelines [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] use 85% aa identity along the NS1 protein to establish bocaparvovirus species. Based on this criterion, the genus
