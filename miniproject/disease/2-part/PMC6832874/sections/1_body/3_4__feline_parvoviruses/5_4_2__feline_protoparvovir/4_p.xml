<p>Whether these protoparvoviruses are associated with any disease in cats is not yet known. Until now, BuVs have been identified in humans and recently in wild carnivores (wolves and foxes), exclusively in the enteric tract [

 <xref rid="B149-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>], suggest possible extraintestinal and systemic BuV infections. Molecular screening of feline fecal samples and respiratory swabs revealed that the virus was more common in nasal and oropharyngeal samples (10.2%) than in enteric specimens (2.2%). Furthermore, higher positivity rates were observed in cats with respiratory signs (16.4%, 29/176) than in asymptomatic animals (8.7%, 17/196) [

 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. More recently, canine BuVs were detected in serum specimens from dogs in China. Of interest, the positive sera were collected from animals showing signs of CIRD [
 <xref rid="B147-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Accordingly, a preferential tropism for the respiratory tract for these viruses has been hypothesized, although the identification of these viruses in enteric tract of domestic carnivores and more recently also in wild canids [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] should be further investigated in order to exclude their enteropathogenic role and the possibility that fecal shedding of BuVs represents a strategy of virus persistence in animal populations.
