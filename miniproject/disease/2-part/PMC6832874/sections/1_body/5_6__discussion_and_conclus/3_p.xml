<p>The global distribution of cats and their close contacts with humans represents an additional reason to better understand the composition of their enteric virome [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Historical evidence suggest that some feline viruses are potentially zoonotic. Infection of young children by rotavirus strains of feline origin has been documented in Italy [
 <xref rid="B185-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>] and more recently, in Germany [
 <xref rid="B186-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. The discovery of GIV.2 NoVs in cats and dogs genetically closest related to human GIV.1 NoVs has raised public health concerns about potential interspecies transmission between humans and pets. This eventuality has been demonstrated in a serosurvey performed in Italy on a collection of human serum samples, in which specific IgG antibodies against VLPs based on the lion GIV.2 NoV [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have been detected with prevalence ranging from 6.8% to 15.1% among different age groups [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Furthermore, in a study conducted in Portugal [
 <xref rid="B187-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>], the presence of antibodies to GVI.2 NoV were found in 22.3% of the veterinarians and 5.8% of the control group, revealing for the small animal veterinarians an increased risk for exposure to this virus. Besides NoVs, the zoonotic potential is also suspected for other caliciviruses as the novel 2117-like vesiviruses (VeVs), firstly identified in dog stool samples in Italy [
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. IgG antibodies against the canine 2117-like VeVs have been detected in 7.8% of Italian human sera [
 <xref rid="B189-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>] and, more recently, the RNA of a 2117-like VeV was detected in the feces of a clinically healthy cat [
 <xref rid="B190-viruses-11-00908" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. Accordingly, understanding the ecology of novel enteric viruses in cats will be helpful also to assess more precisely if and to which extent pets may pose a risk of infection for humans.
