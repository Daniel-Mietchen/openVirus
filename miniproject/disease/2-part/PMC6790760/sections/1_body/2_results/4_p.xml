<p>Within Costa Rica, viruses showed variable degrees of temporal residence and spatial structure, and no virus lineage was detected across the duration of the study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20191527F3">figure 3</xref>). For example, L1c appeared in 2015 near the border with Nicaragua and was not subsequently observed, and L2, which was geographically widespread from 2004 to 2014, was not detected in 2015–2017 (

Despite the relatively small sample sizes underlying the lineage-specific time series, the multinomial regression found an effect of year on which virus was observed (

 <italic>a</italic>). L1a and L1c were unlikely to have circulated in Costa Rica during the first 6 years of the study (mean probability of presence less than 0.01) and viruses L1d, L1b and L2 had a high probability (0.975–0.999) of having gone extinct by 2017 (

 <italic>a</italic>). Rabies outbreaks from 2018 (the year after our sequencing completed) revealed no additional cases in other regions, suggesting the continued absence of other viral lineages (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). By the end of the molecular study, non-L1a viruses had not been encountered for 2.96 years on average (range: 2–10.41 years), which was longer than the expected interval between successive detections of persisting viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20191527F4">figure 4</xref>
 <italic>b</italic>). The estimated probabilities of failing to detect a still-circulating virus were less than 0.005 for viruses L1b, L1d and L2, and 0.11 for virus L1c, confirming that all viruses other than L1a were likely to have gone extinct from Costa Rica. By combining molecular clock estimates of the time since the MRCA of clades with the final dates of viral detections, we estimated viruses circulated in Costa Rica for only 10.5 years on average (range: 4.7–18.65 years).
