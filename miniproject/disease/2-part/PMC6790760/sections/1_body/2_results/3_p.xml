<p>Ancestral state reconstructions of the latitude and longitude of the progenitors of the L1a and L2 viruses (the two Costa Rican viruses with sufficient sample sizes for this analysis) provided additional support for invasions suggested by the discrete phylogeographic analysis. The inferred ancestor of virus L1a occurred in southern Costa Rica near the border with Panama, consistent with a recent invasion from South America (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20191527F2">figure 2</xref>). This invasion spread northward at an average of 11.61 km yr
 <sup>−1</sup> (95% credible region on the mean branch velocity = 4.08–59.93) while in Costa Rica. The inferred ancestor of virus L2 occurred further north in central Costa Rica, but was considerably less precise, suggesting that the longer time period of circulation in Costa Rica largely erased evolutionary signal of viral origins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20191527F2">figure 2</xref>). This led to higher and more variable velocities which should be interpreted cautiously (median = 56.98 km yr
 <sup>−1</sup>, 95% credible interval = 12.62–2522.36).
