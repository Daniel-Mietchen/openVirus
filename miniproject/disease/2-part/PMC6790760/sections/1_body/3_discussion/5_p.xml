<p>Our findings also illustrate a Central American corridor of VBRV between North and South America. Inter-continental spread of VBRV was previously implied by large-scale phylogenetic evidence that viral variants occur on both continents, but whether this reflected ancient or modern spread was unknown [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The recent time scale of the dispersal events we observed (within the last 30 years) argues strongly that this corridor is sustained in the present day. Although we did not observe a full sweep across continents (i.e. a North American virus traversing Costa Rica to arrive in South America or vice versa), this was expected, given that the sparse sampling of viruses and the relatively slow progression of rabies expansions in vampire bats observed here (11.6 km yr
 <sup>−1</sup>) and elsewhere (16.1–37.1 km yr
 <sup>−1</sup> in Peru and Argentina) made detection of the same lineage in both continents unlikely during our observational window [

 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, however, three out of five viral lineages circulated only in northern or southern Costa Rica, suggesting they went extinct before traversing the country (

 <italic>b</italic>). This raises the possibility that the reliance of VBRV on sufficiently sized bat metapopulations for long-term maintenance combined with the narrow geography of Central America increases the probability of viral extinction [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consistent with this hypothesis, viral lineages in mainland South America sustain transmission over larger geographical areas, whereas outbreaks on the island of Trinidad fail to persist and are driven by introductions from the mainland, analogous to our observations [

 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Ultimately, contemporaneous sequencing of viruses from across the Americas is needed to determine the relative importance of Central America as a corridor or sink of VBRV since existing data are strongly biased towards North and South America. These data could also determine the true frequency of international viral dispersal, which may be underestimated here due to the limited availability of viral sequences from Central America. Ideally, these datasets could adopt viral whole-genome sequencing, which is expected to increase the resolution of spatio-temporal inferences compared to the single-gene approach used here [
