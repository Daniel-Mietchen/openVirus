<p>Distinguishing endemic pathogen circulation from extinctionâ€“recolonization dynamics is a major challenge which has potential to undermine strategies for disease prevention and control. Focusing on Costa Rica, a small Central American country that has detected rabies nearly every year for decades, we observed invasions of North and South American viruses as well as northbound and southbound exportations of VBRV; however, all viruses had relatively brief residence times within the country. These observations are most parsimoniously explained by a dynamic process of spatial invasion fronts among Central American countries, each of which has limited capacity to sustain enzootic transmission in isolation. Consequently, patterns of spillover to humans and livestock reflect epidemiological processes occurring across multiple countries, which creates challenges and opportunities for prevention and control.</p>
