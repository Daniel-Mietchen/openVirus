<p>In conclusion, this study shows that combining phylogenetic inference of relatively small amounts of longitudinal pathogen sequence data with statistical analyses of surveillance data can disentangle endemic pathogen maintenance from recurrent epidemic fadeouts and spatial re-introductions. For VBRV, this information reveals previously unrecognized spatial structure, clarifies the mechanisms underlying ecological or environmental drivers of cross-species transmission and provides new opportunities for prevention and control. The increasing availability of molecular sequence data should make similar approaches practical in other wildlife disease systems where pathogens persist through spatio-temporal processes, but the dynamics of spatial spread are unobservable from ecological data.</p>
