<p>The pattern of recurrent lineage invasion and replacement we observed provides new insights into the epidemiological mechanisms that underlie rabies endemicity. The ability of successive viral introductions to invade despite the recent presence of other viruses is unlikely to be explained by antigenic differences that allow viruses to evade host immunity as rabies antibodies are broadly protective within and among divergent lyssavirus species [

The low frequency of vampire bat dispersal may also create fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in susceptibility, wherein colonies that evade one invasion remain susceptible to later viral introductions. Similar extinction–reinvasion dynamics have been observed at fine spatial scales in carnivore rabies. For example, endemicity of rabies in domestic dogs in Bangui, a city in Central African Republic, arises from frequent human-mediated re-introduction of infected dogs that trigger short-lived chains of transmission [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, in other rabies systems, including dog rabies in Tanzania and raccoon rabies in North America, viral lineages appear pervasively endemic and may even co-circulate [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These differences are likely to reflect both spatial heterogeneity in rabies persistence (e.g. source–sink dynamics) and observational artefacts, with all rabies viruses experiencing extinctions at some spatial scale. How host population dynamics, behaviour and environmental context interact to define the scale of viral maintenance remains an outstanding question across rabies systems.
