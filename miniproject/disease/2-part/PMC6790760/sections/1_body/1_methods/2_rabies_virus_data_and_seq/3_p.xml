<p>Upon arrival to LANASEVE, samples were stored at −80°C. RNA extractions used the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) used the primers RAB20 5′ ACGCTTAACAACAARATCARAG-3′ and RAB304 5′-TTGACGAAGATCTTGCTCAT-3′ targeting the complete nucleoprotein gene [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The nucleoprotein is an informative gene for phylogeographic analyses of rabies and is the most widely sequenced VBRV gene in GenBank (2440 records versus 596 in the glycoprotein and fewer in other genes; accessed 31 July 2019 via

 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One-step RT–PCR was performed with the following conditions: 45°C for 30 min, 95°C for 15 min, then 40 cycles of 94°C for 10 s, 53°C for 45 s, 68°C for 1:30 min, followed by 68°C for 10 min. The 1534 base pair amplicon was visualized under UV light after electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing GelRed Nucleic Acid Stain (Biotium) and a slice of the gel was purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The sequencing reaction was performed with BigDye T
 <sc>erminator</sc> v. 3.1 using the following cycle conditions: 30 cycles of 96°C for 10 s, 50°C for 5 s and 60°C for 4 min; products were purified with BigDye XT
 <sc>erminator</sc>. DNA sequencing was performed on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT and trimmed to the coding regions [
