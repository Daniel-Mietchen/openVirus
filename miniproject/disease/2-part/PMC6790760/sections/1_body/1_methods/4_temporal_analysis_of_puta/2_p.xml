<p>We evaluated evidence for viral invasions and extinctions given the possibility of undetected viral circulation using two distinct approaches. First, we tested whether the probability of observing each viral lineage varied through time by fitting a multinomial logistic regression using the 
 <italic>multinom</italic> function in the 
 <italic>nnet</italic> package of R. Specifically, we modelled the identity of the viral lineage associated with each rabies outbreak as a nominal dependent variable with five levels (the number of discrete virus lineages detected), with year as the only covariate. This analysis used the earliest detected virus (L2) as a baseline outcome against which to compare other lineages (
 <italic>i</italic>), leading to

 <sub>L2</sub> is log odds effect of the change in year on an outbreak being caused by virus

 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> and 
 <italic>p</italic>-value for the effect of year by comparing the log likelihood of the fitted model against an intercept-only model using the 
 <italic>pscl</italic> package. Second, we used the number of months between successive detections of the same viral lineage (interval data) to assess evidence for continued viral circulation at subdetectable levels versus extinction. We compared the intervals between successive detections of each virus while it was known to have circulated (based on genetically typed outbreaks) to the interval between the final detection of each virus and the end of the observation period, capped by the last outbreak in our dataset (2017.66). Values for the time since final detection are therefore conservative lower bounds, representing minimum estimates. The empirical probability density of inter-detection intervals was estimated using the 
 <italic>demp</italic> function in the 
 <italic>EnvStats</italic> package of R, after aggregating intervals observed across all viruses. To avoid artificially reducing the distribution of inter-detection intervals, we removed repeat observations of the same virus in the same month (i.e. intervals of zero). The 
 <italic>pemp</italic> function was used to estimate the probability of virus lineage extinction, given the number of months since its final detection. R scripts for both statistical analyses are provided in electronic supplementary material, file S3.
