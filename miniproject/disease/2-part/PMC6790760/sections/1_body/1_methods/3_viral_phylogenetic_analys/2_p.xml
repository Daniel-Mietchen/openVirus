<p>Analyses used two datasets comprising sequences from Costa Rica with (hereafter ‘international dataset’, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 75) and without (‘national dataset’, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 40) sequences from other North, Central and South American countries. International analyses focused on the time scale and geographical patterns of viral dispersals into and out of Costa Rica using discrete phylogeographic analyses. We used a cut-off of 98% similarity to any Costa Rican sequence to identify VBRVs available in GenBank that could plausibly have shared a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with Costa Rican viruses, but also included additional representative VBRV lineages for reference. National data were used to confirm the geographical origins suggested in the international analyses and to examine patterns of viral diffusion within Costa Rica using continuous phylogeographic analyses.
