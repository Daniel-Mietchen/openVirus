<p>Both datasets had evidence of clock-like evolution according to TempEst (international: slope = 5.56 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.75; national: slope = 7.08 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.70). Preliminary phylogenetic analyses of the international dataset in BEAST v. 1.8.4 used stepping stone sampling to estimate the marginal likelihood and Bayes factor (BF) support for the strict, relaxed lognormal and random local clock models (electronic supplementary material, file S1) [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The relaxed lognormal molecular clock was indicated (BF &gt; 7.5 and 35.8) and used in subsequent analyses using a normally distributed prior (mean = 5.6 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, s.d. = 2 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Molecular clock models were not formally compared for the national dataset since the random local clock cannot currently be applied to single analyses with multiple trees (see below). We used a relaxed lognormal clock (uniform prior from 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 7 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) since substantial rate variation among branches (ucld.stdev &gt; 0.65) rejected the strict molecular clock. We used partitionFinder2 to identify the best fitting models of codon partitioning and nucleotide substitution, according to the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample size [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. International analyses used a TRN + I + G model shared by codon positions 1 and 2 and the GTR + G model for codon position 3. National analyses used the HKY model shared by codon positions 1 and 2 and a TVM model with equal base frequencies for codon position 3. Customized nucleotide substitution models were implemented in BEAST by manually editing the xml file generated by BEAUTI.
