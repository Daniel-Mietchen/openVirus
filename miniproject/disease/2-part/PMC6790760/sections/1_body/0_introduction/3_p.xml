<p>Vampire bat (
 <italic>Desmodus rotundus</italic>) rabies virus (VBRV) exemplifies a zoonosis for which limited understanding of transmission dynamics in a wildlife reservoir poses substantial management challenges. Although VBRV was discovered over a century ago, it remains the primary cause of uniformly lethal human and animal rabies outbreaks throughout most of the Latin American tropics and subtropics [

Vampire bats have also been culled using anticoagulant poisons since the 1970s, but practically attainable levels of population reduction appear to have negligible effects on rabies risk, in part due to the weak relationship between bat colony size and rabies incidence [
