<p>Little is known of the ecology of VBRV circulation in Central America, although rising human rabies incidence has been noted [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Here, we present the first molecular epidemiological study of VBRV in Central America, focusing on Costa Rica, where the virus was first reported in 1968, and rabies outbreaks in humans and livestock have been documented annually since 1985 [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Specifically, using virus sequence data obtained from domestic animals that succumbed to rabies over a 14-year period, we (i) identified the time scale of evolutionary relationships between VBRVs from Costa Rica and other North, Central and South American countries, (ii) reconstructed the histories of international and inter-continental viral dispersals through Central America, and (iii) examined whether the dynamics of viral lineage residence in Costa Rica were better explained by endemic circulation of resident viruses or extinctionâ€“recolonization dynamics.
