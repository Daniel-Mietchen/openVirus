<p>Many newly emerging and historically important human pathogens originate from wildlife [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Understanding how these pathogens circulate in their natural hosts and what drives cross-species emergence remains a major challenge for epidemiology and public health [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Existing datasets typically comprise short-term field studies and longer-term, but sparser, records of cross-species transmission to humans or domestic animals detected by surveillance systems [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although these data can reveal epidemiological patterns, markedly different underlying ecological processes can be responsible. Variation in incidence can arise from extrinsic environmental drivers (e.g. variation in climate or food availability that influences host immunity or population dynamics) or intrinsic demographic factors (i.e. seasonal replenishment of susceptible individuals) [

 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Alternatively, apparent cycles of endemic infection may reflect recurring extinction–recolonization dynamics of the pathogen. The best examples of this phenomenon come from highly monitored human and domestic animal pathogens (e.g. dengue virus and foot and mouth disease virus), where cycles of extinction and replacement of antigenic types influence vaccination strategies [

Many wildlife pathogens also persist through spatio-temporal processes, but except in rare cases (e.g. invasions of highly visible diseases such as white nose syndrome in bats or chytridiomycosis fungus in amphibians), the dynamics of spatial spread are unobservable due to the scarcity of genotyped or serotyped longitudinal incidence data [
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20191527C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Unrecognized extinction–recolonization dynamics potentially mislead conclusions on the mechanisms of pathogen persistence. Favoured models would incorrectly predict long-term, localized persistence in the absence of immigration, leading to biased estimate the basic reproductive number (
