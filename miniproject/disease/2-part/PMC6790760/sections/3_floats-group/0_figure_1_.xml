 <caption>
  <p>Bayesian phylogenetic inference of international dispersal histories of vampire bat rabies. (
   <italic>a</italic>) Phylogenetic tree with branches coloured by the country of origin. Black branches signal countries omitted from the map in (
   <italic>b</italic>). Node circle size and colours indicate posterior probabilities on branch partitions. Red tip labels indicate viruses from Costa Rica. (
   <italic>b</italic>) Summary of statistically supported (BF &gt; 5) viral dispersions between countries, restricted to those involving Costa Rica. Arrow colours represent northbound (red) or southbound (blue) dispersals, with width proportional to the number of Markov jumps (range = 0.9â€“2.2). Arrows are annotated with the BF support for dispersals between countries. (
   <italic>c</italic>) Additional transitions supported in the discrete phylogeographic analysis that did not involve Costa Rica occurred predominately between geographical neighbours. Country name abbreviations in (
   <italic>b</italic>) and (
   <italic>c</italic>) match (
   <italic>a</italic>). (Online version in colour.)
