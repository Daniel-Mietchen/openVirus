 <caption>
  <p>Invasions and extinctions of five viral lineages. (
   <italic>a</italic>) The predicted probability of viral presence from 2004 to 2017 for each viral lineage. Dashes across the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis indicate observations of any virus; the shading indicates the 95% CI on the mean probability (solid blue line). (
   <italic>b</italic>) The probability density of intervals between successive observations of the same viral lineage. The blue dashed line is the 95% upper bound. Points indicate the duration of the interval between the final detection of each virus (L1b, L1c, L1d, L2) and the final VBRV detection in the study (virus L1a in 2017.66).
