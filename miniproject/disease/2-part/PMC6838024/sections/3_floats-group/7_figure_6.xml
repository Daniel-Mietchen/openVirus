  <p>Pathway enrichment analysis. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Graph shows the enriched pathways targeted by HEV, analyzed by KEGG functional annotation pathway database. 
   <italic>Y</italic>-axis represents the combined score computed using Enricher. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Schematic representation of “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” pathway (imported from KEGG: map04141). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Schematic representation of the spliceosome pathway targeted by HEV host interacting proteins (imported from KEGG: map03040). Proteins interacting with HEV RNA promoter (G or Sg) or polymerase within the entire pathway are shown in red color.
