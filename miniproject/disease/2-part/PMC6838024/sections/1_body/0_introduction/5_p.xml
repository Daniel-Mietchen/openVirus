<p>In order to better understand the HEV-host interface, we identified liver cell proteins interacting with the HEV polymerase and HEV putative promoters and generated a protein-protein interaction network. We further utilized a bioinformatics approach to analyze these interaction networks and assess their significance. Our study identified host proteins related to cellular processes like RNA metabolism, unfolded protein response, stress granules, secretory vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and innate immune pathways. HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 proteins were found to be interacting with both HEV promoters and HEV RdRp. We demonstrated the
