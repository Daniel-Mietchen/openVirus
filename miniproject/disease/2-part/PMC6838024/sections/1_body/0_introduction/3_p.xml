<p>Viruses bear relatively compact genomes, encoding a limited number of proteins and, therefore, rely on host factors to establish replication in the infected cell. Being obligatory intracellular parasites, viruses have to subvert the biosynthetic pathways of the host cell. Constant interactions between the virus and its host during the process of co-evolution have shaped the anti-viral immune system of the host and, in turn, the capability of viruses to manipulate host control mechanisms to facilitate their propagation (

Classical scientific approaches to understanding the molecular basis of such virus-host interactions involve analysis of individual gene or protein targets and study of their functional significance. However, these approaches have not been sufficient to address the challenges of the host-pathogen interface. System biology tools provide a multidimensional approach for a comprehensive view of the biological system at molecular network levels. High throughput genomic and proteomic studies, such as siRNA and microRNA screens, and microarrays have greatly expanded our understanding of virus-host networks. Advances in several tools for data acquisition, processing, integration and computation provide rapid, and promising strategies for the development of new therapies for infectious diseases (
