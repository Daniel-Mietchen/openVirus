<p>To understand the cellular pathways targeted by HEV, we performed pathway enrichment analysis by using the KEGG functional annotation pathway database through Enricher. The results revealed enrichment of different pathways involving pathogenic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infection, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, legionellosis, spliceosome, antigen presentation and processing, gap junction, citrate cycle, IL17 signaling pathways, apoptosis, and phagosome (
