<p>Analysis of HEV-host protein interactions suggested that HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 are common factors associating with HEV RNA promoters and polymerase (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> validated the interactions between HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 with that of HEV promoters and RdRp. In order to confirm the interaction of RdRp with host proteins, coimmunoprecipitation technique was employed. HEV RdRp encoding sequence and the coding sequence of selected host protein were cloned in pTandem vector. pTandem vector was chosen for its additional feature which enables cloning of two different genes in the same construct to increase the co-transfection efficiency. Huh7 S10-3 cells transfected with pTandem_Flag-RdRp_Myc-HNRNPK or pTandem_Flag-RdRp_Myc-HNRNPA2B1 plasmids. Post 48 h of transfection co-immunoprecipitation was performed by using anti myc antibody or isotype IgG antibody. After co-immunoprecipitation, interaction of host factors with RdRp was confirmed by western blot using anti FLAG antibody. We observed that both HNRNPK and HNRPA2B1 specific immunoprecipitation could pull down HEV RdRp (
