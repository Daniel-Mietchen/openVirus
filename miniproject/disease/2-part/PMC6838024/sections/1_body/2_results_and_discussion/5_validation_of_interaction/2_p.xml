<p>To further confirm the binding of HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 with HEV putative promoters; we employed RNA immunoprecipitation followed by RT PCR. Huh7 S10-3 cell lysate was incubated with G or Sg promoter RNA followed by pull down by anti-HNRNPK or anti-HNRNPA2B1 or isotype IgG antibody. From the eluted complexes, total RNA was isolated and presence of promoter region RNA sequence was checked by RT PCR. We observed that both HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 could successfully pull down HEV genomic and sub-genomic promoter RNA as evident by the specific band on agarose gel (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 with HEV RdRp and HEV promoters as obtained from the mass spectrometry data, further increasing the confidence level of the obtained interactions. Thus, we believe that HNRNPK and HNRNPA2B1 play crucial roles in HEV replication and their functional significance in the context of HEV replication can be further assessed. Taken as a whole, our study reveals the importance of host cellular machinery in HEV lifecycle regulation. Studying host pathways targeted by HEV can facilitate the hunt for putative anti-viral candidates for therapeutic purposes. In conclusion, our study shows that analyzing host-virus interactions through system biology approach can be beneficial in understanding the molecular regulation of viral lifecycle and can put forth set testable hypotheses for future experimental validation.
