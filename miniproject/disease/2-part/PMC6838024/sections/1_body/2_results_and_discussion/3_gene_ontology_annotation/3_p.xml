<p>We also observed enrichment of stress granule proteins (GO:1903608; 
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 3.3 × 10
 <sup>–2</sup>) in our data. Stress granules are dynamic structures that are formed when cellular translational rates decline after external stresses are applied to cells. Viral infection into the host cell has been shown to induce cytoplasmic stress granule formation in the host cells due to the upregulation of stress granule proteins, such as helicase DDX3X and DHX9 (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Pène et al., 2015</xref>). As stress granules regulate the cycle of mRNA turnover and gene expression, they happen to be another vital point for viruses to manipulate cellular systems. Stress granules have also been reported to play a role in promoting innate immune responses (
