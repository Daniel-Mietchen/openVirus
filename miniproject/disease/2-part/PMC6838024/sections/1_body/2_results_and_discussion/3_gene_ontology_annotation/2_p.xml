A vital characteristic of any virus-host interaction is the manipulation of cellular gene expression in order to establish favorable cellular conditions for efficient viral replication. Eukaryotic genes are highly regulated at post-transcriptional stages, such as splicing, export, regulation of translation, subcellular localization and mRNA turnover. Viruses have often been observed to target these RNA processing stages to hijack the host RNA metabolism which is evident from the enrichment of host RNA splicing and nucleic acid metabolism related protein in our data. Such enhancement could also hint at the reliance of HEV on host systems for the regulation of viral RNA translation, transcription, and stability within the host cell (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahlquist et al., 2003</xref>). We observed the highest number of proteins having nucleic acid-binding activity in our data, which further confirms the dependence of HEV on the host for viral RNA metabolism. We have incorporated the data of classification of proteins on the basis of protein class in the HEV-host interaction network using different color codes as indicated on the figure (
