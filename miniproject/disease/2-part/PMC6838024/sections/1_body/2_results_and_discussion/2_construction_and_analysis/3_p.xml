<p>We also used STRING database to generate the inter-protein interaction network from our data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>). This analysis gave us a more intense multidimensional network as, along with the experimentally determined interactions, those predicted from gene fusion; co-expression, homology, and text mining were also considered. The observed number of edges for the network (487) was significantly higher than the expected number of edges (132) for the given number of nodes (67), implying that there are more interactions than expected. The result suggested that the proteins in our data dispaly more interactions than expected for a random set of proteins. Such enrichment indicates that the proteins are at least partially biologically connected as a group, highlighting the significance of the HEV-host network reported in this study. This also indicates the probability of isolating HEV-specific protein complexes gathered at the HEV replication site.
