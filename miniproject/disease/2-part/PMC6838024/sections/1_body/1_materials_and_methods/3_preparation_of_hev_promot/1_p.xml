<p>Sequences coding for the putative genomic promoter (G promoter: nt 1 to 139 on positive sense RNA) and putative sub-genomic promoter (Sg promoter: nt 5051 to 5200 on positive sense RNA) of HEV genotype 1 were PCR amplified from pSK-HEV2 replicon. The primers for the amplification of template were designed with T7 promoter sequence in such a way that the RNA of anti-sense orientation is generated. Primers used for the amplification have been listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. PCR products were used as templates for the synthesis of RNAs bearing respective promoter sequences. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> RNA was synthesized by using MEGAscript kit (Ambion) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Biotinylated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs were prepared using 5 mM rATP, 5 mM rGTP, 5 mM rUTP, 4.5 mM rCTP, and 0.5 mM of biotin-14 CTP (Invitrogen) in the rNTP mix for the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction. For synthesizing non-biotinylated RNAs of respective regions, total 5 mM rCTP was added instead of biotin-14-CTP. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by purifying the RNA using phenol-chloroform precipitation method. Purified RNAs were visualized on 2% agarose gel.
