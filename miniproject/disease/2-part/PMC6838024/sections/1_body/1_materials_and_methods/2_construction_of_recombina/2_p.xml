<p>To confirm interaction of HEV RdRp with hnRNPK/hnRNPA2B1, FLAG tagged RdRp and c-Myc tagged hnRNPK or hnRNPA2B1 encoding sequence was cloned in pTandem vector (Clontech) under CMV promoter and IRES, respectively. The constructs have been designated as pTandem_FLAG-RdRp_Myc-hnRNPK or pTandem_FLAG-RdRp_Myc-hnRNPA2B1. Primers used for the cloning are mentioned in the
