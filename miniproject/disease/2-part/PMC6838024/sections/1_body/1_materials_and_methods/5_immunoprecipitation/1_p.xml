<p>pcDNA_FLAG-RdRp construct was transfected into Huh7 S10-3 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. After 48 h post transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL and protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein G dynabeads (30 μl; Invitrogen) were used for each immunoprecipitation experiment. Next, 4 μg of either rabbit anti FLAG antibody or a non-specific isotype IgG was incubated with washed dynabeads for 30 min at room temperature on a rotator. The cell lysate was incubated with antibody plus dynabeads complex for 2 h at 4°C on a rotator. Three washes with IP lysis buffer were given, followed by a final wash with PBS. Interacting proteins were eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer (50 Mm Tris–Cl pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS, and 0.1% Tween 20). Eluted proteins were loaded on 12% SDS PAGE followed by silver staining for visualization of protein bands using ProteoSilver staining kit (Sigma). Eluates from three independent immunoprecipitation experiments were pooled together and subjected to protein identification by mass spectrometry.</p>
