<p>Gene ontology “GO” analysis was carried out by using web-based tools like Panther (Gene Ontology Consortium’s web tool), Gprofiler, STRING, and Enricher. To analyze the enrichment of specific pathway, KEGG annotation database was used. Gene set and pathway enrichment analysis was validated by Fisher’s exact 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. To control false discovery rate (FDR) Benjamini and Hochberg multiple test correction was used; 
 <italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. The corrected 
 <italic>p</italic>-value for each GO term has been given in the section “Results.”
