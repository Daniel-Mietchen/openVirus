<p id="Par33">Titers of neutralizing antibodies targeting RSV-A2, RSV CL57, and RSV-B1 in serum were determined using a luciferase-based RSV VNA. Five thousand A549 human lung carcinoma cells (catalog number ATCC CCL-185, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were added to each well of 96-well white half-area plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) containing 2.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/well of RSV-A2, RSV A CL57, or RSV-B1 viral particles encoding a luciferase reporter gene (resulting in an MOI of 5), together with threefold serial dilutions of individual heat-inactivated cynomolgus macaque serum samples starting at a 1:32 dilution in 100 μl reaction volumes. After incubation for 20 h at 37 °C and 10% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, luciferase activity in lysed cells was measured using the Neo-Lite Luciferase Assay System (PerkinElmer, Groningen, Netherlands) on a BioTek Synergy Neo luminescence counter (BioTek). Fifty percent neutralization titers (IC50) were defined as the maximum serum dilution that neutralized 50% of luciferase activity. Each serum sample was analyzed in duplicate. Titers of neutralizing antibodies targeting clinical isolates of RSV A, A 11-050878, A 13-0000323, A 18-0011989 and RSV-B, B 11-052099, B 14-006938, B 17-058221 (kindly provided by Dr. F.E.J. Coenjaerts, UMC Utrecht) were determined by a microneutralization assay. In brief, serially diluted heat-inactivated sera were mixed with 10,000 plaque-forming units (pfu) of virus in 96-well black &amp; white flat bottom tissue culture plates and incubated for 1 h at RT. Subsequently 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> VERO cells (WHO 10–87; 880101, obtained from WHO) per well were added and plates were incubated for 90 h at 37 °C, 10% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The monolayers were washed and fixed with 80% cold acetone. RSV replication was determined by F protein expression with a biotin-conjugated anti-F monoclonal antibody (clone 133-1H, catalog number Mab8262B-5, Sigma-Aldrich) at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by Streptavidin-HRP (BD Pharmingen catalog number 5540667) at a dilution of 1:1000, and Lumiglo substrate. The luminescence signal was determined with the Biotek Synergy Neo luminescence counter (BioTek). VNA titers were calculated as the antibody concentration that caused a 50% reduction in luminescence, expressed as IC50 titers. Cell lines used in the neutralization assays were not additionally authenticated.
