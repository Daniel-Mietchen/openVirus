<p id="Par31">Total serum IgG targeting a type A central conserved domain G peptide (biotin-KQRQNKPPNKPNNDFHFEVFNFVPCSICSNNPTCWAICKRIPNKKPGKKTTTKPTKK sym-1705, Pepscan B.V., Lelystad, Netherlands) was assessed by ELISA. Fourfold serial dilutions of cynomolgus macaque serum samples in PBS with 1% FBS and 0.05% Tween20, starting at a 1:50 dilution were incubated for 1 h at RT in maxisorp ELISA plates (NUNC 439454, Thermo Fisher Scientific) that were first coated with avidin (400 ng/well in carbonate buffer), followed by coating with the biotinylated RSV-G peptide. Reaction volumes were 100 µl. After washing in PBS with 0.05% Tween20, bound RSV-G peptide specific IgG was detected by adding 100 µl of HRP-conjugated cross-reactive polyclonal mouse-α-human IgG Fcγ-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, catalog number 209-035-098) at a dilution of 1:3750. Conjugates were detected with OPD substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 492 nm absorbance readout (BioTek Powerwave 340, BioTek, Winooski, VT). Each serum sample was analyzed in duplicate. Endpoint titers were calculated as the reciprocal dilution at which the signal reached a threshold set at 1.5× the signal of naïve serum using linear interpolation.</p>
