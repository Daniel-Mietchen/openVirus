<p id="Par35">RSV-FA2-specific, IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2-secreting CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected in freshly isolated PBMCs or BAL cells using multiparametric ICS and polychromatic flow cytometry, based on methods optimized for NHP cells as described.

 </sup> In total, 1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMC, or 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> BAL cells were stimulated overnight (12 h) at 37 °C with 2 µg/ml of an RSV-FA2 peptide pool consisting of 15-mers overlapping by 11 amino acids in the presence of 1 µg/ml soluble, fluorochrome-linked anti-CD28 antibody (BD Biosciences, clone L293, catalog number 337181) and 1 µl/ml brefeldin A (BD GolgiPlug) in 200 µl final volume of RPMI-10. Cells were stimulated in sterile 96-well round-bottom plates (VWR, Radnor, PA) coated with cross-linked, purified anti-CD49d (BD Biosciences, clone 9F10) catalog number 556634). PBMC aliquots kept in RPMI-10 with anti-CD28 (unstimulated) or incubated with 2.5 µg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) served as a negative and positive control, respectively. To coat plates with cross-linked co-stimulatory anti-CD49d, sterile 96-well round-bottom, tissue culture-treated polystyrene plates (VWR, Radnor, PA) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200 µl of 2.5 µg/ml affinity purified antibody F(ab’)2 fragments of Goat-anti-Mouse IgG(H + L) (Beckman Coulter, Carlsbad, CA, catalog number IM1618) in D-PBS, washed twice with D-PBS, incubated with 200 µl of 10 µg/ml of unconjugated, co-stimulating antibody targeting CD49d (BD Biosciences, clone 9F10, catalog number 556634) in D-PBS for ≥1 h at 37 °C, and washed one final time with D-PBS.
