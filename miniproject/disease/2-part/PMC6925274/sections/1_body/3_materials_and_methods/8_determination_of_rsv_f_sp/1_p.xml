<p id="Par30">Total serum IgG targeting pre-F and post-F were assessed by an ELISA qualified and validated for human sera. Twofold serial dilutions of individual, heat-inactivated (60 min at 57 °C) cynomolgus macaque serum samples in PBS with 1% FBS and 0.2% Tween20, starting at a 1:64 dilution were incubated for 2 h at RT in white LIA high-binding ELISA plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) that were either directly coated with a soluble RSV-post-F protein (F33, Janssen Vaccines, Leiden, Netherlands

 </sup>) or first coated with streptavidin, followed by coating with biotinylated RSV-pre-F protein (SCTM, Janssen Vaccines, Leiden, NL, described in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>). Those two proteins differ by five amino acids, which are not located in antibody epitopes. Reaction volumes were 100 µl. After washing in PBS with 0.5% Tween20, bound RSV-F-specific IgG was detected by adding 100 µl of a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated, cross-reactive polyclonal mouse-α-human IgG Fcγ-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, catalog number 209-035-098) at a dilution of 1:3750. Conjugates were detected with a luminometric readout on a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy 4HT) with LumiGlo as a substrate. Inhibitory concentration 50 titers (IC50 titers) were determined using a 4-parameter logistic curve fit model using Gen5 software. Each serum sample was analyzed in duplicate. Pre-F-specific IgG in the lung was determined in crude BAL fluid using the ELISA conditions as described above, starting with BAL fluid diluted 1:1. Endpoint titers calculated as the reciprocal dilution at which the signal reached a threshold set at 3× standard deviation above the mean signal of samples collected at baseline. Titers were then normalized to the protein content of the individual BAL fluid samples as measured by OD280 and expressed as log10 endpoint titer per mg protein. Each BAL sample was analyzed in duplicate. Pre-F-specific IgA was measured in crude BAL fluid and nasal swab fluid as described above, using HRP-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-monkey IgA (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number SAB3700759-1MG, 1:5000 dilution) instead of anti-human IgG. Endpoint titers were calculated as described for IgG measurements, including normalization to the protein content in the BAL.
