<p id="Par39">All immunological parameters (i.e., ELISA, VNA, ELISPOT, ICS) were log-transformed. Vaccine regimens were compared using two-sided tests based on analysis-of-variance, or analysis-of-variance for potentially censored values (Tobit regression). A Tukey correction was applied to account for multiple testing. 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The correlation between assays was examined using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Since no formal lower limit of quantification was determined for ICS data, a stringent, exploratory statistical responder analysis was performed at week 14, to determine whether the antigen-specific T-cell responses after peptide stimulation differed significantly from background responses. Positive responses to RSV-F peptide stimulation within each functional T-cell population were determined per animal in comparison with the corresponding negative control, using a one-sided Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed in R 3.3.3.
