<p id="Par12">To evaluate whether the different vaccine regimens induced mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract, RSV-F-specific responses were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) material at eight time points throughout the study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). RSV-F-specific cytokine responses were determined on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in purified BAL cells by ICS. In contrast to the blood, all three regimens induced strong antigen-specific IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 CD8+ T-cell responses in the lung (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a–c</xref>), which were detectable 4 weeks post-prime. Responses increased considerably after boost administration (week 16) and remained detectable until week 86. CD4+ T-cell responses, which were ~10-fold higher than those determined in the blood, followed the same kinetics. No significant differences were detected in the group mean CD4 + responses after prime (week 4) or after boost (week 16) for any of the three measured cytokines (ANOVA for potentially censored values (Tobit analysis) with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons). Within the CD8+ T-cell subset, lower responses for all three measured cytokines were observed in the 26/26 group compared with the 26/35 group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007 for IFNγ, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0009 for TNFα, and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.031 for IL-2) and lower TNFα responses compared to the Mix/Mix group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0026) after boost (ANOVA for potentially censored values (Tobit analysis) with post hoc Tukey correction for multiple comparisons). A functional subset analysis performed on the peak boost response in the lung at week 16 revealed a high degree of polyfunctionality within the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell compartments. A particularly high degree of polyfunctionality was detected in the CD4+ T-cell compartment, with more than half of the antigen-specific cells expressing all three evaluated cytokines in most animals, and any combination of two of them in a sizable percentage of the remaining cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). The polyfunctional profiles of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were not statistically compared, but no obvious differences were detected between the three regimens. The antigen-specific CD8+ T cells showed a lower degree of tri-functionality compared with CD4+ T cells owing to lower expression of IL-2 as characteristic of an effector-type CD8+ T-cell response, but tri- and bi-functional T cells still constituted more than half of the antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response in more than half of the animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). The exploratory statistical responder analysis reflected the high peak responses in the lung at week 16, demonstrating that—as in blood—100% of the animals in the 26/35 group were statistical responders within the CD4+ and the CD8+ T-cell compartments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). High responder rates were also observed in the 26/26 and Mix/Mix groups.
