<p id="Par14">To assess whether the three regimens were able to induce vaccine-specific humoral immune responses in the respiratory mucosa, antibody responses specific for pre-F were measured by IgG and IgA ELISA in BAL fluid obtained at four time points after immunization. After prime, pre-F-specific IgG was detected in 9/15 animals across all groups (2/5 animals primed with Mix/Mix, 7/10 animals primed with Ad26, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Titers peaked 4 weeks after boost, when all animals developed positive responses. By week 68, responses contracted but titers persisted until the end of the observation period, with 9/15 animals showing positive responses at week 86. Similar kinetics were observed for pre-F-specific IgA, with positive responses observed in 6/15 animals after prime (two animals from each group, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), in all animals at peak response 4 weeks after boost and in 8/15 animals at week 86. Pre-F-specific IgA responses were also measured in nasal secretions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), where all animals showed responses by week 16 (4 weeks after boost). By week 86, 13/15 animals still had detectable pre-F IgA titers in nasal secretions (2/5 animals in the Mix/Mix group had non-detectable titers at that time point). In both mucosal compartments, RSV-F-specific IgG and/or IgA titers were in the same order of magnitude for all three regimens and followed similar kinetics.
