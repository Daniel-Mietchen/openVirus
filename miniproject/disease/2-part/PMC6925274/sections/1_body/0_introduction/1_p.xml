<p id="Par2">Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), recently reclassified as a member of the pneumovirus family,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup> causes annual recurrent epidemics of upper and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in people of all ages, with young infants and the elderly being particularly susceptible to severe disease in part owing to limitations in immune function compared with adults.
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup> With 64 million cases estimated annually, RSV is the leading cause of LRTI in children under the age of 5, causing approximately three million hospitalizations and up to 199,000 deaths worldwide, most of them in developing countries.

 </sup> Natural infection with RSV induces only short-lived and incomplete protection,

 </sup> allowing reinfection with RSV to cause considerable morbidity and mortality also in the elderly. Approximately 5.5% of adults over the age of 65 are infected with RSV annually, leading to pneumonia in 10–20% and death in 8% of those hospitalized owing to RSV.

 </sup> At present, no treatment for RSV infection is available and prophylaxis is limited to palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the RSV-F protein, which is licensed for prevention of severe LRTI in high-risk infants.

 </sup> However, high costs and the need for monthly administration limit its application.
