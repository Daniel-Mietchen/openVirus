<p id="Par4">Protective immunity against RSV infection appears to involve multiple arms of the immune system. An important role is attributed to serum-neutralizing antibodies against RSV envelope proteins, mostly the fusion (F) glycoprotein, which are inversely associated with the risk of reinfection,

 </sup> reduce the risk of RSV-associated illness,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,

 </sup> LRTIs,

 </sup> and hospitalizations in both children and elderly adults.
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> Recently, it was shown that these neutralizing antibodies are predominantly prefusion F-specific.
 <sup>

 </sup> Systemic T-cell responses to RSV may additionally contribute to protective immunity against RSV disease in infants and in the elderly, although their role is less unequivocal.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup> Mucosal IgA and IgG responses in the nose and lung may further act as a first barrier against RSV infection at the portal of viral entry.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup> In addition, abundance of RSV-specific tissue-resident memory T cells in the lung correlates with reduced symptoms and viral load, implying their capacity to protect against severe respiratory viral disease when humoral immunity is insufficient.

 </sup> Based on these observations, we hypothesize that a protective RSV vaccine needs to elicit RSV-specific immunity that is characterized by high levels of functional antibodies and a Th1-biased T-cell response that distributes systemically and to mucosal sites. Vaccines based on recombinant, replication-incompetent vectors derived from human Adenovirus serotypes with low pre-existing immunity on a population level, such as serotype 26 or 35 (Ad26, Ad35),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> potently induce humoral and cellular, Th1-biased immune responses against various encoded antigens in animal models
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> and in humans.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> In addition, Adenoviral vectors have a favorable safety profile in humans including infants,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> and can be readily manufactured in high quantities under GMP conditions,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup> making them an attractive platform for an RSV vaccine.
