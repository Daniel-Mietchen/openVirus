<p id="Par18">Although the magnitude and polyfunctional cytokine profile of T-cell responses elicited by RSV vaccines based on unadjuvanted soluble protein or DNA have been shown to be rather modest,

 </sup> heterologous prime-boost regimens including a mucosal or intramuscular Adenoviral vector prime or boost have proven to induce higher and more polyfunctional systemic RSV-F-specific T-cell responses also in the absence of an adjuvant.

 </sup> Confirming and extending these findings, all three regimens in this study induced measurable systemic and mucosal T-cell responses upon prime and potently expanded them upon boost vaccination, including the homologous regimens. Systemic responses largely consisted of CD4+ T cells, as previously observed in NHPs vaccinated with Ad35-based vaccine regimens,

 </sup> but contrasts with reports of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after vaccination of cynomolgus macaques with heterologous PanAd3 and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) regimens.

 </sup> In the lung, however, both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses were induced that strongly exceeded the peripheral response. Although being ~â€‰10-fold higher, the frequency of RSV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses in the lung correlated well with the systemic responses using the same assay, which may indicate a biological link between systemic and mucosal T-cell responses after Adenoviral vaccination. To our knowledge RSV-F-specific BAL responses in the same order of magnitude have so far not been described after intramuscular immunization but could only be generated using complex combinations of systemic and mucosal vaccination with heterologous vaccine modalities. BAL responses exceeding systemic responses were for example observed in NHPs receiving a DNA prime by intramuscular electroporation followed by a heterologous, intra-tonsillar Adenoviral boost

 </sup> or in mice receiving a PanAd3-based intramuscular or intranasal prime, followed by a heterologous, intramuscular boost with MVA.
