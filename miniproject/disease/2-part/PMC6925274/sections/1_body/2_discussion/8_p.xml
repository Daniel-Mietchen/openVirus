<p id="Par22">In summary, we conclude that the largely regimen-independent, boostable, durable, and respiratory tract-directed immunogenicity of Ad26 and Ad35 vectors expressing the prototype antigen RSV-FA2 in the NHP model demonstrates that Adenoviral vectors are a promising vaccine platform for the development of an RSV vaccine for use in infants and elderly, expected to safely induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses. The prototypic RSV-FA2 vaccines in this study have been assessed in two completed Ph1 studies in healthy adults (NCT02561871 and NCT02440035). Replacement of the prototypic wild-type FA2 antigen by a stabilized pre-F protein is expected to further enhance the magnitude and quality of the neutralizing antibody response induced by the Adenoviral vector platform, without changing systemic and mucosal responses. Therefore, ongoing clinical evaluation is focusing on optimized vectors expressing RSV-F in a stabilized pre-F conformation (studies NCT03334695, NCT03339713, NCT03303625, NCT02926430, NCT03606512, and NCT03502707).</p>
