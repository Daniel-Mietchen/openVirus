 </sup> Wild-type F protein is intrinsically prone to refold from the labile pre- into the more stable post-F conformation on viral surfaces and in solution.

 </sup> We therefore hypothesize that by expressing the wild-type F protein in cells after transduction, both the prefusion and postfusion conformations are expected to be presented on the surface of the vaccine-transduced cells, allowing the induction of prefusion F- and postfusion F-specific antibodies. We indeed observed that the vaccine regimens induced pre- and post-F-specific antibodies with similar kinetics, but with a bias towards post-F targeting responses immediately after each vaccination in most animals (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A–C</xref>), which could confirm this hypothesis. Alternatively, antibodies recognizing epitopes common between pre- and post-F, which are detected by both used assays, may be induced more quickly. Over time, the ratio of pre- to post-F-specific antibody titers balanced, indicating that the initially high post-F-specific antibody responses may have been easier to induce, yet more short-lived than pre-F-specific responses, perhaps owing to different dynamics of B cell populations. Affinity maturation processes, on the other hand, likely play a role in the comparatively late onset of the pre-F-specific and neutralizing antibody responses.
