<p id="Par21">The mechanisms of ERD have not been conclusively elucidated to date, but two aspects have been associated with vaccine-mediated ERD in preclinical models: a Th2-biased response and/or immune complex deposition and complement activation in the lung owing to the formation of poorly protective antibody responses with limited functional capability.

 </sup> The induction of Th2 cytokines was not assessed in the present study and animals were not exposed to an RSV challenge because adult cynomolgus macaques do not support productive infection with RSV.

 </sup> However, multiple findings indicate that the immune response induced by Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2 used in this study is qualitatively distinct to responses predisposing towards ERD upon viral infection. First, in cynomolgus macaques, CD4+ and CD8+ responses in the lung were characterized by secretion of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. In addition, binding and functional antibodies as measured by ELISA and virus neutralizing assay (VNA), respectively, developed with similar, rather stable kinetics, indicating that there was no loss of functionality in the presence of a persistent binding antibody response. Finally, both vectors used in this study previously showed a strong Th1-type immune response in mice and did not induce ERD in the cotton rat model.
