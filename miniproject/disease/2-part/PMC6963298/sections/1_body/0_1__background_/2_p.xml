<p>Collectively, these recent YF outbreaks have increased the level of concern about the disease and its potential to spread to non-endemic areas in Africa and Latin America and countries in Asia where YFV is absent [

 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Factors that may favor the spread of the disease and increase the likelihood of large urban outbreaks include more abundant vector populations over a wider geographic area [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], increasing urbanization, a highly mobile human population [

 <xref rid="B28-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], an increase in the NHP population [
