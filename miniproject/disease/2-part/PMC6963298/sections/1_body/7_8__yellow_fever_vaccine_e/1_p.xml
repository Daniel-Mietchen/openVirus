<p>While there were no randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials done to evaluate the efficacy or effectiveness of YF 17D vaccine prior to its use in humans, pre-clinical studies found that vaccination protected NHPs against a lethal challenge of YFV [

There is no evidence that vaccine effectiveness has played a role in the recent outbreaks as there is still only a single YFV serotype and while the lineages between South America and Africa continue to diverge, they are still very closely related [

Observations and reports from the field support its effectiveness including the prevention of laboratory-acquired YFV infections among vaccinated staff and the decline in YF incidence after vaccination campaigns with subsequent cases identified only among unvaccinated individuals [
