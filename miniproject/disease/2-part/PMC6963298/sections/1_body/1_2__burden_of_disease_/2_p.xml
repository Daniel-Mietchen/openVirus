<p>After being bitten by a YFV-infected mosquito, the incubation period is 2 to 9 days [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Most infected people develop subclinical infections or mild, self-limited clinically-apparent infections not requiring medical attention [
 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Classic YF has three stages. The first stage occurs while the patient is viremic and consists of nonspecific clinical features including fever, chills, generalized malaise, headache, red conjunctivae, photophobia, low back pain, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and epigastric and hepatic tenderness upon palpation. During this stage, patients are often leukopenic and have elevated serum transaminase levels, which may be predictive of ultimate disease severity [

 <xref rid="B40-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. After 3 to 4 days, patients enter a second 24 to 48-hour remission stage when they become afebrile and their symptoms lessen. Most patients remain afebrile and recover while about 12% (95% CI 5–26) develop severe disease and enter the third stage of illness [
 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. During the third stage, the fever returns, and patients develop nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, jaundice, oliguria, and hemorrhagic manifestations. Patients may develop metabolic acidosis and organ impairment involving the liver, pancreas, kidneys and cardiovascular system [
 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Neurologic complications may occur including seizures, encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and coma. The case fatality rate among patients with severe disease has been estimated to be 47% (95% CI 31–62)[
