<p>YFV is a neurotropic virus and while YF vaccine is attenuated, it is a live vaccine that replicates in the host and produces a brief viremia that has potential for neuroinvasion in a susceptible host. In addition, a recent study demonstrated that Schwann cells can support sustained replication of the 17D strain [
 <xref rid="B108-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Encephalitis and meningoencephalitis associated with 17D vaccine administration in infants was first recognized in 1952 and led to the contraindication against vaccination of infants &lt;6 months old [

Since then, vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (YEL-AND) has come to include not only neurologic disease due to direct viral invasion of the central nervous system (e.g., encephalitis and meningitis) but also autoimmune-mediated demyelination and neuropathy including Guillain-Barre´ syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, myelitis, and cranial neuropathies. YEL-AND typically occurs 2-56 days after the first YF vaccine dose is administered, and the disease is generally not fatal. YEL-AND tends to affect young infants, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. The incidence of YEL-AND is 2.2 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses among vaccine recipients ≥60 years old [

 <xref rid="B115-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. As a result, breastfeeding women should not receive YF vaccine except when exposure to YFV cannot be avoided or travel cannot be postponed to YF endemic or epidemic areas.
