<p>People living in or traveling to areas with risk for YFV transmission should avoid mosquito bites whenever possible [
 <xref rid="B69-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Those who get YF should avoid mosquito bites for five days after fever onset to avoid infecting naive mosquitoes that can then transmit YFV to others. Persons â‰¥9 months old living in or traveling to areas with risk for YFV transmission should be vaccinated unless they have a contraindication to vaccination with a live-attenuated vaccine.
