<p>Preventing YF outbreaks is challenging for public health authorities for several reasons. First, public health officials have no control over the largely inaccessible sylvatic mosquito species that lay eggs in tree holes and the NHP reservoir [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Instead, epizootics among NHPs are monitored as sentinel events to enable early detection of human cases [

 <italic>Aedes spp.</italic> mosquitoes have become more abundant and geographically dispersed in recent decades, in part due to ineffective and unsustainable vector control strategies [

 <xref rid="B73-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Despite limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of control strategies, novel mosquito modification methods combined with an updated integrated vector control program may be the most effective option to mitigate YFV transmission in urban areas [

 <xref rid="B75-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Third, the disease is largely sub-clinical, so outbreaks may go undetected until severe cases are identified by surveillance. This allows the outbreak to become widespread before interventions, like mass vaccination campaigns, are initiated. Last, while the current YF 17D vaccine is thought to be effective [
 <xref rid="B76-vaccines-07-00179" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], 80% of the population needs to be vaccinated in areas with risk for YFV transmission to prevent outbreaks. This level of coverage requires significant support and commitment to national vaccination programs and control strategies as well as the capacity to predict where YF outbreaks may occur and adapt strategies to expand coverage to emerging at-risk areas [
