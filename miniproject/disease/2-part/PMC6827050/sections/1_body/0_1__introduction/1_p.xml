<p>The major viral diseases affecting the European domestic rabbit (
 <italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>) are myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) and these have serious effects on the health and welfare of rabbits [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The economic perspective is often considerable as an entire rabbitry might be affected. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) includes myxomatosis and RHD on its list of notifiable diseases [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The etiological agents of both diseases can be transmitted between domestic and wild rabbits through the action of blood sucking/biting insects [
