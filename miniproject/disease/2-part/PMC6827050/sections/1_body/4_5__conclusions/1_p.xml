<p>In this retrospective study we assessed the relative occurrence of myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in domestic rabbits. To do this, we used a database containing information on 13,326 visits to 1714 farms, located in Spain. The study lasted from 1988 to 2018. Our data indicate two RHDV epidemics: 1988–1989 due to RHDV GI.1, and 2011-2013 due to RHDV GI.2. The data show that the GI.1 epidemics occurred during periods of lack of protection. In 1988–1989 there was no vaccine available. While the GI.2 epidemic occurred demonstrating a lack of cross protection of the GI.1 based vaccines. Agreeing to our observations, serosanguinous nasal discharge is not linked to RHD caused by RHDV GI.2. Analysis of annual and monthly relative prevalence of myxomatosis and mean relative incidence of RHD according to year and month suggest that these variables affect both diseases. Therefore, it may be inferred from our study that future breeders and adults should be systematically protected by vaccination, particularly before the periods when occurrence is higher. Both diseases remain prevalent; however, effective vaccination has produced a steady decline in myxomatosis and RHDV GI.1 and GI.2 on-farm detection. The maintenance of high hygienic standards will be required to continue and improve this control. However, further studies must be carried out to investigate the causes of sustained virus presence and vaccine breaks. </p>
