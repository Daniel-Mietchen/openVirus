<p>We based our on-farm diagnostic procedures of myxomatosis on clinical examination of live rabbits, and sometimes with dead animals. Differential diagnosis was necessary (1) in 2-week-old rabbits, (2) in cases of concurrent diseases such as dermatophytosis or rhinitis, (3) in peracute forms resulting in death, and (4) in rabbits previously vaccinated against myxomatosis. An atypical case of myxomatosis in a female can be seen in a video on our website:
