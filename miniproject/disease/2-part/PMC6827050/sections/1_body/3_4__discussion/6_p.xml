<p>Clinical myxomatosis was clearly endemic on several farms; we could not exclude the cases of unapparent carriers [
 <xref rid="B63-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], the epidemiological importance of which was difficult to determine, as in the case of RHD, according to [
 <xref rid="B64-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. For this reason, and despite seasonality, we recommend keeping future breeders and adult rabbits systematically protected by vaccination, as we have already suggested [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We do not recommend “heterologous” vaccines in pregnant does, in agreement with [
 <xref rid="B49-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We diagnosed fibromatosis on a number of occasions, in spontaneous cases in adults, as indicated in [
 <xref rid="B65-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] or compatible with vaccination in young rabbits under 25–28 days old [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Our interest also lies in concurrent diseases, such as digestive and respiratory diseases, previously studied by Marlier et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], taking into account the immune suppressing effect of MYXV [
 <xref rid="B67-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and their interactions. With regard to immunoprophylaxis, we wonder how so many cases of myxomatosis occur despite the high percentage of farms applying vaccination. Greater knowledge of the protection of breeding rabbits and application of boosters is a key challenge for the future. In addition, continuous progress must be made in biosecurity practices.
