<p>In reference to RHD, we do not know the causes of higher incidence during April–August. Perhaps this epidemiological result differs from the wild, due to climate and environmental variables affecting wild rabbits more intensively [

On 274 farms visited during 2010–2013, 95% of the does were vaccinated against GI.1; vaccine made with GI.2 virus was first used in Spain in July 2013 [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We observed outbreaks of RHD in different farms, and recurrently on same farms. Besides the susceptibility of the host, this could have been due to the persistence of the virus on the farm. Henning et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-animals-09-00780" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] observed that the virus remained infective for up to three months under field environment conditions. Another possibility was the presence of the viruses within the area around the farm; e.g., due to the existence of carrier micromammals [
