<p>In Thailand, several infectious agents such as protozoa (i.e., 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> and 
 <italic>Theileria</italic>) and bacteria (
 <italic>Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic>, for example) are carried by ticks. Viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Reoviridae, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Nairoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> were also reported (Cornet et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Ahantarig et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). We hypothesized that other tick-borne viruses (new or already known) are silently crossing the barrier and sporadically infect humans and/or domestic animals living in the vicinity of humans (as cattle or dogs for example) in specific ecosystems where populations are in close contact with ticks. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the ability of the strategy that consists in coupling HTS with serological screenings to identify which viruses are (and are not) able to cross the species barrier and infect new vertebrate hosts.
