<p>Although identifying novel zoonotic viruses is of great importance and a prerequisite to monitor silent viral emergences, it is of equal importance to determine, among the huge number of viruses composing the virome of vectors and reservoirs, which viruses are not able to cross the species because it could lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying viral emergence, and especially to understand why some viruses that are phylogenetically close to zoonotic viruses are not able to spill over. The strategy developed in this pilot study starting from the inventory of viral communities infecting a given vector by HTS to finally identify reactive antibodies possibly present in exposed vertebrate populations by luciferase immunoprecipitation is well-adapted to such considerations and could easily be transposable to other vectors/mammals interfaces.</p>
