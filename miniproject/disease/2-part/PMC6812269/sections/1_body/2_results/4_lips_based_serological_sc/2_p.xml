<p>For the tick/human interface, no significant difference was observed between exposed and non-exposed groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), and no serum exceeded the positivity threshold, except for WhTV2-Thailand chuvirus antigen, which presents a higher luciferase activity in the non-exposed group than in the exposed group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003), while none of the sera in the exposed nor non-exposed groups exceeded the positivity threshold. Similarly, none of the cattle sera presented a luciferase activity higher than the positivity threshold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), showing that no antibodies against one of the six viruses tested were detected in human and cattle sera. The maximal prevalence of sera reacting with at least one of the six viral constructs was estimated at 0.017% and 0.047% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) in humans and cattle, respectively, meaning that these infections of vertebrates, if they occur, are very rare.
