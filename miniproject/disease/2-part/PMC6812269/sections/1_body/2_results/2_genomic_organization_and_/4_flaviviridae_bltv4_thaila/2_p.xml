<p>Phylogenetic analyses performed on the RdRP region of representative sequences of 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> placed BLTV4-Thailand virus in a sister clade of the 
 <italic>Pestivirus</italic> genus that contains viruses only identified in invertebrates, as previously described (Sameroff et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Putatively forming the fifth genus of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, this group of viruses infecting arthropods placed at the root of the four recognized genera (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), supporting the hypothesis of Shi et al. that flaviviruses may originate from arthropods (Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Interestingly, with a highly supported node of 96, two subclades compose this putative genus: one restricted to the class of Insecta and the second, including BLTV4-Thailand virus, composed of viruses infecting all types of arthropods, ranging from Chelicerata to Myriapoda and Hexapoda, suggesting a possible more ancestral position of this virus in the evolution of flaviviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, inset) and a later divergence of insect-specific 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>-related viruses.
