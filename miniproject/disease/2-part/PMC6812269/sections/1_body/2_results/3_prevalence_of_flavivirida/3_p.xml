<p>Ticks harbor numerous EVEs within their genome (Katzourakis and Gifford, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Li C. X. et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), including several sequences phylogenetically related to viruses identified in the present study. Therefore, ticks positive either for LTPV-, BLTV4-, WhTV1-, WhTV2-, CpTV2-, and thogoto-Thailand viruses were individually screened for the presence of EVE using their corresponding DNA extract. No positive result was obtained, showing that the viruses identified by next generation sequencing are exogenous viruses (data not shown).
