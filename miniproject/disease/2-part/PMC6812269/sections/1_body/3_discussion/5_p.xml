<p>The prevalence of Thailand tick thogotovirus in 
 <italic>Rh. microplus</italic> ticks was inferior to 3%, suggesting that this virus possibly infects vertebrate hosts, according to Bouquet hypothesis linking prevalence of a given virus in ticks with its putative infectivity in vertebrates (Bouquet et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Indeed, thogotoviruses are zoonotic tick-borne viruses, among which Bourbon, Dhori, and Thogoto viruses are able to infect several mammals (cattle, sheep, donkeys, camels, and buffalos) including humans, causing for the latter from febrile illness to encephalitis (McCauley et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Apart from ticks, many arthropods were reported as alternative vectors, including mosquitoes [Batken and Sinu viruses (Frese et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Contreras-Guti√©rrez et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)] and biting midges (Temmam et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Several evidence of a possible role of rodents as amplifying hosts or reservoirs were reported (Ejiri et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Our survey shows that human and cattle infections were absent (or at most very rare), although this virus is phylogenetically close to known human pathogens. This finding raised the question of the mechanism of host restriction of tick-borne viruses (and more specifically of Thailand tick thogotovirus and other Oz-related tick-borne viruses) and more generally of the mechanisms that underlined the adaptation of tick-specific viruses to vertebrate-infecting tick-borne arboviruses (Li C. X. et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
