<p>Complete extracellular regions of viral glycoproteins and/or nucleoproteins were cloned into pFC32K vector (Promega, France), at the N-terminal end of the NanoLuc luciferase gene, using the Gibson Assembly (GA) kit (NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix, New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer's instructions. First, the Kosak sequence (GCCACC, in bold in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>) and the start codon (ATG, in italic in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>) were added by PCR in 5′ of the target fragment along with a 28- and a 27-nt vector region overlapping the sequence of the vector and containing the restrictions sites of the multiple cloning sites (underlined in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>, SgfI and EcoICRI, respectively, for forward and reverse primers). Great attention was paid to maintain the reading frame between the target fragment and the NanoLuc gene. Then, PCR products were gel purified with the Nucleospin Gel and PCR cleanup kit (Macherey-Nagel) and quantified by Qubit with the ds DNA High Sensitivity kit (Invitrogen).
