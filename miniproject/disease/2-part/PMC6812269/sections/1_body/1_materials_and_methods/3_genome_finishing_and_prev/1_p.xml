<p>The complete ORFs were obtained by conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing after designing specific primers targeting the identified viruses. Briefly, viral RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA), and cDNA was subsequently used to fill the gaps in the genomes using the Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, France). Positive PCR products were further purified and sequenced by Sanger sequencing on the Eurofins Segenic Cochin platform. When start and stop codons were lacking, rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR were performed using the 5′/3′ RACE kit, second generation (Roche Applied Science, Germany).</p>
