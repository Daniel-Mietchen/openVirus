  <p>Luciferase activity (in LU/ml) distribution of measures after luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) performed in 
   <bold>(A)</bold> tick/human interface and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> tick/cattle interface. In white: human and cattle populations exposed to tick bites; in gray: non-exposed human populations. Positivity threshold is indicated for each antigen construct. 
   <italic>t</italic>-test statistical analysis (Î± = 0.05) was used to compare the mean LU/ml measure of both exposed and non-exposed human groups.
