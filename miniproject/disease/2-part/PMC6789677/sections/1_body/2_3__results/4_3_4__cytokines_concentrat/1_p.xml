<p>The concentrations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the lungs of infected mice were quantified using ELISA. After H1N1 infection, significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 were observed in the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 as compared to the control group, but no obvious difference was observed in the level of IL-6 (
