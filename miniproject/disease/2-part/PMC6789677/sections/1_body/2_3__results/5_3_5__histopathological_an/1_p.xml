<p>At day five post-infection with H1N1 or H3N2, the lungs of the mice were harvested, fixed, sectioned, and stained with H and E. The degree of lung inflammation was scored based on the severity of bronchiolitis, edema, and interstitial inflammation. Infections by different strains of IAV resulted in varying magnitudes of lung inflammation. The mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 experienced mild bronchiolitis, edema, and interstitial inflammation when challenged with H1N1 (
