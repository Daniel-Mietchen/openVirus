 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which had one to three copies of M2e peptides fused to the viral capsid protein, were demonstrated to have a better protective efficacy in proportion to the copy numbers of M2e peptide. We previously fused copies of M2e fragments to the C-terminal end of 
 <italic>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</italic> nodavirus capsid protein (NvC), producing a chimeric protein (NvC-M2ex3) which self-assembles into VLPs (see Figure 2 in Yong et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). A subsequent immunization study demonstrated that NvC-M2ex3 induced strong M2e-specific antibody responses in the presence of the Freundâ€™s adjuvant [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this article, we report the protective efficacy and immune responses induced by NvC-M2ex3 without an adjuvant, in BALB/c mice against H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) and H3N2 (A/HK/8/68) challenges. H3N2 and H1N1 were used in this study because they are the most common IAV subtypes that emerge during annual flu seasons. Our results showed that the NvC-M2ex3 was highly immunogenic even in the absence of adjuvants. Higher anti-M2e antibody titers corresponded well with increased survival, reduced immunopathology and morbidity of the infected BALB/c mice. Following infection, the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 exhibited lower viral RNA copy numbers in the respiratory tract, suggesting limited viral replication. Moreover, different antiviral cytokines were activated in the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 and challenged with H1N1 and H3N2. Collectively, these results demonstrated that NvC-M2ex3 could be a potential universal influenza A vaccine.
