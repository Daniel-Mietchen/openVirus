<p>Influenza virus is transmitted primarily via close contact, aerosols, or droplets [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A hospitalized patient with severe IAV infection can shed a detectable and infectious amount of virus for a longer period of time [
 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In general, detection of influenza viral RNA in the respiratory airway indicates the viral infection, and a high viral load in the upper respiratory airway is associated with an increased risk of transmission, which often correlates with the severity of the disease [
 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-07-00091" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the present study, the mice immunized with NvC-M2ex3 experienced mitigated morbidity and a reduced viral RNA copy number in their oropharynges compared to the control groups after being challenged with H1N1 or H3N2, suggesting the suppression of viral shedding.
