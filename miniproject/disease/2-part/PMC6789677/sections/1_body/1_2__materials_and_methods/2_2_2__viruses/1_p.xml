<p>The virus strains, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1; ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> VR-95™) and A/HK/8/68 (H3N2; ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> VR-544™), were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The mouse-adapted viruses were generated via serial lung passages in BALB/c mice. In brief, a virus stock (50 µL) containing H1N1 or H3N2 was inoculated intranasally into the nostril of lightly anaesthetized mice. Three days later, the mice were euthanized, and their lungs were harvested, homogenized, and clarified. Lung supernatants containing IAV were used for the following passage. H1N1 and H3N2 were adapted to BALB/c mice following a total of 8 and 20 passages, respectively. All procedures involving H1N1 or H3N2 were carried out in the BSL-2 laboratory.
