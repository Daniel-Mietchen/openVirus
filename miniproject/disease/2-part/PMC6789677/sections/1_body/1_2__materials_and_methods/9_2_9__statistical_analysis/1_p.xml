<p>The differences in immunogenicity, weight loss, and morbidity scores among animal groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Duncan’s multiple range test. Variations between different treatment groups with respect to viral RNA copy numbers, cytokine levels, and lung inflammatory scores were analyzed using the independent Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. The Kaplan–Meier method was used for the survival analysis using the log-rank test. A 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of lower than 0.05 is considered significant, lower than 0.01 is considered very significant, lower than 0.001 is considered highly significant, and lower than 0.0001 is considered extremely significant.
