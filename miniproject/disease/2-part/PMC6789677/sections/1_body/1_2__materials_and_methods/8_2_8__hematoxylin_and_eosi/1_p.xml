Parameters used in scoring the total lung inflammation were bronchiolitis, edema, and interstitial inflammation. The severity of each parameter was scored in a blinded manner on a scale of 0 to 4, in which 0 indicates absent, and 1 to 4 indicate increasing severity. The sum of the score of each parameter is the total lung inflammation score and the maximum score is 12 [
