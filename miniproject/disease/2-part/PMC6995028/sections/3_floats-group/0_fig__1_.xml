  <p>Systemic H84T is very well tolerated in mice. BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with two 50-mg/kg doses of WT, H84T, or D133G BanLec administered 1 mo apart (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10 per group). Injection site lesions (
   <italic>A</italic>) and appearances (
   <italic>B</italic>) were scored, and weight measured (
   <italic>C</italic>) for all mice for 59 d postinjection. In 
   <italic>C</italic>, the data represent the mean for all mice in each group and error bars the SEM.
