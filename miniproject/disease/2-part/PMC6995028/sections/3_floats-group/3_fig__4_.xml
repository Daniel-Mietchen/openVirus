  <p>H84T prevents influenza virus protein expression in MDCK cells. MDCK cells were pretreated for 1 h with H84T (0.1, 1, or 10 μM in 
   <italic>A</italic>; 0.05, 0.1, or 1 μM in 
   <italic>C</italic>), 10 μM D133G, or 40 μM of the fusion inhibitor ARB and infected with A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) (
   <italic>A</italic>) or A/Colorado/15/2014 (H3N2) (
   <italic>C</italic>) (MOI = 0.5) for 5 h at 37 °C. (
   <italic>A</italic> and 
   <italic>C</italic>) Representative immunofluorescent micrographs of influenza A antigen staining (green) and nuclei (blue) 5 h postinfection. Data for 
   <italic>A</italic> and 
   <italic>C</italic> are representative of three and four independent experiments, respectively. Scale bars indicate 100 μm. (
