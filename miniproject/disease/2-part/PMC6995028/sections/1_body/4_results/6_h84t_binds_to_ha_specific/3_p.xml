<p>HA mediates both early and late stages of the virus life cycle, including attachment and entry, fusion, and assembly, whereas NA, another potential target for H84T, primarily mediates late stages, including assembly and budding (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). To understand whether H84T exerts its primary inhibitory effect against influenza virus replication early or late in the influenza virus life cycle, we assessed whether viral protein expression was reduced by H84T. Arbidol (ARB), a viral fusion inhibitor that locks HA in a nonfusogenic conformation (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), was used as a positive control for inhibition of early-stage infection. A dose-dependent reduction in viral protein expression was observed at 5 h postinfection (hpi) with A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) (

 </xref>), suggesting that H84T inhibits a step at or before viral protein translation. Inhibition was dependent on carbohydrate binding, as D133G did not block viral protein expression. H84T also inhibited a step at or before protein translation 5 hpi with a virus pseudotyped with the HA and NA of A/Colorado/15/2014 (H3N2), a strain representative of the 3C.2a clade of H3N2 viruses that encompassed the majority of the ∼69% of clinical influenza infections caused by H3N2 strains in the 2017 to 2018 season, for which vaccine effectiveness was only ∼25% (

 </xref>). To ensure that the decrease in viral protein expression observed could not be attributed to toxicity, we measured cytotoxicity of H84T on MDCK cells. At 24 h posttreatment, there was no decrease in cell viability at the EC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration for H1N1 virus (∼32 to 130 nM), and minimal decreases above it, suggesting that cytotoxicity could not account for the observed decrease in viral protein expression (
