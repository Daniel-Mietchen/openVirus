<p>We previously reported that intranasal administration of H84T protects mice against otherwise lethal H1N1 influenza virus infection (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). To assess whether H84T is also efficacious against another influenza virus strain in vivo, we inoculated C57BL/6J mice via aerosol with a lethal dose of A/Hong Kong/8/1968 (H3N2) influenza virus and treated them with 0.1 mg/kg of H84T intranasally once daily for 5 d beginning 4 h postinfection (

Greater than 80% of H84T-treated mice survived otherwise lethal influenza virus infection, as compared to &lt;10% of placebo-treated animals, extending the results of our previous study and indicating that H84T has robust activity against the two major contemporary subtypes of influenza A in vivo.
