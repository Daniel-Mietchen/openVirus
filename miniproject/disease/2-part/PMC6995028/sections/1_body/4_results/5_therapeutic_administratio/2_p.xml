<p>H84T confers robust antiinfluenza protection when delivered intraperitoneally, but in a clinical setting intravenous administration, which is analogous to intraperitoneal administration, of H84T would likely be limited to hospitalized patients. On the other hand, subcutaneous administration of H84T, if efficacious, would provide the important advantage of being feasible in the outpatient setting. We therefore examined whether subcutaneous administration of H84T conferred protection against lethal influenza virus infection in mice (

H84T provided 100% protection from challenge when administered in a two-dose regimen at 4 h preinfection and 4 d postinfection, as compared to &lt;10% survival in the placebo-treated group. In addition, two doses of H84T provided 60% protection when administered at 24 h and 96 h (4 d) postinfection, and a single dose at 24, 48, or 72 h provided 50% protection. Oseltamivir, used as the positive control, protected 70% of mice when administered twice daily for 5 d starting 48 h postinfection. Thus, it appears that subcutaneous administration of H84T holds therapeutic promise as well.
