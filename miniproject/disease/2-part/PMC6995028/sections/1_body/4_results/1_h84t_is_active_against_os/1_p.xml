<p>Our previous work demonstrates that H84T has robust activity against diverse influenza viruses in vitro, including A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/New York/18/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), A/Duck/MN/1525/1981 (H5N1), and the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain, with half-maximum effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 1 to 4 μg/mL (∼32 to 130 nM) versus H1N1 virus, 0.06 to 0.1 μg/mL (∼2 to 3 nM) versus H3N2 virus, and 5 to 11 μg/mL (∼160 to 350 nM) versus H5N1 virus (

Antiinfluenza activity is dependent on carbohydrate binding, as the D133G BanLec mutant lacking carbohydrate-binding activity has no antiinfluenza activity. Because influenza strains resistant to the standard-of-care therapy, oseltamivir, do circulate in certain years (
