<p>Given that H84T is highly efficacious against influenza infection in vitro and in vivo via intranasal administration, we sought to further characterize its safety and efficacy in vivo when administered systemically. In BALB/c mice, we found that intraperitoneal administration of WT BanLec in two 50-mg/kg doses 1 mo apart resulted in prolonged injection site lesions, characterized as erythematous papules up to a centimeter in size, in 60% of the mice lasting for up to 23 d postinjection (

 </xref>). These findings support in vivo the in vitro finding that WT BanLec is mitogenic and give a stark description of how mitogenicity manifests in vivo. In clear contrast, intraperitoneal administration of H84T was very well tolerated, resulting in no injection site lesions, no piloerection of back hair, and no weight loss upon administration of either dose, similar to administration of D133G BanLec, which in vitro lacks both mitogenicity and antiviral activity due to a mutation in the carbohydrate-binding site and so was not expected to elicit an inflammatory reaction. Thus, H84T appears to be nonmitogenic both in vitro and in vivo, in contrast to WT BanLec, which is poorly tolerated in mice, consistent with its mitogenicity in vitro.
