<p>We have previously demonstrated that mitogenicity can be removed from a banana lectin (BanLec), while maintaining broad-spectrum antiviral activity, by engineering a single amino acid mutation at position 84 from histidine to threonine (H84T BanLec, H84T) (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). H84T is highly efficacious against pandemic, epidemic, and avian influenza in vitro and against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo when administered intranasally, yet its safety and efficacy via other clinically important routes of administration remain to be determined. In addition, although H84T is known to bind high-mannose type 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans, these glycans are abundantly present on both HA and NA (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and thus it is not clear whether HA or NA is the key viral component antagonized by H84T. We therefore set out to determine the efficacy of systemically and subcutaneously delivered H84T, as well as the mechanism of action of H84T. Here, we report that in a lethal mouse model, H84T is indeed nonmitogenic as predicted by the in vitro data, and both early and delayed therapeutic administration of H84T intraperitoneally are highly protective, as is H84T administered subcutaneously. Mechanistically, attachment is only somewhat inhibited by H84T, incommensurate with the overall inhibitory effect of H84T, which was unexpected based on our observation that wild-type (WT) BanLec inhibits HIV attachment to cells. Instead, H84T, which can bind to HA, is internalized into the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment and inhibits the HA-mediated step of fusion with the endosome. Taken together, these studies reveal that H84T is efficacious against influenza virus in vivo, even when given up to 72 h after challenge, and that it inhibits virusâ€“endosome fusion, underscoring its potential use as a new broad-spectrum antiinfluenza agent with a mechanism of action that is quite distinct from that of the currently available inhibitors.
