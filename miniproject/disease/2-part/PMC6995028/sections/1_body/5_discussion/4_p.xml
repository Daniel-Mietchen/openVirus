<p>Our work indicates that H84T binds to HA specifically, as binding to baculovirus-derived HA can be inhibited by a known ligand of BanLec but not by a noninteracting monosaccharide and as carbohydrate digestion by PNGase F reduces binding to virus-derived HA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that H84T functions as an antiinfluenza agent primarily via fusion inhibition. Carbohydrate binding is essential for both binding and fusion inhibition, as the carbohydrate binding site mutant D133G does not bind as efficiently and is not inhibitory to fusion. A key question to address was where HA might be bound by H84T, as both its head (HA1) and stalk (HA2) regions are glycosylated with high-mannose type 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), among other glycans, which are ligands for H84T. Neutralizing antibodies that function as fusion inhibitors typically bind the stalk of HA (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), which contains the fusion peptide and other components necessary for fusion (
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, work by others indicates that an inhibitor that binds to the head of HA can target fusion (
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) and it is known that the antiinfluenza lectin cyanovirin-N binds HA1 (
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), so it was not wholly unexpected that H84T would bind HA1. A potential limitation of H84T is that it may require that its target be glycosylated and pandemic strains are sometimes less heavily glycosylated than seasonal strains, but some glycosylation is virtually always present, even in pandemic strains (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Interestingly, the number of glycosites that a certain strain possesses seems to correlate with the EC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of H84T against that strain. Contemporary H3 viruses have more glycosites than contemporary H1 viruses (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and H84T has a lower EC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration against the former strains, which correlates with the higher amount of methyl α-
 <sc>d</sc>-mannopyranoside needed to compete for binding to H3 versus H1 HA. In addition, the amount of binding to strains as determined by lectin blot generally correlated with the EC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of H84T against those strains, with the most binding to the H3N2 strain, followed by binding to influenza B, then the H1N1 strain. Of course, multiple other strains of each subtype would need to be evaluated to further clarify this issue. It is presently not possible to assess whether binding of H84T correlates with the number of high-mannose 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans in particular on certain HA molecules, as the number of high-mannose glycans on specific HAs cannot be predicted by the sequence of the protein and has to be empirically determined (
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), but overall it appears that binding to HA by H84T correlates with the number of glycans on HA.
