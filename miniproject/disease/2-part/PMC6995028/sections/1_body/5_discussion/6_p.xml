<p>Our data demonstrate that H84T BanLec has potential as a new antiviral against influenza viruses. It is very well tolerated and nonmitogenic in vivo and is highly efficacious against otherwise lethal influenza virus infection via three distinct routes of administration, even when treatment is delayed. H84T is highly broad-spectrum in that it inhibits replication of all oseltamivir-resistant and -sensitive strains and all influenza A and B strains tested, highlighting its promise as an empiric drug for influenza illness, which will be critically needed in the event of a new pandemic influenza virus or increasing resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. H84T is broad-spectrum not only in its antiinfluenza activity, but also in the sense that it inhibits HIV and hepatitis C virus as reported previously (

 <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), among other viruses. The present study, along with our previous work, underscores the value of engineering antiviral lectins to be nonmitogenic and safe in vivo, as H84T and perhaps eventually other similarly engineered lectins could be leveraged as a therapeutic arsenal against a diverse array of viruses.
