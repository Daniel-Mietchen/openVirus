<p>Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice (Taconic) were anesthetized with isoflurane then injected intraperitoneally with either 50 mg/kg V66D/H84T/A100D BanLec, a variant of H84T engineered to increase solubility for biochemical assays, or with PBS (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). Twenty-one days later, mice received a second injection of either BanLec or PBS as before. Mice were euthanized 2 d after the second administration by the University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine. Mouse sera were collected and stored frozen prior to use for detection of anti-BanLec antibodies by ELISA (see ELISA in
