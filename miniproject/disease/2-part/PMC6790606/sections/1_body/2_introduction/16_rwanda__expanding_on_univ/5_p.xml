<p>Major ongoing barriers to addressing viral hepatitis in Rwanda include the lower awareness of, and priority given to, viral hepatitis compared to other infectious diseases (eg malaria and HIV) and the competing priorities for limited public‚Äêsector health funding. A prior strategy (from 2011) that failed and has since been abandoned was to develop local viral hepatitis treatment guidelines based upon international consensus guidelines, without sufficient attention to the resources required for implementation (including particularly laboratory testing and availability of medications) or the skills and experience required of clinicians. These guidelines thus lacked local contextualisation and recommended unavailable or unaffordable management; consequently, they were impractical and did not influence daily clinical practice greatly.</p>
