<p>To ascertain feasibility and ensure financing for sustainability, a national operational plan was developed to demonstrate priority‐setting of key activities and provide costing estimates for different levels of coverage of screening, diagnosis, and treatment of both hepatitis B and C.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">88</xref> Several initiatives were used to secure funding, including support from international donors, in particular the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Rwanda has a voluntary licensing agreement for DAAs and is therefore able to produce medication at reduced cost (approx. US$ 560 in 2017).

 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">88</xref> Rwanda's Essential Medicines List includes generic hepatitis B medicines treatment; this is subsidised by government for people with HIV coinfection. All major private health insurance companies (as well as military medical insurance) reimburse for the cost of DAAs, and the Rwanda social security board covers 85% of the cost. Ultimately, the aim is to provide reimbursement for hepatitis C diagnostics and treatment by the community‐based health insurance scheme.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">88</xref> As of June 2017, 2500 patients had been treated with DAAs and treatment for 9000 additional patients had been procured (Figure
