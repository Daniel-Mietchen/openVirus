<p>Of concern in Australia is the continuing drop off in the number of patients undergoing screening and confirmatory testing and treatment since March 2016.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">93</xref> While treatment numbers have been sufficient to maintain the elimination targets, further decline could put the elimination effort at risk. The decline in treatment numbers demonstrates that universal availability of DAA treatment alone is not enough to improve access to diagnosis and retention in care. Continued political commitment and policy and health system interventions are needed to facilitate treatment access for key populations to sustain momentum and overcome ongoing programme challenges to treatment scale‚Äêup.
