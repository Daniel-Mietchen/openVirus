<p>The implementation of the national action plan increased access to hepatitis C testing and linkage to care while driving improvements in monitoring and surveillance, infection control and prevention.

 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> The evaluation of harm reduction‐based peer‐supported hepatitis C treatment demonstrated excellent treatment uptake and retention in care among PWID based in Tbilisi.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> By January 2019, 53 000 people had initiated treatment with the new DAAs, of whom almost 34 800 had already achieved hepatitis C cure (Figure 
 <xref rid="liv14222-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Remaining challenges relate to the marginalised status of PWID, with stigma and discrimination preventing PWID from accessing hepatitis C services. Punitive drug laws (such as criminal responsibility for personal drug use) challenge the effectiveness of harm reduction programmes and lead to high rates of incarceration and hepatitis C transmission in prisons, where access to OST is limited. As well, as in other countries aiming for hepatitis C elimination, treatment numbers declined after the first two years of the programme, with many people being unaware of their hepatitis C status or not commencing treatment.
