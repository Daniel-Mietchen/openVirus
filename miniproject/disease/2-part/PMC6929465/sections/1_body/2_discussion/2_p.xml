<p id="Par55">Despite the limitations of the datasets due to the ways in handling missing MLD50, partial sequences and incomplete genomes, and also a recent critic of using LD50 as a virulence measure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the models learned from the datasets could provide insights about IAV virulence across mouse and virus strains. Rule-based models were chosen since their output can be easily interpreted and are congruent with the current practice in investigating IAV virulence experimentally. Three rule-based learning approaches were employed: OneR, JRip and PART. OneR approach outputs a single site model that gives the highest accuracy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; JRip and PART considers multiple sites and they construct a set of decision rules using different strategy. While JRip mainly uses separate-and-conquer algorithms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], PART combines separate-and-conquer strategy and partial decision trees [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For a comparison in the performance, we also explored the RF approach [
