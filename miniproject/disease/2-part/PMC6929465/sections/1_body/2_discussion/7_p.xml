<p id="Par60">Overall, PART, with its approach that combines separate-and-conquer strategy and partial decision tree, has been a suitable method to generate sequence-based virulence models that are not only considerably good in performance, but also provides interpretable information. But here, rather than relying on a single model developed from a single training dataset, the information was extracted from 100 models learned independently from different training datasets. While bias due to imbalanced classes were resolved by under-sampling to obtain balanced classes, the iterations might help reducing bias due to over-sampling of a particular mouse or IAV strain. Furthermore, we also noted from the confusion matrix that PART models tended to misclassify the avirulent (or less virulent) strains as virulent (or more virulent) ones rather than misclassify the virulent (more virulent) strains as avirulent (or less virulent) ones. In practice, this is preferred since classifying the virulent strains as avirulent ones is a worse decision that can cost lives. Moreover, we also investigated the effect of increasing the training size for learning PART models (data not shown). Using the two-class and three-class IV datasets containing the concatenated protein alignments, the mean accuracy of PART models based on the training size of 80% or 90% of the total records was about 2–3% higher than the mean accuracy of PART models based on the training size of 60%, but it came at the cost of higher standard deviation (about 1.3–3.3% higher) and average number of rules (3–6 rules more for two-class and 12–20 rules more for three-class; in other words, more complex models). Increasing the training size up to 99% of the total records led not only to much higher variance, but also a drop in the mean accuracy. Thus, with additional consideration that there were high overlaps between top sites from PART models trained on 80% or 90% datasets and top sites trained on 60% datasets, and we observed that the top sites for models trained on 80 and 90% datasets were still dominated by sites in PB2, presenting results from models trained on 60% of datasets is justifiable.</p>
