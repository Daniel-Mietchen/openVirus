<p id="Par54">In this influenza study, we systematically and extensively searched literature, collected infection records involving specific mouse and IAV strains, noted their virulence, classified the virulence level, and obtained related IAV proteins in order to develop predictive virulence models of IAV infections. Furthermore, we proposed a number of procedures to tackle various missing data. For virulence, the MLD50 value is the ultimate information we looked for; but in its absence, weight loss and/or survival data of infected mice were utilized to infer the lower or upper bound of MLD50 and subsequently, to label the virulence class. For IAV genomes, when the genomes were incomplete or contained partial sequences, extrapolation was performed using the closest genome relative identified with BLAST. These pre-processing works were done manually and ambiguity occasionally occurred. Hence, caution must be taken when dealing with the datasets and improvement in the pre-processing approach may be considered for future works. Alternatively, efforts in improving the current practice of storing IAV virulence information by research community such that it eases its reusability ought to be encouraged, e.g., by creating an online database that accepts submissions of IAV virulence related data and is able to generate high quality tables or figures of the input data (which then can be added into related manuscript).</p>
