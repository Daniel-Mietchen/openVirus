<p id="Par57">Further inspection on PART models across different IAV strains using IV dataset revealed that although HA had many more sites correlated with virulence, PB2 seemed to play more important role in determining IAV virulence. This was in agreement with the RF’s site importance ranking. In terms of their accuracy, PART models based on PB2 alone were usually as good as or even better than PART models based on HA; except when modelling the virulence of two-class H1N1, PART models based on HA were more superior (see (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2)). Moreover, PART models based on the concatenated IAV protein alignments had a high preference towards sites in PB2, and many sites in PB2 were also considered as the most important features for RF models (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> that shows synergistic graphs for the two-class and three-class virulence models further clearly demonstrate this. Investigations on MIV dataset and datasets for specific IAV or mouse strain also revealed the dominance of PB2 in most of the cases (data not shown). When sites in PB2 did not dominate, the sites in HA dominated, such as in the case for the two-class H1N1 dataset.
