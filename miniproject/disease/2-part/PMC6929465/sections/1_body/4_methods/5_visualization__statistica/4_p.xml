<p id="Par93">Following 100 independent learnings from the two-class and three-class IV datasets, the protein sites from models learned using each algorithm were ranked. For OneR, the sites were ranked according to their frequency of being selected for the models; for JRip and PART, the sites were ranked according to their average contribution to the accuracy of learned models; and for RF, the sites were ranked according to their contribution to the average mean decrease in accuracy. For PART models, we also ranked the site pairs according to their average contribution to the accuracy of learned models and visualized the synergistic graph arises from the top 50 site pairs using igraph package version 1.2.2 [
