<p id="Par87">This procedure selected a record that had the more or most virulent information among the records, except when only the lower bound of MLD50 values was available; or alternatively, with the majority class if it could be determined. Note that when applying this procedure, the recombinants of naturally occurring or wild-type IAV strains were considered representing the wild-type version. In a similar fashion, we applied this procedure to reduce multiple records of infections of a specific IAV strain in different mouse strains into a single record (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S3).
