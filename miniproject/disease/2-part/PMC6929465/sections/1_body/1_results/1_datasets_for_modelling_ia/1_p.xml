<p id="Par42">The steps in creating benchmark datasets for modeling IAV virulence is summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Initially, a dataset containing 637 records of IAV infections in mice – of which the full or incomplete genomes of the IAVs could be retrieved from public sequence databases and the virulence class of the infection could be identified - was created according to information available in 84 journal publications (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S1). Of those records, 502 records have their MLD50 provided in the literature. Following RULE 6 (see 
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), multiple records involving specific IAV and mouse strain were reduced into a single record (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S2). This produced a new dataset containing 555 records and named as the Mouse-IAV Virulence (MIVir) dataset. Using the same rule, the MIVir dataset was further reduced to a dataset containing 489 records of IAV virulence across different mouse strains and named as the IAV Virulence (IVir) dataset (Additional file
