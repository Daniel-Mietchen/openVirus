<p id="Par39">Many aspects of IAV and the disease it causes have been investigated in mice since the animals are not only cost-effective and easy to handle, but also available in various inbred, transgenic, and knockout strains. Moreover, the genomes of various inbred mice have been recently available. Mice have also allowed us to uncover host and viral molecular determinants of IAV virulence. Early outcome of IAV study in mice was the revelation of the protective role of interferon-induced gene Mx1 against the virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the last 50â€‰years, the importance of many more host genes in influenza pathogenesis has been discovered through experiments in mice, including RIG-I, IFITM3, TNF and IL-1R genes (reviewed in [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Nonetheless, one limitation of the existing approaches in investigating host molecular determinants involved in IAV virulence is that it has not yet taken into account the contribution of allelic variation to differential host responses.
