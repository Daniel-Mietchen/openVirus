<p id="Par37">Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> that circulates in humans, mammals and birds. The genome of the virus consists of 8 single-stranded, negative-sense viral RNA segments encoding at least 12 proteins that make up its proteome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Segment 1 encodes for the basic RNA polymerase 2 (PB2); segment 2 encodes for the basic RNA polymerase 1 (PB1) and non-essential PB1-F2 protein; segment 3 encodes for the acidic RNA polymerase (PA) and non-essential PA-X protein; segment 4 encodes for the hemagglutinin (HA) membrane glycoprotein; segment 5 encodes for the nucleocapsid protein (NP); segment 6 encodes for the neuraminidase (NA) membrane glycoprotein; segment 7 encodes for the matrix protein 1 (M1) and matrix protein 2 (M2; also referred to as ion channel protein); and segment 8 encodes for the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and nonstructural protein 2 (NS2; also referred to as nuclear export protein).
