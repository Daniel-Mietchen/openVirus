    "Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) may be associated with infection of unknown pathogen(s). For predicting of the etiology of KD, we evaluated epidemiological characteristics in KD, common infectious diseases and immune-mediated diseases in childhood. Methods: We respectively, reviewed the data of patients with KD, influenza, aseptic meningitis, exanthem subitum (ES), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia, acute pyelonephritis (APN), Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP), acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), and childhood asthma. We compared and interpreted epidemiological data across the groups. Results: In age distribution, KD, APN, and ES showed a similar pattern in that majority of patients were infants or young children, and other diseases showed a relatively even age-distribution which had a peak age, mainly 5-6 years, with bell-shape patterns. In annual-case pattern, there were epidemic years in aseptic meningitis and MP pneumonia, and the fluctuated annual cases were seen in other diseases. The trends of decreasing cases were seen in APSGN, HSP, and childhood asthma in recent years. In seasonal frequency, influenza or aseptic meningitis occurred in mainly winter or summer season, respectively. HSP and APSGN cases had less in summer, and KD, APN, and ES showed relatively even occurrence throughout a year without significant seasonal variations. Conclusions: Our results suggest that KD agents may be associated with normal flora that are influenced by environmental changes, since pathogens of APN and ES could be regarded as normal flora that originate from the host itself or ubiquitously existing human reservoirs."
