<p>The subjects of this study were collected from the patients (0–15 years of age) who were admitted at The Catholic University of Korea Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital from January 1987 to December 2016. We evaluated the epidemiological characteristics of patients diagnosed with 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> (MP) pneumonia, influenza, aseptic meningitis, APN, ES, acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), HSP, childhood asthma (or recurrent wheezing episode), and KD. As an exception, the subjects diagnosed with influenza in this study were selected from outpatients who were positive for influenza in rapid diagnostic testing during the winter of influenza seasons. The diagnosis or selection criteria in each disease were referenced from other publications (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Although the study period and the number of patients in each disease were not identical, we reevaluated the data that were used for previously published papers or collected new data for some diseases such as ES and HSP. Age, sex, age distribution pattern, annual-case pattern and monthly-case pattern were analyzed in each disease. For mean age, &lt;12 months of age was regarded as 0 years of age for statistical analyses, except ES. In age distribution pattern, we focused on age predilection in infancy and younger children. In annual-case pattern, we searched whether the pattern shown cyclic epidemics during the study periods. As for seasonal variation, the disease was regarded as having seasonality when the number of seasonal cases showed over 10 or 15% difference in the number of cases between the highest season and the lowest season.
