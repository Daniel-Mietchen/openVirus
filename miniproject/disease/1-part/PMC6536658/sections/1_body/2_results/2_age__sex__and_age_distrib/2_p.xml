<p>Male predominance was observed in all the diseases except ES (0.95:1), but the M:F ratios were somewhat different across the diseases. The highest M:F ratio was seen in APSGN (2.3:1), and the lower M:F ratios were seen in ES, MP pneumonia and influenza (1.1:1, respectively), and KD showed 1.7:1 ratio in this series. The lowest mean age was noted in order of ES (mean 1 year of age), APN (1.5 years), and KD (2.2 years) and the higher mean age was noted in APSGN (8.3 years) and HSP (6.5 years). In age distribution, KD, APN, and ES showed a similar pattern in that the majority of patients were infants and young children (0–4 years), and after this age period the prevalence decreased dramatically. There were only a few patients &gt;3 years of age in ES and a few patients &gt;5 years in KD, however there was relatively an even distribution with female predominance after &gt;2 years in APN. A bell-shape distribution pattern with a peak prevalence, mainly in the 4–6 years age range was observed in other diseases, however peak ages were slightly different across the diseases (
