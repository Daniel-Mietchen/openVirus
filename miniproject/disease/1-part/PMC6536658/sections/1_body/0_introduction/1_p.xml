<p>Kawasaki disease (KD) disease was a novel disease that appeared in East Asian countries in the order of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China with a 5–10 year time-gap (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). After the first case report in the 1960s in Japan, KD has been reported in over 60 countries around the world (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, the incidence of KD is different across various populations; currently, the incidence in Western countries is lower by one tenth to one twentieth compared to East Asian countries, and has plateaued during recent decades. Whereas, the number of KD patients in East Asian countries has slowly and steadily increased after its first emergence (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In these countries, KD occurs mostly in children between 6 months and 4 years of age, and has become a nationwide endemic disease within 2 decades after its first appearance. These findings suggest that KD spreads slowly to other regions within a nation and neighboring countries, which is contrasting to common infectious disease epidemics. KD pathogen(s) should satisfy with the epidemiological characteristics of KD.
