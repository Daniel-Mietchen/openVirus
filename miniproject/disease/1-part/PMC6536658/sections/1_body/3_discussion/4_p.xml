<p>In the present study, monthly case or seasonal case patterns in KD were also the most similar to those in APN or ES. Similar to this study, Nagao et al. (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) reported that the super-annual periodicity of KD was the most similar to ES among seven childhood infectious diseases including ES, herpangina, hand-foot-mouth disease, chicken pox, pharyngoconjunctival fever, erythema infectiosum, and GAS infection. They suggested that the KD pathogen is transmitted through close contact and persists asymptomatically in most hosts, likely ES (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and this suggestion is accordance with our presumed characteristics of KD pathogens. Although the rate of KD has slowly increased with slight seasonal predominance in nationwide studies in Japan and Korea (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), KD has occurred with annual fluctuations with seasonal variation each year in a given location as shown in this study. These data suggest that KD appears as local outbreaks rather than as a simultaneous nationwide epidemic as shown in viral or MP infections in Korea.
