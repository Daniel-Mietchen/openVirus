<p>Pathogenesis of KD and APN as well as other infectious and immune-mediated diseases remains to be further studied. APN has a focus in renal cortical parenchyma, where replicated uropathogens, byproducts from APN agents such as toxins and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), substances from injured host cells, and those from activated immune cells are produced. When these diverse substances spread from the focus into systemic circulation, clinical manifestations such as fever, tissue cell injury and/or bacteremia begin to occur, and the host immune system may respond to the substances. The majority of patients infected with APN pathogens may be asymptomatic and their disease are self-limited if systemic spread did not occur and the substances in the focus were controlled as a localized inflammation (

In ARF, after 1â€“4 weeks after initial GAS infection when symptoms and signs of the initial bacterial infection (pharyngitis) subside, acute onset of fever and other symptoms, such as carditis, arthritis, and rarely skin rash (erythema marginatum), develop (

The majority of patients with ARF or APSGN show a self-limited clinical course, although severely affected patients have long-term complications such as severe rheumatic heart disease or chronic renal failure, similar to giant coronary artery aneurysms in KD. Only a small proportion of patients with GAS infection are affected with ARF or APSGN. Some patients with ARF or APSGN may have preceding asymptomatic GAS infections, and other group streptococci, other bacteria or viruses are associated with postinfectious glomerulonephritis or heart tissue inflammation, including myocarditis and possibly heart valve diseases, without evidence of GAS infection (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These substances include not only those originating from the pathogens but also those from the injured host cells, including damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and those from immune cells activated by infectious insults. It have been proposed that these substances bind to specific target cells of organs such as heart and joints in ARF, kidneys in APSGN, or coronary arteries or other organs in KD. The host immune system may control these substances based on their size and biochemical properties (the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis) (
