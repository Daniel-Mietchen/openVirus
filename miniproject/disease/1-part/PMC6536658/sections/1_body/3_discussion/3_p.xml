<p>In the annual-case pattern, cyclic epidemics were noted in MP pneumonia and aseptic meningitis, and marked fluctuated cases with a different peak week were noted in influenza. The annual-case pattern in KD was relatively even, but fluctuations in annual cases were noted as well as in APSGN, HSP and childhood asthma, and APN and ES in infectious diseases. APN may be the most common systemic bacterial infection in early childhood in developed countries (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A majority of uropathogens causing APN in infants are 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> or other uropathogens such as 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Proteus</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp., and they may originate from the intestinal commensals in the host. It is possible that after colonization of a strain of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> or other uropathoegns transferred from other persons, the pathogens invade into the host on occasional events and elicit immune reactions (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Although KD and APN affect mainly infants and young children, older children and adults are also affected (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Moreover, recurrent cases are not uncommon in the both diseases. These findings suggest that immature immune function in early childhood may be associated with both diseases, and pathogens may be multiple in KD (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). ES is an acute systemic viral infection, and is characterized by sudden appearances of generalized maculopapular or morbilliform rashes just after defervescence. The etiologic agent is a species belonging to the human Herpes virus group, herpes virus type 6 or rarely type 7. Herpes viruses have a characteristic of latent infections after initial infection. ES may have no differences in age predilection, possibly sero-prevalence rate, and clinical manifestations across populations around the world and have occurred throughout every year with no seasonal variations (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Herpes virus groups become latent in the host after the initial infection as shown in herpes zoster, herpes labialis, and reactivation of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in depressed immune state of the host (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). It was reported that EBV infection or herpes virus 6 infection was related to certain clinical manifestations in KD such as otorrhea or BCG inoculation site inflammation (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It is a reasonable presumption that etiologic viruses in ES may have been introduced to humans a long-time ago, and may be coexisting within healthy human reservoirs including family members of infected infants with ES, and can be activated at any time. On occasion, the latent viruses in healthy carriers who may have a transient immune disturbance, can be reactivated and be spread to infants who have no immunity to the viruses.
