<p>Successful immunization and neutralizing antibody production in C57BL/6 mice has been demonstrated for an RNA nanoparticle vaccine based on prM-E (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chahal et al., 2017</xref>). This vaccine uses an RNA replicon vector to package ZIKV prM-E protein for expression in BHK21 cells. Protein expression results in the release of small viral particles (SVPs) that exhibit similar functions to fully functional virions but are smaller than the wild type virions that contain capsid proteins (
