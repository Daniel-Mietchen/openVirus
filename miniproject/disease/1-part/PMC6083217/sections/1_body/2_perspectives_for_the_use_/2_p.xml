<p>The ZIKV vaccines currently under development are mainly based on purified inactivated viruses, plasmid DNA, or mRNA platforms (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gaudinski et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Modjarrad et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, none of these ZIKV vaccine approaches have achieved success in terms of generating highly effective neutralizing antibodies by using prM or E protein alone. Instead, a combination of prM-E structural proteins is required, even if the
