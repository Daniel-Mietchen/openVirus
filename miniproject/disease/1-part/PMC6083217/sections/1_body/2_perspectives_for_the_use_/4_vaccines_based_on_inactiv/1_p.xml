<p>A vaccine produced by immunizing mice with VLPs that incorporates full-length ZIKV structural proteins (C-prM-E) can also endow full protection against ZIKV and induces production of more ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies than DNA vaccines (

Another approach using chimeric ZIKV with DENV prM-E proteins or a chimeric DENV with ZIKV prM-E proteins revealed robust protection in immunized mice through the production of highly neutralizing antibodies (
