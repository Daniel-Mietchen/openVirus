<p>The ZIKV viral envelope is comprised of two viral proteins, the prM/M and E proteins. Since prM is cleaved to M during virion maturation, prM is usually not present on the virions or at a very low levels. Although M proteins are protected by E proteins in mature virions, both prM and E proteins have become major targets of vaccine design and development against ZIKV infections (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2018</xref>). These structural proteins have been targeted because they are: (i) non-replicating subunits of the ZIKV genome so they present a safer candidate profile for vaccines; (ii) the main determinants for the high stability of ZIKV; and (iii) epitopes for CD4
