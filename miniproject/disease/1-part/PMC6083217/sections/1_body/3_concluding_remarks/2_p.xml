<p>Various platforms have been employed to generate vaccines against ZIKV infections, including purified inactivated virus, plasmid DNA, and mRNA nanoparticles. Despite these platforms having been adapted from studies of other flaviviruses, the resulting vaccines have exhibited experimental success when a combination of both prM and E proteins are utilized. In contrast, sole use of ZIKV prM protein in vaccines against ZIKV has not yet proven as effective as prM-E combinations.</p>
