<p>It remains unclear if future epidemics will have the same clinical implications as the most recent epidemic or which viral protein modifications are more likely to result in another epidemic. Furthermore, whether the ZIKV vaccines currently under development can be effective against future epidemics is uncertain. These basic questions should guide research efforts for the prevention, control and therapeutic strategies of ZIKV. Additional focused studies on the molecular and structural biology of ZIKV prM may accelerate our ability to tackle this emerging public health concern.</p>
