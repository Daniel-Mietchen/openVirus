<p>Zika virus has been categorized into pre-epidemic and epidemic strains through analyses of complete genomes or polyprotein sequences of isolates, most of which came from humans but some are from primates or mosquito vectors (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ramaiah et al., 2017</xref>). Pre-epidemic strains represent isolates associated with sporadic human infections in both Africa and Asia prior to 2007 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Saluzzo et al., 1981</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adekolu-John and Fagbami, 1983</xref>). Epidemic strains represent ZIKV isolates linked to human infections from outbreaks on Yap Island in 2007 to more recent outbreaks reported in the Americas (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hennessey et al., 2016</xref>). Further bioinformatics analyses of these two viral categories have suggested that some amino acids may have been substituted in the epidemic viruses that have remained unaltered in pre-epidemic strains (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bos et al., 2018</xref>). A recent genomic analysis of ZIKV strains revealed two amino acid substitutions in ZIKV prM protein isolated from strains contributing to epidemics in 2007 compared to that of a pre-epidemic Asian strain isolated in 1966 (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). When pre-epidemic African strains were compared with all other sequenced epidemic strains, nine amino acid substitutions were identified in ZIKV prM protein (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Another study found 10 amino acid substitutions between pre-epidemic and epidemic ZIKV prM proteins (

 </bold>). These genomic variations might have been driven by ZIKV adopting an urban-based transmission cycle targeting humans as hosts rather than the original sylvatic mode of transmission that normally involves 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and non-human primates (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ramaiah et al., 2017</xref>). Adoption of a new transmission mode exerts a selection pressure on the viral genome to enable it to maintain its replication efficiency. Epidemic ZIKV strains, including those associated with neurovirulence, have been shown to belong to the Asian lineage (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Faye et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bos et al., 2018</xref>). The change in target host to humans, and especially to na√Øve human Asian populations (rather than African), may have driven the amino acid substitutions and protein evolution of ZIKV prM proteins (
