 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], recombinant viruses were generated with a plasmid-based reverse genetics system in the EG/2013 (H9N2) genetic background. Mutations were introduced into the plasmids using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All propagated viruses were completely sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted mutations.
