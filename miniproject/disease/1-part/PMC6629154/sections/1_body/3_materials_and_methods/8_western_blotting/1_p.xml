<p>For expression analyses, 293T cells were transfected with equal amounts of plasmids encoding the non-tagged or flag-tagged PB2 gene of EG/2007 (H5N1), Sh/2013 (H7N9) or EG/2013 (H9N2). At 16 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested with sample buffer. For the PB2-flag immunoprecipitation assays described above, final immunoprecipitates were boiled in sample buffer and analyzed by western blotting. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-influenza PB2, PB1 and PA antibody (GeneTex), anti-flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The bands were visualized with Amersham ECL Select Western Blotting Detection Reagent and the Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare). The band intensities were quantified by Amersham Imager 600 Analysis Software (GE Healthcare).</p>
