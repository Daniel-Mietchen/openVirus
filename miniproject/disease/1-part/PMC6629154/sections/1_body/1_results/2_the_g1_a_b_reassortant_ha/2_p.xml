<p>We then searched for the PB2 mutations that the G1-A/B reassortant had accumulated during its evolution in the field, with reference to the ancestral G1/1997 virus. A total of 32 amino acid substitutions were identified and grouped in four mutation categories, designated a-d (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Category a contained 17 substitutions, including E627V, that had all been detected in the oldest H9N2 G1-A strain in the Middle East (A/chicken/Saudi Arabia/532/1999) and all its descendants. Category b contained strains with 8 substitutions that were identified during the G1-A prevalence in Israel and Jordan during 2000–2006. Category c contained 2 substitutions that were identified in G1-A/B reassortants in 2006–2009. Category d contained 5 substitutions that were maintained after incursion of the G1-A/B reassortant into Egypt around 2010. The G1-A/B reassortant that has predominated in Egypt since then and almost all its descendants have retained these substitutions, indicating that they may have contributed to the establishment of the G1-A/B reassortant in poultry.
