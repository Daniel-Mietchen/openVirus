<p>To trace evolution of the PB2 gene in the G1-A/B reassortant, we analyzed the phylogeny of PB2 genes, including the PB2 genes of the G1-like prototype A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997 and the descendant G1-like subclades that were isolated in Central Asia and the Middle East from 1998 to 2015, including EG/2013. The PB2 genes in viruses isolated in Central Asia and the Middle East clustered in several groups (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007919.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The topology of the PB2 and HA gene phylogenetic trees indicated a major intra-subclade reassortment between G1-A and G1-B viruses. It has been reported that the G1-A/B reassortant emerged in Israel and Jordan, with the PB2, PB1, PA and NP genes from G1-A and the other genes from G1-B, and has become dominant there since 2006 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), indicating that the Egyptian H9N2 virus originated from the G1-A/B reassortant that was prevalent in Israel and Jordan. The G1-like subclades in Central Asia and the Middle East were mostly isolated from chickens, but also from birds, including turkeys, quails, ducks, ostriches, pheasants and pigeons. The isolates from each bird species were interspersed throughout the H9N2 phylogenetic tree without distinct clustering, indicating a wide dispersion of these viruses in birds in these geographic areas.
