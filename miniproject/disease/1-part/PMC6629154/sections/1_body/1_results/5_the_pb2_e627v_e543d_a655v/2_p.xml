<p>The role of the PB2 amino acid at residues 627, 543, 655 and 526 in the G1/1997 background on virus replication was studied next. For these experiments, we used a reassortant virus carrying polymerase-associated genes (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) from G1/1997 and the other genes from EG/2013 to assess polymerase-specific effects on virus replication. The reassortant virus was designated G1(3P+NP). The G1(3P+NP) mutants produced significantly higher virus titers than G1(3P+NP)-wt in both DF-1 cells and Calu-3 cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), E543D needed to be coupled with the A655V compensatory mutation to act cooperatively to produce increased G1(3P+NP) growth in infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007919.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The most phylogenetically recent mutant genotype, G1(3P+NP)
 <sub>E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R</sub>, had the greatest progeny virus yield in both cell types: G1(3P+NP)-wt &lt; E627V &lt; E627V/E543D/A655V &lt; E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R. Together, these results suggested that, during about two decades of evolution in the Middle East, the ability of G1-like clade viruses to replicate in avian and human cells gradually increased and the E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R quadruple mutations acted cooperatively in evolution of the G1-A/B reassortant, with the most fit phenotype able to replicate more successfully in human cells at the lower temperature.
