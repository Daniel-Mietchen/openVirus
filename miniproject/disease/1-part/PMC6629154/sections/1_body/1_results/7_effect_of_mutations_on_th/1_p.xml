<p>The influenza virus polymerase complex is intrinsically flexible and can adopt multiple conformations depending on the presence or absence of specific RNA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our structural model of the heterotrimeric G1/1997 polymerase complex showed that PB2 mutations that increased polymerase activity and replication in human cells and mice (i.e., E627V, E543D, A655V and K526R) were exposed on the surface of the PB2-627 domain in at least one of the two conformations of the polymerase complex that we examined. In the transcription pre-initiation form (PDB: 4WSB as the modeling template), E543D, A655V and K526R were located on the inner side of the polymerase complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). E543D was located on the PB2 surface, but A655V was less surface-exposed. The two sites were close to PB1, but not directly contacting it. K526R faced the product exit channel. In addition, E627V was fully exposed on the surface at outer side of the polymerase complex. In the rearrangement of the polymerase conformation from the transcription pre-initiation form to the apo form (PDB: 5D98 as the modeling template), all of the mutations became more fully exposed on the surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>) and located at the outer side of polymerase complex. These results suggested that the mutations identified here may affect interaction between the PB2-627 domain and host factor(s) that mediate species-pecific effects to promote polymerase activity and viral replication.
