<p>To determine the effect of each mutation on viral polymerase activity, we introduced a reverse mutation of each mutation that had been identified into the EG/2013 background, both with and without PB2-V627E, and measured the polymerase activities of the revertants by minigenome assays in avian DF-1 cells at 37°C and in 293T cells at 33°C. As a reference, a reassorted polymerase complex composed of PB2 from G1/1997 and PB1, PA and NP from EG/2013 (referred to here as EG/2013-G1/PB2) was included in these assays. In avian cells at 37°C, none of the single reverse mutations had a significant effect on EG/2013 polymerase activity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The effect was greater when the mutation was combined with V627E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The K190R and T643S reverse mutations only showed moderate effects when combined with V627E. The polymerase activity of these single revertants was higher than that of the reference EG/2013-G1/PB2, indicating that multiple mutations contributed to the high polymerase activity of the G1-A/B reassortant. At 37°C, the effects were negligible, except that the R526K reverse mutation showed a noticeable effect in reducing EG/2013 polymerase activity in human cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007919.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). There was no apparent difference in PB2 expression between the wild-type and the mutants with appreciably reduced polymerase activity (i.e., V627E, D543E, R526K, K190R and T643S), indicating that their lower polymerase activity was not due to a decrease in PB2 expression. Together, these results suggested that the reverse mutations of the phylogeny-associated PB2 mutations in this study, singly and together with V627E, decreased EG/2013 polymerase activity in human cells to a greater degree at the lower 33°C temperature.
