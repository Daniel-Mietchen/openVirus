<p>To elucidate the replication capacity of the G1-A/B reassortant in human cells, the polymerase activity of the EG/2013 (H9N2) virus in human 293T cells was compared to that of three other zoonotic AI viruses; i.e., A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997 (H9N2), A/duck/Egypt/D1Br/2007 (H5N1) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9). A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997 (G1/1997) (H9N2) is the prototype virus of the G1-like clade. A/duck/Egypt/D1Br/2007 (EG/2007) (H5N1) is an ancestral strain of clade 2.2.1 that is unique to Egypt: most clade 2.2.1 field isolates, including EG/2007, have the PB2-E627K mutation [
