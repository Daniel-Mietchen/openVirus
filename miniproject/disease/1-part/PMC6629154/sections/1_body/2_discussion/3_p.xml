<p>In this study, the PB2 E627V, E543D, A655V and K526R mutations acted cooperatively and produced increased replication of the G1-A/B reassortant in human cells and mice. However, the PB2-R190K and S643T mutations only had marginal effects. This was consistent with the hypothesis that the H9N2 virus PB2 gene was a key determinant in the host adaptation of AI viruses to mammals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The G1-like clade accumulated the E627V, E543D, A655V and R190K mutations during phylogenetic branching from the ancestral G1-like clade to form the G1-A subclade in the Middle East (1997–1999) (summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The S643T mutation occurred during the time G1-A was prevalent in Israel and Jordan (1999–2006), and the K526R mutation occurred during the emergence of the G1-A/B reassortant in this area in about 2006. The resulting G1-A/B reassortant has retained all these mutations and has been prevalent in Egypt since 2010. This indicated that these phylogeny-associated PB2 mutations provided a selective advantage for adaptation of G1-like clade strains to poultry during its evolution in the field. Indeed, these mutations, singly and especially in combination, produced a moderate increase in G1/1997 polymerase activity and replication in avian cells, which may have led to the current prevalence of the G1-A/B reassortant in Egyptian poultry. H9N2 virus adaptation to poultry could have facilitated expansion of the viral host range, including infection of humans and other mammals [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which may have generated more complicated phenotypes in the field. Taken together, these findings suggested that the G1-A/B reassortant evolved to produce strains with diverse phenotypes in the Middle East, which led to its expanded host range, including to humans.
