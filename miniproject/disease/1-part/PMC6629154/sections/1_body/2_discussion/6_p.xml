<p>The H9N2 virus and the H5N1 clade 2.2.1 viruses have been prevalent in poultry in Egypt, which has provided the opportunity for reassortment between the two viruses. Fortunately, the emergence of H9N2/H5N1 reassortants has not been reported in Egypt thus far. However, we recently reported that Egyptian H9N2 and H5N1 viruses have a high genetic compatibility and a substantial potential to generate reassortants with greater fitness in mammalian species than the parental viruses [

The results of this study suggested that, if an H5N1 clade 2.2.1 virus successfully recruited the G1-A/B PB2 gene, such reassortants may pose an infection threat beyond the current outbreaks in the Middle East. The G1-A/B reassortant has an increased replication ability in human cells at 33Â°C and in the upper respiratory tract of mice. This implied that an exposure to fewer G1-A/B reassortant viruses may establish an infection in the respiratory tract of a mammalian species, greatly increasing the likelihood of a co-infection and reassortment with a seasonal human or swine influenza virus in the upper airway. The G1-A/B reassortant has an HA-Q226L mutation (H3 numbering) that increased viral binding affinity to human respiratory epithelia [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggested that the Middle East, with an epicenter in Egypt, is now a hot spot of H9N2 and H5N1 virus evolution, which may generate novel viruses presenting an increased public health risk.
