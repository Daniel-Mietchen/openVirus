 </sup> (70 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (5 mL). 4-Azidobutanoic acid (77 mg, 0.6 mmol, 3 equiv) was added, followed by DMAP (7.3 mg, 0.06 mmol, 0.3 equiv), EDCÂ·HCl (190 mg, 1.0 mmol, 5 equiv). The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. Then the solution was washed with 1 M HCl solution, followed by saturated NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> solution and by saturated NaCl solution. After drying (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) the solvent was removed, and the residue was purified using column chromatography over silica gel (eluent DCM/MeOH 75:1 v/v) to give 55 mg (40%) of an off-white solid.
