<p>The appropriate azido compound (1 equiv) and alkyne (1.3–2.3 equiv per azido group), CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>·5H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.04–0.5 equiv), sodium 
 <sc>l</sc>-ascorbate (2.5 equiv) were dissolved in DMF/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.2–2 mL). The reaction was performed under microwave irradiation (80–100 °C, 1–1.5 h). Then the mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica chromatography (DCM/MeOH 20:1 v/v) for 
 <bold>9a</bold> and Biogel P-2 (eluent H
 <sub>2</sub>O) for the others.
