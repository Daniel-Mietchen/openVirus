<p>To further evaluate the potential of the compounds as IAV inhibitors, an infection inhibition test was performed using the H3-containing WU95 virus. As such, MDCK-II cells were exposed to IAV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) per cell in the presence and absence of 
 <bold>14</bold> or 
 <bold>12</bold> at different concentrations without the presence of an NA inhibitor. At 7 h postinfection the number of infected cells were determined (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>), and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined. In agreement with the BLI results, 
 <bold>14</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.4 μM) inhibited infection more efficiently than 
 <bold>12</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15 μM). Furthermore, it was determined that the two compounds did not cause significant cytotoxicity (see

In addition, we analyzed the ability of the compounds to prevent cell killing by virus infection. Again, 
 <bold>14</bold> was more effective than 
 <bold>12</bold> (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00303/suppl_file/jm9b00303_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information</ext-link>). Finally, we analyzed whether synergy could be observed between HA inhibitor 
 <bold>15</bold> and NA inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate. Low nanomolar concentrations of each showed little effect, but when they were combined, a significant reduction of infection was observed (see
