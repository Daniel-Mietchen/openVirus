<p>For drug development it would be an advantage if monodisperse, small well-defined molecular entities can be used, with no risk of immunogenicity. Reaching this goal has proven considerably more difficult. Reported studies by Knowles et al. showed that certain divalent sialiosides,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
 </sup> did not exhibit enhanced HA binding when exposed to an HA trimer but were able to enhance hemagglutination inhibition when the HAs were present on a viral surface. Their convincing proof showed that the compounds were able to bridge between HA trimers, an aggregation mechanism, the benefits of which are not well understood.

 </sup> Similar observations were made by others including a system containing two α-2,6-SiaLacNAc units linked via a single galactoside moiety,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>
 </sup> dendrimers presenting sialic acids,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
 </sup> cyclic peptides presenting sialyl lactosides,
 <sup>

 </sup> and a calixarene linked to four sialic acids.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>
 </sup> These constructs resulted in moderate enhancements, and they did not have the structural features now known to be needed to bridge between binding sites within an HA trimer (∼67 atoms in the bridge between sialic acids).

 </sup> An interesting case is a system based on a trisubstituted benzene ring linked to sialic acids via peptidic spacer arms. This construct with the right dimensions to bridge binding sites was reported to bind to immobilized HA by SPR with a

 <sub>d</sub> of 450 nM.

 </sup> However, the peptidic component showed significant binding indicative of peptide protein interactions but indeed leading to an overall potent compound. In another system, a three-way junction DNA for the display of α-2,3-SiaLac units was shown to be potent, but a single arm was not much less potent. This is indicative of DNA–protein interactions and makes a bridging mechanism less likely.

 </sup> A system based on PNA-DNA complexes displaying two α-2,6-SiaLacNAc units at various distances was also reported.

 </sup> Evidence for true chelation, i.e., bridging between binding sites, was provided and yielded a ∼30-fold enhancement (15-fold per sugar) over a DNA-PNA reference construct containing only a single glycoligand. Unfortunately, these noncovalent constructs of ∼21 kDa are not small molecules. Other indications that chelation of HA binding sites is indeed possible come from carbohydrate array experiments with biantennary glycans. They showed that glycans with at least three LacNAc units in each of the arms bound more strongly to human type specific HAs.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
 </sup> Molecular modeling supported the chelation mode and indicated that two LacNAc units would be too short. This chelation type binding was shown to only be possible for the human type specific HA binding to α2,6-linked sialic acid for geometrical reasons and is precluded for the α2,3-linked ones.
