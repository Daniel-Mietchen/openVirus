<p>The results of ACE showed that out of the 217 diseased goat sera samples tested using ACE, 30 were antigen-positive for BVDV. Antigen-positive samples were confirmed as BVDV-1 using BVDV-1 specific nested RT-PCR. Fifteen additional samples that were close to the cutoff value of ACE were also tested with nested RT-PCR, eight of which were positive for BVDV-1. Taken together, 38 sequences from 217 total samples corresponded to BVDV–1 by nested RT-PCR, which resulted in a 197–bp amplicon from the BVDV–1 5′–UTR. However, BVDV–2, BVDV–3, and BDV were not detected in any of these samples using RT-PCR. These results indicated that the average infection rate of BVDV–1 in goats was 17.51% (38/217) in southwestern China.</p>
