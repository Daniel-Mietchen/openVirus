<p>Twelve of those sequences were selected for the construction of a phylogenetic tree and were divided into five different subtypes. Five isolates (XC1522, HL1407, DC1301, SC1601, and MN1319) were clustered within BVDV–1b, one (DS1324) was typed as BVDV–1a, one (FS1573) as BVDV–1c, one (FS1426) as BVDV–1p, and four (FS1605, CF1374, DF1312, and DB1503) were characterized as BVDV–1m. No BVDV–2, BVDV–3, or BDV was detected in field isolates by phylogenetic analysis.</p>
