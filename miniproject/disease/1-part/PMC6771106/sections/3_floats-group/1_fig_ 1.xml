   <bold>a</bold> biological process,

   <bold>c</bold> KEGG pathways in human RPE cells 24 h post-infection with EBOV. Percentages indicate proportion of known genes represented within the grouping. 
   <bold>d</bold> Network of interactions between protein-coding genes and miRNAs in EBOV-infected human RPE cells, with miRNAs indicated by yellow diamonds, molecules indicated by blue circles, and interactions that are promoting or inhibiting represented as blue or red lines, respectively. Size of circle or diamond is proportionate to the number of molecular interactions (or degrees). An enlarged version of
