<p id="Par20">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (18–22 nt) fragments of single-stranded RNA that bind the 3′ untranslated region of mRNA, and directly suppress or indirectly activate gene expression. Because only a small (7–8 nt) “seed region” requires complementarity to permit binding, a single miRNA may have hundreds of mRNA targets, and thus play a complex regulatory role in cellular activity that varies by cell type and disease state [
