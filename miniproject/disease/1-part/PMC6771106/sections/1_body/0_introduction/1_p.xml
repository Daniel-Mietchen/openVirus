<p id="Par19">Survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD) suffer long-term sequelae. Intraocular inflammation—termed uveitis—develops in 18–34% of survivors [

 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (EBOV) has been isolated from intraocular fluid after resolution of the viremia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and retinal scars that indicate involvement of the retinal pigment epithelium are associated with uveitis [

 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> may persist at immune-privileged sites, such as the eye, since local immune responses are attenuated to avoid tissue damage. We previously demonstrated that human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells mount a type I interferon (IFN) anti-viral response and maintain immunomodulatory activity when infected with EBOV, and this cell population may be a reservoir for EBOV in the eye [
