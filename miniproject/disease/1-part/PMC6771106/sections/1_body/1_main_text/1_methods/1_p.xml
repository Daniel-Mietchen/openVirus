<p id="Par21">Total RNA was sourced from our previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], in which the human RPE cell line (ARPE-19) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] was infected in triplicate with EBOV (multiplicity of infection, 5) or mock-infected for 24 h. From 1 μg of RNA extract, small RNA was selectively enriched through sequential adapter ligation to 3′ and 5′ ends of RNA fragments using the TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription, and separately amplified with polymerase chain reaction using one of 48 primers containing index sequences (11 cycles). Using the Pippin Prep DNA Size Selection System (Sage Science, Beverley, MA), amplified cDNA constructs were purified from 3% agarose gel to isolate a library of small clone fragments. The library was sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500, using NextSeq 75-cycle High Output Kits (Illumina), with the PhiX Control v3 library (Illumina) as sequencing control.
