<p id="Par22">Short reads were filtered for adapters and reads of low quality using Cutadapt (v.1.8) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] with error rate of 0.2 and minimum length of 18 bp, aligned against GENCODE human genome reference assembly GRCh38.p3 using Burrows Wheeler Aligner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and assigned to miRBase (v.21) annotations using HTSeq (v.0.6.1p2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Data were filtered for targets with a minimum of 10 counts in at least 50% of samples. After normalization, differentially expressed miRNAs between EBOV- and mock-infected ARPE-19 cells were identified using the DESeq 2 statistical package (v.3.2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Reads were screened for complete matches to published EBOV miRNA sequences, allowing for 3 mismatches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Raw data from our RNA-Seq study of the total RNA transcriptome of EBOV-infected ARPE-19 cells [
