 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and collating miRNA-gene pairs, a miRNA-based network was constructed from miRNA-predicted gene target lists, miRNA-validated target gene lists, and the differentially expressed gene list; interactions were demonstrated based on degree, to identify the most highly-connected genes and miRNAs. An inverse correlation was required between expression of an miRNA and its target gene in these analyses.
