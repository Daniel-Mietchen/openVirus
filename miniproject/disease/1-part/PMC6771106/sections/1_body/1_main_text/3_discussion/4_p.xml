<p id="Par30">As applies to all viruses, EBOV infection involves hijacking translational machinery of the host cell to produce viral particles. Gene ontology enrichment analysis for molecular function showed strong activation of DNA-binding and transcription pathways in EBOV-infected human RPE cells. Known to bind double-stranded RNA, multiple genes in the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase pathway were upregulated in our gene ontology enrichment analyses, indicating a miRNA-facilitated host response to EBOV. Activation of kinases was prominent; pathways involving kinases—such as protein kinase R—are directly involved in the response to EBOV, binding to double-stranded RNA, activating cellular targets and inhibiting the host translational machinery [
