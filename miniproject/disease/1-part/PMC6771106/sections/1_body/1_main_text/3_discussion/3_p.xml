<p id="Par29">After entering the host cell, EBOV is transported via endolysosomal trafficking [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Infected cells also release exosomes containing EBOV VP40, which may promote leukocyte apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Consistent with involvement of the endolysosomal system, the most highly connected molecule in the miRNA-target gene network was LRRK2. This protein is a key regulator of the system; a range of mutations in LRRK2 result in formation of large, dysfunctional lysosomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, LRRK2 activation in microglia has been implicated in the progression of central nervous system inflammation, as occurs in Parkinsonâ€™s disease and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This suggests LRRK2 activity in EBOV-infected RPE cells may contribute to the development of uveitis.
