<p id="Par31">Virus-infected cells release exosomes containing host- and virus-derived miRNAs that modulate gene expression in uninfected neighbouring cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Human RPE cells have the capacity to secrete exosomes containing miRNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Our data indicate that hsa-miR-27b-5p and hsa-miR-3074-3p are expressed at reduced levels when the cells become infected with EBOV, which might indicate active export of the miRNAs into exosomes. Both miRNAs are detected in the aqueous humour of healthy eyes, at levels higher than found in plasma indicating local production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. We speculate that levels of these miRNAs might be increased in the ocular fluid of EBOV survivors, particularly those with uveitis and present biomarkers for ocular involvement. Other investigators have identified a panel of 8 serum miRNAs that predict pre-symptomatic EBOV infection, facilitating an early diagnosis of EVD [
