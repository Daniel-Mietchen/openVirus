 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the amplification of the sexual transmission of Zika in this community can be quite large if this mode of transmission is included. Moreover, with effective male-to-male transmission, sustained transmission of ZIKV becomes possible without the vector.
