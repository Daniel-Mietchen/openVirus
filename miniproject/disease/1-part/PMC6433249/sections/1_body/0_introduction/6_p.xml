<p>A pan-DENV-specific RT-iiPCR assay was validated recently on the POCKIT system to have clinical performance equivalent to that of a laboratory qRT-PCR for the detection of DENV-1â€“4 serotypes in human plasma and serum [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Four singleplex DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents have become available recently for the identification of DENV-1, 2, 3, and 4 serotypes separately on the POCKIT system, allowing DENV serotyping near patients and soon after the mosquitoes are trapped even at low-resource settings. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the four DENV serotyping reagents on the POCKIT and POCKIT Micro Plus PCR devices for the detection of the respective target DENV serotypes in human serum and mosquito samples.
