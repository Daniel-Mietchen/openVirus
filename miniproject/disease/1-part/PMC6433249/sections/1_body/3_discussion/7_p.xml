<p>In conclusion, performed on the portable POCKIT system, the four POCKIT singleplex serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents have potential to serve as a relatively inexpensive, rapid, and simple PON tool for early detection and serotyping of DENV in viremic patients as well as in infected mosquitoes, enabling timely management and control of dengue disease in underserved communities. Studies to verify and validate further the performance of these reagents on the mobile PCR laboratory system for DENV subtyping in both human and mosquitoes are underway.</p>
