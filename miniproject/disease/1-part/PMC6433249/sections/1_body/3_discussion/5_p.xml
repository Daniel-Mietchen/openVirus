<p>To aid laboratory confirmation of DENV infection during the first 5 to 6 days after symptomatic onset, detection methods for DENV RNA have been recommended by WHO [
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among them, real-time RT-PCR allows serotyping of DENV. However, this technology is in general not available at most PONs to provide timely serotyping results in regions with threats of epidemic dengue; RNA degradation during the shipping process to the central laboratories is also a concern [

The POCKIT or POCKIT Micro Plus device has been bundled with the field-deployable taco mini extraction system in a durable suitcase (POCKIT combo, POCKIT Micro combo, respectively; GeneReach) to meet the needs of PON applications at different settings. The equipment can be operated with a car battery or a rechargeable battery and only a few simple steps are needed from sample to results with this mobile PCR system.
