<p>The detection endpoints of the DENV-1, -2, -3, -4 serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents were evaluated by side-by-side comparison with the reference multiplex qRT-PCR by using their respective target DENV serotypes. 10-fold serial dilutions (100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 PFU/ml) of each isolate were made in DENV-negative human serum and each was subjected to nucleic acid extraction in triplicate. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The 100% detection endpoints were found at 10 and 1 PFU/ml DENV-1 with the reference qRT-PCR and DENV-1 RT-iiPCR, respectively, at 1 PFU/ml DENV-2 with both qRT-PCR and DENV-2 RT-iiPCR, at 1 PFU/ml DENV-3 with both qRT-PCR and DENV-3 RT-iiPCR, and at 10 and 1 PFU/ml DENV-4 with the qRT-PCR and DENV-4 RT-iiPCR, respectively. All data indicated that the four DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RT-iiPCR had analytical sensitivity comparable to that of the reference qRT-PCR in detecting their target DENV serotypes.
