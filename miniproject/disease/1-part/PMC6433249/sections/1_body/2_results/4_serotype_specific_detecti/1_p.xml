<p>The combination of the hand-held POCKIT Micro Plus and the compact taco mini is available in a suitcase for pathogen surveillance at points of need. With the four serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents, it will be possible to performed DENV serotyping soon after the mosquitoes are trapped on site even at settings of limited resources. Here, we evaluated preliminarily the performance of the four serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents to detect their target DENV serotypes in mosquito specimens on the hand-held POCKIT Micro Plus PCR system. Nucleic acids extracted from female

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes experimentally infected with DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 serotype were subjected to PCR testing by the POCKIT DENV-1, -2, -3, or -4 RT-iiPCR. The results showed that the DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RT-iiPCR can detect their target DENV serotypes but not the serotypes to be excluded (
