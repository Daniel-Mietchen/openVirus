<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that used MEM for RSV, which is so far only widely used in influenza research [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As compared with two commonly used other methods and with the results of a previous study on a European level that used the 1.2% method [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], MEM gave similar results and could accurately detect the RSV epidemic, especially with virological laboratory surveillance data. In contrast to the 1.2% method that needs the cumulative number detections in a season as denominator [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], MEM has the advantage that it does not need a denominator and can therefore be applied to both virological laboratory surveillance data with absolute numbers of detections and sentinel GP data. The other two methods can either not be applied in sentinel data because the number of detections per week is too low for the 20 detections per week method or face difficulties due to imprecision with percentages with small numbers in sentinel data (1.2% method). In addition, MEM can easily be replicated in other surveillance systems, quantifies the intensity of the RSV epidemic and can be applied to the most recently available epidemic trends. Furthermore, and maybe most importantly, MEM can be used prospectively to set thresholds for the coming season, whereas thresholds based on percentages of the total number of RSV detections within a season can only be used retrospectively. Prospectively determined thresholds and intensity levels may help surveillance authorities to increase awareness in both primary and secondary care settings for the coming season, potentially leading to more focused diagnostics and therapy during the epidemic period.
