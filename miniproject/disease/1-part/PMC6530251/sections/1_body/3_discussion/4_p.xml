<p>Our data underline the need for RSV awareness in elderly patients. We found that patients &gt; 65 years old have a threefold and patients &gt; 75 years a 3.9-fold increased risk for RSV infections as compared with adults between &gt;15 and 45 years old, regardless of any underlying diseases or immune status [

 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. According to former studies, RSV does not only have a high incidence but also a high disease burden in elderly patients, with hospitalisation and mortality rates similar to influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and outbreaks in nursing homes with fatality rates of 20% (range: 2–20%) [
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Awareness for this frequent and virulent pathogen is therefore not only needed in a hospital setting, but also in primary care and nursing homes.
