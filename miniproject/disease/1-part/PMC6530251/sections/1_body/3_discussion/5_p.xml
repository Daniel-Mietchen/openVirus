<p>The difference between RSV-A and RSV-B originates from structural differences in the G-gene of the virus encoding the important surface G-protein, responsible for attachment to the epithelial cell of the host [
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The observed alternating pattern in RSV-type predominance is explained by reductions in susceptibility and interactions between antigenic variations in the virus and transmission dynamics [
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This consistent pattern of changing predominance has important implications for RSV vaccines currently under development [
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and thus need coverage for both RSV-types, although there may be cross-neutralisation of vaccines that target largely conserved genomic regions in the F-protein that is responsible for fusion of the virus with host cell membranes, a requirement for productive infection. In addition, as the debate on clinical impact of RSV-types is still ongoing, it is important to know and understand their seasonal patterns [
