<p>Our study provides a detailed overview of seasonal patterns in RSV epidemiology in the Netherlands over a period of 12 years. We found RSV in 5.6% of patients presenting with ARI/ILI at the GP, with a significant increase in the percentage of RSV positives over the past 12 years. Although the instructions for inclusion in the sentinel surveillance of NIVEL primary care database (GP data) have remained the same over these 12 years, this increase might still have to do with increasing RSV awareness, resulting in patient samples being taken more selectively at the GPs as well as more selective GP consulting of patients with ARI/ILI [

The RSV epidemic period is quite uniform in length and follows an amplitude-like pattern in the timing of its start. The RSV epidemic period also has a well-defined epidemic peak of 1 week. Virological surveillance data showed a slightly earlier start and longer epidemic period as compared with sentinel GP data, which might be explained by a more vulnerable included patient population and a higher coverage rate in the Netherlands. RSV-type dominance alternates every one or two seasons. Over time, there is only little, negligible, variation in the age distribution of RSV.
