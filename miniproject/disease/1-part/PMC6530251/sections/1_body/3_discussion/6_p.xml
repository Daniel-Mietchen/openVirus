<p>A limitation of the virological laboratory surveillance data is the absence of a denominator, e.g. the number of tested patients, the criteria used for testing, and any clinical data from the included patients. From a previous study on data from 2001 to 2008 we assumed these data were mainly from children less than 6â€‰months of age [

However, absence of clinical data limits possibilities to evaluate potential changes since 2008 in the age distribution of RSV-positive patients included in the virological laboratory surveillance data, which might have changed as a result of increasing awareness of the contribution of RSV to respiratory illness in adults and in particular in the most elderly. Nevertheless, by using both sentinel GP and virological laboratory surveillance data and three different methods to assess seasonality we attempted to strengthen the precision of our analysis, resulting in interchangeable seasonality patterns.
