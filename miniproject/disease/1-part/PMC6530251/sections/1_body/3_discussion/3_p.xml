<p>As MEM largely depends on the type of data and MEM settings that are used, transparency in the settings and data handling is essential and should be chosen based on sound argumentation [
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Sensitivity and specificity should be well balanced to minimise false starts of the epidemic due to the regular noise at the beginning of the epidemic period on the one hand and to include a high percentage of all detections within the epidemic period on the other hand. Our usage of expert opinion to optimise the settings of MEM appeared to be a valuable and transparent approach in a situation where MEM is first used for other pathogens or other epidemic patterns.
