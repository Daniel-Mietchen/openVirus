<p>The objectives of this study were to determine whether the MEM is suitable for use in RSV surveillance and to thoroughly evaluate RSV seasonality over 12 consecutive seasons (2005/06 through 2016/17) in the Netherlands by using virological laboratory surveillance data and sentinel general practitioner (GP) surveillance data. For sentinel GP surveillance data, we analysed the occurrence of RSV-A and -B and the distribution of RSV infection in different age groups within the 12 consecutive seasons and assessed whether these distributions changed over time.</p>
