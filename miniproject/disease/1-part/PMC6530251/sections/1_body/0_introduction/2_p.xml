<p>To guide future priority setting and decision making by national policymakers and immunisation advisory groups, widespread national sentinel data can allow to further understand RSV epidemiology and to better define groups at risk of RSV [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Reliable epidemiological data can moreover provide a baseline to assess possible future RSV immunisation effects, as one of the candidate vaccines currently in development for RSV might become available within a few years from now [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In order to identify potential risk groups for a complicated course of infection, sentinel data [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are needed to complement the currently available evidence resulting from studies that focus on either adults or children [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], immunocompromised [
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], chronically ill persons [
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or hospitalised patients [
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Sentinel data are also relevant for studies modelling RSV epidemiology [
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Europe, over the past 15â€‰years, several large surveillance systems have already been deployed, but have mainly focused on children [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
