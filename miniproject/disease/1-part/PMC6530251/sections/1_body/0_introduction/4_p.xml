<p>Indeed, the common use of a certain percentage of RSV positivity among all RSV detections in a season as a threshold to define an epidemic [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] does not provide insight in the intensity of the epidemic and cannot be employed prospectively to signal the start of an epidemic. For influenza, another viral respiratory disease, another approach, the moving epidemic method (MEM), is widely used to calculate epidemic thresholds [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This method has the advantage of allowing the calculation of intensity levels and can be used prospectively.
