<p>Apart from risk-group identification, reliable epidemiological RSV data may reveal seasonal patterns like the timing, length and peak of the RSV season with importance for awareness, prevention and treatment. Meteorological factors, latitude and co-infection or competition with other respiratory viruses may play an important role in RSV seasonality [

 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although seasonality of RSV at a European level has been evaluated, the available data do not enable to combine seasonal information with RSV-type and important patient characteristics such as age [
