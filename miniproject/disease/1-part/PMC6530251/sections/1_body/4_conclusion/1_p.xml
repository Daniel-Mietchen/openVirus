<p>The current study introduced and validated MEM for characterising RSV epidemics [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This method has great potential in both clinical practice and surveillance as it enables to determine thresholds based on historical data and to monitor prospectively, nearly in real-time, the start, duration, timing and intensity of an upcoming RSV epidemic [
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Virological and sentinel surveillance data analyses conducted as part of this study indicate that in the Netherlands RSV infections follow a fairly uniform pattern within the general population in terms of length of the epidemic season and distribution among age groups, with the highest incidence in children &lt; 5 years old and elderly aged &gt; 65 years. Since 2005, the percentage of RSV positives among ILI/ARI patients within sentinel GP surveillance has increased. The timing of the epidemic RSV period has an amplitude-like pattern, which is uncorrelated with the RSV-type dominance that alternates every 1–2 seasons. The findings in this report potentially allow better comparisons of RSV epidemics between years, regions and countries. They also provide an epidemiological base for RSV awareness, which in turn could lead to enhanced detections of infections in both primary and secondary care (particularly for infants and the elderly) and to adequate treatment of the RSV patients identified (e.g. with antivirals such as ribarivin and passive immunisation with palivizumab in severely ill patients and premature infants, respectively). The results can be helpful for national policymakers and immunisation advisory groups to guide priority setting and provide baseline data for assessing any future vaccination programmes.
