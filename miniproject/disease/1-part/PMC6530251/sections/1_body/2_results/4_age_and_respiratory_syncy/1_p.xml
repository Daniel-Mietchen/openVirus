<p>For applicability and clear interpretation, age was divided into eight age groups (sentinel data). RSV incidence was highest in the age group 0–1 years (26.2%) and lowest in age group &gt;15–45 years (2.1%) (

Taking the &gt;15–45 year olds as reference group, the ORs for RSV positivity for the other age categories were 16.7 (95% CI: 12.7–22.1) for 0–1 years, 14.5 (95% CI: 10.7–19.5) for &gt;1–2 years, 6.9 (95% CI: 5.2–9.1) for &gt;2–5 years, 2.0 (95% CI: 1.4–2.7) for &gt;5–15 years, 2.2 (95% CI: 1.7–2.9) for &gt;45–65 years, 3.0 (95% CI: 2.2–4.1) for &gt;65–75 years and 3.9 (95% CI: 2.7–5.6) for patients &gt; 75 years.
