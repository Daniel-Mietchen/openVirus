<p>In virological laboratory surveillance data, RSV was reported 25,491 times from week 30 in 2005 (25 July) through week 29 in 2017 (until 24 July). In sentinel GP data, RSV was reported in 767 (5.6%) of 13,577 included patients, of whom 401 (3.0%) were RSV-A and 366 (2.7%) were RSV-B positive. Within sentinel GP data, the percentage of RSV positives per season increased over the 12 seasons (p &lt; 0.001) (

RSV positive patients were significantly younger than RSV negative patients with a median age of 11.6 (IQR: 1.5–54.3) years vs 36.8 (IQR: 16.4–54.2) years (p &lt; 0.001). RSV occurred more frequently among immunocompromised patients (9.4%; 14/149) than among immunocompetent patients (5.6%; 753/13,428) (p = 0.046). Among ILI patients 5.1% (365/7,160) of patients was RSV positive, whereas among other ARI patients 6.3% (402/6,417) was RSV positive (p = 0.003).
