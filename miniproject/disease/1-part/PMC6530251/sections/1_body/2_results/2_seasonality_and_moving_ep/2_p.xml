<p>Using MEM, the average epidemic length was 18.0 weeks (95% CI: 16.3–19.7), covering 91.5% (95% CI: 90.2–92.2%) of all RSV diagnoses during the season. Using the predefined threshold of 1.2%, the average epidemic period lasts 18.8 weeks (95% CI: 17.8–19.9) and covered 92.4% (95% CI:  91.5–93.2%) of all RSV diagnoses. Using the threshold of 20 detections per week, the average season lasted 19.8 weeks (95% CI: 18.7–20.8) and covered 93.3% (95% CI: 92.2–94.3) of all RSV diagnoses. </p>
