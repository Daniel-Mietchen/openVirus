<p>On average, RSV was detected 2,125 (95% CI: 1,701–2,549) times per season (week 30–29). The average MEM pre- and post-epidemic thresholds were 25 and 37 RSV diagnoses per week, respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows graphs of RSV epidemic periods, MEM intensity levels and the average epidemic MEM curve for virological laboratory surveillance data. The epidemic period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) was sometimes shorter than the period of low intensity near the end of the epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>), since the post-epidemic threshold was higher than the low intensity threshold. For example, for 2005/06 MEM determines the RSV season to end in week 9, but the low level intensity continues until week 10.
