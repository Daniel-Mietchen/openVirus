<p>To describe seasonality of RSV, both virological laboratory and sentinel GP data of 12 consecutive seasons were used. A season was defined from week 30 through week 29 of the following year to capture at least 10 weeks of assumed background noise before and after the epidemic. Characteristics of epidemics in each season were assessed using three methods: (i) epidemic thresholds at 1.2% of the cumulative number of RSV-positive patients per season [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], (ii) epidemic thresholds at 20 detections per week (used only for laboratory data) – which is used in daily practice at the RIVM [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and (iii) epidemic thresholds using MEM [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For each method we calculated (i) the mean length of the epidemic period, defined as the number of weeks from the first week above the pre-epidemic threshold through the last week above the post-epidemic threshold, (ii) the mean starting and ending week (e.g. timing) of the epidemic period, (iii) the mean timing of the peak week and (iv) the coverage of the epidemic and peak week, defined respectively as the percentages of RSV detections during the determined epidemic period and the peak week relative to all RSV detections during the season (week 30 through 29 of the next year). The RSV epidemic period was defined as the longest period during the season above the threshold, without interruptions for laboratory data and with interruptions of 1 week maximum below or at the threshold for sentinel GP data. The peak week was defined as the first week during the epidemic period with the maximum absolute number of RSV detections per week during that season. Epidemic thresholds and intensity levels were rounded down to the closest integer. All other numbers, including week numbers, were rounded up or down according to the normal rounding rules.
