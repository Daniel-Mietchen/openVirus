<p>According to Dutch legislation, surveillance of ILI/ARI is registered in the Personal Data protection Act Register of the Personal Data Protection Commission. For anonymised studies based on specimens collected through this surveillance no specific ethical approval is needed. Nevertheless, GPs are requested to ask participants (or, for those unable to provide consent, their relatives) informed consent for further anonymised research use of collected specimens and clinical data and register this on the specimens form. None of the patients from whom specimens and data are used in this study objected to further use.</p>
