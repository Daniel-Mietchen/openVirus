<p>Distribution of RSV by age was evaluated using sentinel GP data. The mean ages of RSV positive patients vs RSV negative patients were compared using a two-sided independent sample t-test. For clinical applicability, age was not used as continuous variable, but as categorical variable using eight different age groups: 0–1 years, &gt;1–2 years, &gt;2–5 years, &gt;5–15 years, &gt;15–45 years, &gt;45–65 years, &gt;65–75 years, &gt; 75 years. Percentages of RSV positives per age group were compared using a chi-squared test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Odds ratios (OR) for RSV positivity were calculated using a logistic regression model using the age group with the lowest proportion RSV positives as reference group. Variability of age distributions among RSV positive patients over the 12 consecutive seasons was assessed visually using spaghetti plots for RSV. The distribution of RSV-A vs RSV-B was calculated per season, after which RSV-A or RSV-B dominance or co-dominance was established using the 60/40 rule used in influenza surveillance [
