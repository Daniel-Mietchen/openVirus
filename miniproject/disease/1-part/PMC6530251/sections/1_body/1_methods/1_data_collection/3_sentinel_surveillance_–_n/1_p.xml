<p>Sentinel surveillance data in the Netherlands are assembled in the primary care database of the Netherlands institute for health services research (NIVEL) [
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the sentinel surveillance, participating GPs collect for viral diagnostics nose and throat swabs from a subset of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) or another ARI according to Dutch definitions (

The swabs are screened for enterovirus, influenza virus, rhinovirus and RSV at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, which is the centre for infectious disease control in the country. The population of the 40 sentinel practices covers ca 0.8% of the Dutch population [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and is nationally representative for age, sex, regional distribution and population density (

 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics from the individual patients are obtained using a standardised questionnaire filled by the GPs. Details on the sampling strategy, e.g. instructions for the GP, are described in

 <italic>.</italic> Since the duration of RSV shedding in an outpatient setting is reported to be on average 9.8 ± 4.8 days for adults [
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and can be even higher in children (especially of very young age) and immunocompromised patients [
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], patient samples were only included in the analysis when the PCR sample was taken within 14 days after start of symptoms. International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-weeks, years and seasons were determined using the day of sampling. Missing values for immune status were imputed using a multiple imputation model including all other clinical variables, further described in
