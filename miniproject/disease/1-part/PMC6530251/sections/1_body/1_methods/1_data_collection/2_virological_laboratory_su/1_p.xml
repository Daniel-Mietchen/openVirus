<p>Virological laboratory surveillance data consisted of virology diagnostic reports, which are established in the Netherlands since 1964 [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These data consist of positive virological laboratory diagnostic results of 31 virus species with some distinct (sub)types and serotypes. Some intracellular growing bacteria are also reported. The reports are generated weekly in an online registration system by up to 21 participating Dutch laboratories, which are all members of the Working Group for Clinical Virology of the Dutch Society for Medical Microbiology. The participating laboratories are spread all over the country (

 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The data in the weekly reports are based on outcomes of diagnostic tests, either virus isolation, antigen test, PCR or serological test, performed by these laboratories upon request from GPs, clinical departments in hospitals, and outpatient clinics. Apart from the number of RSV diagnoses per week, no further information on individual patients is collected. However, based on an inventory study, we assume that these RSV virological laboratory surveillance data mainly come from very young children, mostly below the age of 6 months [
