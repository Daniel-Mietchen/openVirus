<p>We used absolute numbers since the number of reporting sites remained similar and the number of tested samples remained relatively stable over time (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, due to low sample numbers at the beginning and end of the season, relative numbers may be subject to important variations concerning the epidemic and intensity thresholds, which can potentially lead to false alerts.
