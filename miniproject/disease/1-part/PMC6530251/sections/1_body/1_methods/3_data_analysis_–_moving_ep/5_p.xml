<p>We calculated the mean length, timing and coverage of the epidemic period by calculating pre-and post-epidemic thresholds using the arithmetic mean and its one-sided 95% point confidence interval (CI). We also calculated epidemic intensity levels using the geometric mean and its one sided 40% (medium), 90% (high) and 97.5% (very high) point CI. The validity of MEM epidemic thresholds for detecting the epidemics was calculated using cross validation, reflected as sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values. All calculations are included in the application.</p>
