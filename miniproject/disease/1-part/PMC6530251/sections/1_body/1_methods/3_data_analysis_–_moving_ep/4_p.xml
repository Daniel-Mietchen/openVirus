<p>Manually optimised slope parameters were determined for both datasets separately using a slope range setting from 0.1 to 4.0. Sensitivity and a minimal epidemic percentage of 90% were used to determine the optimum, to be able to detect the start of the epidemic season at an early stage without creating too many false signals. Four researchers with expertise in surveillance (JL, TV, AM and LV) independently performed manual optimisation after which any discrepancies were solved by consensus. After determination of the optimal slope parameters − 1.4 for both datasets − the final analysis was done.</p>
