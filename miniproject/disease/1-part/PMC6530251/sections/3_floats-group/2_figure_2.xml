  <p>Laboratory surveillance data-based representation of (A) seasonal RSV epidemics, (B) seasonal epidemic intensity levels determined by MEM and (C) average epidemic MEM curve, Netherlands, 2005/06–2016/17 (n = 25,491 RSV positive samples)</p>
 </caption>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">MEM: moving epidemic method; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus.</p>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">A. Length and timing of the epidemic period per season (coloured horizontal lines) and timing of the peak (black dots) obtained using three different methods: (i) 1.2% of total number of RSV positives per season, (ii) 20 detections per week and (iii) the MEM method with an optimised slope parameter of 1.4.</p>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">B. Heat map showing the different levels of intensity given by the MEM method for each season: baseline (≤25 RSV diagnoses/week; green), low (26−175 RSV diagnoses/week; yellow), medium (176−286 RSV diagnoses/week; orange), high (287−355 RSV diagnoses/week; red) and very high (≥356 RSV diagnoses/week; purple).</p>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">C. Average epidemic curve over the overall study period given by the MEM method (MEM web application) with start (first week above pre-epidemic threshold, indicated with a red dot) and end (first week below post-epidemic threshold, indicated with a green dot) of the epidemic period and the three different intensity thresholds (medium, high, very high). </p>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">Note that for 2010 and 2016 week 1 is actually week 53 of 2009 and 2015 respectively, and week 2 actually is week 1 of 2010 and 2016 respectively.</p>
