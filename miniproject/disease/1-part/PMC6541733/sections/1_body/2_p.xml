<p>Multiple mechanisms could explain the development of bacterial disease following influenza. The virus is cytolytic and induces epithelial damage, impairment of surfactant production and muco-ciliary clearance [

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Exposure of the basement membrane and matrix offers binding sites for bacteria [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; glycan receptors can be revealed by viral and bacterial neuraminidases [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, the increased secretion of galectin 1 and galectin 3 can favor the adhesion of

 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Murine models indicate that host sialic acid, released by neuraminidases, can also act as a nutrient for pneumococci in the upper airway, promoting bacterial spread [
