<p>DNA was extracted from swabs using the MoBio Power Soil isolation kit (MoBio laboratories). Barcoded primers were used to amplify ~500 bp from the V1-V3 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Amplification conditions were 5 minutes at 95°C, then 25 cycles of 95°C for 45 seconds, 53°C for 45 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute 30 seconds, with a final step of 72°C for 15 minutes. The products were analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer after purification with QIAquick (Qiagen) and were quantified by Quant-iT Picogreen (Invitrogen). The samples were pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced using a Roche 454 GS-FLX Titanium platform.
