 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> was isolated by plating to GC selective medium (Oxoid). A 413 bp fragment-encoding RplF was amplified, sequenced, and identified with PubMLST [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Meningococcal isolates were characterized by serogrouping, serotyping, and serosubtyping. To detect the pneumococcus, 
 <italic>lytA</italic> qPCR was performed, as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
