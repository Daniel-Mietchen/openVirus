<p>A sequence dissimilarity distance of 0.015 was used to cluster sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), using the average neighbor algorithm. Taxonomies were assigned using the HOMD reference dataset. The richness of communities was calculated using the Chao1 and Catchall indices [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and diversity was estimated with the Simpson’s inverse [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Shannon [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] indices. Good’s non-parametric estimator was used to assess the coverage of communities in samples [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The species diversity was examined by analyzing the beta diversity. Samples were adjusted to 2997 reads per sample by random sampling. Distance matrices were generated with the Jaccard Index and the thetaYC measure of dissimilarity [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Dendrograms, representing the relationships between samples, were analyzed by parsimony and UniFrac [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
