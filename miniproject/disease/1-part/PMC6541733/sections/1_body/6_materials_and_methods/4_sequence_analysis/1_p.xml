<p>The quality of sequences was assessed using FastQC v0.11.3 (Babraham Institute). The pre-processing of sequences was performed with mothur v1.35.1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Next, we used trim.flows to remove sequences with mismatches in the primer sequence or barcode. Sequences were de-noised by shhh.flows, trimmed to remove primers and barcodes, then aligned to the SILVA 16S rRNA reference alignment using trim.seqs; chimeric sequences were eliminated by Uchime [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Sequences were used to interrogate the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) v13.2 at the 98.5% identity level using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). met the following criteria: read length &gt;375 nucleotides (nt). (excluding barcode and primers), no ambiguous bases, or homopolymers of &gt;8 nt.
