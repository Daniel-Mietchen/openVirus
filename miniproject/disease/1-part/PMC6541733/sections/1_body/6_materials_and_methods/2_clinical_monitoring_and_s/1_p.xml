<p>Volunteers recorded symptoms daily, and vital signs were recorded 3 times daily. Nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and venous blood were collected on days âˆ’1, 3, 6, and 28. Respiratory specimens were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and serological specimens were analysed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization assays. Laboratory-confirmed influenza was defined as either a 4-fold or greater rise in HAI or microneutralization titres between day -2 and day 28 or a positive nasopharyngeal test by PCR.</p>
