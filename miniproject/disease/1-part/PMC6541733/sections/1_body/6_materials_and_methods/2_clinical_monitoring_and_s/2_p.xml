<p>Volunteers were classified according to symptoms and signs. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition, as an illness lasting ≥24 hours with either a temperature of &gt;37.9°C or 2 or more symptoms, at least 1 of which was a respiratory symptom. Volunteers were labeled as symptomatic if they experienced symptoms with no fever; experienced a single symptom; had ≥2 symptoms, none of which were respiratory; or had an illness of &lt;24 hours. Therefore, a volunteer could have an ILI or be symptomatic and not be infected with influenza. Individuals were classified according to their symptomatology and tests into 3 groups: the ILI
 <sup>flu+</sup> group consisted of subjects who received the viral challenge and had an ILI, with evidence of an influenza infection (n = 19); the S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group consisted of subjects who received the viral challenge and were symptomatic, with evidence of an influenza infection (n = 14); and the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group consisted of individuals belonging to both these groups (n = 33). Those who were not challenged with influenza and remained asymptomatic/influenza-negative formed the AC (asymptomatic control) group (n = 24).
