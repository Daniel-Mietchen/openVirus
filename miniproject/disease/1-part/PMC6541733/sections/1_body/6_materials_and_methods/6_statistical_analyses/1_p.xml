<p>An analysis of alpha diversity was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunnâ€™s correction for multiple comparisons. An analysis of molecular variance was used to evaluate differences in PCoAs [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Parsimony tests were implemented by mothur [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size was used to examine differences in OTUs in the control/challenged groups [
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; the alpha values were set to 0.05 and a LDA score of 2.5 was selected. A 2-tailed Fisher exact test was applied to compare colonization rates.
