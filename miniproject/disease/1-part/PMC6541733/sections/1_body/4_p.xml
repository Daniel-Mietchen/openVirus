<p>Several factors influence the microbiome, including age, smoking, and antibiotic treatment [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18â€“20</xref>]. Furthermore changes in the microbiota are associated with airway disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, healthy volunteers were reported to have a more diverse nasopharyngeal microbiome compared with patients suffering from pneumonia [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], while a highly diverse community is found in patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, little is known about the impact of viral infection on the microbiota. No specific profiles of bacteria in the upper respiratory tract (URT) were associated with any of 7 different viral infections, although an apparent decrease in the carriage of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>Neisseria</italic> was observed after rhinovirus [
