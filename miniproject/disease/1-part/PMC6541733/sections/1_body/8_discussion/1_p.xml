<p>We performed the first prospective characterization of bacterial communities within the human URT during influenza infection. Previous studies have examined changes in the microbiota following challenges with other viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and found only minor changes in certain bacterial genera. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies have characterized the microbiomes of patients with influenza [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However we are not aware of a previous study that examined individuals during a defined influenza challenge.
