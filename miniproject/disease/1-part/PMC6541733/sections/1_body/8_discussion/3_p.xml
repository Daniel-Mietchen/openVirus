<p>The microbiotas were dominated by 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusobacteria</italic>, which include species that can cause influenza-associated pulmonary disease. However, during the acquisition of influenza, the profile of the URT microbiome remained remarkably stable. Although we detected no large shift in the bacterial population at the genus level, there was an increase in the abundance of 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> in the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group at days 3 and 28, a key time of secondary bacterial infection; although 
 <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> was associated with this increase, little is known about its role in respiratory disease.
