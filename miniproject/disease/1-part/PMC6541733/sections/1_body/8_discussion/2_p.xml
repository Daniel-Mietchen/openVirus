<p>We detected slight perturbations in the upper respiratory microbiota following a challenge with influenza A. There was a high level of inter-individual variation in the upper respiratory microbiome, a common feature of human studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We found that the microbiota contains at least 11 phyla, with 5 (
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacterioidetes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>) constituting the core microbiome, as in a previous study [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and with 
 <italic>Fusobacteria</italic> highly prevalent (accounting for 24.2% of all OTUs) [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
