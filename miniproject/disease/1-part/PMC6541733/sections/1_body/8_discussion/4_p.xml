<p>Overall, our study does not provide evidence that influenza infection has a marked impact in shaping the pharyngeal microbiome. However, certain factors might be responsible for this. Participants were healthy adults, who do not generally suffer secondary bacterial infections; studies in at-risk individuals might reveal more significant changes in the microbiome, although they would pose serious ethical issues. In addition, other effects might become evident in a larger study. Furthermore, 16S rRNAâ€“based methods are limited, lacking species-level resolution for particular genera, including 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Neisseria</italic>. Even though cohort studies have established a relationship between influenza and the rate of pneumococcal carriage, we did not find differences in pneumococcal carriage following an influenza infection. For the meningococcus, we also examined capsule expression, as this virulence factor is only expressed by a subset of strains [
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, there was no alteration in the rate of carriage of encapsulated or non-encapsulated 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> with the advent of an influenza infection. We did not examine swabs for the presence of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as this secondary bacteria pathogen follows influenza far less frequently than 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and is associated with severe disease rather than milder infections, such as that represented by our challenge.
