<p>To further understand secondary bacterial infections, we investigated the impact of the influenza virus on the human nasopharyngeal microbiome. Using 454 pyrosequencing, we characterized the microbiota over a 30-day period in 52 healthy adults challenged with influenza A H3N2 and in 32 non-challenged individuals. This approach allowed us to define changes in the human microbiome following an influenza challenge. Furthermore, we examined whether influenza affected the carriage of pathogens in the upper airways.</p>
