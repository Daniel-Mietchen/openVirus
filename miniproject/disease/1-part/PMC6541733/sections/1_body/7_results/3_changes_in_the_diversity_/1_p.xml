<p>Coverage of bacterial communities was high (mean 97.6% Â± 0.007%), with samples having an average of 161 OTUs (range 63 to 321). The number of OTUs at each time point was not significantly different between groups (asymptomatic controls vs ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup>,

 <sup>flu+</sup> group, with no significant difference compared with asymptomatic controls (

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) than the recorded OTUs. The non-parametric estimator Catchall yielded a median of 437 OTUs per sample (range 66 to 2643). There were no significant differences in the richness of the between the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group and asymptomatic control groups (
