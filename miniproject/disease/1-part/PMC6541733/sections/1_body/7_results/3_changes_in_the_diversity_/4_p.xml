<p>The community structure and membership was also visualized by PCoA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Small differences were found in the structure of communities in the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> and AC groups at day 3 and day 6 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .035 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .033, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Differences were not found in the memberships. The community structure was also examined for each group over time (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>); at day 6, the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group showed a statistically significant difference compared to baseline (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .036), while in the AC group, days 3, 6, and 28 each showed some statistically significant difference compared to baseline (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that quarantine might have effects on the URT microbiome.
