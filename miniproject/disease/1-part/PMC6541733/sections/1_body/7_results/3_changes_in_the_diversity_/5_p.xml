<p>By LDA effect size analysis, the abundance of some OTUs was significantly different between groups on days 3 and 6 post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The OTUs which were more abundant within the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group at day 3 included OTU11 (
 <italic>Prevotella melaninogenica</italic>), OTU14 (
 <italic>Leptotrichia</italic>), OTU38 (Human Oral Taxon 352), and OTU38 (
 <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>), while OTU42 (
 <italic>Burkholdiales</italic>) and OTU6 (
 <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> HOT218) were more abundant within the AC group. At day 6, OTU18 (
 <italic>Fusobacterium necrophorum</italic>) and OTU37 (
 <italic>Prevotella</italic>) were significantly more abundant in individuals in the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group.
