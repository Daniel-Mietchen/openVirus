<p>Next, we assessed differences between samples. Dendrograms were generated, highlighting similarities of the membership and structure of communities using Jaccard and thetaYC indices, respectively. At the 4 time points, results for certain individuals clustered together (eg, individual S
 <sup>flu+</sup> individual 2, ILI
 <sup>flu+</sup>6, S
 <sup>flu+</sup>7, S
 <sup>flu+</sup>10, ILI
 <sup>flu+</sup>11, S
 <sup>flu+</sup>12, ILI
 <sup>flu+</sup>13, S
 <sup>flu+</sup>17, ILI
 <sup>flu+</sup>28, AC61, and AC65), indicating that the individual had a stronger influence on the microbiome than did influenza, with samples from 4 time points clustering together (

 <sup>flu+</sup> and AC groups, with slight differences on days 3, 6, and 28 (
