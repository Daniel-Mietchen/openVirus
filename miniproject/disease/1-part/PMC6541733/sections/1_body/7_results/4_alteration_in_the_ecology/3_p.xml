<p>With regard to the genus level, 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> was a core component of the microbiome, accounting for 21.8% of bacteria, with 
 <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> also abundant (comprising 15.4% and 9.9%, respectively). 
 <italic>Neisseria</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> each accounted for 2â€“5% of the microbiota (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Differences were identified between the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> and AC groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), with a significant increase in the relative abundance of 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> on days 3 and 28 in the challenged group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and an increase in 
 <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> by day 28 in the challenged group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Within the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group, a minor increase in 
 <italic>Actinomyces</italic> was observed at day 6 post-infection (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and, in parallel, 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> decreased (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01;
