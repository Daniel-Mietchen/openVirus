<p>The abundance of each phylum remained remarkably constant following the influenza challenge. There was a significant change in the 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> levels, which increased in the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group at day 3 post-infection, as compared to the AC group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We also analyzed changes over the time. Within the ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> group, there was a significant change in the abundance of 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, which increased by day 6 compared to baseline (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and returned to basal levels by day 28 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> levels also increased between days 6 and 28 post-infection in the control group (

 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (
