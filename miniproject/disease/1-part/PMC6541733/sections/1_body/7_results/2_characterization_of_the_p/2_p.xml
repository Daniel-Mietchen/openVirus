<p>Initially, we compared ILI/S
 <sup>flu+</sup> (n = 33) and AC (n = 24) individuals. To normalize the dataset, we took 2997 sequences from each sample; 11 samples had fewer than this, so were excluded, leaving 213 samples. We identified 2209 OTUs (based on &lt;98.5% of identity, &gt;4 representatives), with 24% of sequences falling into 3 OTUs: OTU1 (accounting for 9.78% of sequences), with predominant member 
 <italic>Fusobacterium periodonticum</italic>; OTU2 (7.8%), with predominant members 
 <italic>S. salivarus</italic>/
 <italic>S. vestibularis</italic>; and OTU3 (7%), with predominant members 
 <italic>S. mitis</italic>/
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.
