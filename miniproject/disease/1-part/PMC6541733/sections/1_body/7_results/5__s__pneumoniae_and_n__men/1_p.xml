<p>As 16S sequencing often cannot discriminate different species, we analyzed the carriage of 2 important respiratory pathogens: 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. The rate of colonization by encapsulated or non-encapsulated 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> was similar, with no difference between challenged and control individuals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). For 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, 16 of 36 influenza-challenged subjects (31%) and 12 of 23 controls (34%) were positive for 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, using qPCR, at day 3 (
 <italic>P</italic> = .8163).
