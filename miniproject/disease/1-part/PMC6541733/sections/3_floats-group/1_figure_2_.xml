  <p>Analysis of the richness of the URT microbiome. The diversity of the microbiome was analyzed by sequencing the V1-3 region of 16S rRNA amplified from samples obtained from the ILI/S
   <sup>flu+</sup> (white boxes) and asymptomatic control (grey boxes) groups following the influenza A challenge. The box whisker plots extend from the 25
   <sup>th</sup> to 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentiles, and the ends of the whiskers show the maximum and minimum values. The line in the middle of the box represents the median and the dots represent the outliers 1.5 greater or lower than the interquartile distance. The analysis was based on: (
   <italic>A</italic>) the number of OTUs; (
   <italic>B</italic>) Chao1 index; and (
   <italic>C</italic>) Shannon diversity index at baseline, 3 (3dpi), 6 (6dpi) and 28 (28dpi) days post–influenza challenge. Abbreviations: AC, asymptomatic control; dpi, days post–influenza challenge; ILI/S
   <sup>flu+</sup>, subjects who received viral challenge, had laboratory evidence of influenza, and had an influenza-like illness/were symptomatic; OTU, operational taxonomic units; URT, upper respiratory tract.
