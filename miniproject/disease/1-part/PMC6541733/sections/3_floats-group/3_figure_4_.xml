  <p>LEfSe analysis of abundant OTUs in ILI/S
   <sup>
    <bold>flu+</bold>
   </sup> and asymptomatic controls. The positive scale indicates the LDA score (Log10) for the most abundant taxa in the ILI/S
   <sup>flu
    <bold>+</bold>
   </sup> group (green bars), while the negative scale represents the LDA scores for the prevalent taxa in the asymptomatic control group on days (

   <sup>flu+</sup>, subjects who received viral challenge, had laboratory evidence of influenza, and had an influenza-like illness/were symptomatic; LDA, Linear Discriminant Analysis; LEfSe, LDA effect size; OTU, operational taxonomic units.
