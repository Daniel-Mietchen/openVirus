  <p>Throat microbiota structure in the ILI/S
   <sup>flu+</sup> and asymptomatic control groups during the influenza challenge. The PCoA was based on the Thetayc index, comparing the community structures of samples from the ILI/S
   <sup>flu+</sup> infected group (blue open circles) and asymptomatic control (red open circles) groups at days (
   <italic>A</italic>) 3 and (
   <italic>B</italic>) 6. The centroid represents the arithmetic mean for each of the groups, each dot represents the microbiota structure profile for each of the samples, while the ellipses represent the 95% of the samples belonging to each group. Abbreviations: ILI/S
   <sup>flu+</sup>, subjects who received viral challenge, had laboratory evidence of influenza, and had an influenza-like illness/were symptomatic; PCoA, principal co-ordinates analysis .
