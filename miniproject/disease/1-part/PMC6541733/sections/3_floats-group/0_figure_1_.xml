  <p>Study timeline. Volunteers were screened prior to admission to a quarantine unit on the day before receiving an intranasal challenge of influenza A (on day 0), then were followed for 28 days. The volunteers were kept in quarantine for 6 days post-inoculation. Controls were screened and housed in identical conditions, but were not subjected to a viral challenge. Throat swabs were collected at different time points during the study (ie, on days -1, 3, 6, and 28 post-inoculation).</p>
