Bacterial pneumonia caused millions of deaths during influenza epidemics in the 20<sup>th</sup> century [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, 94% of a group of patients who died in the 1918 influenza pandemic had evidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], while 28% of fatalities in New York associated with the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic had bacterial co-infections, with most diagnosed post-mortem [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Several pathogens cause bacterial infection following influenza. Co-infections with <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> were so common that it was initially thought to be the cause influenza [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is the commonest influenza-associated infection [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], while cavitatory <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pneumonia is a severe influenza complication; secondary pneumonia with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus emerged in the 2009 pandemic [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There is also an association between influenza A and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> disease [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Multiple mechanisms could explain the development of bacterial disease following influenza. The virus is cytolytic and induces epithelial damage, impairment of surfactant production and muco-ciliary clearance [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Exposure of the basement membrane and matrix offers binding sites for bacteria [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; glycan receptors can be revealed by viral and bacterial neuraminidases [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, the increased secretion of galectin 1 and galectin 3 can favor the adhesion of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Murine models indicate that host sialic acid, released by neuraminidases, can also act as a nutrient for pneumococci in the upper airway, promoting bacterial spread [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The human microbiome is a complex community that has co-evolved with its host. A healthy microbiota protects against invasion by pathogenic bacteria through colonization resistance, in which the microbiota restricts the growth or attachment of pathogens, either by competing for nutrients and ecological niches, or by direct antagonism [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Several factors influence the microbiome, including age, smoking, and antibiotic treatment [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>]. Furthermore changes in the microbiota are associated with airway disease [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, healthy volunteers were reported to have a more diverse nasopharyngeal microbiome compared with patients suffering from pneumonia [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], while a highly diverse community is found in patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, little is known about the impact of viral infection on the microbiota. No specific profiles of bacteria in the upper respiratory tract (URT) were associated with any of 7 different viral infections, although an apparent decrease in the carriage of <italic>Haemophilus</italic> and <italic>Neisseria</italic> was observed after rhinovirus [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>To further understand secondary bacterial infections, we investigated the impact of the influenza virus on the human nasopharyngeal microbiome. Using 454 pyrosequencing, we characterized the microbiota over a 30-day period in 52 healthy adults challenged with influenza A H3N2 and in 32 non-challenged individuals. This approach allowed us to define changes in the human microbiome following an influenza challenge. Furthermore, we examined whether influenza affected the carriage of pathogens in the upper airways.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study took place in a quarantine facility with informed consent from volunteers, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with United Kingdom regulatory and ethical (Institutional Review Board) requirements.</p><p>Volunteers were screened before study entry.

Respiratory specimens were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and serological specimens were analysed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization assays. Laboratory-confirmed influenza was defined as either a 4-fold or greater rise in HAI or microneutralization titres between day -2 and day 28 or a positive nasopharyngeal test by PCR.</p><p>Volunteers were classified according to symptoms and signs. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition, as an illness lasting &#x02265;24 hours with either a temperature of &#x0003e;37.9&#x000b0;C or 2 or more symptoms, at least 1 of which was a respiratory symptom. Volunteers were labeled as symptomatic if they experienced symptoms with no fever; experienced a single symptom; had &#x02265;2 symptoms, none of which were respiratory; or had an illness of &#x0003c;24 hours. Therefore, a volunteer could have an ILI or be symptomatic and not be infected with influenza. Individuals were classified according to their symptomatology and tests into 3 groups: the ILI<sup>flu+</sup> group consisted of subjects who received the viral challenge and had an ILI, with evidence of an influenza infection (n = 19); the S<sup>flu+</sup> group consisted of subjects who received the viral challenge and were symptomatic, with evidence of an influenza infection (n = 14); and the ILI/S<sup>flu+</sup> group consisted of individuals belonging to both these groups (n = 33).

Previous studies have examined changes in the microbiota following challenges with other viruses [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and found only minor changes in certain bacterial genera. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies have characterized the microbiomes of patients with influenza [<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However we are not aware of a previous study that examined individuals during a defined influenza challenge.</p><p>We detected slight perturbations in the upper respiratory microbiota following a challenge with influenza A. There was a high level of inter-individual variation in the upper respiratory microbiome, a common feature of human studies [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We found that the microbiota contains at least 11 phyla, with 5 (<italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Fusobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacterioidetes</italic>, and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>) constituting the core microbiome, as in a previous study [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and with <italic>Fusobacteria</italic> highly prevalent (accounting for 24.2% of all OTUs) [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The microbiotas were dominated by <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Fusobacteria</italic>, which include species that can cause influenza-associated pulmonary disease. However, during the acquisition of influenza, the profile of the URT microbiome remained remarkably stable. Although we detected no large shift in the bacterial population at the genus level, there was an increase in the abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> in the ILI/S<sup>flu+</sup> group at days 3 and 28, a key time of secondary bacterial infection; although <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> was associated with this increase, little is known about its role in respiratory disease.</p><p>Overall, our study does not provide evidence that influenza infection has a marked impact in shaping the pharyngeal microbiome. However, certain factors might be responsible for this. Participants were healthy adults, who do not generally suffer secondary bacterial infections; studies in at-risk individuals might reveal more significant changes in the microbiome, although they would pose serious ethical issues. In addition, other effects might become evident in a larger study. Furthermore, 16S rRNA&#x02013;based methods are limited, lacking species-level resolution for particular genera, including <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Neisseria</italic>. Even though cohort studies have established a relationship between influenza and the rate of pneumococcal carriage, we did not find differences in pneumococcal carriage following an influenza infection. For the meningococcus, we also examined capsule expression, as this virulence factor is only expressed by a subset of strains [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, there was no alteration in the rate of carriage of encapsulated or non-encapsulated <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> with the advent of an influenza infection. We did not examine swabs for the presence of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as this secondary bacteria pathogen follows influenza far less frequently than <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and is associated with severe disease rather than milder infections, such as that represented by our challenge.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the upper airway microbiota is not reprogrammed by influenza infection, with only minor perturbations in bacterial communities, similar to recent findings with rhinovirus [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Further studies are required to examine the cross-kingdom interactions that are responsible for secondary bacterial infection being a key player in the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s19"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
