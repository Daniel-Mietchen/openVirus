<p>Natural selection may have shaped picornaviral mutation rates in response to extremely dynamic ecosystems (Elena and Sanjuán, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Therefore, this natural low replicative fidelity results in populations that quickly adapt to unexpected changes in the environment, such as immune pressure (Andino and Domingo, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These observations have been conceptualized in the light of quasispecies evolution (Domingo et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This adaptive capacity can be impaired by altering viral mutation rates (Vignuzzi et al., 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Indeed, the first support of the role of replicative fidelity in viral pathogenesis was observed in picornaviruses. Two groups isolated the first antimutator variant of an RNA virus, by serially passaging PV in the presence of ribavirin (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Vignuzzi et al., 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The resistant variant contained a 3Dpol single point mutant (G64S) relatively resistant to lethal mutagenesis leading to (i) populations with lower mutation rates, (ii) reduced genetic diversity, and (iii) attenuated phenotype in mice (Vignuzzi et al., 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Recently, it has been suggested that this attenuation could be partly an outcome of a decrease in the replication speed (Fitzsimmons et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Moreover, genetic engineering of viral polymerases has also identified several low-fidelity variants, called mutator variants (Thompson et al., 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Gong and Peersen, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Gnädig et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Rozen-Gagnon et al., 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). For instance, using FMDV as a model, low-fidelity variants were found to increase mutation frequencies and render these viruses more susceptible to mutagenesis (Xie et al., 
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, the same residue in the 3Dpol of FMDV is responsible to increase or decrease fidelity (Rai et al., 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Thus, picornaviral mutator variants were proven to increase mutation frequencies, decrease viral fitness, and also display an attenuated phenotype. Ostensibly, picornavirus mutation rates have been tuned to be near an upper limit (Crotty et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) yet evading population extinction by the accumulation of deleterious mutations by harmonizing (i) genetic integrity, (ii) genetic diversity, and (iii) replicative speed.
