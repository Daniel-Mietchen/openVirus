<p>Picornaviruses display a great potential for adaptation and evolution, which is primarily dictated by their high mutation rate. Viral progenies are huge in population size and they have short generation times. Thus, the RNA virus population is a dynamic cloud of mutants where the average-consensus sequence of all variants represents the “genotype.” The mutation rate is the number of genetic changes, such as point mutations, insertions, or deletions introduced during viral replication. The first mutation rate measurement on RNA viruses was reported for CVA, disclosing a value of 1 mutation every 10,000 nucleotides copied (Eggers and Tamm,
