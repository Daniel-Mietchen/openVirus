<p>Interestingly, recombination-deficient variants of PV have been identified. These viruses carry amino acid changes in the in 3Dpol that reduce recombination without conferring other detectable replication deficiencies. These non-recombining viruses accumulate a higher number of detrimental mutations, presumably by an inability to purge deleterious mutations, and fewer beneficial mutations (Xiao et al., 
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Lately, the combined approach of mathematical modeling and experimental evolution experiments have predicted the frequency of recombination of picornaviruses such as PV and EV71 (Stern et al.,
