<p>Innate immune response detects foreign RNA using sensing proteins such as RIG-I, MDA-5, and Toll-like Receptor-3. These mediators act in the early control of picornaviral infection (Slater et al., 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the adaptive response mediated by Abs plays the definitive role in the resolution of the infection. Several pieces of evidence support this view as (i) patients with agammaglobulinemia develop chronic infections (Wilfert et al., 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; McKinney et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Kainulainen et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Bucciol et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), (ii) humoral response mediates the protective effect of picornavirus vaccines (Grant et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Sun et al., 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), (iii) mice lacking B-cells cannot clear enteroviral infections (Mena et al., 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), and (iv) passive immunization with Abs is an efficient treatment of HAV infection (Stapleton, 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), although their effectiveness for enteroviral neonatal infections is disputed (Yen et al., 
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Therefore, it appears to be clear that an effective humoral immune response represents the final host weapon to shortcut the viral infection.
