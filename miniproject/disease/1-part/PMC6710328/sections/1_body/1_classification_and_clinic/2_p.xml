<p>RVs are airborne pathogens, while other enteroviruses and HAV use the fecal–oral route (Yin-Murphy and Almond, 
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). RVs cause the common cold, the most prevalent infectious disease worldwide, resulting in uncountable lost days from school and work. Epidemics occur yearly with outbreaks in the winter and spring (Drysdale et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). PV infection targets the central nervous system, destroying nerves and motor neurons, resulting in paralytic poliomyelitis. Until the PV worldwide eradication program based on global vaccination, polio epidemics have been the cause of high morbimortality (Minor, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The so-called “non-polio enteroviruses” (CVs, EVs, and Es) cause several diseases with high morbimortality including meningitis, myocarditis, poliomyelitis-like syndrome, pancreatitis, and possibly the onset of diabetes. Outbreaks are common and have been considered to have pandemic potential (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Pons-Salort et al., 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Hepatitis produced by HAV is a mild disease producing liver damage usually leading to total recovery, but rare, severe cases are fatal in older age individuals. HAV produces large outbreaks probably due to its long 2 to 3 week incubation time (Jacobsen and Wiersma, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).
