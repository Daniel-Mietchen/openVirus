 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> is a large family of vertebrate viruses that produce both clinically asymptomatic infections but often mild and fatal disease. Their current classification includes more than 30 genera and 75 species (Zell et al., 
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), including several human picornaviruses. The genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> comprises seven species infecting humans (enterovirus A-to-D and rhinovirus A-to-C). This genus contains poliovirus (PV), coxsackieviruses A/B (CVA/B), enteroviruses (EV), echoviruses (E), and rhinoviruses (RV). Further serological classification results in hundreds of serotypes. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the sole human-virus species in the genus 
 <italic>Hepatovirus</italic>. Other human picornaviruses include members of the genera 
 <italic>Cardiovirus</italic> (Saffold virus—SAFV), 
 <italic>Cosavirus</italic> (CoSV), 
 <italic>Parechovirus</italic> (Ljungan virus—LV), 
 <italic>Kubovirus</italic> (Aichi virus—AiV), and 
 <italic>Salivirus</italic> (Salivirus A—SaVA) (Nielsen et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
