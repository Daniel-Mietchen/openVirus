<p>Picornaviruses are known to produce a significant amount of procapsids during the infectious cell cycle, which appears as an inefficient way to replicate (Shingler et al., 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This wastefulness looks aggravated considering each polyprotein translation event would lead to a single protomer. Finally, the so-called procapsid may be an off-pathway particle (Cifuente et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Although counterintuitive in appearance, the function of the procapsid could be to act as an immune decoy to enhance the infectivity of mature virions providing an evolutive advantage (Shingler et al., 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In this regard, empty Dane particles also have been proposed to be decoy particles for the hepatitis B virus (Rydell et al., 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
