<p>Several picornavirus procapsids are larger particles compared to the mature virion and similar in shape to the A-particle. Procapsids have some viral epitopes more accessible and consequently can bind nAbs more efficiently. This phenomenon has been observed for the procapsid and mature virion of EV71, revealing that they are antigenically distinct (Shingler et al., 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Moreover, a non-nAb has been structurally solved in complex with procapsids but not disclosed for the mature virion (Hewat and Blaas, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), which suggests that procapsid may also lead to effects in the modulation of non-nAbs immune response.
