<p>The larger proteins (VP1–3) form the external and internal capsid surface. These proteins have a common fold, the “jelly-roll,” formed by two 4-strand anti-parallel β-sheets and two helices (

 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Belsham et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The capsid external surface displays a rugged topography. Main surface features include (i) a principal protrusion built by the interaction of copies of VP1 forming a star-shaped 5-fold vertex, (ii) a 5-fold surrounding valley called the “canyon,” (iii) a VP2 loop protuberance or the “puff,” (iv) a VP3 loop rise or the “knob,” and (v) a large 2-fold depression (Muckelbauer et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Loop differences result in distinctive surface traits between picornaviruses. Finally, some picornaviruses exhibit a lipid molecule, the “pocket factor,” bound in a cavity located inside the VP1 jelly-roll, which has been observed to play a role in particle stability (
