<p>Inactivated vaccines for PV, HAV, and FMDV are shown to prevent associated illnesses by inducing specific antibody defenses (Salk, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">1957</xref>). Nevertheless, it was the live-attenuated oral PV vaccine (OPV) responsible for most of the success in controlling polio epidemics. PV attenuation was obtained by serial passage in cell lines from non-human hosts (Sabin, 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>). Rare cases of vaccination-derived paralytic disease can occur as well as vaccines shedding of virulent poliovirus revertant (Platt et al.,
