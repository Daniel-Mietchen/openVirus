 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>The diagnosis of influenza A virus is essential since it can be confused with influenza A like illness and lead to inaccurate drug prescription. In this study, the M2e peptide, a strategic antigen that is conserved in all virus subtypes, was used as a diagnostic marker of influenza A. For the first time, M2e-specific IgY antibody was covalently conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme in the presence of glutaraldehyde. The antibody-enzyme bioconjugate was characterized by fluorescence and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, the diagnostic value of this bioconjugate was evaluated by direct sandwich ELISA using nasopharyngeal swab samples positive/negative for H1N1 and H3N2, which were previously analyzed by rRT-PCR for influenza. In conclusion, the M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate demonstrated positive results for Influenza A in samples that were diagnosed as Influenza A via the RT-PCR method.</p>
