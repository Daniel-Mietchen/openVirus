<p>To obtain the M2e-specific IgY antibody, the affinity column was prepared using Carboxylink™ Couplink Gel (Prot: 20266; Thermo Scientific, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), was added and covalently bound to the M2e peptide resin. Then, the IgY antibody was added to the column, and elution of M2e-specific IgY was conducted by changing the pH.</p>
