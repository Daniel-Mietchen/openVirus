<p>Initially, 96-well plates were coated with M2e peptide antigens and incubated overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, the plates were washed three times with PBS-T. Then, the plates were coated with blocking buffer (10 mg/mL BSA) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the washing step was repeated. A 1:100 dilution of the obtained M2e-specific IgY antibody was added to the wells (n = 5) with PBS-T and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the plates were washed with PBS-T, and ALP-conjugated anti-chicken IgY antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) was added at a 1:1000 dilution before the plates were incubated. Finally, 100 µL of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) substrate solution (SIGMAFAST) was added to each well and incubated for 45 min in the dark. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm with a microtiter plate reader (Thermo Labsystems Multiskan Ascent 354 Microplate Photometer).</p>
