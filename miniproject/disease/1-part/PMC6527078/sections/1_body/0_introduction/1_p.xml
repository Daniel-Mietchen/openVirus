<p>Influenza A virus is a viral pathogen associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and it causes several epidemics and pandemics every year worldwide, especially in the winter season [
 <xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>] The annual epidemics caused by influenza A can be attributed to major mutations in the HA and NA glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Unlike mutations in HA and NA, the M protein on the surface of influenza A virus is the most conserved structural protein and is similar among influenza A virus species [
 <xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. The M gene of influenza A virus encodes M1 (a capsid protein) and M2 (an ion channel protein) [
 <xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. The M2 protein has a homotetrameric structure and acts as an ion channel that regulates the pH of the viral core and functions in the transportation of protons [
 <xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. The protein is composed of 97 amino acids, which include 24 amino acids in the N-terminus (ectodomain-M2e), a transmembrane domain that contains 19 amino acids, and an intracellular domain that contains 54 amino acids in the C-terminus [
 <xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>].
