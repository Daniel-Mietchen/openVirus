<p>The diagnosis of influenza A virus is required for preventing outbreaks at health centers, outpatient management, and ruling out other influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) [
 <xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>] . Various methods have been used to diagnose influenza A, such as serologic tests, molecular methods, viral culture, and rapid diagnostic tests [
 <xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>] . Nevertheless, the rapidity and specificity of diagnosis are vital [
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>] . Among the different diagnostic tests, ELISA is commonly used for the rapid and specific detection of influenza A antigens particularly in clinical applications [
 <xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies are commonly used in sandwich ELISA systems [
 <xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. However, the production of monoclonal antibodies is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, antibodies that are cheaper and easier to produce are needed. IgY antibody, developed as an alternative to monoclonal antibodies, has been used to diagnose several infectious diseases [
