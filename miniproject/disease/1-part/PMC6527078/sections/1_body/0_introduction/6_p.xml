<p>The aim of this study was to covalently conjugate M2e-specific IgY antibody to ALP using glutaraldehyde for the detection of influenza A. The novel structure was characterized by fluorescence and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, a sandwich ELISA was developed to evaluate M2e-specific IgY-ALP conjugation and validate nasopharyngeal specimens tested positive for influenza A by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR).</p>
