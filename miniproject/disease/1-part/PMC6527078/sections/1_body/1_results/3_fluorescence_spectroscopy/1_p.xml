<p>Antibodies contain hundreds of amino acid residues in their structures. Tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, which are aromatic amino acid residues, exhibit specific fluorescence characteristics. The conjugation reaction of the proteins containing these amino acid residues can be characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy through Stokesâ€™ shift, which can be observed in their characteristic fluorescence spectra.</p>
