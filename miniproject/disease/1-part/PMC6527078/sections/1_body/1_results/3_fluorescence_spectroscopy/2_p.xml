 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(a</xref>) shows the fluorescence spectrum of the M2e-specific IgY antibody. The maximum fluorescence intensity and maximum wavelength of the fluorescence spectrum were 20,400 and 325 nm, respectively. ALP also exhibited fluorescence properties due to the presence of aromatic amino acids. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(b</xref>), the maximum fluorescence intensity and maximum wavelength of the fluorescence spectrum were 27,625 and 307 nm, respectively. The M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate exhibited a specific fluorescence emission spectrum. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(c</xref>), the maximum fluorescence intensity and maximum wavelength of the fluorescence spectrum of the M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate were 20,868 and 330 nm, respectively. The fluorescence spectrum of the antibody-enzyme bioconjugate was different from the characteristic fluorescence spectrum of both the antibody and enzyme. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(d</xref>), a Stokes’ shift of 5 nm was observed in the fluorescence spectrum of the antibody-enzyme bioconjugate compared with that of the free antibody.
