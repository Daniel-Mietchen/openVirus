 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> shows the conjugation reaction of the M2e-specific IgY antibody with the ALP enzyme in the presence of the homobifunctional crosslinker glutaraldehyde. The bioconjugation process involved the primary amine groups of the antibody and the primary amine groups of the enzyme. After the synthesis of the M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate, it was characterized by fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopy.
