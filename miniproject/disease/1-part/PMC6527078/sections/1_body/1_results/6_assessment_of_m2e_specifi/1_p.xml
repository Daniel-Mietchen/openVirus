<p>The activity of the antibody-enzyme bioconjugate was evaluated using the direct ELISA method. To determine the optimal M2e peptide amount for conjugation with M2e-specific IgY antibody for ELISA, preliminary experiments were conducted (data not shown). The results indicated that 20 μg/ml of M2e peptide antigens with a 1:1 ratio of the antibody-enzyme bioconjugate would be optimal.</p>
