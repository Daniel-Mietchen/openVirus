<p>FTIR analysis was performed to clarify whether M2e-specific IgY antibody was conjugated with the ALP enzyme. 
 <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="F0005">5</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="F0006">6</xref> indicate the FTIR spectra of M2e-specific IgY antibody, ALP enzyme, and M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate, respectively. The different characteristic bands that belong to different functional groups have been obtained.
