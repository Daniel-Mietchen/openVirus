<p id="Par6">Recently, we investigated the global transcriptome of the human lung A549 cell line infected with IBV with RNA-seq. We identified 340 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in these cells at 8 h after infection. Among them, we found that type III IFNs (including IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3) were among the top highly up-regulated genes. However, type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) was not significantly up-regulated and not listed among the DEGs. Besides, various antiviral ISGs including almost all known antiviral effectors in the innate immune system, including OAS proteins, MX proteins, IFITM proteins, and viperin (Schneider et al.,
