   <bold>Different gene expression pattern triggered by type I and type III IFNs</bold>. Type III IFNs (IFN-λ3, PDB ID: 5T5W) binding to their heterodimeric receptor composed of IFNλR1 and IL-10Rβ triggers the formation of heterdimeric complex of STAT1 and STAT2 which translocates to the nucleus where it forms ternary complex with IRF9 and form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (IGF3). IGF3 binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and induces the expression of antiviral ISGs. Engagement of type I IFNs (IFN-α2, PDB ID: 3SE3) with their receptor, the heterodimer composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, can also activate the STAT1 homodimer which binds to gamma-activated sequence (GAS) and induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
