<p>Colombia is a hyperendemic country for DENV transmission (1). In 2014, the situation was further complicated with CHIKV circulation (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), followed by ZIKV circulation in 2015 (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This combination of similar viruses circulating in the country presents challenges regarding case confirmation, given the similar clinical presentations and cross-reactivity of DENV and ZIKV in serologic tests. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, two or all three arboviral diseases have co-circulated in Colombia since 2015, with the highest incidence generally reported for dengue. In 2015, CHIKV had the highest incidence of the three viruses, whereas by 2016, the rate of ZIKV had increased and dengue circulation had decreased compared with historical averages. The following departments reported co-circulation of the three viruses: Antioquia, Atlántico, Bolívar, Caldas, Cauca, Huila, Meta, Norte de Santander, Quindío, Risaralda, Santander, Tolima, and Valle del Cauca (
