<p>Furthermore, the introduction of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and the growing trend of urbanization of the Colombian population because of recent violent conflicts in multiple areas further complicate dengue control. Finally, DENV tends to erupt in epidemic cycles every two to three years, but these cycles can be challenging to predict. For example, the epidemics of 1977, 2002, 2007, and 2010 were notable for the high numbers of cases. The 2010 outbreak is considered the most massive registered DENV epidemic in Colombia, with more than 150Â 000 confirmed cases, 217 deaths, and simultaneous circulation of all four serotypes. Interestingly, the number of DENV cases reported in 2015 decreased during the large-scale CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics. Various possibilities might explain this phenomenon. For example, there may have been underreporting of cases during the Zika epidemic because the only institution in Colombia that could do laboratory confirmation was the INS. Another possibility is that mosquitoes are unable to transport and transmit DENV simultaneously with CHIKV and ZIKV.
