<p>DENV infection occurs more frequently in the youngest age groups in Colombia, with the highest incidence being reported in individuals 5 to 14 years of age (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This epidemiological behavior can be explained by the high endemicity of the country, in which people acquire DENV infection at an early age, generating immunity after the first episode. Similar trends can be expected in the future for CHIKV and ZIKV in several Colombian municipalities because of the similar DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV transmission cycles that create the endemic establishment of these arboviruses (
