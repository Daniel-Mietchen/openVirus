<p>In Colombia in 2015, there was a higher incidence of CHIKV than of ZKV and DENV. In 2016, the incidence of ZKV increased, with a subsequent decrease in the frequency of DENV and CHIKV. This situation may reflect a synergistic effect of these viral infections, given that most of the patients reported did not require hospitalization and recovered after a mild clinical course.</p>
