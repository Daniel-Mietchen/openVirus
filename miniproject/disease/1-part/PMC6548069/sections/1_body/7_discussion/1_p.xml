<p>DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV are arboviruses of great concern because of their impact on public health, particularly in countries such as Colombia. Based on DENV endemicity patterns, transmission patterns of these newer arboviruses can be determined. DENV has been the most prevalent arbovirus in Colombia for the last several decades. DENV is a public health priority in Colombia for multiple reasons. Its reemergence and intense transmission, with an increasing tendency toward frequent and severe DENV outbreaks, are particularly concerning. The simultaneous circulation of different serotypes, reintroduction of serotype 3, and infestation by
