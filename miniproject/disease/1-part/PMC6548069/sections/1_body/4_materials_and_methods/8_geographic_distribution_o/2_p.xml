<p>Colombia’s 1991 constitution institutes the country as a unitary republic that is divided administratively and politically into 33 divisions: 32 departments and a capital district, Bogotá. The departments form geographic, cultural, and economic regions. In Colombia, resources pass from the nation to the departments and from departments to the municipalities, except for Bogotá, which receives resources directly from the nation because it is the capital district.</p>
