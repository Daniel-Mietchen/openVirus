<p>Colombiaâ€™s Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) consists of an organized association of users, rules, procedures, and resources (financial, technical, and human) for the collection of data and for the analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of information regarding health events. Among the health concerns that SIVIGILA monitors are dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Information on these diseases flows from clinics and hospitals to organizations responsible for health insurance and to territorial health entities, where data is consolidated and then sent to the National Institute of Health (INS), which is the governing body for health surveillance in Colombia.</p>
