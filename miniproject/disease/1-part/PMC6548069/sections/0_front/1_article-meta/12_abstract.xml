  <title>Objective.</title>
  <p>This study aimed to identify the co-circulation patterns of three viruses (dengue, Zika, and ­chikungunya) in Colombia from 2008 to 2018 by using notification reports provided to the national surveillance system.</p>

  <title>Methods.</title>
  <p>This cross-sectional study was conducted through a review of data for 2008 through 2018 from Colombia’s Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA).</p>

  <title>Results.</title>
  <p>In 2015, when chikungunya was first detected, it had a higher incidence (1 359.0 cases per 100 000 persons) than did the two other diseases. In 2016, when the circulation of Zika virus was first found, the incidence was 296.4 cases per 100 000 persons; that incidence declined dramatically in the next two years. Between 2015 and 2018, there was a substantial decrease in the frequency of dengue circulation, with it going from 334.1 cases per 100 000 persons in 2015 to 90.7 cases per 100 000 in 2017 and 173.1 cases per 100 000 in 2018.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Conclusions.</title>
  <p>The decrease in the number of dengue cases after co-circulation of the three viruses could indicate possible cross-protection. This finding should be further analyzed.</p>
