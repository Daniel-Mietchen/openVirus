<italic>Rice yellow mottle virus</italic> (RYMV) in Madagascar Island provides an opportunity to study the spread of a plant virus disease after a relatively recent introduction in a large and isolated country with a heterogeneous host landscape ecology. Here, we take advantage of field survey data on the occurrence of RYMV disease throughout Madagascar dating back to the 1970s, and of virus genetic data from ninety-four isolates collected since 1989 in most regions of the country to reconstruct the epidemic history. We find that the Malagasy isolates belong to a unique recombinant strain that most likely entered Madagascar through a long-distance introduction from the most eastern part of mainland Africa. We infer the spread of RYMV as a continuous process using a Bayesian statistical framework. In order to calibrate the time scale in calendar time units in this analysis, we pool the information about the RYMV evolutionary rate from several geographical partitions. Whereas the field surveys and the phylogeographic reconstructions both point to a rapid southward invasion across hundreds of kilometers throughout Madagascar within three to four decades, they differ on the inferred origin location and time of the epidemic. The phylogeographic reconstructions suggest a lineage displacement and unveil a re-invasion of the northern regions that may have remained unnoticed otherwise. Despite ecological differences that could affect the transmission potential of RYMV in Madagascar and in mainland Africa, we estimate similar invasion and dispersal rates. We could not identify environmental factors that have a relevant impact on the lineage dispersal velocity of RYMV in Madagascar. This study highlights the value and complementarity of (historical) nongenetic and (more contemporaneous) genetic surveillance data for reconstructing the history of spread of plant viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>phylogeography</kwd><kwd><italic>Rice yellow mottle virus</italic></kwd><kwd>Bayesian statistical framework</kwd><kwd>molecular clock</kwd><kwd>dispersal statistics</kwd><kwd>ecological drivers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">French National Research Agency as an &#x02018;Investissements d&#x02019;Avenir&#x02019;</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-001-01</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003130</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">European Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100010663</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Research Foundation&#x02014;Flanders</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek&#x02014;Vlaanderen</named-content></funding-source><award-id>G066215N</award-id><award-id>G0D5117N</award-id><award-id>G0B9317N</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Less than a decade ago, a methodology for reconstructing the phylogeographic history of viruses on a continuous landscape in a Bayesian statistical framework was introduced (<xref rid="vez023-B38" ref-type="bibr">Lemey et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>). It has increasingly been applied to animal viruses (<xref rid="vez023-B70" ref-type="bibr">Trov&#x000e3;o et&#x000a0;al. 2015a</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bourhy et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B33" ref-type="bibr">Jacquot et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B68" ref-type="bibr">Tian et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>), and in some cases to human viruses (<xref rid="vez023-B27" ref-type="bibr">Faria et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B55" ref-type="bibr">Pybus et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B16" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et&#x000a0;al. 2018a</xref>). In contrast, it has been rarely been applied to plant viruses (<xref rid="vez023-B46" ref-type="bibr">Monjane et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B13" ref-type="bibr">De Bruyn et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B71" ref-type="bibr">Trov&#x000e3;o et&#x000a0;al. 2015b</xref>) although plant immobility may result in a regular virus spread, in particular for plant viruses with short-range vectors. Recently however, the spatiotemporal dispersal of <italic>Rice yellow mottle virus</italic> (RYMV) in mainland Africa was inferred using the continuous diffusion model framework (<xref rid="vez023-B71" ref-type="bibr">Trov&#x000e3;o et&#x000a0;al. 2015b</xref>). The choice of the spatially continuous model for RYMV spread was motivated by the predominance of short-range transmission (<xref rid="vez023-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bakker 1974</xref>) and by the high degree of genetic isolation by distance (<xref rid="vez023-B2" ref-type="bibr">Abubakar et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>). The spatiotemporal estimates indicated the emergence of RYMV at the end of the nineteenth century in Africa followed by an overall regular dispersal over more than a century across West Africa and across East Africa. A natural extension of studies conducted at the continental scale is to apply the spatially continuous model at a country scale (<xref rid="vez023-B39" ref-type="bibr">Levin 1992</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B8" ref-type="bibr">Baudelle and Regnauld 2004</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chave 2013</xref>). An island sufficiently large for the epidemics to develop and isolated enough to prevent recurrent introductions from blurring the dispersal patterns could provide an interesting model system of study (<xref rid="vez023-B12" ref-type="bibr">Cliff and Hagget 1995</xref>). For this reason, we focus on RYMV in Madagascar, a 600,000&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> large country isolated from mainland Africa by the Mozambique canal that is at least 400&#x02009;km wide. Rice is the staple crop in Madagascar (<xref rid="vez023-B73" ref-type="bibr">Van Chi-Bonnardel 1973</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B37" ref-type="bibr">Le Bourdiec 1977</xref>) and RYMV is the main disease of rice (<xref rid="vez023-B60" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Andriamasintseheno 1997</xref>). Scrutinizing the historical spread of RYMV in Madagascar will also help to understand the epidemiology and contribute to control the disease.</p><p>RYMV was first isolated in 1966 in Western Kenya near Lake Victoria (<xref rid="vez023-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bakker 1974</xref>). Since then, RYMV has been detected in almost all rice-producing countries of sub-Saharan Africa (<xref rid="vez023-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abo, Sy, and Alegbejo 1997</xref>), in Madagascar (<xref rid="vez023-B60" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Andriamasintseheno 1997</xref>) and recently in the North-West of Ethiopia (<xref rid="vez023-B58" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). RYMV currently is a major deterrent to rice cultivation in Africa (<xref rid="vez023-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abo, Sy, and Alegbejo 1997</xref>) and in Madagascar (<xref rid="vez023-B60" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Andriamasintseheno 1997</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B58" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>) and has not been detected outside this continent. RYMV has a narrow host range restricted to the two cultivated rice species <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> and <italic>O.glaberrima</italic>, the wild rice species <italic>O.longistaminata</italic> and <italic>O.barthii</italic> and a few related wild <italic>Poaceae</italic> species (<xref rid="vez023-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bakker 1974</xref>). The virus is transmitted by chrysomelid beetles (<xref rid="vez023-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bakker 1974</xref>), by mammals (<xref rid="vez023-B63" ref-type="bibr">Sarra and Peters 2003</xref>), and by contact during cultural practices (<xref rid="vez023-B69" ref-type="bibr">Traor&#x000e9; et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). No evidence of seed transmission has been found in cultivated and wild rice species (<xref rid="vez023-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bakker 1974</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B28" ref-type="bibr">Fauquet and Thouvenel 1977</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B35" ref-type="bibr">Konat&#x000e9;, Sarra, and Traor&#x000e9; 2001</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B4" ref-type="bibr">Allarangaye et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>RYMV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA species of the <italic>Sobemovirus</italic> genus in the <italic>Solemoviridae</italic> family (<xref rid="vez023-B36" ref-type="bibr">King et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>) with a ca. 4,450-nucleotide-long genome organized into five open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref rid="vez023-B65" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f5;mera, Sarmiento, and Truve 2015</xref>). ORF1, located at the 5&#x02032; end of the genome, encodes a small protein (P1) involved in virus movement and in gene silencing suppression. ORF2, which encodes the central polyprotein, has two overlapping ORFs. ORF2a encodes a serine protease and a viral genome-linked protein that determines the virulence. ORF2b, which is translated through a &#x02212;1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism as a fusion protein, encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF4 is translated from a subgenomic RNA at the 3&#x02032; end of the genome and encodes the coat protein (CP). Recently, the presence of a fifth ORF (ORFx), conserved in all sobemoviruses, which overlaps the 5&#x02032; end of the ORF2a in the +2 reading frame, was reported (<xref rid="vez023-B40" ref-type="bibr">Ling et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). The CP gene (ORF4), 720 or 723 nucleotide long (depending on the strain), has been used for the phylogeographic reconstructions. It revealed a high (up to 20% between isolates) and spatially structured diversity with distinct strains in East and West Africa (<xref rid="vez023-B2" ref-type="bibr">Abubakar et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>). Thus far, there is no evidence of intra-ORF4 recombination, with the exception of a localized strain recently found in Western Kenya (<xref rid="vez023-B3" ref-type="bibr">Adego et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). RYMV isolates of Madagascar belong to a specific strain named the S4-Mg strain (<xref rid="vez023-B57" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B50" ref-type="bibr">Ochola et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Due to its economic importance, rice in Madagascar has been subjected to regular phytosanitary surveys, more frequent and comprehensive than in most countries of continental Africa. The first reports of RYMV symptoms by farmers and agricultural advisers date back to the 1970s. In several instances, leaf samples with symptoms were kept dried for years and were found positive a decade later when the first serological tests became available (S. Randrianangaly, unpublished data). By the 1980s, plant pathologists conducted regular surveys throughout the country. Since the 1990s, RYMV presence was not only assessed through symptom expression, but also after mechanical inoculation of susceptible cultivars or by serological agar-gel double-diffusion tests (<xref rid="vez023-B61" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Randrianangaly 1990</xref>). We resumed these surveys between 2003 and 2017 in which RYMV was diagnosed by ELISA and molecular tests. Serological or molecular tests have shown that RYMV is not detected in symptom-free plants, even those collected close to or alongside infected plants. Together, these surveys provide reliable information on the presence/absence of the virus in the visited fields. Results of the field surveys are accessible in scientific journals (<xref rid="vez023-B61" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Randrianangaly 1990</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B60" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Andriamasintseheno 1997</xref>) or in internal reports.</p><p>Analyses of ORF4 sequences from isolates collected since 1966 revealed that RYMV is a fast-evolving pathogen (<xref rid="vez023-B26" ref-type="bibr">Fargette et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). This implies that samples collected over the last few decades may contain information about recent evolutionary dynamics. Such temporally spaced sequence data can, however, only reliably inform evolutionary rate estimates if genetic divergence over the sampling time range, or the so-called temporal signal, can be identified and statistically supported (<xref rid="vez023-B22" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>), and it is now well-recognized that this assumption should be thoroughly tested in order to avoid spurious results (<xref rid="vez023-B29" ref-type="bibr">Firth et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B25" ref-type="bibr">Duch&#x000ea;ne et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B47" ref-type="bibr">Murray et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B59" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). How accurately the spatial patterns of spread can be recovered by phylogeographic methods, on the other hand, remains challenging to evaluate. Recently, key aspects of the phylogeography of RYMV have tentatively been linked to the spatially heterogeneous and rapidly changing rice cultivation in mainland Africa (<xref rid="vez023-B53" ref-type="bibr">Pinel-Galzi et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B71" ref-type="bibr">Trov&#x000e3;o et&#x000a0;al. 2015b</xref>), a historically (<xref rid="vez023-B54" ref-type="bibr">Port&#x000e8;res 1950</xref>)&#x02014;and now genetically (<xref rid="vez023-B42" ref-type="bibr">Ly et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B11" ref-type="bibr">Choi et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>)&#x02014;well documented crop in Africa. However, this link was not significantly supported when appropriate negative controls were used (<xref rid="vez023-B17" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et&#x000a0;al. 2018b</xref>).</p><p>To provide information on the genetic and geographical origin of RYMV in Madagascar, and on whether or not the virus introduction was unique, we examined the phylogenetic relationships of the S4-Mg strain in the light of an expanded full-length sequence dataset that included new strains from East Africa (<xref rid="vez023-B58" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B48" ref-type="bibr">Ndikumana et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B3" ref-type="bibr">Adego et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). By capitalizing on available and newly generated ORF4 sequence data, we also investigated the patterns and dynamics of the spatiotemporal spread of RYMV in Madagascar, we contrasted the phylogeographic inferences against historical knowledge of the RYMV spread in Madagascar, and analyzed the determinants of the velocity with which RYMV invades new regions and migrates within infected areas.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Surveys and sampling</title><p>Madagascar is the fifth largest island in the world. It covers 600,000&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup>, stretches 1,500&#x02009;km from south to north, 500&#x02009;km from east to west, and is isolated from mainland Africa by the Mozambique canal that is at least 400&#x02009;km wide. The landscape is divided into three zones: a high-altitude plateau (1,000&#x02013;2,500&#x02009;m) forms a south-to-north barrier between the wide plains at the west and a narrow coastal zone at the east. The island has several climatic zones, tropical humid at the east, tropical savanna at the north-west, warm semi-arid at the south and south-west, and a subtropical oceanic highland climate in the high plateau of the center of the country (<xref rid="vez023-B21" ref-type="bibr">Donque 1975</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B51" ref-type="bibr">Peel, Finlayson, and McMahon 2007</xref>). With 1,500,000 ha of rice cultivation, rice is the main staple crop of Madagascar. It occupies nearly half of the total cultivated area. Rice is grown in six zones: the north, north-west, and central-western regions, the central part of the Malagasy highlands, the east, and the central-eastern part including the Lake Alaotra basin with its swampy areas, plains, and valleys suited for rice. Rice is also cultivated to a smaller extent in the south of the country. There are four main rice cultivation modes in Madagascar: irrigated rice, rainfed lowland rice, rainfed upland rice, and rice as a first crop after slash and burn. In ratio of cultivated area, irrigated rice is the most important, covering 82 per cent of all area under rice in 2008. About 60 per cent of irrigated rice is transplanted.</p><p>A total of eighty-eight isolates were collected between 2003 and 2017 throughout Madagascar, except from the difficult-to-access Melaky region in the west of the country. The outbreaks were sporadic in the high-altitude plateau in the center of the country. In the extreme south of the country, the disease was detected in 2010 only. We also had access to six isolates collected during surveys in 1989 and 1991 from the Lake Alaotra basin, the Marovoay plains, and the high-altitude plateau near Antananarivo.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 ORF4 and full-length genome RYMV sequence datasets</title><p>ORF4 sequences (720&#x02009;nt) of eighty isolates collected between 1989 and 2010 in Madagascar were retrieved from NCBI GenBank (<xref rid="vez023-B57" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>).

In the first half of the 1980s, disease symptoms were observed in the large rice plains in the northwest of the country (Betsiboka valley, Marovoay, Ambato-Boeny, Mampikony). It was later confirmed by serological tests that the symptoms resulted from RYMV infection (see Section 2). In 1990, RYMV was detected by biological and serological tests in symptom-carrying plants from this region. In the second half of the 1980s, symptoms were observed in the northeast of Madagascar (Vohemar, Sambava, Andapa) and in the central west (Miandrivazo). In 1989, the virus was detected in the Lake Alaotra basin, in the central east, the largest rice producing region of Madagascar (100,000&#x02009;ha). In the first half of the 1990s, symptoms were observed with subsequent virus detection in the central west (Morondava, Maintirano, Melaky district), in the high plateau (Antananarivo), and along the east coast (Vavatenina plains, Toamasina, Mananjary). In the second half of the 1990s, the disease was observed further southeast (Tsivory). Since 2000, the disease has been observed further south, in the southwest (Tandava) and in the southeast (Manakara). RYMV in Madagascar is now present in regions with different climates and where rice is cultivated under different modes (see Section 2), except in the very south of the country (Tsiombe, Beloha, Ampanihy, Ejeda) where it is absent although surrounded by locations where the disease has been present for years. In the high-altitude plateau, the disease remained sporadic, observed near Antananarivo in 2014 only since its first report in 1991. Furthermore, the disease was not found in locations neighboring Antananarivo during surveys conducted the same year (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><fig id="vez023-F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Reconstruction of the continuous spatiotemporal dispersal of RYMV in Madagascar shown from 1989 to 2014 at intervals that capture the major dispersal events.

Accordingly, the disease has crossed ca. 1,500&#x02009;km from the north to the south of Madagascar within ca. 40&#x02009;years, so with an average of about 37&#x02009;km/year.</p><p>The reconstructed epidemic history based on the virus genetic data places the time to the most recent common ancestor (<italic>t</italic><sub>MRCA</sub>) of the sampled RYMV strains in Madagascar around 1983 (95% HPD: 1979&#x02013;87) with an initial spread from the north-western and Lake Alaotra basin to the other regions of the country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Of note, this date range largely overlaps with the <italic>t</italic><sub>MRCA</sub> estimate derived from the Madagascar dataset alone (1981, 95%CI: 1975&#x02013;86). The southwards dispersal occurred along the west and east sides of the country, with few virus exchanges across the high-altitude plateau between the east and west regions. In the high-altitude plateau, where the disease is sporadic, closely related isolates were found nearby the capital Antananarivo at the early (1991) and late stages (2014) of RYMV epidemics. This suggests localized low-level virus persistence in the high plateau rather than recurrent and transient introductions from the Lake Alaotra basin, 200&#x02009;km north, through rice corridors connecting the two regions. Whereas the phylogeographic reconstructions do not infer an origin of the epidemic in the very north of the country, they infer a re-invasion of the northeast around 1995 and of the northernmost part of the country around 2005. The full extent of spread throughout the country was achieved within three decades. The estimated mean wavefront rate was 33&#x02009;km/year (95% HPD: 24.6&#x02013;41.3) which is close to that of 37&#x02009;km per year we deduced from the field surveys.</p><p>In <xref rid="vez023-T1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>, we compare the weighted average dispersal velocity of RYMV in mainland Africa and Madagascar epidemics. Over the time frame of the Madagascar epidemic (the 1983&#x02013;2017 period, i.e. a 35-year-long time slice), the lineage dispersal velocity is similar in Madagascar and East Africa (ca. 14&#x02013;15&#x02009;km/year) and somewhat lower in West Africa (ca. 11&#x02009;km/year) although the uncertainty on the estimates overlaps substantially. At earlier 35-year-long time slices, the lineage dispersal velocity in Madagascar was higher than that of the East Africa epidemic. The mean estimates show a similar trend for West Africa, but the large uncertainty that overlaps with that for the Madagascar estimate prevents us from drawing any firm conclusions about these differences.

Only the elevation raster tested as a conductance factor with the least-cost path model led to both a positive distribution of <italic>Q</italic> values and an associated BF support &#x0003e;3 (BF = 3.8). This means that under the least-cost path model, phylogenetic branch durations tend to be more correlated with environmental distances computed on the elevation raster (treated as a conductance raster) than with environmental distances computed on the null raster. However, while the <italic>Q</italic> distribution is supported, the mean <italic>Q</italic> value remains rather low. A low <italic>Q</italic> value indicates that the tested environmental layer (here the elevation layer) does not better explain the heterogeneity in lineages dispersal velocity than a uniform layer (null raster) that only accounts for the impact of geographic distance. Indeed, using the elevation raster to compute environmental distances with the least-cost path model only increases the correlation with branch durations by &#x0223c;2 per cent, relative to the null raster. Therefore, if high altitude was directly or indirectly associated with higher lineage dispersal velocity, it contributed only marginally to the observed heterogeneity in RYMV dispersal velocity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The geographical distribution of RYMV in continental Africa (<xref rid="vez023-B53" ref-type="bibr">Pinel-Galzi et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>) shows that RYMV can persist in diverse climates, ranging from equatorial, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical climates to warm semi-arid climates (<xref rid="vez023-B51" ref-type="bibr">Peel, Finlayson, and McMahon 2007</xref>). As the spatial distribution of strains in West Africa is structured according to the main climatic zones, it had been hypothesized that this reflected strain adaptation to specific climatic/ecological conditions. Accordingly, these strains had sometimes been referred to as Sahelian strain, savanna or forest strains (<xref rid="vez023-B49" ref-type="bibr">N&#x02019;Guessan et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>). The RYMV epidemiology in Madagascar does not support this hypothesis. Rather, it shows that a single strain, with a restricted genetic diversity, can rapidly spread and infect rice in diverse climates similar to those in continental Africa. Consequently, the spatial structure of the strains in West Africa more likely reflects the patterns generated by successive founder effects and neutral epidemiological processes (<xref rid="vez023-B53" ref-type="bibr">Pinel-Galzi et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B71" ref-type="bibr">Trov&#x000e3;o et&#x000a0;al. 2015b</xref>) rather that adaptation to climates. Although wide, the ecological plasticity of the disease in Madagascar is less than that of rice, its main host species. In particular, RYMV was sporadic in the high-altitude plateau (subtropical oceanic highland climate) and absent in the extreme south of the country with a warm semi-arid climate. In these two regions, the susceptibility of the rice cultivars and the presence of vector beetle species (<xref rid="vez023-B56" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>) suggest that environmental conditions may be unfavorable to disease spread. For instance, low temperature in the high plateau and drought in the south may hinder vector movements and disease spread.</p><p>The S4-Mg strain is a combination of genetic fragments of lineages ancestral to the S4-Ug strains (CP, protease, VPg, and polymerase genes) and an ancestral S4-Et strain (P1 gene), assembled through consecutive recombination events. The S4-Ug and the S4-Et strains are found, respectively, at the East of the Lake Victoria basin and in the northwest of Ethiopia. In contrast, the S4-Mg strain is genetically quite distant from the strains S4-Lm, S5, S6, and S7 found along the Tanzanian coasts, and RYMV has not yet been observed in Mozambique (S&#x000e9;r&#x000e9; and Ndikumana, pers. comm.). Taken together, this indicates that RYMV in Madagascar was not introduced from the closest continental coasts 400&#x02013;1,000&#x02009;km away. Rather, the available data suggest that RYMV virus in Madagascar originates from the very East of Africa. The long distance separating Madagascar from mainland Africa and in particular from the northwest of Ethiopia (&#x0003e;1,000&#x02009;km) points to a mode of transmission not involving the usual short-range beetle-driven dissemination. This long-range, likely unique, introduction, suggests a human-mediated mode of transmission (<xref rid="vez023-B34" ref-type="bibr">Jones 2018</xref>), possibly related to rice trade between continental Africa and Madagascar (<xref rid="vez023-B37" ref-type="bibr">Le Bourdiec 1977</xref>), although any association remains speculative in the absence of a clear pattern.</p><p>RYMV in Madagascar presents an opportunity to study the spread of a plant virus after a single and relatively recent introduction in a large country with a heterogeneous host ecology and landscape. The field surveys and the phylogeographic reconstructions converge on a picture of a regular and rapid southward invasion of the epidemic throughout Madagascar within three to four decades. The most notable difference between the reconstructions of the epidemic lies in the early stages as the presence of the disease in the 1970s in the very north of Madagascar reported by farmers is not captured by our sample of the epidemic. As our sequence dataset contains only a limited number of isolates from this region, it remains difficult to distinguish between the scenario where the initial isolates from the north of Madagascar have no surviving progeny, or that their descendants were not sampled. In addition, the phylogeographic reconstructions capture a re-invasion of the north regions that is difficult to distinguish from ongoing local transmission by traditional surveillance methods. The fast dissemination of RYMV in Madagascar underlines the risk of a rapid diffusion of virulent pathotypes. For instance, isolates which readily overcome the <italic>Rymv1-2</italic> allele of high resistance were found in 2003 in the north-west of Madagascar (<xref rid="vez023-B56" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). With a dispersal of around 15&#x02009;km/year, these virulent isolates can rapidly become, everywhere in the country, a threat to rice cultivation with varieties harboring this resistance genotype. Such risks should be considered in the design of RYMV control strategies (<xref rid="vez023-B32" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000e9;brard et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>).</p><p>The spread of RYMV in Madagascar was faster than that in mainland East Africa at the early stages of the epidemics when the mode and the extent of rice cultivation were unfavorable to virus spread. The dispersal rate increased over time in mainland Africa, possibly reflecting the intensification of rice cultivation favorable to virus spread (<xref rid="vez023-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abo, Sy, and Alegbejo 1997</xref>), so the difference in dispersal velocities between mainland Africa and Madagascar fades towards the present. This is still unexpected considering that several factors can favor RYMV dispersal in Madagascar even more: the dense and continuous rice landscape, endemic beetle vector species such as <italic>Dicladispa gestroi</italic> (<xref rid="vez023-B19" ref-type="bibr">Delucchi 2001</xref>), the regular use of the zebu which disseminates the virus during trampling and through feces, and the high rate of transplanted rice (<xref rid="vez023-B60" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Andriamasintseheno 1997</xref>). Yet, these differences do not appear to affect the rate of RYMV spread into new areas as the slope of the epidemic wavefront distance over time is comparable among the three epidemics in the three decades before the wavefront reaches its plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). Combined, this suggested the existence of a threshold in rice density, currently reached both in Madagascar and in continental Africa, beyond which the virus dispersal is &#x02018;optimal&#x02019;.</p><p>The factors impacting the dispersal rate of RYMV throughout Madagascar were tested using a landscape phylogeographic approach (<xref rid="vez023-B18" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour, Rose, and Pybus 2016</xref>; <xref rid="vez023-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>) similar to that recently applied to RYMV in mainland Africa (<xref rid="vez023-B17" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et&#x000a0;al. 2018b</xref>). Rice density, elevation, mean temperature, and annual precipitation are epidemiologically relevant and consequently of particular interest to test. For instance, absence of the disease in the very south of the country may link to the low rice density that restricts the possibilities of propagation. Sporadic presence of RYMV in the high-altitude plateau may be due to the lower temperature that is unfavorable to the virus vectors. Limited movements from west to east may be the consequence of elevation made by the high-altitude plateau that forms a physical barrier crossing the country from south to north. Yet, none of these factors were found to significantly impact the lineage dispersal velocity. This does not necessarily mean that they do not impact virus spread. For instance, if several of these factors interacted and concomitantly shaped the dispersal, their coordinated effect would not be identified in the seraphim analyses because only independent factors can be tested. Nonlinear relationships, such as between the spread and temperature because of detrimental effects of too low or too high values, may also be difficult to detect. Only linear relationships are investigated in the present study because of the lack of prior information on alternative relationships to test.</p><p>We also acknowledge that the temporal and/or the spatial scales of the factors we tested may not be epidemiologically relevant. Concerning the temporal scale, RYMV spread may be dependent on temperature variation over brief periods that cannot be captured by testing annual mean temperature. Concerning the spatial scale, a high degree of variation in rice cultivation over small areas in Madagascar that may be epidemiologically more relevant to assess host connectivity will be averaged out at a regional scale. Such small-scale variation is apparent in a suite of detailed geographical maps (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cartomundi.fr/site/">http://www.cartomundi.fr/site/</ext-link>) that display rice cultivation in Madagascar in the 1970s at a scale of a few hundred meters (1/100,000). Areas of 10 &#x000d7; 10&#x02009;km are often rice-free, even in regions with an overall high density of rice cultivation. These 10 &#x000d7; 10&#x02009;km wide gaps are likely to be major obstacles for RYMV with vectors associated to restricted mobility and an average lineage dispersal rate of around 15&#x02009;km/year. Moreover, the layout of the rice surfaces is critical. In particular, rice is often cultivated continuously along rivers and around lakes, facilitating rice connectivity for virus propagation, even across regions of overall low rice density. Altogether, this indicates that host density, even when considered at a scale of a few hundred meters, is not necessarily a good predictor of RYMV dispersal. These challenges may explain the difficulty to assess the drivers of the epidemics of RYMV in mainland Africa (<xref rid="vez023-B17" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et&#x000a0;al. 2018b</xref>) and now also in this study that can rely on detailed information for the more restricted island of Madagascar.</p><p>This study provides an example of data integration in viral phylodynamics (<xref rid="vez023-B6" ref-type="bibr">Baele et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>), applied to a plant pathogen. The temporal signal in the sequence dataset of isolates from Madagascar was not sufficient to obtain a reliable estimate of the substitution rate although it included isolates collected over a 30-year-long period. However, a flexible partition model which shared the temporal information among several geographical partitions, yet allowing independent estimates of the other parameters, circumvented this difficulty. This enabled us to perform a phylogeographic reconstruction despite the low genetic diversity of the S4-Mg strain. Increasing the sequence length as an alternative way will not necessarily increase the temporal signal as recombination events now known to be frequent for RYMV may hamper the recovery of the clock signal. Increasing the sampling density may increase the spatial information and the temporal information. However, as illustrated by our study, it cannot account for extinct or displaced lineages which may be frequent in RYMV epidemiology because of the narrow host range of the virus. Using information from field surveys provided complementary spatial and temporal information on the early stages of the epidemic not accessible through genetic data. This study highlights the value and complementarity of (historical) nongenetic and (more contemporaneous) genetic surveillance data for reconstructing the history of spread of plant viruses. In conclusion, despite differences in strain characteristics, vector species, transmission means, landscape ecology, agro-climatic environments, and spatial scales, the virus dispersal processes across Madagascar and continental Africa are consistent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>vez023_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="vez023_supplementary_data.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr RAC Jones for helpful discussions.
