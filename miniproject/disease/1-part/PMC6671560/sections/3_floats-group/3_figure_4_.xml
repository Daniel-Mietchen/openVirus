  <p>Reconstruction of the continuous spatiotemporal dispersal of RYMV in Madagascar shown from 1989 to 2014 at intervals that capture the major dispersal events. Black lines show a spatial projection of the representative phylogeny. Colored clouds represent statistical uncertainty in the estimated locations of RYMV interval nodes (95% HPD intervals). The first map displays the historical records, that is date and location of the first reports of RYMV symptoms in the different regions of Madagascar; see text and
