  <p>Similarity plot of the full-length sequence of a S4-Mg isolate (Mg15) with East African isolates representative of the other S4 strains: S4-Lv (Tz5), S4-Lm (Tz8), S4-Ug (Ug207), S4-Et (Et5), S4-Ke (Ke101), and of the S5 sister-strain (Tz3). Genetic distances were estimated using the Kimura two-parameter model in a sliding window of 200 nucleotides and a step size of 20 (top). The three putative recombination sites are identified where sequence crossover occurs and are indicated by vertical dotted lines. The horizontal dotted line is set at the 0.98 identity level to indicate the S4-Mg strain diversity. The genomic organization of RYMV is sketched below the similarity plot.</p>
