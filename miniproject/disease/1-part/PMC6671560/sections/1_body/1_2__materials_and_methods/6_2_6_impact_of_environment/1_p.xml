<p>We analyzed the impact of several environmental factors on the lineage dispersal velocity of RYMV in Madagascar using R functions available in the package ‘seraphim’ (
 <xref rid="vez023-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et al. 2016</xref>). In this analysis, each environmental factor was described by a raster that defines its spatial heterogeneity and that was used to compute an environmental distance for each branch in the phylogeny using two different path models: (1) the least-cost path model, which uses a least-cost algorithm to determine the route taken between the starting and ending points (
 <xref rid="vez023-B20" ref-type="bibr">Dijkstra 1959</xref>), and (2) the Circuitscape path model, which uses circuit theory to accommodate uncertainty in the route taken (

 <xref rid="vez023-B45" ref-type="bibr">McRae et al. 2008</xref>). Here, we investigated the impact of rice area harvested, elevation, mean annual temperature, and annual precipitation (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref> for the sources of the original raster files). These rasters were either tested as potential conductance factors (i.e. factors facilitating movement) and/or as potential resistance factors (i.e. factors impeding movement). Correlations between phylogenetic branch durations and environmental distances were estimated with the statistic

Statistical support was then evaluated against a null distribution generated by a randomization procedure and formalized as a Bayes factor (BF) value (
 <xref rid="vez023-B15" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et al. 2017</xref>). To account for the uncertainty related to the Bayesian inference, this analysis was based on 500 trees sampled from the post-burn-in posterior distribution inferred using the continuous phylogeographic model.
