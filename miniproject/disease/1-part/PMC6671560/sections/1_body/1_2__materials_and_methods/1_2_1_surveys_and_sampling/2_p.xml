<p>A total of eighty-eight isolates were collected between 2003 and 2017 throughout Madagascar, except from the difficult-to-access Melaky region in the west of the country. The outbreaks were sporadic in the high-altitude plateau in the center of the country. In the extreme south of the country, the disease was detected in 2010 only. We also had access to six isolates collected during surveys in 1989 and 1991 from the Lake Alaotra basin, the Marovoay plains, and the high-altitude plateau near Antananarivo.</p>
