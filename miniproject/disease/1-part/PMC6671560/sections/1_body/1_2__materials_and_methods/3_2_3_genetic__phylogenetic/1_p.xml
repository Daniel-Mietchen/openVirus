<p>Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL X with default parameters (

The diversity index (Pi), which is the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site between any two sequences in a multiple sequence alignment, was calculated for the Malagasy and continental Africa ORF4 (720 nt) sequence datasets using DNASp version 6 (

 <xref rid="vez023-B31" ref-type="bibr">Gouy, Guindon, and Gascuel 2010</xref>) under a HKY85 substitution model. The ML trees were rooted at the point in the tree that minimizes the variance of the root-to-tip distances. The approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) was applied to assess the reliability of key branches of the trees.
