<p>The geographical distribution of RYMV in continental Africa (
 <xref rid="vez023-B53" ref-type="bibr">Pinel-Galzi et al. 2015</xref>) shows that RYMV can persist in diverse climates, ranging from equatorial, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical climates to warm semi-arid climates (
 <xref rid="vez023-B51" ref-type="bibr">Peel, Finlayson, and McMahon 2007</xref>). As the spatial distribution of strains in West Africa is structured according to the main climatic zones, it had been hypothesized that this reflected strain adaptation to specific climatic/ecological conditions. Accordingly, these strains had sometimes been referred to as Sahelian strain, savanna or forest strains (
 <xref rid="vez023-B49" ref-type="bibr">N’Guessan et al. 2001</xref>). The RYMV epidemiology in Madagascar does not support this hypothesis. Rather, it shows that a single strain, with a restricted genetic diversity, can rapidly spread and infect rice in diverse climates similar to those in continental Africa. Consequently, the spatial structure of the strains in West Africa more likely reflects the patterns generated by successive founder effects and neutral epidemiological processes (

 <xref rid="vez023-B71" ref-type="bibr">Trovão et al. 2015b</xref>) rather that adaptation to climates. Although wide, the ecological plasticity of the disease in Madagascar is less than that of rice, its main host species. In particular, RYMV was sporadic in the high-altitude plateau (subtropical oceanic highland climate) and absent in the extreme south of the country with a warm semi-arid climate. In these two regions, the susceptibility of the rice cultivars and the presence of vector beetle species (
 <xref rid="vez023-B56" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et al. 2008</xref>) suggest that environmental conditions may be unfavorable to disease spread. For instance, low temperature in the high plateau and drought in the south may hinder vector movements and disease spread.
