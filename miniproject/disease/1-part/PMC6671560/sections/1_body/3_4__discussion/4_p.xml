<p>The spread of RYMV in Madagascar was faster than that in mainland East Africa at the early stages of the epidemics when the mode and the extent of rice cultivation were unfavorable to virus spread. The dispersal rate increased over time in mainland Africa, possibly reflecting the intensification of rice cultivation favorable to virus spread (
 <xref rid="vez023-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abo, Sy, and Alegbejo 1997</xref>), so the difference in dispersal velocities between mainland Africa and Madagascar fades towards the present. This is still unexpected considering that several factors can favor RYMV dispersal in Madagascar even more: the dense and continuous rice landscape, endemic beetle vector species such as 
 <italic>Dicladispa gestroi</italic> (
 <xref rid="vez023-B19" ref-type="bibr">Delucchi 2001</xref>), the regular use of the zebu which disseminates the virus during trampling and through feces, and the high rate of transplanted rice (
 <xref rid="vez023-B60" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Andriamasintseheno 1997</xref>). Yet, these differences do not appear to affect the rate of RYMV spread into new areas as the slope of the epidemic wavefront distance over time is comparable among the three epidemics in the three decades before the wavefront reaches its plateau (
