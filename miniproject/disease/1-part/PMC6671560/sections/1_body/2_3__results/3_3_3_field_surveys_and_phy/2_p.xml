<p>This sequence of observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F4">Fig. 4</xref>), the low genetic diversity of the Malagasy isolates and the well-supported monophyly of the S4-Mg strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F2">Fig. 2</xref>) are consistent with a single introduction of RYMV in the early 1970s in the very north of Madagascar, followed by a gradual spread southward along the east and along the west parts of the country. Accordingly, the disease has crossed ca. 1,500 km from the north to the south of Madagascar within ca. 40 years, so with an average of about 37 km/year.
