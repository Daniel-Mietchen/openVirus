<p>For the full dataset (544 sequences, including the ninety-four sequences from Madagascar), the linear regression between the sampling dates and the root-to-tip distances of the 544 isolates was significant after tip (

 <sup>−3</sup>) and cluster permutations (340 clusters, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>5. 10
 <sup>−3</sup>). The estimated mean rate was 9.2 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitution per site per year (

 <sup>−3</sup> substitution per site per year with a 95 per cent HPD of 8.8 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>–1.3 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> that did not overlap with those obtained either after tip or after cluster permutations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). These results indicate that a reliable estimate of the evolutionary rate can be obtained by combining the temporal signal of the East Africa (EA240), West Africa (WA210), and Malagasy (Mg94) datasets. To achieve this while independently modeling the phylogeographic diffusion process in each area, the East Africa, West Africa, and Madagascar datasets were considered as separate partitions with independent tree topologies and evolutionary parameters, except for the mean clock rate that was shared among datasets. This model was applied to reconstruct the phylogeography of RYMV and to estimate the dispersal statistics in the three geographical partitions.
