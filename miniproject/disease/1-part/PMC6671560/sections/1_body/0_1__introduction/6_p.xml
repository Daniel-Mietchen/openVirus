<p>To provide information on the genetic and geographical origin of RYMV in Madagascar, and on whether or not the virus introduction was unique, we examined the phylogenetic relationships of the S4-Mg strain in the light of an expanded full-length sequence dataset that included new strains from East Africa (
 <xref rid="vez023-B58" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez023-B48" ref-type="bibr">Ndikumana et al. 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez023-B3" ref-type="bibr">Adego et al. 2018</xref>). By capitalizing on available and newly generated ORF4 sequence data, we also investigated the patterns and dynamics of the spatiotemporal spread of RYMV in Madagascar, we contrasted the phylogeographic inferences against historical knowledge of the RYMV spread in Madagascar, and analyzed the determinants of the velocity with which RYMV invades new regions and migrates within infected areas.
