<p>RYMV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA species of the 
 <italic>Sobemovirus</italic> genus in the 
 <italic>Solemoviridae</italic> family (
 <xref rid="vez023-B36" ref-type="bibr">King et al. 2018</xref>) with a ca. 4,450-nucleotide-long genome organized into five open reading frames (ORFs) (
 <xref rid="vez023-B65" ref-type="bibr">Sõmera, Sarmiento, and Truve 2015</xref>). ORF1, located at the 5′ end of the genome, encodes a small protein (P1) involved in virus movement and in gene silencing suppression. ORF2, which encodes the central polyprotein, has two overlapping ORFs. ORF2a encodes a serine protease and a viral genome-linked protein that determines the virulence. ORF2b, which is translated through a −1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism as a fusion protein, encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF4 is translated from a subgenomic RNA at the 3′ end of the genome and encodes the coat protein (CP). Recently, the presence of a fifth ORF (ORFx), conserved in all sobemoviruses, which overlaps the 5′ end of the ORF2a in the +2 reading frame, was reported (
 <xref rid="vez023-B40" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al. 2013</xref>). The CP gene (ORF4), 720 or 723 nucleotide long (depending on the strain), has been used for the phylogeographic reconstructions. It revealed a high (up to 20% between isolates) and spatially structured diversity with distinct strains in East and West Africa (
 <xref rid="vez023-B2" ref-type="bibr">Abubakar et al. 2003</xref>). Thus far, there is no evidence of intra-ORF4 recombination, with the exception of a localized strain recently found in Western Kenya (
 <xref rid="vez023-B3" ref-type="bibr">Adego et al. 2018</xref>). RYMV isolates of Madagascar belong to a specific strain named the S4-Mg strain (
