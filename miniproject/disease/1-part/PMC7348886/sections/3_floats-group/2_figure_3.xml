  <p>Active immunization in AgBR1 AG129 mice with AH-AgBR1 against mosquito-borne ZIKV infection. Survival rates, viremia, and body weight were analyzed in immunized AG129 mice after ZIKV infection. (
   <bold>a</bold>) The ZIKV viral load recovered from the thorax of ZIKV-infected 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes after mice challenge. The basal line corresponds with the background observed in non-infected mosquitoes. ZIKV RNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR and normalized to the levels of 
   <italic>Rp49</italic>. Each dot represents one mosquito. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The survival rates of AH-AgBR1 and AH mice after a mosquito-borne ZIKV challenge. The mice were observed every 24 h for 30 days. (
   <bold>c</bold>) The ZIKV viral load recovered from the blood of AH-AgBR1 and AH-immunized mice after challenge measured by qRT-PCR. Each point represents an individual animal. The relative ZIKV level was normalized to mouse β actin RNA levels. (
   <bold>d</bold>) The body weight loss (%) of mice after challenge. The error bars represent mean ± SEM. Asterisks represent significant difference between samples (AH-AgBR1 versus AH) for each analyzed day, calculated by Mann–Whitney non-parametric test (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Survival statistical analysis was calculated by Log-Rank test (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). (Three separate experiments were operated biologically independently with the same results.)
