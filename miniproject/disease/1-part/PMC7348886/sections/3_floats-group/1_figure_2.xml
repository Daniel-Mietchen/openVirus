  <p>AG129 mice produce anti-AgBR1 antibodies after AgBR1 active immunization. 4-6 week old AG129 mice were immunized subcutaneously with 10 μg of AgBR1 adjuvanted with AlumHydro gel at the back base on weeks 0, 2, and 4 (AH-AgBR1, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 7) or only AlumHydro gel served as a control (AH, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6), following a prime–boost–boost regimen. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the experiment. Fourteen days after prime–boost–boost immunization, mice were challenged with Zika Virus (ZIKV) via mosquito bite and mice were monitored 30 days for survival, body weight, and viremia. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Mice antibody titer against AgBR1 was tested individually one day before challenge by ELISA (individual).
