  <p>Expression of recombinant AgBR1 protein and polyhistidine-tag cleavage. Recombinant AgBR1 protein was expressed using stable transfected S2 cells, and the polyhistidine tag was cleaved by TEV protease. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Analysis of purified recombinant AgBR1-TEV-V5-His and His-cleaved AgBR1 protein by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Analysis of AgBR1 His-cleaved recognition by rabbit anti-AgBR1 specific antibodies by Western Blotting. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Analysis of His-cleavage efficacy by Western Blotting using an anti-His tag specific antibody.
