<p>Moreover, ZIKV has been shown to be transmitted by different 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species, and two anthropophilic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, are able to transmit ZIKV to humans [
 <xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As the sequences of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> AgBR1 proteins share 92.3% identity, it is highly plausible that the antibodies developed against the 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> AgBR1 can also block the 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> homolog, thereby exerting an effect on ZIKV transmission. Therefore, targeting the mosquito salivary factor AgBR1 may direct the development of a new vaccine, either by blocking viral spread in the host or improving the efficacy of conventional vaccines that directly target the virus.
