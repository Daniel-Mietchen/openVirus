<p>We next determined whether active immunization with AgBR1 protects mice against ZIKV transmission. A total of 100 PFU ZIKV virus were injected into the thorax of each mosquito using a Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter Injector (Drummond). Then, two of the ZIKV-infected mosquitoes fed until engorgement on each mouse actively immunized with AH-AgBR1 or AH. There was no difference in ZIKV level in the thorax between the two groups of mosquitoes (

A statistically significant delay in mortality was observed in AH-AgBR1 group compared to AH control group. Between day 15 and 19 post-infection, more than 80% of AH-AgBR1 mice were alive, whereas fewer than 20% were alive in the AH control group (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00145-f003">Figure 3</xref>d). On average, these differences in body weight are statistically significant at 10 day post-infection. We observed that the animals with the highest anti-AgBR1 antibody titers (AH-AgBR1-2, 4 and 5) had the most pronounced delay in mortality and body weight loss. Intriguingly, mice AH-AgBR1-3, 6, and 7 appear to be partially protected despite the lack of a robust humoral immune response, suggesting that other components of the adaptive immune system may contribute to antiviral protection (
