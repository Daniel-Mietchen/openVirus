<p>This study suggests that active immunization with AgBR1 adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide delays lethal mosquito-borne ZIKV infection in AG129 mice. In addition, we did not observe inflammation at the site of inoculation, clinical signs, morbidity or any other appreciable pathological sign in the immunized mice, making this immunization strategy safe for mouse studies. The AG129 mouse model has been established as an adequate murine model to assess vaccine and antiviral efficacy against ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00145" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As we were able to influence infection using an immunocompromised mouse (which is more susceptible to ZIKV), it is likely that more pronounced immune responses to AgBR1 will be obtained following the active immunization of immunocompetent mice or other animal models. Moreover, AG129 also have an inability to elicit robust host responses to ZIKV, which accounts for their high susceptibility to lethal infection. It is also possible that the delay in time to death following immunization with AgBR1, observed in our studies, may enable an immunocompetent mouse to develop a more robust direct response to the virus, which would aid in viral clearance and protection.
