<p>We previously showed that AgBR1 antiserum suppresses inflammatory responses at the bite site and reduces lethality after ZIKV-infected mosquitoes fed on AG129 mice deficient in both interferon α and interferon γ receptors [

 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-08-00145" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We actively immunized two groups of mice: AgBR1 with Alum Hydrogel (AH-AgBR1) or Alum Hydrogel (AH) as control. 10 μg of purified AgBR1 protein was subcutaneously injected for immunization, following a prime–boost–boost regimen (

Blood samples were collected one day before priming and 13 days after final immunization to measure anti-AgBR1 antibody titer by ELISA. The anti-AgBR1 antibody titers in the AH-AgBR1 group were, on average, significantly higher than the titers in the AH group, (
