<p>To obtain pure AgBR1 protein for vaccination studies, we expressed in Drosophila S2 cells a polyhistidine-tagged AgBR1 protein with a TEV recognition site located upstream of the His tag, using a pMT-Bip-V5-His vector (Thermo Fisher) and purified from the supernatant by TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech). The purified recombinant protein (Fig. 1a, left lane) was TEV protease-treated to cleave the V5-His tag (
