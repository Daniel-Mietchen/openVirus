<p>The Asian lineage of ZIKV has recently caused epidemics and severe diseases, being responsible for the recent epidemics in the Americas in 2015 [

 <xref rid="B28-vaccines-08-00145" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These strains have adapted to generate higher viremia in humans, leading to enhanced cross-placental infection and microcephaly neurological disease and weight loss [
