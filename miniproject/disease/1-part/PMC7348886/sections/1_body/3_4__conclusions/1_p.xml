<p>In conclusion, this study presents a new vaccine candidate based on an 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> salivary antigen AgBR1. An immunization regimen based on AgBR1 adjunvanted with the human-licensed alum hydroxide delayed the mortality rate in the highly ZIKV susceptible AG129 mouse model, preventing body weight loss and reducing viral burden, although the latter result should be examined carefully, since the viral burden analyzed by RT-PCR is a measurement of viral genome. Furthermore, analyzing efficacy in other less immunocompromised models, examining other adjuvants, ways of administration, or different delivery platforms, such as DNA and RNA-based vaccines, should be performed to achieve a maximal protection of AgBR1 candidate, and also could be potentially applied for other mosquito-based antigens.
