<p>Purified protein was mixed in 1x Laemmli buffer (Biorad) with 2-mercaptoethanol (2.5%), heated to 95 °C for 10 min and separated by SDS-PAGE using 4%–20% Mini-Protean TGX gels (Bio-Rad) at 200 V for 25 min. Proteins were semi-dry transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 45 min at 4 V. The blots were blocked in 1% non-fat milk in water for 60 min. AgBR1 and homologous proteins were incubated with AgBR1 antiserum (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (CST). After washing with 0.05% PBS-T, the immunoblots were imaged through ECL Western Blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare) with a LI-COR Odyssey imaging system. </p>
