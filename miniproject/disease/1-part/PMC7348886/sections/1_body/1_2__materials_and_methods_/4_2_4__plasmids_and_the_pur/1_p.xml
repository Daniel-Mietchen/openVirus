<p>AgBR1 with a TEV tag was cloned in frame into the pMT-Bip-V5-His tag vector (Invitrogen) and recombinant proteins expressed and purified using the Drosophila Expression System (Invitrogen). AgBR1-TEV-V5-His was purified from the supernatant by TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) and eluted with 150 mM imidazole. The eluted samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and concentrated with a 10-kDa concentrator (Sigma-Aldrich) by centrifugation at 4 °C, and washed and dialyzed in PBS. Recombinant protein purities were assessed by SDS-PAGE, and then quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific). TurboTEV Protease (Accelagen Inc.) was used to cleave the tags from AgBR1-TEV-V5-His following the manufacturer’s instructions to obtain untagged AgBR1 protein for immunizations.</p>
