<p>For the active immunization assays, mice were immunized subcutaneously with 10-Î¼g AgBR1 [

Two weeks after the final immunization, the mice were anaesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and challenged by ZIKV-infected mosquitoes. For mosquito infection, ZIKV-filled needles were inserted into the thorax of each mosquito and 100 plaque forming units (PFU) in a volume of 138 nl were injected, using a Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter Injector (Drummond). Infected mosquitoes were placed back in paper cups with mesh lids and maintained in triple containment for ten days in a warm chamber. The day before challenge, two infected mosquitoes were randomly selected and placed into individual cups with mesh covers, and, the following day, the mice were anaesthetized and ZIKV-infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed on them until observing blood engorgement. After challenge, mosquitoes were knocked down on ice and their thorax was dissected to examine the virus levels after mosquito feeding. To analyze viremia levels, the blood of the mosquito-bitten mice was collected at days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 post infection. Survival and weights were monitored daily. Mice exhibiting a weight loss of &gt;20% of initial body weight or neurological disease were euthanized.
