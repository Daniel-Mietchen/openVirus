<p>The RNA from the thorax was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) and the cDNA was generated with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR using IQ SYBR Green Supermix. Viral RNA levels in mosquito thorax were normalized to

 <sup>−ΔCt</sup> calculations. Viral RNA levels in mouse blood were normalized to mice β-actin RNA levels according to 2
 <sup>−ΔCt</sup> calculations.
