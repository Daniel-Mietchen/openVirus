<p>All experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health). The animal experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Yale University School of Medicine (assurance number A3230-01). All infection experiments were performed in an arthropod containment level 3 (ACL3) animal facility according to the regulations of Yale University. Every effort was made to minimize murine pain and distress. The mice were anaesthetized with ketamine-xylazine for mosquito infection experiments and euthanized as suggested by the Yale IACUC.</p>
