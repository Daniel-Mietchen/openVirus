 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Ho Chi Minh strain, kindly provided by Dr J. Powell laboratory at Yale University) mosquitoes were maintained on 10% sucrose feeders inside a 12- by 12- by 12-in. metal mesh cage (BioQuip; catalog no. 1450B) at 28 Â°C and 80% humidity. Egg masses were generated via blood meal feeding on naive mice. All mosquitoes were housed in a warm chamber in a space approved for Biosafety Level 2 and Arthropod Containment Level 3 research. Mosquitoes were randomly chosen for experimental groups. Four- to six-week-old mixed gender AG129 mice were used in the immunization assays and ZIKV infection studies. The mice were randomly chosen for experimental groups. All mice were kept in a specific-pathogen-free facility at Yale University.
