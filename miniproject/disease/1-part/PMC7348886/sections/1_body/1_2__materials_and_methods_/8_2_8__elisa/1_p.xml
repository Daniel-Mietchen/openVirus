<p>In total, 100 ng of recombinant AgBR1 were coated on Nunc-Immuno 96 MicroWell solid plates (Thermo Scientific) overnight at 4 °C. After being blocked with 2% non-fat milk for 1 h at 37 °C, the plates were incubated for 1 h 37 °C with serum samples serially diluted in PBS. After three washes with PBS+0.05% Tween20, the plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Enzyme activity was detected by incubation with 50 μL of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution (KPL) for 5 min at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL of 1 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader.
