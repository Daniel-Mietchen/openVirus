<p>Vaccines are often composed of an antigen and an adjuvant that triggers a heightened immunostimulatory response [

Alum Hydrogel (Aluminum hydroxide in a wet gel suspension, AH, InvivoGen, CA) is a human-licensed adjuvant that initiates an innate immune response by the enhancement of antigen availability, the activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and uptake by immune cells [
