<p>Mosquito salivary proteins enhance the infectivity and pathogenesis of Zika, dengue, or West Nile viruses by modulating immune responses [

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquito are capable of potentiating viral infection by arboviruses, demonstrating that certain salivary proteins are important for flavivirus pathogenicity and transmission from vector to host [

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> salivary gland protein AgBR1 modulates the early immune response in the murine skin following mosquito bite. Moreover, passive immunization with antibodies against AgBR1 prolongs survival in mice infected with mosquito-transmitted ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-08-00145" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there are limitations to passive immunizations, such as the short-lived protection, the need for repeated administration of antibodies, and the high cost [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00145" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To determine whether an active immunization strategy could inhibit mosquito-borne ZIKV infection in mice, we adjuvanted AgBR1 with aluminum hydroxide to enhance antibody production and examine its influence on infection.
