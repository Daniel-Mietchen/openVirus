 </bold>: IRE1 is a type I transmembrane protein receptor having a N-terminal ER luminal sensing domain. The cytoplasmic C-terminal region contains both an endoribonuclease domain and a Ser/Thr kinase domain [
 <xref rid="CIT0130">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0131">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0136">136</xref>]. There are two homologs of IRE1, namely IRE1α and IRE1β. Activation of IRE1 involves first dissociating itself from Grp78. Then, IRE1 undergoes dimerization, oligomerization, and trans-autophosphorylation, which leads to conformational changes and activation of its RNase domain [

 <xref rid="CIT0134">134</xref>]. Activated IRE1 excises a 26-nucleotide intron region from mRNA that encodes the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Dissociation of the 26-nucleotide intron region from XBP1 leads to a shift in the coding reading frame and produces a more stable form of XBP1 called XBP1 spliced form (XBP1s) [

 <xref rid="CIT0138">138</xref>]. XBP1 also modulates phospholipid synthesis which is required for ER expansion under ER stress [

 <sup>IPK,</sup> HEDJ, DnaJ/Hsp-40-like genes, protein disulphide isomerise P5 (PDI-P5) and ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (RAMP4) [
 <xref rid="CIT0130">130</xref>]. Different studies have shown that activation of IRE1 signalling is robust at first but as time progresses it diminishes [

 <xref rid="CIT0130">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0140">140</xref>]. However, artificial maintenance of IRE1 signaling is achieved by a chemically activated mutant form of IRE1 which positively correlated with enhanced cell survival conditions under ER stress; this provides an indication that IRE1 signaling mainly plays a role as a pro-survival pathway [
