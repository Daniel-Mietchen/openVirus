 </bold>: ATF6 is a type II transmembrane protein that contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor domain in its cytosolic terminus [
 <xref rid="CIT0130">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0131">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0141">141</xref>]. The ATF6 family of ER transducers includes ATF6α, ATF6β, old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS), LUMAN (also called CREB3), BBF2 human homolog on chromosome 7 (BBF2H7), cyclic-AMP responsive element binding protein hepatocyte (CREBH) and CREBP4 [
 <xref rid="CIT0139">139</xref>]. Unlike IRE1, ATF6 does not undergo oligomerization, dimerization, and autophosphorylation. Under ER stress conditions, Grp78 dissociates from ATF6, thus uncovering the ATF6 Golgi localization signal. Activated ATF6 translocates into the Golgi complex where it undergoes cleavage by site-1 and site-2 proteases [
 <xref rid="CIT0133">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0137">137</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0139">139</xref>]. Thus, the N-terminal cleavage product of ATF6 translocates to the nucleus and regulates the expression of genes that are associated with the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. Some of the ATF6 target genes include Grp78, protein disulphide isomerise (PDI) and ER-degradation enhancing-a-mannosidase-like protein 1 (EDEM1). All these proteins work closely in concert to reduce unfolded proteins in the ER lumen [
 <xref rid="CIT0130">130</xref>]. ATF6 also activates pro-survival transcription factor and IRE1 target gene XBP1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0142">142</xref>]. Similar to that of IRE1 signaling, ATF6 is activated upon UPR but is not sustained throughout the UPR response. ATF6 signaling is primarily for pro-survival, but in some cases, it activates pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) during prolonged ER stress [
