 </bold>: Protein kinase RNA-activated like ER kinase (PERK) is a type I ER transmembrane protein having an ER luminar sensor domain and a cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain contains Ser/Thr kinase activity. Upon activation by UPR, PERK dissociates itself from Grp78 and undergoes dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation [
 <xref rid="CIT0130">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0131">131</xref>]. Activated PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51 reduces the activity of the eIF2α complex and leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis. This rapidly reduces the number of proteins entering the ER and this can lead to pro-survival effects on the cell [

 <xref rid="CIT0133">133</xref>]. GADD34 is involved in a feedback loop to dephosphorylate eIF2α by protein phosphatase IC (PPIC) to restore protein synthesis [

In normal cells, Nrf2 is present in the cytoplasm in association with cytoskeletal anchor kelch-like Ech-associated protein (KEAP1). Upon activation, PERK phosphorylates Nrf2 and this helps Nrf2 to dissociate from KEAP1 and translocate into the nucleus [
 <xref rid="CIT0130">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0144">144</xref>]. Upon translocation into the nucleus Nrf2 induces the expression of genes with an anti-oxidant response element (ARE) within their promoter such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) aiding in protein folding and helping to restore ER homeostasis [
 <xref rid="CIT0130">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0144">144</xref>]. The role of Nrf2 as a pro-survival factor is further proved by the fact that cells devoid of Nrf2 upon ER stress displayed increased sensitivity to cell death by means of apoptosis [
