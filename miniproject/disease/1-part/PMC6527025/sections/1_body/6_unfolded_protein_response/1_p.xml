<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the intracellular organelle which is important in regulating various metabolic activities such as metabolism of carbohydrates, lipid biogenesis and calcium homeostasis, protein synthesis and post-translational modification of many secretory and membrane proteins. The ER contains a large network of tubules, sacs, and cisternae which extend from the cell membrane through the cytoplasm to the nuclear envelope through a continuously connected network [

 <xref rid="CIT0132">132</xref>]. The ER is the main sub-cellular compartment involved in proper folding of proteins and their maturation. About one-third of the total cellular proteins are synthesized in the ER. Many different perturbations can alter the function of the ER leading to unfolding or misfolding of proteins in the ER. This condition is referred to as ER stress [

 <xref rid="CIT0133">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0135">135</xref>]. UPR involves activation of three major canonical ER stress sensors, namely inositol-requiring enzyme I (IRE1), protein kinase RNA-activated like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). These ER stress transducers are localized to the ER membrane [
