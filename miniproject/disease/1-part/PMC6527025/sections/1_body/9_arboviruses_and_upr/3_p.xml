<p>Another study showed that A547 ovarian cancer cells infected with DENV elicited the UPR signaling response [
 <xref rid="CIT0235">235</xref>]. This was confirmed by phosphorylation of eIF2α. It was also shown that different serotypes of DENV activate other UPR pathways such as ATF6 and IRE1. These results showed that different serotypes of DENV have the capacity to modulate different UPR pathways. This unique report showed that different viruses from the same group could activate different UPR pathways [
 <xref rid="CIT0235">235</xref>]. This report also indicated that DENV induces the expression of the protein complex (containing the protein phosphatase 1 and its cofactor GADD34) which leads to enhanced dephosphorylation of eIF2α. Pharmacologically inhibiting GADD34 by Salubrinal, a small molecule inhibitor of this protein complex dephosphorylated eIF2α, dramatically reduced GADD34 and subsequently reduced DENV infection [
