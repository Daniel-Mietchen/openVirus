<p>P58
 <sup>IPK</sup> is an Hsp40 family member and interferon-induced kinase. After IAV infection in NIH 3T3 cells and ER stress, the posttranscriptional activation of P58
 <sup>IPK</sup> occurs which may act synergistically with UPR-mediated transcriptional activation to help influenza virus escape from both PKR- and PERK-mediated translational repression [
 <xref rid="CIT0321">321</xref>]. Another study showed that P58
 <sup>IPK</sup> regulates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2a, and then regulates IAV mRNA translation and infection through a PKR-mediated mechanism, which is independent of PERK [
