<p>Hassan et al. showed for the first time the role of ER stress and UPR in the pathogenesis of IAV infection in lung epithelial cells. They reported that IAV infection activates the IRE1 pathway with subsequent XBP-1 mRNA splicing, with little or no effect on the PERK and ATF6 pathways [

This study was conducted in murine primary tracheal epithelial cells (MTECS), one of the primary sites of IAV infection. They also reported that ER stress in infected cells was related to apoptosis through caspase-12 which plays a central role in the initiation of ER stress-induced cell death [
