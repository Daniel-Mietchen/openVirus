<p>The mTOR signaling pathway negatively regulates autophagy [
 <xref rid="CIT0257">257</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0258">258</xref>]. The phosphorylated form of the effector protein kinase mTOR is known to inhibit autophagy [
 <xref rid="CIT0259">259</xref>]. It has been proposed that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, induces autophagy in MEF cells by suppressing phosphorylated mTOR signaling. Thus, inhibition of autophagy could reduce H5N1-mediated cellular damage [
 <xref rid="CIT0260">260</xref>]. However, autophagy in human epithelial cells involved AKT, a tumor suppressor protein TSC2 and mTOR. Sun and colleagues also showed that H5N1 HA was responsible for stimulating autophagy [
 <xref rid="CIT0261">261</xref>]. A study demonstrated that the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is closely related to the autophagic process, has a biphasic effect on IAV replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0262">262</xref>]. In this regard, Datan et al. showed that lethal autophagy and protective autophagy are activated in different ways. In lethal autophagy, mTORC2 upregulates p70S6K activity, that is required for LC3-II formation which interestingly increases viral production by delayed lysosome activity. Blocking PI3K, mTORC2 or p70S6K activity prevented lethal autophagy and limited infectious virus production [
 <xref rid="CIT0263">263</xref>]. Deficiency in autophagy caused impaired survival of memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells during infection with IAV [
