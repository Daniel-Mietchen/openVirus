<p>The molecular mechanisms underlying the reduction of major cellular antioxidant enzyme group superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) during IAV infection, which results in over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), clearly involves autophagy. Silencing the LC3 gene in A549 cells, which normally supports the critical role of autophagy in ROS, increases in the early phases of IAV infection [

IAV also induces the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family, including the pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, causing mitochondrial damage and release of ROS. NLRP3 forms an inflammasome complex with ASC (essential adaptor of inflammasomes) and caspase-1, thus inducing the production of IL-1Î± and IL-18 in response to mitochondrial ROS [
