<p>Bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) is a highly specific, but somewhat toxic, inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton (V-H
 <sup>+</sup>) pumps, which are responsible for the acidification of endosomes and lysosomes, and are necessary for IAV replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0249">249</xref>]. Using Baf-A1 at low sub-toxic concentrations also effectively inhibited IAV replication without impacting host cell viability [
 <xref rid="CIT0240">240</xref>]. Thus, sub-toxic Baf-A1 concentrations can inhibit autophagosomes, either by inhibiting autophagosome formation or by increasing degradative flux [
 <xref rid="CIT0240">240</xref>]. A study on the antiviral activity of statins confirmed that IAV increases autophagosome formation by LC3-II accumulation and inhibits autophagosome maturation/degradation [
 <xref rid="CIT0250">250</xref>]. Law et al. showed induction of functional autophagy by different strains of IAV in primary human blood macrophages, which was detected by the degradation of the autophagy receptor p62 [
 <xref rid="CIT0241">241</xref>]. It was also shown that IAV induced autophagy with no detectable block in the pathway via confirmation of GFP-LC3 puncta and p62 degradation measurements. They also showed that autophagy was not involved in MHC class II-restricted presentation [
 <xref rid="CIT0251">251</xref>]. In a report that studied IAV H3N2 infection, LC3-II began to accumulate a few hours post-infection (hpi) in A549 cells and very early post-infection in Ana-1 macrophages. This also confirmed that H3N2 induced autophagy in both A549 and Ana-1 cells [
