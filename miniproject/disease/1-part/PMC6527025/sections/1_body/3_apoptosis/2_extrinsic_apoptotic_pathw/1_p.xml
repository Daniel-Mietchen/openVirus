<p>The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by the activation of death receptors present on the cell surface. These death receptors belong to the subset of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. There are six well-known death receptors that can regulate apoptosis either directly or indirectly. These include TNFR1, Fast/Apo/CD95 (TNFRSF6), DR3 (TNFRSF25), DR4 (TNFRSF10A), DR5 (TNFRSF10B) and DR6 (TNFRSF21) [

Initially, they trigger the apoptotic cascade by forming a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) which often contains the adaptor protein FADD and the apoptosis initiating protease caspase-8. Once caspase-8 gets activated, it, in turn, activates other executioner caspases such as caspase-3 and âˆ’7 and these activations eventually commit the cells to undergo apoptosis [
