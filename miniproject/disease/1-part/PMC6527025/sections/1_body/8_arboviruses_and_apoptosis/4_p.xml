<p>Several studies have confirmed the effect of DENV on apoptosis in a wide variety of mammalian cells including hepatocytes, monocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, mast cells, and neuroblastoma cells. However, the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Dendritic cells are believed to be the primary targets for DENV and play central roles in supporting active replication for virus pathogenesis. However, a study reported that replication of DENV in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs) was positively correlated with TNFα and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="CIT0208">208</xref>]. To achieve high rates of replication, DENV may subvert apoptosis in macrophages, hepatoma, and dendritic cells, by inhibiting NF-kB in response to TNFα stimulation [

 <xref rid="CIT0209">209</xref>]. DENV replication was positively affected by inhibiting apoptosis by the interaction between capsid protein and the hepatoma cell line (Huh7) calcium modulating cyclophilin-binding ligand (CAML) [
 <xref rid="CIT0201">201</xref>]. Activation of p53-dependent apoptosis by DENV may contribute to the inhibition of inflammation and reduction of immune responses to efficiently disseminate viral progeny (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). This research was conducted on a p53-deficient cell line, H1299, and on a p53-knockin cell line [
 <xref rid="CIT0210">210</xref>]. Following DENV infection in these cell lines, a microarray analysis revealed that activation of the pro-apoptotic gene caspase-1 played a basic role in the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway and was necessary for up-regulation of different immune response genes [
 <xref rid="CIT0210">210</xref>]. The WNV capsid protein was shown to be capable of inducing the p53-dependent apoptotic process in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) or SH-SY5Y cells. It showed no significant effects on p53-null MEF or on p53-knockdown SH-SY5Y cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0199">199</xref>]. The pro-apoptotic NSs and anti-apoptotic NSm proteins of the Phelebovirus genus of the family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> (e.g. RVFV) delayed apoptosis in Human small airway lung epithelial cells (HSAECs) to efficiently replicate virus by regulating p53 and favor virus propagation [
 <xref rid="CIT0211">211</xref>]. RVFV infection in Vero E6 and HEK293 cells inhibits either caspase-8 or the extracellular apoptotic pathway to regulate pro-apoptotic p53 signaling (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0212">212</xref>]. The viral NSs protein can facilitate viral translation through inhibition of the PKR/eIF2α pathway and blockage of IFN at early stages of infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0213">213</xref>]. The genus Orthobunyavirus of the family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> delayed apoptosis in a cell line (P2.1), derived from U4C, defective in double-stranded RNA signaling due to low levels of IRF-3 through anti-apoptotic effects of NSs protein on IRF-3 activity [
