<p>Flavivirus replication (e.g. WNV, JEV and DENV) can be limited by virus-induced programmed cell death at the early stage of virus infection. These viruses may block or delay apoptosis by activating PI3K/Akt signaling which improves their replication rate (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0190">190</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0195">195</xref>]. Blocking PI3K in neuronal N18 cells (using LY294002 or wortmannin) showed that apoptosis induction might be due to p38 MAPK activation and did not affect JEV and DENV viral particle production [
 <xref rid="CIT0190">190</xref>]. In 2001, it was demonstrated for the first time that WNV-induced cytopathic effect was caused during the induction of apoptosis. It was also found that viral replication is essential for virus-induced cell death in K562 and Neuro-2a cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0196">196</xref>]. The WNV capsid protein has anti-apoptotic functions which can block or delay apoptosis by suppression of the PI3-kinase-dependent process at the early stage of infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0195">195</xref>]. Akt, which is a downstream target of PI3-kinase, can directly phosphorylate Bad at position Ser136 [
 <xref rid="CIT0197">197</xref>]. However, WNV can trigger apoptosis after several rounds of replication through caspases-3 and −12 and p53 and it is important to note that the initial viral dose affects the kinetics of WNV-induced cell death [

 <xref rid="CIT0198">198</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0200">200</xref>]. Replication of several RNA viruses might be affected by the expression of multiple miRNAs in host cells either positively or negatively. One such miRNA is Hs_154, which limits WNV replication in HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells by inhibition of two anti-apoptotic proteins; CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), and EGFR-co-amplified and overexpressed protein (ECOP) [
 <xref rid="CIT0190">190</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0201">201</xref>]. JEV is an RNA virus which may trigger ROS-mediated ASK1-ERK/p38 MAPK activation, which leads to initiation of apoptosis (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0202">202</xref>]. In another experiment, mouse neuroblastoma cell line N18 was infected with UV-inactivated JEV (UV-JEV). These dead virions induced cell death through a ROS-dependent and NF-kB-mediated pathway [
 <xref rid="CIT0203">203</xref>]. The initial suppression of UV-JEV-induced cell death, followed by co-infection with active or inactive JEV, demonstrated that JEV may trigger cell survival signaling in mouse neuroblastoma N18 and human neuronal NT-2 cells to modify cellular pathways for timely virus production [
 <xref rid="CIT0203">203</xref>]. NS1‘ protein, a neuroinvasiveness factor that is produced by the JEV serogroup of Flaviviruses, was introduced as a caspase substrate; however, using a caspase inhibitor had no effect on virus replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0204">204</xref>]. The experimental evidence showed that JEV may affect Bcl-2 expression to increase anti-apoptotic response to enhance virus persistence and reach a balance between cell death and virus replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0205">205</xref>]. JEV may also enhance blood–brain barrier permeability through up-regulation of Bax, Bid, Fas and FasL and down-regulation of IGFBP-2, Bid, p27 and p53 [
 <xref rid="CIT0206">206</xref>]. The results from a macaque model study indicated neuronal apoptotic death along with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are crucial steps in the pathogenesis of JEV [
 <xref rid="CIT0207">207</xref>].
