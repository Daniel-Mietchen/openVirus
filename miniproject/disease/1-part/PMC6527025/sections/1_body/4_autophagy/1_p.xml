<p>The term autophagy is defined as self-eating. It sequesters, degrades and recycles cellular materials. The autophagy function is evolutionarily conserved in yeast, plants, and mammals as a basic stress-response and degradation mechanism. The role of autophagy has been widely investigated in humans, as it plays crucial roles in maintaining optimum functional conditions at the cellular and organismal level [

 <xref rid="CIT0070">70</xref>]. Autophagy can be defined as a catabolic process which degrades and recycles cytosolic materials. It is a highly regulated cellular process divided into three main types: Macroautophagy, Microautophagy and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy (CMA) [
