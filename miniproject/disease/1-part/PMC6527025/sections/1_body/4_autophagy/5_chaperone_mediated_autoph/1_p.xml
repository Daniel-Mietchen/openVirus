<p>In chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a cytoplasmic chaperone mediates lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP 2A)-dependent uptake of unfolded proteins. In CMA, cytosolic proteins with the pentapeptide motif KFERQ are recognized by heat shock cognate protein 70 kDa protein (HSC70), also known as HSPA8 [
