<p>Macroautophagy involves double-membrane autophagosomes that engulf different cargos like organelles and cytoplasmic proteins. These autophagosomes sequester their cargo to lysosomes where the cargo is degraded [
 <xref rid="CIT0073">73</xref>]. Microautophagy results in the direct engulfment of substrates through lysosomal or endosomal membrane invagination, and the substrates then are degraded by lysosomal proteases [
 <xref rid="CIT0074">74</xref>]. CMA acts in a very selective way and does not use membranes to engulf the cargo. This makes it different from macroautophagy and microautophagy. Proteins targeted by CMA contain a pentapeptide motif containing KFERQ sequence (Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln) that is detected by cytosolic heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (hsc70). Hsc70, together with the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) receptor, helps the cargo be transferred into lysosomes through their membranes [
 <xref rid="CIT0075">75</xref>]. Pathways of selective or nonselective autophagy include glyophagy (glycogen), lipophagy (lipids), pexophagy (peroxisomes), nucleophagy (nucleus), reticulophagy (endoplasmic reticulum), mitophagy (mitochondria), xenophagy (intracellular pathogens) ribophagy (ribosomes) and zymophagy (zymogen granules) [
