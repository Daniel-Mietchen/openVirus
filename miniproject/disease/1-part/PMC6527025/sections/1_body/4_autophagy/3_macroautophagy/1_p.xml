<p>Macroautophagy was discovered in the late 1950s using morphological techniques [
 <xref rid="CIT0081">81</xref>]. Being a principle degrading mechanism of the cell, macroautophagy contributes to the survival of cells under stressful conditions [
 <xref rid="CIT0069">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0082">82</xref>]. Briefly, the cargo is sequestered into autophagosomes followed by their delivery to lysosomes for degradation [
 <xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. There are many proteins involved in the autophagy pathway including ATG proteins. Thirty-two ATG proteins have been identified which play crucial roles in different steps of autophagy activation [
