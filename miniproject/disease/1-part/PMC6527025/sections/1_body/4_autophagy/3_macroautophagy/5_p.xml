<p>Autophagy plays a prominent role in the selective removal of damaged organelles and unfolded proteins [
 <xref rid="CIT0096">96</xref>]. It was believed that autophagy induced by growth factor deprivation acts in a non-selective manner. However, the currently accepted theory is that autophagy sequesters its cargo (organelles, unwanted proteins, etc.) in a very selective mechanism [
 <xref rid="CIT0097">97</xref>]. Generally, changes in cellular metabolic processes cause non-selective autophagy while alterations in homeostasis (such as damaged mitochondria, misfolded proteins, bacterial or viral infection) trigger selective autophagy [
 <xref rid="CIT0098">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0099">99</xref>]. During selective autophagy, cargo is attracted through five well-known special receptors [p62 (SQSTM1), NBR1, NDP52, OPTN, and NIX] which recognize the degradation signals on cargo. Most of these receptors have an LC3-interacting region (LIR) [
 <xref rid="CIT0100">100</xref>] and a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) [
 <xref rid="CIT0101">101</xref>]. This signal in mammals is usually ubiquitin which binds to the receptor UBD [
 <xref rid="CIT0102">102</xref>]. p62 (SQSTM1) is a cargo receptor which greatly contributes to the removal of protein aggregates; a process called aggrephagy. This process is also dependent on the UBD and LIR2 [
 <xref rid="CIT0100">100</xref>]. Furthermore, organelles are also targets of selective autophagy. As an example, mitophagy is involved in the process of damaged mitochondrial degradation and recycling [
 <xref rid="CIT0098">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0103">103</xref>]. Recent studies have identified the presence of receptors involved in mitophagy, such as BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and ATG32 in mammals and yeast, respectively [
 <xref rid="CIT0104">104</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0106">106</xref>]. They regulate mitophagy via phosphorylation of some of their residues, and they use LIR in order to sequester mitochondria [
 <xref rid="CIT0107">107</xref>]. One important concept in the study of autophagy is “autophagic flux”, which is the measurement of the rate of autophagic degradation activity. The rate of the degradation activity is directly related to the respective rates of degradation [
 <xref rid="CIT0108">108</xref>].
