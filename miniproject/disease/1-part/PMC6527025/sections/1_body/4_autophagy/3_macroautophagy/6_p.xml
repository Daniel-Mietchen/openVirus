<p>A basal level of autophagy acts as an intracellular quality control system in normal conditions by protecting the cell from unwanted and damaged proteins and organelles [
 <xref rid="CIT0109">109</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="CIT0111">111</xref>]. Autophagy serves as an adaptive and cytoprotective response upon activation by various stimuli such as oxidative, genotoxic and nutritional factors [
 <xref rid="CIT0073">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0112">112</xref>]. This has been further proved by the observation that cells with non-functional autophagy (chemical or genetic intervention) do not have the necessary ability to adapt to the stressful conditions [
 <xref rid="CIT0110">110</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0112">112</xref>]. Therefore, due to its cytoprotective role in the cell, autophagy serves as a defensive mechanism against different abnormalities like tumorigenesis and also against virus infections. Basal autophagy is also vital for the health and homeostasis of other cell types like neurons and muscle cells, as it has been observed that autophagy dysfunction can lead to the formation of inclusion bodies because of damaged protein aggregation and result in the development of neurodegenerative and cardiac disorders [
 <xref rid="CIT0113">113</xref>]. In addition, autophagy contributes to ER homeostasis through a process called reticolophagy, where some areas of the ER and even part of the nucleus, are targeted and sequestered by selective autophagy. Reticolophagy generally occurs under nitrogen-deprived conditions, and ATG39 and ATG40 are required in the reticolophagy process [
 <xref rid="CIT0114">114</xref>]. These observations show how autophagy can be a determinant factor in controlling cellular metabolic systems both in healthy and unhealthy cells [
