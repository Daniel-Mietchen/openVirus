<p>Virus-induced stress responses are the major focus of this review. Cell stress responses include a wide range of cellular mechanisms intended to either reduce cellular stress-induced damage, or if the damage is beyond repair, direct the cell towards cell death. Cellular stress responses can be protective in nature (e.g. heat shock response or unfolded protein response (UPR)), or they may be pro-cell death, such as programmed cell death, or necrosis [

Autophagy is a multistep process that involves degradation and recycling of proteins and organelles trapped in autophagosomes targeted to fuse with lysosomes. Autophagy helps cells adapt to stress by either preventing cell death or promoting it (autophagic cell death) [
