<p>There are also multiple viruses that exploit lipophagy. DENV infection increases the number of lipid droplets per cell. These dropleys contain viral capsid proteins, suggesting that they provide a platform for nucleocapsid formation and viral replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0127">127</xref>]. Moreover, DENV infection induces lipophagy, which depletes stored triglycerides and increases Î²-oxidation and energy production for viral replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0128">128</xref>].
