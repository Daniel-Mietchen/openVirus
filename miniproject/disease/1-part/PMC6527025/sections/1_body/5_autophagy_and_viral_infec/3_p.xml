<p>The intracellular endosomal TLRs are primary detectors of host defense against viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). They may recruit different adaptors to activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF-3) for IFN production [
 <xref rid="CIT0121">121</xref>]. During viral infection, TLR activation tends to induce autophagy by binding of MYD88 or TRIF to Beclin 1 which disturbs BCL-2 interaction to improve IFN production, whereas the negative regulation of autophagy helps terminate and inhibit TLR signaling by promoting the selective degradation of TRIF [
 <xref rid="CIT0122">122</xref>]. Upon viral infection, the cross-talk between PRRs and autophagy leads to the activation or inactivation of various intracellular signaling pathways, which generates an optimal antiviral environment [
