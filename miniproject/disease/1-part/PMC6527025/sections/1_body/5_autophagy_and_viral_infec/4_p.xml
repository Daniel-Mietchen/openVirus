<p>Following the presentation of viral antigen fragments on MHC molecules in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which are then recognized by T cells, the adaptive immune response is initiated. MHC class I molecules present intracellular antigens after they have been processed by the proteasome and transported into the ER by the antigen peptide transporter (TAP). There is an additional mechanism for loading exogenous antigens onto MHC class I molecules in a process known as cross-presentation. Cross-presentation modulates trafficking and processing of phagocytosed antigens from the endosome to MHC I, and autophagy induces antigen packaging in donor cells for release to APCs [
