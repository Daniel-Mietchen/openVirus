<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) antagonizes autophagy induction. Its M2 protein blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion [
 <xref rid="CIT0124">124</xref>]. Disruption of the M2â€“LC3 interaction decreases virion budding and stability. NS1, a multifunctional IAV protein, also stimulates autophagy indirectly by increasing the synthesis of HA and M2 [
 <xref rid="CIT0125">125</xref>]. HIV-1 induces autophagosome formation and HIV-1 Gag colocalizes with LC3, but HIV-1 Nef blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion by interacting with Beclin 1 to sequester transcription factor EB (TFEB) in the cytosol, thus inhibiting autophagosome maturation [
 <xref rid="CIT0126">126</xref>]. These viruses avoid autophagy-dependent degradation and possibly interfere with innate recognition and presentation of viral antigens on MHC molecules [
 <xref rid="CIT0117">117</xref>]. Flaviviruses also use ER-derived membranes for viral replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0120">120</xref>].
