<p>Following viral infection, autophagy initially triggers an innate immune response by cooperating with a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to induce interferon production and dispose of attacking viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0118">118</xref>]. Then, autophagy coordinates adaptive immunity by delivering antigens derived from the virus for presentation to T lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="CIT0119">119</xref>]. However, during evolution, some viruses have acquired the ability to hijack autophagy, use autophagy-generated metabolites and, in some cases, convert the autophagosome into their “home” during replication. Given that viral infection causes cell stress, autophagy is a frequent by-product of viral infection [
