<p>Viruses are the smallest living organisms and all are obligate intracellular parasites that use host cell machinery for their replication. Based on the nature of the virus’ genetic material [whether RNA or DNA], polarity of genome [whether plus-sense (+) or negative-sense (-)] and strandedness [whether single-stranded (ss), double-stranded (ds), or partially ds], viruses are classified into seven groups (Classes 1–7)[

 <xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. Viruses also can be either enveloped or naked, based on the presence or absence of a membrane envelope. Surrounding the genetic material is a protein coat known as the capsid that protects the viral genome against degradative enzymes. Capsids are composed of capsomeres which are arranged such that most capsids are icosahedral (essentially spherical) or helical in shape. As of 2016, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has reported &gt; 4400 identified viruses in 122 families [
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. Most viruses are extremely specific with regards to the types of host they infect. For example, most plant viruses cannot infect humans or bacteria, and most bacterial viruses (bacteriophages; phages) cannot infect plants or animals. Similarly, with the exception of a few viruses, such as arboviruses (discussed below), most viruses that infect vertebrate animals cannot infect invertebrate insects, and vice versa [
