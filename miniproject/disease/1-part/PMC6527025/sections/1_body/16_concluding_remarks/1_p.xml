<p>Cellular responses to stress are regulated via UPR and autophagy which is regulated by ER chaperone and autophagy regulatory proteins. Both UPR and autophagy are tightly involved in regulation of apoptosis in different cell models and can drive the cells to apoptotic cell death in chronic stress conditions or situations in which stress response mechanisms are not able to rescue the cells. Viruses induce host cellular stress response (UPR, and autophagy) and also are able to hijack autophagy and UPR machinery to promote host infection and replication. However, activation of autophagy and UPR via virus infection can induce chronic and persistent activation of cellular stress responses, which can be involved in the activation/modulation of the apoptotic pathway. Therefore, any tools (CRISPR, small molecule inhibitors/inducers) which can modulate autophagy and UPR could be beneficial approaches to target virus replicative cycles via apoptotic cell death, or by changing the cellular cytokine profile. Currently, many groups are focused on developing new therapeutic approaches to mitigate viral infection by targeting the autophagy and UPR pathways. Our team has recently showed that of autophagy pathway inhibition can successfully affect symptoms of viral infection in a hepatitis c drug irresponsive population [

UPR inhibitors have been successfully used in the animal model and some preclinical trial against different diseases. Recently, it has been showed that MKC8866 (inhibitor of IRE1) can affect secretome [
 <xref rid="CIT0336">336</xref>] therefore it may have some application in the regulation of immune response and cytokine profile of infected cells during viral infection. Overall, continued work in the next few years will better illuminate the roles of these pathways in the regulation of host responses to viral infection.
