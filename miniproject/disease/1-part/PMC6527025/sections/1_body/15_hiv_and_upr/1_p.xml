<p>HIV-1 Tat is a major culprit for HIV/neuro-AIDS. One of the consistent hallmarks of HIV/neuro-AIDS is reactive astrocytes or astrocytosis, characterized by the increased cytoplasmic accumulation of intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). HIV-1 Tat induces GFAP expression in astrocytes and is responsible for astrocyte-mediated Tat neurotoxicity. Aggregation of GFAP induces UPR and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Interestingly, ER stress activation has only recently been detected in HIV-induced neurodegeneration. GFAP expression in the presence of Tat expression activated all UPR/ER pathways including PERK, IRE-1, ATF6 and OASIS [
