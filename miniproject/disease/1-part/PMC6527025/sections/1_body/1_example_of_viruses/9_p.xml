<p>The major challenge in HIV treatment and management is the continuous survival of latently infected cells which indicate incomplete removal of infectious viral particles from an infected individual. HIV is the fourth leading cause of death in developing countries [
 <xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>] and so far has claimed more than 35 million lives globally [
 <xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. In 2017, 940,000 deaths because of HIV infection were recorded [
 <xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. No effective vaccine has been developed due to high levels of mutation within the viral genome [
 <xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. Thus, antiviral therapy, involving various inhibitors against fusion, Integrase, and Protease (combination therapy), are used for management of infected patients. Some efforts are in early stages and involve the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). A recent study showed the impact of cART in HIV-1 infection by examining the JAK-STAT signaling pathway which plays a crucial role in host innate immunity against HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathogen recognition, IRF activation and the induction of IFN-inducible genes such as MxA and ISG56. Liu and colleagues noticed that HIV-1-infected subjects had lower levels of the TLRs, IRFs and the cellular anti-HIV factors. Therefore, they postulated that deficiencies in the JAK-STAT pathway may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 disease. These new directions are focused on latency-reversing agents to activate immunotherapies, gene therapies, and therapeutic vaccines to eliminate persistent HIV reservoirs or induce effective immune control of HIV infection [
