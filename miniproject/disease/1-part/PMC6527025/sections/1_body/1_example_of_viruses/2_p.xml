 <bold>Arboviruses</bold>: These viruses are so named because they are transmitted from animal to animal, or from plant to plant, by invertebrate arthropods (hence arthropod borne). The major insect vectors are primarily found in the tropics and sub-tropical regions; hence approximately one-half of the global population is at risk for these viruses, and the numbers are expected to increase with climate change. The five major families of arboviruses are: 
 <italic>Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Reoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. Arboviruses are diverse; they have either a plus-sense (
 <italic>Flaviviridae, Togaviridae</italic>) or negative-sense (
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>) RNA genome which can either be ss (
 <italic>Bunyaviridae, Flavividae, Rhabdoviridae, Togaviridae</italic>) or ds (
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>). Most of them, except for Reoviruses, have an envelope which is the lipid bilayer acquired while budding out of the host cell. The genome itself of the (+) sense RNA arboviruses serves as the mRNA and is directly translated into a polyprotein which is cleaved by viral and host enzymes into structural and nonstructural proteins. The genomes of (-) sense ssRNA viruses, and the negative-sense strand of the Reovirus dsRNA, must be converted into (+) sense mRNA by the viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) before protein translation.
