<p>The acute stage of HIV infection involves increases in viral load which leads to depletion of the CD4 + T lymphocytes. This stage lasts for approximately 10 weeks from the day of infection. Seroconversion occurs at this stage and transmission is very high. The virus then moves from the blood into lymphoid organs. This stage is known as clinical latency. There is a high level of replication with approximately 10 billion viral copies produced each day. This stage can last for 10 years or more, depending on the immune status of the patient. CD4 T cell numbers may increase at this stage. The late stage involves a sudden increase in viral load with a drastic decrease in CD4 + T cell counts leading to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) which is characterized by opportunistic infections and malignancies.</p>
