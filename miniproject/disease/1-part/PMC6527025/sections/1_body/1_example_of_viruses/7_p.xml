 <bold>HIV</bold>: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) belongs to the family 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic>. HIV1 and HIV2 are the two main subtypes; however, most outbreaks involve HIV1. HIV has a diploid (two copies) (+) ssRNA genome. HIV is an enveloped virus, which has two main glycoproteins, GP120, and GP41 which are needed for cell attachment and entry. CD4 + T lymphocytes are the primary targets of this virus. During viral entry, GP120 recognizes and binds to the CD4 molecule, while GP41 recognizes and binds to the cellular co-receptors. The two most common co-receptors are CCR5 and CXCR4. Binding of GP120 to CD4 results in a conformational change in GP41, leading to its binding to co-receptor, followed by cell fusion [
 <xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. Cell fusion results in the release of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm which is immediately reverse transcribed into dsDNA by viral-encoded Reverse Transcriptase (RT). Newly synthesized viral dsDNA moves into the host cell nucleus where viral-encoded Integrase integrates it into the host DNA. This molecule, now called provirus, uses a host RNA polymerase to produce mRNA, which is translated into viral proteins. Many viral proteins are produced as polyproteins that are cleaved into mature viral proteins by viral-encoded Protease and together, with viral progeny genetic material, bud out of the cell, acquiring an envelope from the host cell with both GP120 and GP41, and some host proteins, embedded in the viral membrane.
