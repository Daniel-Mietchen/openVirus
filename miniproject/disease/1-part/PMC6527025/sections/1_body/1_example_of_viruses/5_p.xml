<p>The natural reservoir of IAV is waterfowl which generally remain asymptomatic. However, crossover to other animals may lead to the emergence of pathogenic subtypes, such as the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) and the 1968 H3N2 that caused severe forms of the disease. IAV causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Other studies have reported IAV attacking other organs such as the heart and CNS [

HA facilitates attachment and viral genome is uncoated and transported to the cell nucleus where genome segments are transcribed by viral RdRp into plus-sense mRNA and translated into the various structural and nonstructural proteins needed for IAV replication. New IAV virions bud out of the cell by the help of NA, which cleaves sialic acid from mucins and cell surfaces.
