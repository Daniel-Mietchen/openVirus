<p>The IAV mode of transmission is mainly by respiratory droplets. High incidences of resistance that develop after prolonged usage make antiviral therapy ineffective. Vaccination is, therefore, the most effective way to prevent IAV outbreaks. Unfortunately, high incidences of mutation in both the HA and NA make complete protection difficult. Mutations arise due to two main genetic phenomena; genetic drift, a result of point mutations due to lack of proofreading by viral RdRp, which usually leads to seasonal differences and epidemics, and genetic shift, which arises because of genetic reassortment between genome segments, which leads to the formation of a totally new virus and often leads to pandemics. Reports by the World Health Organization indicate that between 290,000 and 650,000 respiratory deaths occur annually from seasonal IAV [
