<p>Among arboviruses, 390 million Dengue (DEN) infections are reported globally each year, of which 96 million (67â€“136 million) manifest as severe clinical forms of the disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. In 2015, Zika virus (ZIKV) was reported to cause microcephaly and microencephaly in infants born to infected mothers [
 <xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. Vaccine development among RNA viruses is generally a challenge because of high mutation levels and lack of proofreading by the RdRp. Thus, compounds with antiviral properties are being screened to determine their antiviral efficacy [
 <xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Serologic diagnosis for most of these viruses, especially those that are members of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, is not reliable due to cross-reaction of antibodies produced during infection. Thus, RNA nucleic acid testing by PCR is done to confirm infection, which means countries as well as regions that do not have access to this technology, will have cases which will go unreported, thereby giving a false prevalence rate. In addition, the symptoms elicited in patients who are infected by viruses from the same family, such as DENV and ZIKV, may be very similar, which affects proper diagnosis and clinical administration [
