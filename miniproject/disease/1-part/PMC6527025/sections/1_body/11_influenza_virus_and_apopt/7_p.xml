<p>The polymerase acidic protein of influenza virus (PA)-X, encoded by the PA mRNA as an IAV virulence modulation factor, showed loss of expression in pH1N1 and H5N1 viruses in A549 cells, which was associated with increased virulence and apoptosis and host inflammatory response in mice [
 <xref rid="CIT0302">302</xref>]. Another group showed nucleolin (NCL), a novel PA-interacting host protein, significantly decreased IAV replication in the case of H5N1 infection in HEK293T cells by decreasing inflammatory responses. The antiviral mechanisms of NCL may pave the way to develop new anti-influenza drugs [
