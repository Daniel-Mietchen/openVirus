<p>Several studies have investigated the role of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members including Bcl-2, Bax, and Bak in IAV infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0280">280</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0282">282</xref>]. In silico target prediction analysis revealed complementarity of microRNA miR-29c to the 3‘ untranslated region (UTR) of BCL2L2 mRNA. It is involved in apoptosis induced by IAV infection. IAV infection affects miR-29c and down-regulates Bcl2-L2 expression, which leads to apoptosis promotion in A549 cells (

 <xref rid="CIT0283">283</xref>]. Mclean and colleagues showed that pro-apoptotic protein Bak has antiviral effects and its expression is significantly down-regulated during IAV infection. Bak could suppress IAV replication in MDCK cells at 24 hpi. But Bax was activated at 24 hpi. Lack of Bax prevented influenza A virus-induced apoptosis and caused diminished viral replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0280">280</xref>]. However, Yeganeh et al., showed that Bax and Bak are highly expressed in MEF cells at 18 hpi, but the abundance of both proteins was reduced at 24 hpi [
 <xref rid="CIT0279">279</xref>]. This contradiction between the results of these two studies might be related to the time points sampled and the different cell lines used.
