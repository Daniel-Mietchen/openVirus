<p>The IAV NS1 protein inhibits the JNK pathway in MDCK cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0284">284</xref>]. However, Bax expression, which affects IAV infection, is negatively regulated by the PI3K/Akt/JNK pathway in IAV-infected cells. This leads to JNK-dependent inhibition of Bax-mediated apoptosis in A549 cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0285">285</xref>]. In contrast to the Bak and Bax antiviral effects, PR8 infection in A549 cells induced phosphorylation of another pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, BAD, at residues S112 and S136 in a temporal manner and virus-induced cytopathology and cell death were considerably inhibited in BAD-deficient cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0278">278</xref>]. Chung et al. highlighted in a transcriptomic study that apoptosis marker genes were expressed early in infection, at 8 hpi, which is a host strategy to limit viral infection. The PB1-F2 viral gene was suggested to be responsible for this induction [
 <xref rid="CIT0286">286</xref>]. It has been suggested that the influenza virus could facilitate the progress of its pathogenesis and transmission by induction of apoptosis in neutrophils [
 <xref rid="CIT0287">287</xref>] and NK cells [
