<p>HIV-1 encodes a small gene known as Vpr (viral protein regulatory) whose product is a 96-amino acid protein. HIV-encoded Vpr also has the ability to induce apoptosis through transfection and exogenous treatment. A proposed mechanism includes the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and a direct effect on mitochondrial permeability. When cells become infected with HIV-1, two deleterious effects result from the expression of the Vpr gene. One effect is to manipulate the cell cycle by blocking the cells in G2 phase (the phase of the cell cycle immediately preceding mitosis). Thus, cells infected with HIV-1 cease to proliferate. The second effect is the induction of apoptotic cell death. Vpr induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. This pathway is characterized by cytochrome C release, and caspase 9 activations and is triggered in the absence of death receptor ligation [

Murakami and colleagues conducted time-lapse imaging of HeLa cells containing the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator 2. They highlighted the effects of Vpr on G2 arrest and that subsequent apoptosis was reversible [
