<p>HIV-encoded protease is a cytotoxic protein that leads to apoptosis in human and bacterial cells after transfection. HIV protease correlates with the presence of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Findings suggest that HIV protease may also play a role in the death of HIV-infected T cells. However, there is no evidence that HIV protease can induce apoptosis in uninfected cells [
