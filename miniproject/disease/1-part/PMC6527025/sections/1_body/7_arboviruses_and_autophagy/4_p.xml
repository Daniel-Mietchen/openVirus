<p>The relationship between up-regulation of viral replication and virus-induced autophagy also has been shown in Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infected HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0148">148</xref>]. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) induces autophagy, apoptosis, activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylates c-Jun, all of which benefit EHDV replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0149">149</xref>]. Lee and colleagues suggest that DENV2-related pathogenesis in suckling mice were enhanced by autophagy, possibly by promoting viral replication whereas survival rate was reduced upon autophagy stimulation [
 <xref rid="CIT0162">162</xref>]. The amphisomes play major roles in DENV entry and translation/replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0152">152</xref>]. DENV-2 interacts with amphisomes while DENV-3 interacts with both amphisomes and autophagolysosomes for their translation/replication (
 <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0152">152</xref>]. CHIKV also increases autophagosome formation as a site for aggregation of viral translation/replication complexes [
 <xref rid="CIT0148">148</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0163">163</xref>]. These studies have shown the presence of viral replication/translation complexes of DENV and JEV in both the autophagosome and the endosome, which suggests an auxiliary role for autophagosome–endosome fusion in viral entry [
 <xref rid="CIT0147">147</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0164">164</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of autophagosome accumulation in JEV replication is not clear yet, some studies have suggested the importance of autophagy in reducing mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-IRF3 activation to facilitate virus replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0165">165</xref>]. It has been suggested that during JEV infection, the autophagy process promotes cell survival by delivering damaged mitochondria to lysosomes [
 <xref rid="CIT0165">165</xref>]. The DENV2 non-structural viral protein NS4A has been characterized as a main component of the DENV2 replication complexes [
 <xref rid="CIT0166">166</xref>]. This virus’ replication/translation is associated with NS4A in up-regulating PI3K-dependent autophagy, and preventing cell death [
 <xref rid="CIT0167">167</xref>]. In regards to CHIKV, it has been demonstrated that autophagy postpones apoptosis and promotes CHIKV propagation by inducing the IRE1α–XBP-1 pathway in conjunction with ROS-mediated mTOR inhibition (
 <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0168">168</xref>]. In relation to DENV, lipid droplet usage as an energy source is an autophagy-mediated pro-viral mechanism that is used for this virus’ replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0128">128</xref>]. There are several miRNAs produced during persistent infection of mosquito cells with DENV, which help to regulate proteins that participate in processes such as autophagy [
 <xref rid="CIT0169">169</xref>]. A study on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), showed that the interaction of PRR-PAMP with MAVS through caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) by homotypic reaction, leads to signaling cascades that ultimately activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF-3) [
 <xref rid="CIT0121">121</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0170">170</xref>]. Inhibiting IFN production followed by interaction of atg5-atg12 with the CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 inhibits IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), which can promote VSV replication (
 <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0171">171</xref>].
