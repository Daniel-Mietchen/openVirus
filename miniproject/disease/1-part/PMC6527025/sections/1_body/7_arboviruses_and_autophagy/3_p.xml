<p>The replication of DENV is positively linked to autophagy induction by which the initiation of autophagy is enhanced in DENV-infected cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0154">154</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0155">155</xref>]. However, DENV replication is cell-specific and it would be limited in monocytes [
 <xref rid="CIT0156">156</xref>]. Regarding WNV, which is a neurotropic flavivirus responsible for meningitis and encephalitis, its replication is autophagy independent; however, it still induced autophagy in different mammalian cell lines [
 <xref rid="CIT0157">157</xref>]. Some evidence supports upregulation of autophagy by WNV [

 <xref rid="CIT0159">159</xref>], whereas some other evidence does not [
 <xref rid="CIT0157">157</xref>]. A study by Bl√°zquez and colleagues mapped the genetic determinants of autophagy regulation in WNV-infected Vero cells and thus clarified the controversy concerning the induction of autophagic responses in WNV-infected cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0160">160</xref>]. They highlighted that amino acid substitutions in the viral non-structural proteins 4A or 4B can modulate the induction of autophagy in WNV-infected cells independently of the activation of the unfolded protein response [
 <xref rid="CIT0160">160</xref>]. Another study showed that JEV infection of neuronal cells activated all three pathways of ER stress (UPR). However, they showed that a crucial link exists between two ER stress pathways (XBP1 and ATF6) and autophagy in JEV-infected neuronal cells [
