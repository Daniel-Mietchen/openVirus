<p>Autophagy is associated with replication/translation of different arboviruses [

 <xref rid="CIT0149">149</xref>]. Several arboviruses invoke autophagy components such as the autophagosome, amphisome, and autolysosome not only to serve as a scaffold for viral replication, but also to escape from the immune system [
