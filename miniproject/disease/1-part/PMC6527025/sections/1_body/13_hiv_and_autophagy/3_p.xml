<p>HIV ENV has different effects in different type of cells. The HIV envelope glycoprotein GP120 is released from infected glial cells and able to induce autophagy in neurons. In dendritic cells (DCs), HIV ENV inhibits the autophagic process through activation of mTOR and S6K. This event leads to the inhibition of viral degradation and accumulation of viral particles in DCs. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by LC3 and ATG5 silencing increases HIV transfer to CD4 + T-cells. Autophagy in HAND has also been evaluated. A contribution of autophagy alteration to HAND pathogenesis has been proposed based on the evidence of abnormal accumulation of large autophagosomes and an increase in autophagic markers like ATG5, ATG7, and LC3II in post-mortem brains of HIV patients with encephalitis [
