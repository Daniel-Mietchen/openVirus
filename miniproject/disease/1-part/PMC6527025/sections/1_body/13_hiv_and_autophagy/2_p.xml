<p>In contrast to CD4 + T-cells, macrophages are not depleted during HIV infection, but are considered a reservoir for the virus. Autophagy plays a double role in infected macrophages. HIV infection results in autophagy induction in the early steps of viral infection and blocks autophagy to avoid the elimination of the virus. HIV Tat causes impairment of autophagy in macrophages. Tat inhibits autophagy in neurons and also inhibits autophagosome/lysosome fusion by interaction with LAMP2A; this might be the reason that neurons will proceed to apoptosis because of inhibition of autophagy in HIV-associated neurodegenerative disease (HAND). Tat induces autophagy by interaction with BAG3 in glial cells [

Although autophagy levels are upregulated during infection, both antiviral and immune properties of this process are severely inhibited by HIV infection. An important example is the interaction of Nef and Beclin-1 which inhibits autophagosome maturation [
