  <p>Autophagy Signaling During Influenza A Virus Infection.</p>
  <p specific-use="attrib">Influenza A virus (IAV) induces the NLRP3 inflammasome, which causes mitochondrial damage and release of ROS, which prevents the conversion of LC3-II to LC3-I by degrading Atg4 and leads to increased levels of LC3-II. NLRP3 forms an inflammasome complex with ASC and induces the production of inflammatory cytokines. IAV also binds to Beclin1 by the viral M2 protein. It up-regulates the expression of several autophagy-related genes, which can increase autophagic flux. M2 also contains an LC3-interacting region (LIR) which is required for influenza virus subversion of autophagy; this leads to LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane in infected cells. The complex P-mTORC2/p70S6K blocks lethal autophagy. Autophagosome formation blocks IFN-Î² and reduces ISG expression [modified from [
