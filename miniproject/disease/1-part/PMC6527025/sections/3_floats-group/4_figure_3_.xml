  <p>UPR Signaling During Arbovirus Infection.</p>
  <p specific-use="attrib">ER stress is enhanced in viral infected cells and activates UPR proteins (e.g. PERK, ATF6, and IRE1). Activated PERK induces ATF4 via phosphorylation of eIF2Î±, causing attenuation of translation and genes encoding CHOP. Upon IRE1 activation, TRAF2 and XBP mRNA1 splicing are initiated in the cytoplasm, which subsequently leads to regulation of UPR target genes. The degradation of ATF6 is increased through recruitment of ATF6, a UPR sensor, which results in the regulation of protein folding. The consequences of UPR activation are necessary for viral replication and pathogenesis [modified from [
