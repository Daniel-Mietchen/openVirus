  <p>Apoptosis Signaling During Influenza A Virus Infection.</p>
  <p specific-use="attrib">IAV infection affects apoptosis in early and late infection. In early infection, it has anti-apoptotic effects by decreasing Bax and BAK, but in late infection, it is pro-apoptotic by increasing Bax and BAK, cleavage of PARP-I, truncation of the BID, phosphorylation of BAD and decreasing Bcl-2. Cellular factors P53, miR-29C, TRAIL, CLU and PRPc are involved in IAV infection through the apoptosis pathway. IAV proteins PB1-F2, NP, and NS1 are also involved.</p>
