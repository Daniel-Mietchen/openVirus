  <p>UPR Signaling During Influenza A Virus Infection.</p>
  <p specific-use="attrib">Upon IAV infection, BiP is released from UPR proteins (e.g. PERK, ATF6, and IRE1) and facilitates their activation. IRE1 activation results in the splicing of XBP-1 mRNA in the cytoplasm, leading to its nuclear translocation and transcription of UPR target genes. It mediates HA degradation by involvement of three class I α-mannosidases EDEM1, EDEM2, and ERManI. Upon activation of PERK, eIF2a is phosphorylated and blocks protein synthesis. IAV targets eIF2α by inducing P58IPK, then regulates its mRNA translation by PKR-mediated and PERK-dependent mechanisms. ATF6 translocates to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved, then moves to the nucleus and targets ER chaperone genes. IAV targets this pathway using MxA.</p>
