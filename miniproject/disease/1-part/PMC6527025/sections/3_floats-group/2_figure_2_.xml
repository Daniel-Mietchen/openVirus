  <p>Apoptosis Signaling During Arbovirus Infection.</p>
  <p specific-use="attrib">Arboviruses exert their effect on apoptosis through different signaling routes. A mechanism for anti-apoptotic activity by these viruses is up-regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway. Another mechanism that viruses can regulate is the initiation of protein 14–3-3 through activation of JNK followed by induction of PKR. CCHFV replication is associated with upregulation of Bax, HRK, PUMA, and Noxa. WNV, JEV and DENV block or delay apoptosis via activating PI3K/Akt signaling. WNV can trigger apoptosis after several rounds of replication through caspases-3 and −12 and p53. JEV triggers ROS-mediated ASK1-ERK/p38 MAPK activation which leads to initiation of apoptosis. JEV may affect Bcl-2 expression to increase anti-apoptotic response. DENV may subvert apoptosis by inhibiting NF-kB. DENV reduces immune responses by activation of p53-dependent apoptosis. RVFV inhibits caspase-8 to regulate pro-apoptotic p53 signaling. The BTV-induced apoptosis involves NF-kB [modified from [
