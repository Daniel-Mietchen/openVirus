  <p>Autophagy Signaling During Arbovirus Infection.</p>
  <p specific-use="attrib">There are five possible mechanisms for modulating viral replication which include: a) some arboviruses such as DENV and JEV can use amphisome formation for their entry and replication; b) several arboviruses such as DENV, ZIKV, JEV, CHIKV and TBEV exert diverse mechanisms to induce autophagosome formation to enhance viral replication/translation complexes. DENV is associated with NS4A in up-regulating PI3K-dependent autophagy. CHIKV induces the IRE1α–XBP-1 pathway in conjunction with ROS-mediated mTOR inhibition; c) DENV benefits from autophagy activation by using lipid droplets as an energy source for replication; d) Viruses such as DENV-2 and CHIKV can increase their replication by prolonging cell survival and preventing cell death; and d) VSV appears to suppress IFN signaling by conjugated Atg5-Atg12, leading to an effective virus-suppressing immune response [modified from [
