<p>Both CDV and MeV belong to the genus 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> and have the same genomic architecture. The high nucleotide and amino acid similarities between both viruses results in high levels of functional and structural conservation, this is why the CDV has been used as a model to understand the pathogenesis of measles, and often has been used in genetic engineering to develop vaccines and antiviral treatments [
