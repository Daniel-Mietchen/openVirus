<p>The SLAM receptor has 39 residues that are involved in the interaction with CDV protein H [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]; when comparing the aminoacidic sequences of the SLAM receptor in different species -human, dog, raccoon, mink, fox, cow, mouse- an identity of 57.2% is observed between the human SLAM and the dog, fox and cow receptors. Likewise, there are an amino acid identity of 93.1% between nectin-4 receptor in humans and dogs [

The possible explanation for the inability of CDV to infect humans and domestic cats could be the differences in certain residues that alter the SLAM interaction region determining a low affinity interaction between the cellular receptor and CDV protein H [
