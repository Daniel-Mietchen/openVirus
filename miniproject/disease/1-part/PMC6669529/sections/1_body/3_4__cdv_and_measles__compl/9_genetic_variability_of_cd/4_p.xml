<p>Evolutionary comparative analyses of both virus receptor-binding proteins and host receptor proteins may help elucidate virus–host co-evolutionary dynamics. Additionally, comparative genomics in a phylogenetic framework permits the assessment of evolutionary forces that influence genetic variation in those interacting regions reflecting virus–host arms races [

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Comparative genetic studies including several complete genome sequences of CDV showed that certain residues are under positive selection, almost all located in the receptor binding region of the H protein [
