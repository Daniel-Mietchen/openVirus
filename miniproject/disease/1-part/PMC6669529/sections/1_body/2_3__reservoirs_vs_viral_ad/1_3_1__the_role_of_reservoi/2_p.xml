<p>Although the initial spread of CDV resulting from the interactions between domestic canids and wildlife has been shown to trigger high mortality in wildlife [

In 2015, authors analyzed CDV outbreaks in dogs and lions in the Serengeti National Park, revealing that initially the outbreaks in lions were due to virus transmission by domestic dogs; however, over the years the outbreaks in lions (1993â€“1994, 1999 and 2007) were asynchronous with those in domestic dogs, suggesting that CDV may persist in other wild species interacting with this lion population [

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and possibly in other ecosystems. This hypothesis is supported by the variety of species reported as susceptible for CDV infection [
