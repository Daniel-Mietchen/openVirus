<p>Multiple epidemiological scenarios can lead to the presence of CDV in wildlife even in the absence of infection in domestic populations [

 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and in captivity [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], CDV can also occur in different domestic or wild species without clinical signs. For example, domestic dogs can be CDV-positive without developing signs but can still transmit the virus since viral RNA is found on fecal swabs, thus these individuals act as potential CDV reservoirs [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Recently, CDV shedding was observed up to several months after the cessation of clinical signs in recovered domestic dogs [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]; therefore emphasizing the role of asymptomatic domestic dog carriers in CDV epidemiology in this species in urban areas.
