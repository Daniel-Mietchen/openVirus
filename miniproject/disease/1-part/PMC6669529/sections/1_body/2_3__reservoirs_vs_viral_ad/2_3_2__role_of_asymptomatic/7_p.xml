<p>In these last cases it is not possible to differentiate between vaccine failure—a vaccine that does not provide protection against wild CDV strains [

 <xref rid="B82-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], the efficacy, safety, and possible risks of administering vaccines to free-living wildlife should be critically evaluated to avoid possible lethal consequences, especially in areas of high biodiversity. Moreover, the handling of the animals to administer the vaccine [
