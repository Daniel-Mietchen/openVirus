<p>For example, CDV is thought to have specialized in two major host orders: Caniformia and Feliformia, in which the virus quasispecies with better host fitness are considered specialized strains [

 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Those have acquired the ability to interact with SLAM receptors of different species, and they have coevolved with their hosts, thus fixing mutations allowing the virus to specialize in a particular host; thus, antagonistic pleiotropy in CDV shows that substitutions at the hemagglutinin are related to species jump. However, the capacity for evasion of the immune response should be studied in the other viral proteins in each affected host [
