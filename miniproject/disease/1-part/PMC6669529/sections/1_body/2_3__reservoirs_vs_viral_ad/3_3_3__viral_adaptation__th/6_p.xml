<p>In a homogeneous environment with a single host species, strong coevolution promotes the optimization of viral fitness in that host (i.e., fitness peaks), resulting in low fitness of the virus in other species (i.e., fitness valleys). Therefore, specialists should be favored in homogeneous environments [

By contrast, in heterogeneous environments where multiple hosts are available, the evolution of generalists with the highest average fitness that allow the virus to infect all hosts should be favored, which results in suboptimal fitness in any single host in comparison to single-species specialists [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Therefore, specialists should have greater fitness in the host species to which they are well adapted than generalists in that same host [
