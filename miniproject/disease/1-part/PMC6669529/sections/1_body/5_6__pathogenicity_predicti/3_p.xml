<p>Similarly, in a Brazilian study all the strains isolated from dogs harbored the substitution 549H causing the death of every animal, with a statistically significant association (

 <italic>H</italic> gene are the first performed for CDV, and should be extended to the study of the complete genome to explain the pathogenesis in the various susceptible species. It has been reported that mutations in intergenic regions, and in the 5′ and 3′ UTRs can affect the virulence and pathogenicity of field strains [

 <italic>M–F</italic> intergenic region were associated with a different viral phenotype [
