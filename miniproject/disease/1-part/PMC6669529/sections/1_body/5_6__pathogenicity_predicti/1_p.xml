<p>Genetic approaches are one of the multiple tools used to analyze viral spread and pathogenesis. Association predictions between morbidity and lethality related to the presence of specific substitutions at certain genomic positions have been presented by several authors [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>,
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. It is important to note that these predictions are hypotheses that arise from the analysis of the sequences obtained by the authors and that due to the lack large epidemiological studies no statistical association has been established.
