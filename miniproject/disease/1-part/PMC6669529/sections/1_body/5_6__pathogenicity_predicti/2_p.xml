<p>In the non-canid CDV strains from the 1993â€“1994 Serengeti outbreak a new substitution in the H protein (R519I) was associated with the presence of clinical signs in these wild species (African lion and spotted hyena). In this study, the authors evaluated the presence of various combinations of substitutions at positions 519 and 549 of the protein H in strains from domestic dogs, wild canids, and non-canids wild species. They found that a rare combination of substitutions in these positions (519I and 549H) was only observed in non-canid strains and was related to a fatal outcome only in non-canids (lion and hyena). The other combinations found (519R/549Y and 519R/549H) caused death only in domestic and wild canids (
