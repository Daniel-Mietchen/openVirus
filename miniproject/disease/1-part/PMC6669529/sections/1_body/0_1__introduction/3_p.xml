<p>The transcriptional CDV units are separated by untranslated regions (UTRs) that are relatively uniform (107–155 nucleotides), except for the UTR between the M and F genes, which has approximately 405 nucleotides. This UTR modulates virulence through the translational control of the protein F [

 <italic>phosphoprotein</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic>) gene (1524 nucleotides) is highly conserved and encodes a viral polymerase cofactor protein (P) and two additional nonstructural proteins V and C, which are produced by RNA editing and an alternative start of the translation, respectively [
