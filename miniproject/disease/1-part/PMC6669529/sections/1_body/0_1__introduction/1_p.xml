<p>Canine morbillivirus also known as canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the genus Morbillivirus within the family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, which also includes measles virus (measles morbillivirus—MeV), phocine distemper virus (phocine morbillivirus—PDV), peste des petits ruminants virus (small ruminant morbillivirus—PPRV), and rinderpest virus (rinderpest morbillivirus—RPV), which has already been eradicated [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CDV has the ability to infect a wide range of species and poses a risk to the conservation of free and captive wildlife [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The present review will analyze different viral and host characteristics to elucidate the conditions that have allowed the CDV to have this wide distribution, evidencing different successful genetic and evolutionary scenarios in both domestic and different wildlife environments.
