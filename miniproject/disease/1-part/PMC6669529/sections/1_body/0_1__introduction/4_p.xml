<p>The 
 <italic>hemagglutinin</italic> gene has 1824 nucleotides and encodes for the protein H, which shows the highest variability in CDV when compared to other morbilliviruses [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This gene has the highest divergence within CDV genome with substitution rates between 5.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>–1.8 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site, per year [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The protein H determines the viral tropism and initiates the infection by binding to the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) receptor in immune cells [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and nectin-4 receptor in epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When dogs recover from natural infection/disease due to CDV, they develop neutralizing antibodies against the H protein which confers lifelong immunity to the diseases [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has been shown that for this gene wild type and vaccine strains are highly divergent (7–10% for nucleotides and 8–11% for amino acids) with a nucleotide identity between 93–90% and amino acid identity between 92–89%. It is because of this high variability, that this gene is used in for the phylogenetic classification of CDV in different lineages or genotypes [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The fusion (F) protein is encoded by the 
 <italic>F</italic> gene, composed by 1989 nucleotides. After the binding of the protein H to the host cellular receptor, the F protein mediates the fusion between the viral envelope and the host plasma membrane at physiological pH [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A short region of this gene (405 nucleotides) encodes for the F signal peptide; the signal peptide region is highly variable and has also been used in phylogenetic classification, representing a rapid method for characterizing circulating CDV strains [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The matrix (M) protein, encoded by the 
 <italic>M</italic> gene with 1008 nucleotides, constitutes the inner layer of the viral envelope and interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of the H and F proteins [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. When this protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm during the replication cycle, it also associates with the ribonucleoprotein complex, connecting it to the envelope, thus playing an essential role in viral shedding [
