<p>The virus is pleomorphic (spherical and filamentous shapes), with a size between 150â€“300 nm in diameter and contains a genome comprising single-stranded, non-segmented ribonucleic acid (RNA) of negative coding sense. The genome comprises 15,690 nucleotides (15.6 kb), including six gene regions organized in separate and non-overlapping transcriptional units coding for six structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), viral polymerase (L), matrix (M) and the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion protein (F) glycoproteins [
