<p>Different studies have tried to elucidate the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for CDV [

 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. However, the number of sequences available in the GenBank throughout years has led to diverse results, making the data from different studies not comparable. A first approach, published in 2008, estimated the tMRCA for CDV to happened 58 years ago using a sequence from 2001 as reference, suggesting that the ancestor existed in 1943, with an interval from 1894 to 1974 and 95% higher probability density (HPD) [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In Taiwan, the tMRCA was established in 1945, with an interval from 1918 to 1966 and a 95% HPD [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Likewise, in Brazil, another tMRCA was found to be 92 years from 1919, with an interval from 1899 to 1944 and a 95% HPD [
