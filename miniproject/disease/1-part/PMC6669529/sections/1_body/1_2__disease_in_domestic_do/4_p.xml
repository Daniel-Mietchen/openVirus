<p>Viruses with a broad host range such as CDV could persist in populations with great sizes and may potentially cause disastrous epidemics in endangered species. Thus, the understanding of CDV’s epidemiology in multiple species is of great importance from a conservation point of view [

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, different studies have reported the link between CDV infection and the population decline of various wildlife species [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], highlighting the possible role of CDV as a cause of extinction of certain endangered wildlife species [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. CDV outbreaks have been reported in near-extinct species, such as the giant panda (
 <italic>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</italic>) in a wild animal rescue and conservation center in China with a morbidity of 27% and mortality of 23% [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the Ethiopian wolf 
 <italic>(Canis simensis)</italic> with a reported mortality of up to 68% in a wild population in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. CDV has also been reported in monkey breeding sites with an incidence of 20–60% and a mortality of 5–30% in 
 <italic>Macaca fuscata</italic> and 
 <italic>Macaca mulata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the Serengeti National Park, in Tanzania, CDV has been detected in canid and non-canid species with varying outcomes of the disease depending on the genetic strain involved [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with changes in the CDV genome of the non-canid viruses that were consistent with expansion of selected variants in non-canid hosts [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Most notably, a strain adapted to non-canids but not with the recent spillover of a dog strain caused a fatal epidemic in 1993–1994 in two non-canid species, killing approximately one third of the African lion population (
 <italic>Panthera leo</italic>) and several juveniles spotted hyena 
 <italic>(Crocuta crocuta)</italic> [
