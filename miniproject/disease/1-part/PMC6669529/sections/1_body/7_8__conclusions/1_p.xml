<p>Viruses with a broad host range such as CDV are highly contagious and have high morbidity and mortality in wild and domestic animal populations. Epidemiological data from around the world show that CDV has become an important threat for conservation of multiple species even outside of the Carnivora order. The lack of ecoepidemiological information of CDV transmission beyond the infection between dogs, has led to investigate the importance of the infection in a multihost scenario that is not totally yet understood. The capability of the virus to adapt to multiple species and evolve in those, makes CDV not only a well-known pathogen of domestic dogs, but one of the most important pathogen of mammals with the ability to jump the species barrier and perhaps even infect humans. The different transmission scenarios discussed in this paper are an attempt to elucidate the transmission of CDV in different environments, and encourage uniting multiple areas of research for understanding the intricate epidemiological dynamics of CDV in multiple hosts.</p>
