<p>The 
 <italic>H</italic> gene is the basis for the phylogenetic classification of CDV due to the high evolutionary pressure to which its protein subjected. The 
 <italic>H</italic> gene study has also allowed researchers to infer key amino acid substitutions involved in the inter-species jump. The developing of new studies of the CDV complete genome would enable us to explain in detail its evolution and to establish substitution rates, glycosylations, and homologous recombination points that would explain the pathogenicity, species jump ability and vaccine failure of this virus.
