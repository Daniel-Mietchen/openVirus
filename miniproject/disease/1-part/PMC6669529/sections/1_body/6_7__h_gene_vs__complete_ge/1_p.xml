<p>There is controversy about which position substitutions in the 
 <italic>H</italic> gene are associated with CDV host adaptation and pathogenicity in the various affected species, which has led the scientific community to conclude that more sequences of the 
 <italic>H</italic> gene in wildlife should be obtained to clarify this point [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. As was mentioned, it is necessary to broaden the search for molecular markers to explain relevant aspects such as the species barrier jump and the pathogenicity of field strains. Studies on CDV infection in human cells have characterized the complete genome of these adapted strains, and in addition to the 
 <italic>H</italic> gene sites, substitutions associated with host adaptation and immune system evasion were found in other genes [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Additionally, other authors have characterized the complete genome of wildlife strains and have reported important substitutions (at CDV-H 519/549) that could explain the adaptation, immune system evasion, and the presence/absence of clinical signs in these animals [
