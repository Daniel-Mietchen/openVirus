<p id="Par16">The challenge of diagnosing pneumonia and ARDS in patients with positive laboratory results for influenza relates to the temporality of the clinical events. Influenza virus infection alone can cause severe pneumonia and ARDS, but it can also act in conjunction with a bacterial infection (discussed below). It can precede a pneumonia episode caused by a secondary bacterial infection, most commonly by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, or can be followed by an episode of nosocomial pneumonia [

In the case of severe pneumonia or ARDS, the only reliable clue that influenza is a possible causal agent is the presentation during the peak season of the epidemic because the symptomatology alone cannot distinguish severe influenza from other viral or bacterial respiratory infections. Primary influenza pneumonia shows persistence and/or subsequent worsening of respiratory symptoms, while secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs 1–3 weeks as a “relapse” after the initial Influenza symptoms have ended or subsided; however, bacterial co-infection can also occur a few days after the Influenza illness onset. That said, only 5% of all severe pneumonias admitted to the ICU are from a viral etiology [
