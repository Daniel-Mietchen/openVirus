<p id="Par10">Ultimately, the involvement of significant portions of the airways in an infectious response, either by direct viral infection or by damage from the responding immune system, represents a physiological failure. The inability of the lung to perform its primary function of gas exchange can result from multiple, non-exclusive mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity from direct epithelial cell killing, and degradation of the critical extracellular matrix that maintains the structure of the lung [

This latter area has been relatively understudied, with the relationship between the immune response and extracellular matrix structure not fully elucidated. Further, the key pathways regulating extracellular matrix degradation and regeneration in the context of infection and in the restoration of healthy lung functioning are not fully understood [
