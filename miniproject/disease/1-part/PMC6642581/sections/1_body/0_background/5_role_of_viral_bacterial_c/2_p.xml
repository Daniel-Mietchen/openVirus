<p id="Par19">The mechanism of increased susceptibility to bacterial co-infection after an influenza virus infection has been a focus of many studies. The lung immune environment is substantially altered after influenza virus infection, with early depletion of alveolar macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. As these cells play a key role in the response to many bacterial infections, their loss may play a critical part in increasing susceptibility. Additionally, the normal regulatory mechanisms that are induced by any inflammatory response are triggered by a viral infection. These include the upregulation of key negative regulators on the surface of lung immune cells, including CD200 on airway macrophages. Such suppressor activity is necessary to allow tissue repair and avoid pathological consequences of overzealous immune responses, but they can allow a window of opportunity for bacteria [

Blocking the glucocorticoid response actually led to death from the inflammation associated with the influenza virus infection, demonstrating the balance between tolerance and pathogen resistance that can be difficult to determine in the co-infected host [
