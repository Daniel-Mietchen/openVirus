<p id="Par18">The occurrence of viral-bacterial respiratory co-infections has been described for over a century, including the period of the 1918 influenza pandemic; however, until just a few years ago, the general evidence pointed to this as a uncommon event without major changes on patients’ outcomes. The recent advent of more rapid and available microbiological diagnostic tests (e.g. real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) has revealed a very different picture. Nowadays viral etiologies per se are responsible for one-third of all cases of community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. These etiologies include influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and other less frequent microorganisms. Viral infections presenting concurrently with bacterial CAP are now known to occur with a frequency of 30–50% in both adult and pediatric populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Interestingly, it would be more intuitive to assume that CAP would be the most severe manifestation of these co-infections, but more recently there have been several studies demonstrating these viral-bacterial infections also affect 10–20% of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In a large cohort study with over 2,000 patients hospitalized with severe H1N1pdm09 influenza, the following risk factors were identified for developing HAP: need for mechanical ventilation, sepsis, ICU admission on the first day, lymphocytopenia, older age, and anemia. Of note, growing evidence suggests that 20–30% of pediatric and adult patients presenting with suspected bacterial sepsis may have a viral co-infection (e.g. influenza, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus) and about two thirds of these cases are commonly missed by clinicians [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Current data still lacks proof that the clinical presentation with viral-bacterial co-infections directly leads to worse outcomes, but a growing body of evidence suggests that influenza-bacterial co-infections are associated with higher morbidity and higher mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In fact, a recent study showed that the presence of co-infection in adults with influenza-associated acute respiratory syndrome requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation was significantly associated with a fourfold increase in mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], and another study in children with 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> co-infection with influenza-related critical illness also showed a ninefold significant increase in mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].
