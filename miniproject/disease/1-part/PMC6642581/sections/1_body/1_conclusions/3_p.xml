<p id="Par23">Influenza can primarily cause severe pneumonia, but it can also present in conjunction with or be followed by a secondary bacterial infection, most commonly by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Influenza is associated with a higher predisposition to bacterial sepsis and ARDS. Viral infections presenting concurrently with bacterial pneumonia are now known to occur with a frequency of 30â€“50% in both adult and pediatric populations. Influenza A (H3N2) virus has been associated with unprecedented high levels of intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
