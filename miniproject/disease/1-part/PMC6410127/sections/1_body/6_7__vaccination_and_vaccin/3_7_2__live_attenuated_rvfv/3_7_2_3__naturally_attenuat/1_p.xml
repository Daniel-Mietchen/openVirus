<p>The natural deletion of 549 nucleotides (70%) of the 
 <italic>NSs</italic> gene (the main virulence factor), leads to the development of attenuated clone 13 vaccine. This vaccine is a plaque-derived clone, isolated from immunocompetent patients infected with 74HB59 RVFV strain from the Central African Republic [

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Clone 13 vaccine is highly potent (equivalent to Smithburn vaccine), safe, causes no abortions or teratogeny in immunized pregnant ewes [

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], suggesting that the vaccine is not completely harmless. Further, administration of the pregnant ewes with an overdose of Clone 13 vaccine in the first trimester, allowing the vaccine to cross the placental barrier, leading to fetal malformations, and stillbirth [
