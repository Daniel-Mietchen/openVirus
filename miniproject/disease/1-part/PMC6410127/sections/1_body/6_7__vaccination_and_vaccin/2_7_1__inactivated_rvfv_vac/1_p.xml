<p>The first RVF vaccine was formalin-inactivated and was developed from RVFV Entebbe strain (NDBR103), isolated from Uganda mosquitoes via 176 intraperitoneal or intravenous serial passages in mice, then 184 passages in green monkey kidney cells [

It was also used for 963 UN soldiers who received the vaccine administered subcutaneously (s/c) in three doses at 0, 7–10, and 28–30 days. The immunized soldiers exhibited good antibody titers, which reached its peak at six weeks post-vaccination [

 <xref rid="B73-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This vaccine was used for vaccinating service troops by three s/c injections on days 0, 7, and 28, followed by a single booster dose after six-months. The vaccine produces a 1:237 neutralizing antibody titer and induced long-term immunity in vaccinated humans with primer and booster doses [

Interestingly, the Veterinary Serum and Vaccine Research Institute (VSVRI) in Egypt developed another formalin-inactivated vaccine from Egyptian RVFV strains that were isolated from the 1977 outbreak (ZH501). The virus was propagated in BHK-21 cells, inactivated with 0.5% formalin with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, and used only for animal immunization in Egypt [
