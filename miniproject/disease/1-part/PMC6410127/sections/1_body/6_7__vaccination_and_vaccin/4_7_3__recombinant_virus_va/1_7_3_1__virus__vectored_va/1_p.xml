<p>There are many virus vectors that have been identified as vaccines for controlling RVFV. For example, heterologous vectors expressing Gn and/or Gc glycoproteins and non-structural proteins of RVFV and they include: (1) Vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain (Vco) devoid of the virulent gene, which expresses Gn and Gc of RVFV, elicit protective antibody titers, and is highly safe in mice, primates, and ruminant [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], (2) Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) which was experimentally evaluated in South Africa as a vector for RVFV glycoproteins and can generate neutralizing antibodies against LSDV, RVFV, and sheep poxvirus (which is closely related capripoxvirus) [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], (3) Chimpanzee adenovirus construct vector (ChAdOx1-GnGc) which also carry Gn and Gc of RVFV can induce humoral and cell-mediated immunity and provided complete protection against RVFV infection in ruminants [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], (4) Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) which express RVFV envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc and showed efficacy in murine models [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], (5) Recombinant New Castle disease virus (NDV) that was evaluated in calves and induced neutralizing antibodies in sheep after two doses [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Sheep and cattle are not the natural hosts of Newcastle virus, leading to the absence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated animals, which is the main advantage of NDV vectored-vaccine, (6) alphavirus (Sindbis) replicon vaccine, which exhibited 100% protection against RVFV in mice, and augmented RVFV neutralizing antibody responses in sheep [
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], and (7) equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) vector vaccine, which induced RVFV neutralizing antibody titers in sheep [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Recombinant RVFV vaccines lacking 
 <italic>NSs</italic> and 
 <italic>NSm</italic> proteins can overcome fetal malformations and abortions [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The Virus-vectored vaccine possessed high efficacy and safety in both pregnant and non-pregnant sheep [
