<p>The reverse genetic technology system helps in the management of complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of each RVFV genome segment in vitro for the generation of novel reverse genetic vaccines [

 <xref rid="B122-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The production of attenuated recombinant RVFV vaccine has been established by a reverse genetic system (infectious clone system) [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Laboratory studies carried out on the immune-evading role of non-structural viral proteins allow the creation of virus deficient for these proteins using reverse genetics technology. The virulent vaccines were developed and examined in rats and ruminants [

 <xref rid="B127-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Reverse genetic systems were used to generate new ZH501-derived mutant virus (rRVF-ΔNSs:GFP-ΔNSm ) with M-segment lacking the 
 <italic>NSm</italic> gene and containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) in the 
 <italic>NSs</italic> gene of the S-segment [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The rRVF-ΔNSs:GFP-ΔNSm virus is highly attenuated (due to the lack of 
 <italic>NSs</italic>) and is highly immunogenic in rats challenged with RVFV at 28 days post vaccination after a single 1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> or 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu vaccination [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Additionally, DDvax vaccine (recombinant ZH501 strain), that encoding the deletions of 
 <italic>NSs</italic> and 
 <italic>NSm</italic> genes [rZH501-ΔNSs-ΔNSm] has shown protective efficacy in pregnant ewes, without causing any adverse effects in newborn lambs [
 <xref rid="B125-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The reverse genetic vaccines have shown protective and immunogenic effects in sheep, rats, and mice without producing clinical signs. The single deletion mutant (ΔNSs rRVFV) and double deletion mutant (ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV) vaccines were shown to be immunogenic and safe in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a non-human primate (NHP) model. These vaccines induced strong antibody response after a single dose without adverse reactions, clinical signs, or detection of infectious virus in vaccinated marmosets. Also, there were no detectable viremia or liver diseases in animals challenged with RVFV [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. RVFV vaccines lack 
 <italic>NSs</italic> gene and/or 
 <italic>NSm</italic> gene with the insertion of a nonviral gene is useful to differentiate between naturally infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA test) as the vaccinated animals elicit antibodies against the inserted nonviral gene and do not elicit antibodies against deleted proteins [
