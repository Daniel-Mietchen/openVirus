<p>Plasmid DNA vaccines have been used against some pathogens when scientists discovered that naked DNA could be transferred into tissue and express the antigen [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. DNA vaccines encoding a protective antigen with a strong promoter can be used to express protective proteins [
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Administration of plasmid DNA vaccine is usually via intramuscular, intradermal, or mucosal routes and reaches the host cells via endocytic vesicles, membrane pores, or mediated receptors [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Inside the cells, DNA is transferred to the nucleus and is presented to the immune system [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. A DNA vaccine was developed from plasmid encoding, Gn and Gc of RVFV, Hantavirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and 
 <italic>preM</italic> and E genes of tick-borne encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The DNA vaccine combination produced protective antibodies against RVFV infection in mice; whereas DNA vaccine expressing Gn and Gc exhibited a 20% survival rate in mice [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. This vaccine is stable, suitable for use in tropical countries and has variable efficacy based on gene gun immunization of mice with a plasmid carrying G1 and G2 of RVFV [

 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The low immunogenicity of DNA vaccines can be enhanced by using immune modulators [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] or using booster dose of the DNA vaccine or primary vaccination with a plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a booster dose with attenuated or viral vectored vaccine [
