<p>Virus-like particles (VLPs) is a replication-deficient viral particle that consists of the viral envelope protein (Gn and Gc), and N protein while lacking the viral infectious genetic material [

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] The VLPs are characterized by (1) a lack of the risk of virus replication and inactivation, (2) a morphological similarity to the virulent virus, (3) enhanced adsorption with cell wall and digesting in endolysosomes, (4) the stimulation of both MHC class I and class II responses, (5) the stimulation of cellular and humoral-mediated immune responses against RVFV [
