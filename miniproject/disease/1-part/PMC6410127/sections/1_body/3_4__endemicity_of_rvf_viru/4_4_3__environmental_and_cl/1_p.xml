<p>The environment and climate directly impact how, when and where humans, animals, and vectors live and thrive. The presence of an appropriate environment for multiplication and growth of vector mosquito species, such as the presence of water ponds in the Egyptian villages, which can serve as a suitable environment for the breeding of mosquitoes, and the blood feeding habit of the vectors on sheep blood, an important reservoir host of RVFV, impact RVF transmission. Past outbreaks of RVFV have been associated with periods of heavy rainfalls. Fluctuations between drought and heavy rains in Egypt, leading to water collection near homes that serve as a suitable environment for mosquitoes breeding and make it easier to feed without flying so far from breeding sites, have contributed to RVFV outbreaks. The geographical location of Egypt in Africa and in the center of the Middle East maintains the endemicity of the disease; Egypt serves as a focal point that transmits the RVFV disease to Europe and Asia.</p>
