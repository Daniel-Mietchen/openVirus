<p>There are three surveillance methods for RVF based on OIE definition: (1) syndromic surveillance which is based on the detection of clinical cases or disease patterns. It depends on the presence of abortion storms in ruminants with early deaths (in lambs, kids or calves) especially during the presence of surface flooding following heavy rainfalls, (2) participatory surveillance which detects the best methods that help people to identify, solve their health needs and understand the risk perception with a greater involvement of animal owners in RVF disease surveillance. Participatory epidemiology is used in disease surveillance, risk assessment, disease control, disease recovery, prevention of reinfection, project development and epidemiological research. Participatory epidemiologists have developed qualitative risk maps as a first step for the RVF disease control, and (3) risk-based surveillance, which is surveillance of locations, populations, and periods with increased disease threats. It is aimed to detect disease rapidly and result in better use of resources. Risk-based surveillance uses quantitative or qualitative information (developed within several hours) that help in disease control [
