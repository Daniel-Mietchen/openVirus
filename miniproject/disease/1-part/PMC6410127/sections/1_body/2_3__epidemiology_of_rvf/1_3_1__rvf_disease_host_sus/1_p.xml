<p>The most susceptible hosts to RVF infection are sheep, goats, lambs, cattle, buffaloes, some wild animals, and mice [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Camels may play an important role in the entrance and maintenance of RVFV in Egypt as camels enter Egypt via Sudan without any virological investigation or even a period of quarantine. Abortion storms in camels have been reported during RVF outbreaks in Egypt [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and the virus was isolated from healthy and naturally infected camel blood. Interestingly, the importation of camel and sheep from Sudan was considered the main source of the RVF during the first Egyptian outbreak in 1977 [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, horses, pigs, fowl, and guinea pigs are resistant to RVFV infection. Especially during livestock outbreaks, RVFV caused serious disease in humans [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For example, the mortality rate in lamb and adult sheep was 90% and 20–60%, respectively, while the abortion in pregnant ewes can reach 100% [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The disease was less severe in cattle and camels with a 10–30% mortality rate and the abortion rate in pregnant cows was 30–40% [
