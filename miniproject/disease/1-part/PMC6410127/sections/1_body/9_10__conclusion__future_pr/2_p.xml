<p>One Health approach of RVFV requires collaboration among: (1) medical and veterinary clinicians, diagnosticians, epidemiologists, and public health experts to perform rapid diagnosis, notification, treatment of the affected patients and animals, provide notices to minimize the risk of future disease spread among the affected species, (2) wildlife experts to understand the epidemiology of the disease in wildlife and its role in disease transmission, (3) entomologists to understand the vector biology, its role in RVFV epidemiology and to provide advice on vector control, (4) ecologists to determine the impact of the disease on the ecology and the environment, (5) economists and social scientists to assess the social and economic impact of RVF disease on the populations, (6) governments and decision makers to write policies and support funding required for the One Health approach, prevention, and control, (7) vaccinologists to develop and provide the vaccines for virus control, and (8) pharmaceutical industries for treatment (both human and animals) and vector control (repellents, insecticides, acaricides, and larvicides). The One Health approach includes: (1) using a safe and effective RVFV vaccine to vaccinate the susceptible animals under the supervision of the government in order to decrease outbreaks in humans, (2) the establishment of a strong and regular surveillance system and fast reporting program for the disease, (3) the hiring of well trained and professional personnel, (4) conducting epidemiological investigations to determine the risk factors, (5) the training of veterinary and medical health specialists on the diagnosis and management of suspected cases, (6) increasing public health awareness about the RVFV and its transmission, (7) breaking the virus transmission cycle by controlling the mosquitoes, and (8) controlling animal importation and quarantine for imported animals from Africa.</p>
