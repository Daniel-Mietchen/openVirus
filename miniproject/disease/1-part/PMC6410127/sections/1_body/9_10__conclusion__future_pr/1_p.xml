<p>RVFV is a highly fatal endemic viral disease in Egypt and was included by the OIE in the category A- diseases that have a potential of rapid and extensive spread. This disease causes severe economic losses in humans and animals in Egypt. RVF is characterized by complex epidemiology due to the involvement of multiple mosquito species in the transmission cycle. Therefore, this disease is a significant problem that requires collaboration between multidiscipline researchers from different organizations to control the disease in Egypt. In order to effectively control the disease in Egypt, we recommend an effective collaboration between GOVs, the ministry of health, epidemiologists, veterinarians, and stakeholders. Currently, the One Health approach is used for the management and understanding of animal, human, and environmental determinants of the disease through the collaboration and direct communication between veterinarians, occupational health physicians, and public health operators in order to control the RVF through improving the education system, status of thinking, legislation, and administrative structures. Recently, the One Health approach can save up to 35% of RVFV control costs [
