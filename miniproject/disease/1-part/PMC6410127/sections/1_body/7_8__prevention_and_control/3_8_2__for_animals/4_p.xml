<p>The Egyptian GOVs have banned the use of live attenuated-RVFV (Smithburn vaccine) since 2007 and have decided to use only the inactivated ZH501 vaccine for regular immunization against RVFV in animals. The inactivated vaccine has overcome the disadvantages of the live attenuated vaccine, such as abortion in pregnant animals and reversion to virulence. The GOVs have obtained the vaccine from the VSVRI, and immunize the animals for free.</p>
