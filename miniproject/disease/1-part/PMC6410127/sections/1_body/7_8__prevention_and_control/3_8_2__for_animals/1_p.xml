<p>The control of RVFV in animals in Egypt was based on detection of the disease, vector control, restriction of animal movement, and animal vaccination. Several vaccines were reported to be used for the control of RVF in Egypt including: (1) Formalin-inactivated vaccine with alum adjuvant (Menya/sheep/258) strain produced by VACSERA company in Egypt, (2) Binary ethylenamine inactivated vaccine with alum adjuvant (ZH501 RVF) strain, produced by Veterinary Serum and Vaccines Research Institute (VSVRI), and (3) Live Smithburn neurotropic attenuated strain produced by VSVRI [

 <sup>4</sup> TCID 50/mL [

This vaccine has several disadvantages including (1) it is used only for immunization of sheep and goats (2) it is unsafe for pregnant animals and can cause abortions and birth defects, (3) it cannot be used during the breeding season of mosquitoes, which can extend to 12 months in Egypt due to ecological and environmental factors such as a warm winter, (4) vaccinated animals cannot be slaughtered within 21 days of vaccination, (5) not all vaccinated animals give a good antibody response to this vaccine, and (6) potential for reversion of RVFV to virulence in vaccinated animals [
