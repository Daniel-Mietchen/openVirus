<p>Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an acute, arthropod-borne viral disease of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, and humans caused by single-stranded ambisense RNA virus, that belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>, the family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> and the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus genome is tripartite RNA that contains three segments; large (L), medium (M) and small (S) [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The L-segment encodes the viral polymerase (L protein) [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The S-segment translates into nucleoprotein and a non-structural protein (
 <italic>NSs</italic>) that determine the virus virulence [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The M-segment encodes two envelope glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, and two uncharacterized polypeptides (NSm1, and NSm2) [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
