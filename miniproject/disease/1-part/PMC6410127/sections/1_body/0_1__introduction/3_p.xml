<p>RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted to humans through drinking unpasteurized milk, direct contact with infected animalâ€™s blood, aerosol or the bite of infected mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are considered the main vectors. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are also considered as reservoirs [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fortunately, RVFV is not often transmitted from human-to-human, however, aerosol transmission of RVFV is suspected to have occurred among close contacts, which may have contributed to nosocomial infections and community outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Disease in humans varies from influenza-like illness to more complicated forms such as hemorrhagic fever, retinitis, renal failure, encephalitis, and miscarriage [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Notably, RVF outbreaks are episodic and associated with climatic, hydrologic and socioeconomic factors [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During RVF outbreaks, significant numbers of infected human cases have been documented, leading to healthcare challenges. Several RVF outbreaks have been recorded in Egypt with devastating morbidity in humans such as the 1977 outbreak (200,000 human cases and 600 deaths) [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Human epidemics are often preceded by epizootics in livestock. Hence, controlling RVF in animals is thought to be effective in preventing human disease through disrupting the transmission cycle [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Currently, the One Health approach, an integrated approach for the understanding and management of animal, human, and environmental determinants of disease, is used in part for the prevention and control of RVF infection and transmission [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This approach is thought to be very strategic in that risk factors for RVF transmission are increasingly recognized to be interlinked: expansion of human and animal populations, ecological changes, climate variations, etc. Hence, there is a critical need for close One Health-oriented collaborations among professionals working in diverse sectors such as animal health, human health, public health, entomology, and animal production. In this review, we have sought to review the history of the RVF disease, the previous outbreaks in Egypt, transmission dynamics, disease in humans and animals, epidemiological risk factors related to the introduction and spread of RVF in Egypt, surveillance for RVF, employment of vaccines against RVFV infection, and the role of One Health approach in the prevention and control of RVF. We posit that One Health efforts to control RVF in Egypt can be expanded with strong potential for added preventive effect.
