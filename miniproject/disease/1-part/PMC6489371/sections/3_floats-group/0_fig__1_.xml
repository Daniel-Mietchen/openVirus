  <title>Yellow Fever virus (YFV) detection in human and/or non-human primates, per county and seasonal transmission cycle, in Rio de Janeiro and its borders. The satellite image shows Morro São João, where the howler monkey was found, and its surroundings. This woody fragment is bordered by the São João River, whose gallery forest may serve as a corridor for virus dispersion between the more continuous forests on the steps of Serra do Mar. Frontal view of Morro do São João was obtained through the Google Earth Software, accessed on 22th Feb 2019.</title>
