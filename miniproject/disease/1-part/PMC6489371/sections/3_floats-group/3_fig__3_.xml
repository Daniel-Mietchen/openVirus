  <title>maximum clade credibility phylogeographic tree of the Yellow Fever virus (YFV) strains involved in the ongoing outbreak. The coloursâ€™ branches represent the most probable location of their descendent nodes, as indicated in the legend and the map. The posterior and posterior state probability (PP/PSP, respectively) of key nodes are indicated above the branches. All horizontal branch lengths are drawn to a scale of years. The two lineages found in Rio de Janeiro state (YFV
   <sub>RJ-I</sub> and YFV
   <sub>RJ-II</sub>) are indicated by red shaded boxes, and the RJ155 samples are indicated by arrows.
