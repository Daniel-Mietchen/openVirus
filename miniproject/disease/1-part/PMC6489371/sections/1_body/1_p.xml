<p>In the last two decades, a gradual expansion of YFV has been observed towards the coast of SE and S Brazil, an area that has been considered YF-free for almost 80 years, and therefore, without vaccine recommendations.

 </xref> An entomological and surveillance investigation conducted in 2015-2016 to determine the composition and abundance of mosquito fauna in distinct ecosystems in the coastal SE region, particularly in the state of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and its borders, has revealed that RJ was highly receptive and vulnerable to sylvatic YFV transmission.

 </xref> In late 2016 and early 2017, the virus re-emerged in SE Brazil, and the states of Minas Gerais (MG), Esp√≠rito Santo (ES), and RJ were affected in sequence, initiating the largest epidemic of sylvatic YFV ever recorded in the country.

 </xref> The affected area encompasses the biggest remnants of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, which are often close to cities with the highest human population densities in the country, low YFV vaccination coverage and high
