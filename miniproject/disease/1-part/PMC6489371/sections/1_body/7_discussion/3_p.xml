<p>Besides the fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest, the increase of NHP diversity and abundance may have also contributed to YFV persistence in RJ. Previous studies have concluded that YFV typically remains during only one, but not for more than two transmission seasons in the same area in the Atlantic Forest of the SE region.

 </xref> while describing the 1934-1936 sylvatic YFV epidemic in the SE, claimed that “the virus appeared to “burn itself out” as it progressed and rarely lasted longer than one season in any given locality”. The main reason for this pattern would be the reduction in the number of local susceptible hosts due to the rapid and intense transmission and spatial spread of YFV

 </xref> across the fragmented Atlantic Forest in the SE region, the most populated and developed Brazilian region. On the other hand, in the Amazon Region, the dense and continuous forests, together with the great diversity of NHPs, enable an almost perennial circulation of the virus. In fact, YFV had disappeared spontaneously from the coastal Atlantic Forest for almost 80 years. However, during the last decades, environmental and biodiversity protection policies have achieved considerable success. Significant augmentation of conservation units and numerous reforestation initiatives, and the recovery of ecological corridors in the Atlantic Forest have been observed; this may have expanded the zones with suitable environmental conditions to support higher mosquito and NHP species diversity and abundance, especially compared to the case for when the Brazilian developmental policies were put into practice after the second war.

Two recent studies that modelled the epidemiology of YF found that the distribution and diversity of NHP genera are highly associated with the risk of YFV outbreak.
