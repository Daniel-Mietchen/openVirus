 <italic>Ae. scapularis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, usually bite at the ground level, which is a behaviour limiting their chance of getting infected by feeding on viraemic forest canopy-inhabiting NHPs such as howler monkeys. However, many sick monkeys get down from the canopy and agonise for several hours on the ground; this is when they may be easily bitten by such species of mosquitoes.
