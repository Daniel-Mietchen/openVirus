<p>When investigating YF sylvatic epidemics occurring in SE Brazil during the 1930s and 1940s, the authors concluded that in this region, YFV spread in the form of an intermittent wave from infected areas to unaffected neighbouring sites, involving a series of annual outbreaks coinciding with the rainy season (summer), and essentially stopping during the winter, only to retake its course and spread in the next rainy season into sites that were close to those affected during the previous summer.

 </xref> named this spreading as persistence. Here, we demonstrated that besides spreading to new areas, YFV was able to persist in the same zone for at least three transmission seasons in RJ. The mosaic pattern of the Atlantic Forest may have contributed to the maintenance of YFV circulation in such a zone for at least three seasons, where some isolated fragments may not be affected by the expanding wave. Such “virgin islands,” where the YFV has not circulated, may serve as new focal points for viral re-emergence and amplification.
