<p>Our study clearly supports that YFV circulation may be soundless in the coastal SE and that the transmission of this virus may gain force, and cause its re-emergence in the form of epizootics when conditions are suitable. Silent viral circulation or absence of notifications can lead to the demobilisation and deintensification of prophylactic and communication actions, which can have serious consequences. The local persistence of YFV and the possibility of seasonal re-emergences reinforce the need for maintaining continuous surveillance and high vaccination coverage in the SE, particularly in RJ, a state that receives a large influx of (vaccinated and unvaccinated) tourists during the summer who could become infected and export the virus to other states and countries.

 </xref> Effective epizootic surveillance, combined with fast diagnostic and phylogenetic analyses is critical in raising timely awareness and establishing control measures. Using this strategy, we could alert the state and municipal health systems in RJ about YFV re-emergence within 48 hours allowing the authorities to take appropriate preventive actions immediately.
