<p>The present work describes the first record of YFV circulation in RJ in 2019, which essentially consists of the primary sign of virus re-emergence in the state since July 2018, when the epidemiological transmission season had started. Epizootics reported in marmosets in the central and southern zones of RJ nearly six months ago were remnants of the previous transmission season. In turn, we report a YFV infection in a howler monkey from the north-coastal zone, where the YF outbreaks and epizootic records had peaked in early 2017 and then moved southward. This suggests that viral circulation may be soundless in the coastal SE Brazil. Moreover, our phylogeographic and evolutionary analyses showed that YFV may persist in this zone for at least three consecutive transmission seasons, without the need for new introduction. These data unprecedentedly demonstrate that YFV can be locally maintained in the Atlantic Forest for more than two transmission seasons.</p>
