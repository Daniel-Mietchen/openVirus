<p>On January 9th 2019, we received an alert from the information network reporting a dying howler monkey in Morro de São João (22º32’37.98”S 42º0’43.88”W), a mountain with a dense vegetation cover located in the coastal lowlands of Casimiro de Abreu, the municipality where the first human YF case was reported in RJ and whose last detected YFV circulation was recorded in early 2017. The animal was found only 2.0 km away from a considerably dense urban area (
