 <italic>RNA extraction, virus detection, and sequencing</italic> - On the same day, RNA was extracted from 140 μL of RJ155’s serum and whole blood using the Qiagen RNA Viral Kit, following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed in duplicate, as described previously.

 </xref> The nucleotide sequence was determined by capillary electrophoresis at the sequencing facility of Fiocruz-RJ (RPT01A ― Sequenciamento de DNA - RJ). The sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro version 8.1.5 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The amino acid differences, as well as nucleotide and amino acid distances, were calculated using the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) 7.0 program.
