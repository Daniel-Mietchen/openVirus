 <italic>Sample collection</italic> - From 2015 onwards, we have built an information network comprising several kinds of agents (e.g. residents, environmental guards, health agents, conservation unit managers, and local guides) regularly visiting or living in target areas in RJ and consisting of contact chains of key institutions and inhabitants, to continuously monitor the epizootic events of NHPs in RJ using communication technologies such as message exchange applications (FVS Abreu, unpublished data).
