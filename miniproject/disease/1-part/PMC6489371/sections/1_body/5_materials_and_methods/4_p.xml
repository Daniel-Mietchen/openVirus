<p>Our team immediately went to the area (166 km from the lab). On our arrival, the monkey had already died. We were attacked by numerous 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, which also tried to bite the recently dead animal, apparently without success, as engorged females were not observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). We performed the necropsy and sample collection on the field, in accordance with the biosafety protocols and the current biodiversity laws.

 </xref> The animal, a young adult female 
 <italic>Alouatta guariba clamitans</italic> without any wound or external mark, was named RJ155. Samples of the animalâ€™s viscera (liver, spleen, heart, kidney, lung), whole blood, and serum were immediately frozen on dry ice. The carcass was kept refrigerated until delivery at the state health department of RJ, with the epizootic notification form filled out by the municipal health division, as officially recommended. One week later, we visited the site again for mosquito collection. Mosquitoes were collected and tested in pools from 1 to 10 individuals, according to the species, as previously described.
