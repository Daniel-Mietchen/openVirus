<p>The ML phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RJ155 YFV 2019 genome showed the highest support values (aLRT = 1) when clustered with other YFV strains from the ongoing outbreak in SE Brazil [

In order to better understand the geographic origin of the RJ155 YFV, we performed a discrete Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of all YFVs from the current SE Brazilian outbreak. As there was no significant evidence favouring one of the discrete phylogeographic models [

The inferred Bayesian MCC tree supports at least four independent introductions of YFV into RJ from ES and confirmed at least two viral transmission chains in RJ

 <sub>RJ-I</sub> that likely originated in RJ [posterior state probability (PSP) = 0.95] around December 2016 [95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) July 2016-March 2017]. The YFV
 <sub>RJ-I</sub> clade also comprises an older YFV sample from Casimiro de Abreu (March 2017) obtained from a human case and other YFVs obtained from humans and NHPs in neighbouring municipalities (Maca√©, Silva Jardim and Guapimirim) from April to June 2017.
