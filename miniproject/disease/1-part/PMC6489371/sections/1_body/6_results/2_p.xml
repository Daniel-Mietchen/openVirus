<p>The identity between the RJ155 YFV and the YFV sequenced in the 2016-2017 transmission season from the neighbouring counties is high, from 99.8 to 99.9% and from 99.7 to 100%, which are the nucleotide and amino acid identity values, respectively [

The number of nucleotide changes indicates the evolution of the viral genome, most probably due to a bottleneck effect, promoted by the dissemination of the virus into a small number of hosts while circulating silently in the zone [

However, we noticed six amino acid alterations not only in the YFV samples from bordering municipalities, but also in case of all YFV genomes described so far in the ongoing outbreak (
