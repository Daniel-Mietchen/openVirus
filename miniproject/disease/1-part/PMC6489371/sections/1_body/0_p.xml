<p>Except for the rare episodes of urban Yellow Fever (YF) transmission, human infections in the Americas have been acquired from the sylvatic cycle maintained between arboreal mosquitoes and non-human primates (NHPs).

 </xref> In Brazil, the YFV is enzootic/endemic in the Amazon Region, which is in the north from where, it sometimes expands towards the central-west, south (S), and south-eastern (SE) regions, causing isolated epizootic events and human infections to severe epidemics of sylvatic origin.

 </xref> Epidemiological records gathered since the discovery of the YFV sylvatic cycle in Brazil in the early 1930s, as well as recent phylogenetic analyses of South American YFV samples have reinforced this concept.

 </xref> The epidemic character of the sylvatic YF in the extra-Amazon Brazilian territory would be a consequence of the continuous reintroductions of YFV from the endemic region in the Amazon, as the former territories could not maintain the circulation of the virus after one or two transmission seasons, due to the substantial reduction in the number of susceptible vertebrate hosts.
