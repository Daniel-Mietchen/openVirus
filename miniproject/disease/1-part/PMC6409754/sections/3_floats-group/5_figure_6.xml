  <p>Codon deoptimization (CD) for the generation of LAIV: (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of WT (
   <bold>A</bold>) and CD (
   <bold>B</bold>) viral NS segments: WT NS vRNA is represented in gray boxes (
   <bold>A</bold>). WT NS1 and NEP ORFs are represented as dark and light gray boxes, respectively (
   <bold>A</bold>). CD NS1 (NS1
   <sub>CD</sub>, top), NEP (NEP
   <sub>CD</sub>, middle) or both NS1 and NEP (NS
   <sub>CD</sub>, bottom) proteins as well as their respective NS vRNA segments are indicated with black boxes (
   <bold>B</bold>). After infection with a virus encoding a WT NS segment, expression of NS1 results in inhibition of IFN induction, allowing the efficient viral replication (
   <bold>A</bold>). Infection with viruses encoding a codon deoptimized NS1 protein (NS1
   <sub>CD</sub>, top; NS
   <sub>CD</sub>, bottom) results in reduced NS1 protein expression levels and inefficient inhibition of type I IFN responses, resulting in reduced viral replication and viral production. CD of NEP (NEP
   <sub>CD</sub>, middle) results in lower expression of NEP, without significantly affecting viral replication. CD of NS1 and NEP (NS
   <sub>CD,</sub> bottom) results in higher attenuation than viruses containing only NS1 or NEP CD ORFs, correlating with the amount of codon changes introduced in the viral segment. (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) Schematic representation of WT and IAV attenuated by codon-pair bias: WT PB1, HA, NP, and NA vRNA segments are indicated in gray boxes (
   <bold>C</bold>). Codon-pair deoptimized PB1, HA, and NP (PB1/HA/NP
   <sup>3F</sup>) (
   <bold>D</bold>, top); or, HA and NA (HA/NA
   <sup>Min</sup>) (
   <bold>D</bold>, bottom) proteins are represented in black boxes. During WT viral infection (
   <bold>C</bold>), vRNPs mediate viral genome replication and gene transcription, allowing efficient viral protein synthesis and viral production. Likewise, optimal expression of the viral HA and NA results in efficient production of infectious viral progeny. Infection with PB1/HA/NP
   <sup>3F</sup> virus (
   <bold>D</bold>, top), results in reduced levels of viral replication and transcription mediated by lower levels of PB1 and NP expression. The codon-pair deoptimization of HA also affects protein expression levels, contributing to the attenuation of the PB1/HA/NP
   <sup>3F</sup> virus in mice but with reasonable growth in vitro. Likewise, the reduction in the level of expression of the viral HA and NA during infection with the HA/NA
   <sup>Min</sup> virus (
   <bold>D</bold>, bottom) results in reduced virion formation and therefore lower infectious viral production. White boxes (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) indicate the packaging signals that were located at the 3´and 5´ ends of each of the vRNAs. Lines at the end of each vRNA (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) indicate the 3´and 5´ NCR.
