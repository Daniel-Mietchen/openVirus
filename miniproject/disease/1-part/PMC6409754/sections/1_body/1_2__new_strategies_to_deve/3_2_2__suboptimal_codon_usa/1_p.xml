<p>Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, termed as synonymous codons [
 <xref rid="B164-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Codon usage bias refers to the unequal frequency in the use of synonymous codons between and within species [

 <xref rid="B165-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. The existence of preferred codons can affect the levels of gene expression, protein translation, and protein folding [

 <xref rid="B171-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Usually, the codon usage of viruses, including IAV, is similar to that of the host that they infect so that the translation is the most efficient. In the case of pandemic IAVs carrying avian or swine origin segments, an adaptation of the virus codon use might be expected to reflect human codon use. However, although human codon usage imposes certain selection pressure on the avian or swine viruses, it has been shown that human genes and most viral genes from pandemic IAV strains had a negative correlation in codon usage [

 <xref rid="B169-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. In this regard, two models have been proposed to explain viral codon usage: the translation or selection model is based on the adaptation to the host transfer (t)RNA abundance as a strategy to improve viral fitness [
 <xref rid="B169-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]; and, the mutational or neutral model is based on certain mutations in GC-rich regions can provide advantages to the virus to escape from the host antiviral response [

 <xref rid="B172-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Interestingly, human seasonal IAV strains that were isolated in recent years have been shown to have a reduced GC content in their genome, which could be advantageous in escaping immunity [
