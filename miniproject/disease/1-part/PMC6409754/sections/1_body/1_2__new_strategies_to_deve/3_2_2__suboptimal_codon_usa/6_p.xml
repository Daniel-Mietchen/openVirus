<p>Codon-pair bias refers to the fact that some pairs of codons occur more frequently than others and this frequency differs between species [

 <xref rid="B183-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. The codon-pair bias approach has also been used to generate LAIV using codon combinations that are less represented in the genetic code of the host and to alter the expression of viral proteins involved in the synthesis of vRNA and viral spread [

 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Mueller et al. used the Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE) approach to recode and synthesize the viral genome of PR8 in a way that preserved the WT amino acid sequence but created a suboptimal arrangement of codon pairs [
 <xref rid="B173-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. They modified the viral PB1, NP, and HA genes of WT PR8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f006">Figure 6</xref>C) to generate recombinant viruses containing one deoptimized segment (PB1
 <sup>Min</sup>, NP
 <sup>Min</sup> or HA
 <sup>Min</sup>) or a combination of three deoptimized segments (PB1/NP/HA
 <sup>3F</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f006">Figure 6</xref>D, top). The authors did not find significant differences in the growth kinetics or plaque phenotype of mutant deoptimized viruses when compared to WT PR8. However, in all of the mutant viruses, protein expression of the deoptimized viral gene product was specifically reduced when compared to the same protein in the WT-infected cells. In vivo analysis showed that all of the deoptimized viruses were remarkably attenuated in mice, especially PB1/NP/HA
 <sup>3F</sup>, which led to a cumulative attenuation of 13,000 fold over WT PR8. Importantly, a single intranasal immunization of mice induced specific immunity that protected them against the homologous WT PR8 challenge. However, these studies did not evaluate heterologous protection.
