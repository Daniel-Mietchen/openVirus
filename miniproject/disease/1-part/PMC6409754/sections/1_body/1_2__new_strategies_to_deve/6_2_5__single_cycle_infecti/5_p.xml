<p>In order to study the packaging signals for IAV HA segment, sciIAVs ΔHA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f009">Figure 9</xref>C) containing the GFP with HA packaging regions (45 3′-end and 80 5′-end nucleotides) were first developed by Marsh et al. using the backbone of A/WSN/33 H1N1(WSN) or PR8. [
 <xref rid="B195-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. SciIAVs ΔHA were efficiently passaged in MDCK cells that constitutively expressed the WSN HA protein, although the virus could not be spread in parental MDCK cells. Using a similar strategy, Martinez-Sobrido et al. [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] demonstrated the use of GFP-expressing sciIAVs ΔHA pseudotyped with different HA proteins for the identification of neutralizing antibodies in monoclonal or polyclonal preparations. Importantly, the newly described fluorescent-based microneutralization assays could be conducted under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, even in the identification of neutralizing antibodies against highly pathogenic human or avian IAVs, such as the 1918 Spanish influenza (A/Brevig Mission/18 H1N1) and HPAIV (A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1) [

 <xref rid="B206-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>,
 <xref rid="B216-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. Interestingly, the sciIAV ΔHA pH1N1 stimulated robust immunity in both mice and ferrets, conferring protection against WT viral challenges [
 <xref rid="B205-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. Additionally, both sciIAV ΔHA pH1N1 [
 <xref rid="B205-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>] and X31 [
 <xref rid="B206-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>] conferred protection against heterologous infection by eliciting a memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell immune response. Moreover, Katsura et al. has also used the sciIAV ΔHA system to generate a bivalent vaccine harboring the pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) from 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> with the ability to protect against both IAV and
