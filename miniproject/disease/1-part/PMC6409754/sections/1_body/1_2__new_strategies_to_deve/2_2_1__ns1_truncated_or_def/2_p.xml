<p>A correlation between the length of the NS1 protein and IAV attenuation in vivo has been reported [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f005">Figure 5</xref>C) NS1 proteins had reduced ability to counteract IFN activation compared to the WT H3N8 CIV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Notably, NS1 mutations resulted in the attenuation of the virus in vivo in a mouse model of influenza infection and ex vivo in canine tracheal explants, with the ΔNS1 virus showing the greatest degree of attenuation [
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. In addition, mice that were vaccinated with a single intranasal dose of modified NS1 viruses were protected against challenge with WT H3N8 CIV. Most likely, the ability of these viruses with altered NS1 proteins to induce an IFN response, which is usually blocked during the WT viral infection, resulted in an optimal balance of attenuation and protective immunogenicity: the desired outcome for a safe and effective LAIV [
