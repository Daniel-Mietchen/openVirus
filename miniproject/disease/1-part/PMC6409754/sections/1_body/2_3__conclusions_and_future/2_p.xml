<p>The implementation of reverse genetics approaches has impacted the development of LAIVs by reducing the timeline that is needed for vaccine manufacturing, which is especially relevant in the generation of LAIVs against pandemic IAV strains. Ideally, future vaccines should increase the breadth of immune responses to protect against antigenically different IAVs within the same or different subtypes and it should be able to be manufactured in cells lines to further reduce production time. Here, we have provided an update on the progress that has been made in the influenza vaccination field in the last five years to improve or overcome current vaccine production and effectiveness drawbacks. The potential of implementing these approaches for the development of a universal vaccine that would elicit immune responses with broad specificity and providing long-acting protection, which is one of the current and major priorities of the NIAID, and the CEIRS, must be highlighted.</p>
