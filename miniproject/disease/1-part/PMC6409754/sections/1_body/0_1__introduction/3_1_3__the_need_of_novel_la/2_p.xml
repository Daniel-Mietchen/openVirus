<p>To date, the real cause(s) of reduced effectiveness of the quadrivalent LAIV are not known, but several factors have been suggested to contribute to the lower efficacy of the LAIV [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]: (1) pre-existing immunity in the adult population could suppress local mucosa replication of the LAIV that is required for the induction of an effective protective immune response [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]; (2) reduced viral infection of the IAV H1N1 component of the LAIV because of reduced sialic acid binding of the not fully human-adapted viral HA as compared to the H3N2 and/or IBV LAIV components [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]; (3) the acquisition of mutation(s) in the M segment of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 that affects the pH stability of the vaccine, having a higher impact on the IAV H1N1 component of the LAIV [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]; (4) the introduction of a second IBV component in the quadrivalent LAIV formulation that could interfere with the replication of the H1N1 component of the LAIV [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]; (5) heat stability, since the H1N1 component of the LAIV that was used during the 2013â€“2014 seasonal vaccine had increased susceptibility to thermal degradation [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]; and, (6) a high-content of defective-interfering (DI) viral particles in the LAIV that compromise virus replication in the respiratory tract, leading to a decrease in the immune response to the vaccine [
