<p>During IAV infection, the binding of the viral HA to host oligosaccharides containing terminal sialic acid initiates the uptake of the virus by endocytosis. Since cell surface sialyloligosaccharides are highly heterogeneous, differential recognition of sialic acid groups by the viral HA is one of the major determinants of viral tropism and host specificity [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In general, avian viruses preferentially bind to sialic acid that is attached to galactose by an α2,3 linkage, while human influenza viruses preferentially bind the sialic acid attached to galactose by an α2,6 linkage [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].Upon endocytosis, the acidification of the endosomal lumen triggers conformational change of the viral HA that results in the fusion of the viral and endosome membranes [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At the same time, the opening of the M2 ion channel protein allows the acidification of the viral core, leading to the dissociation of the vRNPs from M1, and as a result, the vRNPs are delivered into the cytosol of the infected cell. In a process that is mediated by the viral NP, vRNPs are transported to the nucleus where viral replication and transcription take place. IAV NP and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) complexes (PB1, PB2 and PA) are the minimal components for viral genome replication and gene transcription [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. IAV is able to transcribe individual (PB2, HA, NA, and NA) or multiple (PB1, PA, M, and NS) proteins from each viral segment [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Newly synthesized vRNPs need to be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and then transported to the cell surface in order to be packaged into the new viral particles. In this regard, the assembly of a nuclear export complex consisting of vRNP, M1, and the nuclear export protein (NEP), which contains two nuclear export signals, is required [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. After their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the structural proteins HA, NA, and M2 are transported to the plasma membrane directed by the apical sorting signals [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For successful packaging, the eight vRNA segments are incorporated into nascent virions by the selective packaging signals that are present in each of the vRNAs (
