<p>Because of the changing nature of influenza virus, vaccine production to develop high-yield strains as vaccine components is a constant challenge. Manufacturing influenza vaccines usually take around four to five months to produce, package, test, and release for use in the upcoming season [

The implementation of reverse genetics approaches into research has advanced our understanding of the biology of influenza virus, including the mechanisms that are involved in viral genome replication and gene transcription, pathogenesis, or viral-host interactions [
