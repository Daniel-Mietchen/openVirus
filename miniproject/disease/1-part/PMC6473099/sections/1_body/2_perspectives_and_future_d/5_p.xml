<p>Repurposing of clinically approved drugs could potentially be used as BRMs for the treatment of severe IAV infectious and should be explored (

 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Considering that susceptibility to severe IAV infections is influenced by host genetics and host-specific immune responses, selection of therapeutic BRMs should be carried out using 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model systems that are representative of the immune status spectrum and underlying conditions of high-risk influenza patients (young, immunocompromised, non-naive, obese, pregnant, or aged). Using these model systems will increase the likelihood of identifying BRMs with clinically relevant antiviral and immunomodulatory potentials.
