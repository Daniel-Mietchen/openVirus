<p>Sphingosin kinases (SphK) are lipid kinases that mediate conversion of sphingosine to bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), a known modulator of central apoptotic pathways (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). IAV infections leads to increased expression and activation of SphK1 and SphK2 (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of SphK1 was shown to decrease IAV RNA synthesis via suppression of NFkB activation (
