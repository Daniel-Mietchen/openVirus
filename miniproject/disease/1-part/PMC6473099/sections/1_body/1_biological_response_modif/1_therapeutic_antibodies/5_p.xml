<p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a key cytokine for controlling severe IAV infections. It regulates two main antiviral functions: the induction of (i) the NFkB pathway, which ultimately controls expression of several inflammatory cytokines and (ii) apoptosis through multiple signaling cascades (
