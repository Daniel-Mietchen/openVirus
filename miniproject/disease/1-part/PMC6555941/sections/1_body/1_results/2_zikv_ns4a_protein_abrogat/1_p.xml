<p id="Par36">Our previous finding that the NS4A protein of all four serotypes of DENV, which also belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, blocks type I IFN production through targeting RIG-I–MAVS-mediated signaling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] prompted us to ask whether ZIKV NS4A protein is also able to interfere with RLR–MAVS-dependent IFN production. To this end, mammalian two-hybrid analysis was performed to identify possible molecular interactions between ZIKV NS4A and components along the RIG-I signaling pathway. Specifically, we used ZIKV NS4A to transfect 293T cells, together with, respectively, one of the four key RLR signaling proteins, namely, RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1 and IKKε, whose expression was verified by Western blotting (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1, A–D). When DENV NS4A and ZIKV prM were used as a positive and negative control, respectively, for NS4A binding, our results showed a strong interaction between MAVS and ZIKV-NS4A, DENV2-NS4A (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), whereas no interaction between ZIKV prM, NS4A and RIG-I, TBK1 orIKKε was found (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, c, d), suggesting that MAVS might represent a specific interaction partner of ZIKV NS4A.
