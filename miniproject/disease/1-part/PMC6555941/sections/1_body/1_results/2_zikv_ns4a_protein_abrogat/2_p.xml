<p id="Par37">To verify the above finding that ZIKV NS4A interacts with MAVS, we examined whether NS4A of Zika virus co-localizes with MAVS by performing confocal microscopy in cells expressing Flag-tagged NS4A. Our results revealed that, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, when influenza (IVA)PB1-F2, a viral protein well recognized for its strong ability to antagonize type I IFN induction by targeting MAVS, was employed as a positive control, ZIKV NS4A or PB1-F2, respectively, but not ZIKV prM, was found to co-localize with MAVS, supporting the notion that ZIKV NS4A interacts with MAVS in host cells.
