<p id="Par44">To further validate that ZIKV NS4A is an antagonist of IFN production, we employed a recombinant VSV-GFP virus system in our study, and our data displayed that ZIKV NS4A, DENV NS4A or IVA PB1-F2 remarkably reduced the IFN-β reporter activity upon VSV-GFP stimulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Moreover, our results also revealed that the recombinant VSV-GFP virus in 293T cells expressing ZIKV NS4A, DENV NS4A or IVA PB1-F2 exhibited a high-degree replication (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b, c), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of ZIKV NS4A on IFN production could occur in the scenario of actual viral infection.
