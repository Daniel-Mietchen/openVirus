<p id="Par40">As MAVS is a 540-amino acid (aa) protein consisting of three structural and functional domains, including an N-terminal CARD-like (CL) domain, a mid-region proline-rich (PR) domain and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], to map the NS4A-binding domain(s) in MAVS, we generated serial MAVS deletion mutants, i.e., a Flag-MAVS (CL) construct expressing aa 1–77 containing the CARD-like domain, a Flag-MAVS (PR) construct expressing aa 78–173 containing the proline-rich domain, a Flag-MAVS (TM) construct expressing aa 174–540 containing the transmembrane domain, and a Flag-MAVS (FL) construct expressing full-length MAVS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged NS4A together with each of the above Flag-tagged MAVS plasmids or empty control vector, respectively. Our co-IP assay showed that either the CL or TM domain of MAVS could pull down NS4A (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), suggesting a key role for the CL and TM domains in the interaction between NS4A and MAVS.
