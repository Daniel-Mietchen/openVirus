<p id="Par30">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, which also includes several life-threatening human pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus (WNV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While ZIKV was originally identified in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 and the first human infection case was documented in 1954, the most serious Zika pandemic to date began in the Americas in 2013–2014 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As of December 2018, over 86 countries and territories have reported cases of active ZIKV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinically, although most Zika cases are asymptomatic or only manifest as an influenza-like illness, severe forms of ZIKV infection such as microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities in newborns and Guillain–Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, multi-organ failure or thrombocytopenia in adults are seen in the clinic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus far, no clinically approved vaccines or specific anti-ZIKV drugs are available for the control of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hence, understanding the molecular basis and host immune mechanisms based on which severe diseases develop as a result of ZIKV infection is key to developing strategies against ZIKV-associated conditions.
