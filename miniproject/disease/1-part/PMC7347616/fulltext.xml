The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 40% of the world&#x02019;s population live in regions where the risk of dengue transmission is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The last comprehensive study on global dengue burden has put the number of yearly infections in about 390 million<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and even though the study was published a few years ago the World Health Organization (WHO) still consider those as the most likely actual numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. <italic>Dengue virus</italic> (DENV)<italic>,</italic> the pathogen that causes dengue fever and other manifestations, is classified as part of the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. The family was named after the <italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> (YFV) and the Latin particle <italic>Flavi</italic> means &#x0201c;of golden color&#x0201d;&#x02014;a reference to the onset of jaundice observed in YFV-infected patients. Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses whose genome encodes just one <italic>open reading frame</italic> (ORF) that codifies a single polyprotein. During the virus replication cycle the polyprotein is cleaved in three structural and seven nonstructural polypeptides by virus-coded or cell proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The DENV Envelope protein (DENV E) is an immunodominant polypeptide that is inserted into the virus envelope and exposed on the virus surface, mediating the adsorption to host cells and membrane fusion upon cell entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">There are four known DENV serotypes which are genetically and antigenically distinct, and each one is able to cause clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe disease or even death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. DENV infections by any serotype induce protective immune responses against subsequent infections with the same serotype, whereas heterotypic secondary infections may lead to exacerbated viral multiplication and the development of severe disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The <italic>Zika virus</italic> (ZIKV) (a closely related flavivirus) emergence in areas where other flaviviruses circulate brought a significant burden to an already complicated scenario, in which affected countries must frequently cope with yellow fever, dengue and epidemics caused by other arboviruses. This is especially true after the recent ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas revealed an association of the infection to the occurrence of neurological malformations in fetuses from infected mothers and neurogenic demyelinating diseases such as the Guillain&#x02013;Barre syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Flaviviruses are known to remain viremic for a relatively short period of time during infection (typically 3&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days after the appearance of symptoms, or longer in the case of pregnant women with ZIKV infections), and this narrow window complicates the detection of virus&#x02019; nucleic acids or antigens to confirm infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, serology continues to be the predominant diagnostic tool in terms of clinical practice, especially serology tests like immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Nonetheless, physicians and public health authorities must be aware of the high antigenic similarity among flaviviruses (e.g. 54&#x02013;59% of amino acid sequence similarity between the DENV and ZIKV E proteins), which limits the use of serology-based tests to distinguish these infections due to intense antisera cross-reactivity between viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Such limitations in the use of conventional diagnostic methods have driven the search for new diagnostic platforms, especially those able to deliver better sensitivity and specificity scores.</p><p id="Par5">The upsurge of the Nanotechnology has induced the generation of many new materials that present potential to be used in association to antigens as diagnostic tools. Metallic gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are highly stable particles with features that make them very attractive in biological applications. Such features include attainable surface functionalization chemistry; capability to be synthesized in many different shapes; shape- and size-dependent optical and electronic characteristics; and many other pertinent properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. One of the most important optical features of GNPs is the fact that when they are irradiated with light of specific frequencies this results in the collective oscillation of electrons in the particle surface. Such oscillation is named Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR). This phenomenon happens when the oscillating electromagnetic field of the incident light interacts with electrons on the conduction band of the metal initiating their oscillation in resonance with the frequency of the light. As electrons oscillate, a charge separation between the free electrons and the ionic core on the metal occurs, exerting a restoring Coulomb force that causes the electrons to oscillate back and forth on the metallic surface, creating a dipole oscillation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">When the plasmon frequency is of the same as the incident light, a resonance phenomenon occurs and results in a noticeable optical absorption. Thus, the coupling of the incident light and plasmon mode generates a sharp electric field on the surface of the metallic nanoparticles. In the spherical gold nanoparticles&#x02019; LSPR, the plasmon absorption frequency is independent of the excitation light polarization, with a peak in the 515&#x02013;520&#x000a0;nm position, presenting low sensitivity for dielectric surface changes. Non-spherical nanoparticles like gold nanorods, however, present two LSPR modes, one transverse and another longitudinal, with incident light polarizations perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the rod, respectively. The transverse mode has low sensitivity to the dielectric surface changes, however, the longitudinal mode presents a strong polarization effect and high sensitivity to dielectric surface changes, making such particles responsive to the dielectric features of the surrounding environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, any modifications around the nanoparticle, including alterations in their surface, the solvent and particle aggregation, will determine changes in the electronic properties of the nanoparticle&#x02019;s surface, resulting in alterations in the patterns of the absorption spectrum. All these optical features make GNPs useful in many different biological applications, particularly to detect molecules found in low concentrations on the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Due to the high LSPR sensitivity, different LSPR-based biosensors have been reported recently, from cardiac biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> to bovine IgG detectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and more. Here, we describe the construction and testing of a Dengue GNR-based nanosensor in which the surface E protein of each DENV serotype was individually associated to GNRs. When tested against commercial antibodies and antisera from different flaviruses-infected patients the GNR sensors were able not only to detect the presence of antibodies in very low concentrations but were also able to distinguish DENV-infected individuals from seronegative ones and from those that were infected by other flaviviruses. Because antibody detection is achieved by evaluating shifts in the light absorption frequencies of the sensor, biosensing can be made with the use of regular spectrophotometers that are usually available in public health centers at remote and under-developed geographic areas where arboviruses so frequently circulate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Validation of the recombinant DENV 1&#x02013;4 envelop proteins</title><p id="Par7">In order to build a LSPR-GNR-based sensor, we generated recombinant proteins based on the Envelope protein coding genes of each of the four DENV serotypes. The expression and purification of the different recombinant E proteins (named DENV1E, DENV2E, DENV3E and DENV4E) were evaluated by SDS-PAGE (Suppl Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A). The antigenic potential of these recombinant proteins (of approx. 50&#x000a0;kDa each) was determined by Western blot using a specific monoclonal antibody against <italic>Dengue virus</italic> (Suppl Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B). Identical blots were also probed with an antibody against the histidine tail fragment to further confirm the production and purification of the recombinant proteins (Suppl Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>C). To analyze the diagnostic potential of these proteins, we developed an in-house ELISA platform and tested it against DENV-positive sera, ZIKV-positive sera and flavivirus-negative sera (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (characterization of the sera banks used here can be seen in Suppl Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The ELISA tests were able to efficiently distinguish DENV-negative sera from the sera of DENV-infected patients (comparing DENV+&#x02009;and negative rows in each graph). Nevertheless, sensitivities were not robust as many patients (individual dots) still fell below the cutoff area, especially for DENVE2 and DENVE4 proteins. The global sensitivity varied from 50.9 to 80.2% whilst the specificity varied from 85.5 to 93.7%. The specificity values represent the ability of the ELISA test to distinguish dengue-infected patients from Zika seropositive individuals, in this case. All diagnostic performances and parameters of this test can be accessed at Suppl Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>.

The functionalization strategy, depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, consists on the attachment of proteins to the gold nanorods by covalently coupling the amine terminal functional groups of polypeptides to so called capping agents, a process well described in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We used a reduced &#x003b1;-Lipoic acid (DHLA) as capping agent and sulfo-NHS (<italic>N</italic>-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) and EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) as intermediate chemicals&#x02014;the later reagents direct the formation of an ester bridge between the protein and the DHLA, resulting in the covalent interaction among these molecules. The choice of the reduced &#x003b1;-Lipoic acid is related not only to the its proper function as a linker to protein binding, but also as a strategy to remove the CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) monolayer covering the nanoparticles in solution. Because CTAB is related to the stability of GNRs in solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, it was important to analyze whether CTAB-stripped and DHLA functionalized GNRs were stable. Indeed, GNR-DHLA particles were evaluated for 16&#x000a0;months using UV&#x02013;Vis spectroscopy and no major changes at the observed light absorbance spectra was observed (Suppl Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Consistently, there was no color change or precipitations in the stored solutions (not shown).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>DENV LSPR-Nanosensor construction. The gold nanorods were primarily linked to &#x003b1;-lipoic acid through interaction with the molecule&#x02019;s thiol group.

The protein-decorated GNRs were used as biosensors in which specific antibodies bind to their cognate proteins on the GNR surface.

</p><p id="Par9">The efficiency of the GNR-DENVE functionalization was confirmed by three different approaches. First, we performed UV&#x02013;Vis measures before, during and after the functionalization process to determine electrical changes on the GNR surface. The LSPR spectrum shifts observed after chemicals (red lines) and protein binding (blue lines) indicate the successful GNR functionalization with each DENVE protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A,C,E,G). To determine the correct plasmon shift, each LSPR curve was plotted with the correspondent calculus of the X axis intercept of the derivative of the Gaussian peak (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B,D,F,H). Second, both pristine GNRs and GNR-DENVE nanosensors were evaluated through Zeta potential analysis, and the GNR total charge modifications after each functionalization step confirmed the correct association of the GNRs to the recombinant DENVE proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>I). At last, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe surface structural modifications during GNR functionalization. The TEM images show the overall GNR structure before functionalization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>J, top panel) and the deposition of an amorphous layer capping the GNR after the functionalization with DENVE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F, bottom panel). Taking together, these results indicate the effective interaction between the DENVE proteins and GNRs, and the correct generation of the all four DENV serotype-specific nanosensors.

The first test was conducted to confirm the correct interaction between proteins and the nanoparticles and the maintenance of available antibody binding sites. More importantly, having a known concentration, anti-Dengue commercial monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the minimum anti-Dengue antibody amounts that can be detected by the sensors. establish limits of detection for the nanosensors. Commercial antibodies of the same brand and batch were used in all experiments. Antibodies were tenfold diluted until concentrations of 1&#x000a0;fg and incubated with the nanosensors.

The nanosensor was able to detect as low as 1&#x000a0;pg of anti-dengue antibodies with a 5&#x000a0;nm wavelength shift in the absorbance spectra in relation to the sensor with no antibodies added. Similar shifts were observed for the three other sensors (data not shown). Likewise, when pooled sera from dengue immune individuals were tested in our nanosensing platforms, dilutions of up to 1:100,000 induced significant wavelength shifts in the observed absorption plasmon bands, especially on the longitudinal bands (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,C,E,G). The GNR-DENV4E sensor presented the best performance, with a shift of 42&#x000a0;nm in the 1:100,000 sera dilution range in relation to the DENV-negative sera (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>H).

</p><p id="Par11">When it comes to flaviviruses&#x02019; diagnostics, however, the specificity of a given test is as important as its sensitivity, because cross-reactions among related virus species and antibodies are a real problem. To evaluate the specificity of the sensors, we tested them with sera from dengue-negative individuals as well as from individuals that were seropositive for other flaviviruses, including <italic>Saint Louis encephalitis virus</italic> (SLEV) and YFV. In almost all cases, we detected no significant wavelength shifts (above 5&#x000a0;nm) during the UV&#x02013;Vis spectroscopy evaluation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

We observed wavelength shifts equal or higher than 20&#x000a0;nm for dengue sensors DENV1, 2 and 4 using 1:10,000 sera dilution ratios of dengue-positive samples, whereas same dilution ratios from ZIKV-infected patients produced between zero and 2&#x000a0;nm in wavelength shifts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

</p><p id="Par12">Having established our sensors&#x02019; ability to serologically distinguish DENV from ZIKV, SLEV and YFV infections, we decided to further evaluate them by testing their ability to serologically distinguish infections caused by even more closely related viruses: in this case, infections caused by each one of the four DENV serotypes. Each individual nanosensor (GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E, GNR-DENV3E and GNR-DENV4E) was incubated with diluted sera preparations from patients that were specifically seropositive for DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4 or ZIKV infection, as well as with flavivirus-negative sera (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The UV&#x02013;Vis spectroscopy analyses revealed that each specific nanosensor was capable to identify most of the correlated serotype-specific samples and distinguish them from patients infected with non-correlated serotypes. The GNR-DENV4E sensor, for instance, performed flawlessly, with no cross-reactivity to the other DENV serotypes or ZIKV above the determined cutoff value. Other sensors performed similarly, although not with the same accuracy as the GNR-DENV4E sensor.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par13">Diagnosing DENV infections is a high priority in countries affected by annual epidemics of dengue fever. The correct diagnostic is essential for patient managing and prognostic as there are no specific antiviral drugs to treat the infection. Depending on the observed clinical developments, the infected patient may be released for home care; treated as an outpatient; or immediately admitted as an inpatient for emergency medical care. In all cases, laboratory confirmation of viral infection is crucial to the decision-making. Nonetheless, DENV infection diagnostic is no easy task, especially considering that tropical regions where dengue is most prevalent are also plagued by the circulation of other arboviruses causing diseases in which clinical manifestations are hardly distinguishable from dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To complicate matters, some of these arboviruses, such as ZIKV and YFV, are closely relatives of DENV and extensive serological cross-reactions among them have been largely documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Genetic approaches and the Plaque Reduction Neutralizing Test (PRNT) are efficient methods to distinguish infections caused by different arboviruses. Nonetheless, these are labor-intensive, time-consuming methods not always available in the regions where they are necessary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In addition, the mass application of those methods during an epidemic is virtually impossible, making more traditional serological diagnostic approaches, like ELISA and immunochromatography, the obvious and feasible choices. In these cases, however, cross-reactivity becomes an issue. In such scenario, nanostructured sensors become an attractive alternative due to their potential sensitivity and specificity aspects.</p><p id="Par14">The choice for the DENV E protein as the sensor&#x02019;s probing component is based on the fact that after an infection the majority of all antibody species produced against DENV recognize epitopes that are distributed on the virus&#x02019; surface proteins, either E or M, whereas a lesser proportion of these antibodies recognizes the NS1 non-structural protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Overall, serotype cross-reactive anti-E antibodies constitute the bulk of antibody responses elicited on a DENV-infected patient, followed by invariably smaller amounts of anti-(pr)M and anti-NS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Conversely, any anti-DENV vaccine design must certainly include the E protein, as it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies which, despite some recent scrutiny, are still viewed as important correlates of immunological protection against the infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We produced truncated versions of the proteins in which the transmembrane C-terminus of each polypeptide was removed to improve the stability of the product. It has been shown by us and others that such modification causes no disturbance to the correct folding of the DENV E protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, bacteria-made DENV E recombinant proteins have been viewed as poor immunogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, mostly because prokaryotic cells do not include post-translational modifications to the produced proteins, including the addition of carbohydrates to the polypeptide backbone. Indeed, most antibodies directed against the DENV E protein are thought to recognize discontinuous epitopes whereas only a few recognize linear epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, and the presence of carbohydrates sterically influences the selection of discontinuous epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In fact, when we used our soluble recombinant E proteins in ELISA protocols to identify DENV-infected patients and distinguish them from either non-infected or ZIKA-infected patients we obtained mixed results. The DENV1E and DENV3E proteins were able to identify most DENV immune patients in our sera bank, distinguishing them from DENV-negative subjects and ZIKV immune individuals, although a few dengue-positive individuals were distributed bellow the cutoff area and some ZIKV-positive subjects were placed above it (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, left panels). As for DENV2E and DENV4E ELISAs, however, identification of DENV immune individuals and distinction from the other groups were quite poor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, right panels). Nonetheless, all proteins could be efficiently recognized in Western-blot experiments using an anti-DENV commercial monoclonal antibody (Suppl Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In the face of such inconclusive results and considering the economic advantages of having recombinant proteins produced in prokaryotic cells, we asked whether the construction of more sensitive diagnostic sensors could significantly enhance the diagnostic potential of the bacteria-made DENV1E to DENV4E recombinant proteins.</p><p id="Par15">We constructed four GNR-based sensors in which recombinant E proteins of each DENV serotype were covalently linked to the surface of the rods employing reduced &#x003b1;-Lipoic acid as CTAB disperser and binding agent between the gold surface and the recombinant proteins. We monitored the correct construction of the sensors employing methods that are traditionally used for this purpose, including UV&#x02013;Vis spectroscopy, TEM and Zeta potential measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Having established that the nanosensors were successfully obtained, we individually tested the ability of each DENV serotype-specific sensor in recognizing correlate anti-sera while avoiding excessive cross-reactions with sera from individuals infected with other related flaviviruses, including SLEV, YFV and ZIKV. To that end, we took advantage of the LSPR property of gold nanoparticles and evaluated shifts at the observed light absorbance spectra when sensors were exposed to antibodies and sera. Our results indicated that all sensors were both highly sensitive and specific, with spectra shifts equal or higher than 5&#x000a0;nm when very low anti-DENV antibody amounts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) or highly diluted DENV-positive sera samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) were added. On the other hand, incubation with sera from YFV- or SLEV-infected individuals produced spectra shifts that were consistently bellow the 5&#x000a0;nm cutoff limit in the spectra shift (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Indeed, according to Yu and Irudayaraj<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, wavelength shifts as little as 5&#x000a0;nm are significant in LSPR-GNR systems, and low limits of detection using LSPR sensors as the ones described here have been documented for other nanosensing probes, especially when high affinity pairs&#x02014;like antibody-to-antigen&#x02014;are tested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">A especial attention was given to the ability of the described sensors to segregate DENV-infected patients from ZKV-infected ones. As demonstrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the GNR-DENV sensors were efficiently able to distinguish DENV-positive sera from ZIKV-positive samples. As mentioned before, ZIKV is a clinically relevant flavivirus that has been associated with important neurological malformations and stillbirths in women infected during pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the vast majority of infections in healthy adults result either on the absence of disease or in a clinical syndrome that is practically indistinguishable from dengue fever<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In addition, the serological differentiation between ZIKV and DENV infections is complicated by extensive cross-reactivity between these two viral agents because of their genetic proximity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, traditional diagnostic methods based in antibody detection are severely compromised when it comes to distinguish patients that were infected with one virus or the other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and, as a result, the PRNT remains as the gold standard for ZIKV diagnosis. Nonetheless, adding to the fact that the method is labor-intensive and not universally available, it has been suggested that even PRNTs may culminate in dubious results when applied to the sera of patients that have been infected with other flavivirus prior to ZIKV exposition, which is a common reality in the geographical areas where ZIKV circulates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Molecular tests that detect the presence of ZIKV RNA are a viable and highly specific alternative; however, viremia is notably short during this virus&#x02019; infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, leaving serology as a needed ZIKV diagnostic tool, despite its limitations. The development of sensors that could improve serological specificity and differentiate DENV from ZIKV has been described, including a microsphere immunoassay employing Luminex technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy coupled to square wave voltammetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. However, the production of a nanosensor that is not dependent on specific and not thoroughly available reading equipment, as the one presented here, could be a real breakthrough for medical personal and public health authorities dealing with the problem in areas with limited access to highly specific technologies.</p><p id="Par17">Although DENV and ZIKV are not in the same serocomplex within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, they share approximately 53&#x02013;57% amino acid sequence identity in their E proteins, to which most abundant and neutralizing antibodies are elicited during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. The four DENV serotypes, on the other hand, share 63&#x02013;78% amino acid identity in their E proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, enough to confer short-lived cross protection in secondary infections caused by a different DENV serotype. Due to this intense antigenic resemblance, the serologic differentiation of DENV serotypes during infections is considered impracticable. Nevertheless, when we tested highly diluted sera samples from DENV-seropositive individuals, each sensor was able to specifically recognize the correspondent anti-sera with accuracy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Importantly, the human sera used to validate this aspect of the sensor were characterized by immunochromatography, ELISA and PRNT, adding the necessary confidence to the obtained results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Although some samples were apparently identified by the non-correlated sensor on panels GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E and GNR-DENV3E (single dots on rows DENV2, DENV3 and DENV1, respectively), we considered these as outliers. Indeed, despite the outliers, the mean values (larger horizontal lines in each row) for the non-correlated samples on panels GNR-DENV2E and GNR-DENV3E remained within the shaded cutoff area. Moreover, it is not possible to rule out that these specific outlier patients have been previously exposed to a different DENV serotype, and in that case the sensors could have picked up this serological signal. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a serological method capable to identify efficiently which DENV serotype was responsible for the latest (primary or secondary) infection based solely on the serum sample of a given patient.</p><p id="Par18">There is no doubt that nanotechnology has the disruptive power to affect our way of life in many ways, being incorporated from the concrete in the walls of our houses, in the micro-circuits of the TV remote, to the quality assessment of the food we eat.

Many nanosensors depend on the use of uncommon electronic/optical devices to perform and cannot operate by using equipments that are immediately available in most diagnostic laboratories. Moreover, many such nanosensors may require specifically trained personnel either to operate the reading devices or to interpret the readouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Although the sensitivity and specificity of many published nanosensors are spectacular, those mentioned constraints might represent significant barriers to the sensors&#x02019; use, especially in developing and under-developed countries where they are frequently so desperately needed. Localized surface plasmon resonance-based nanosensors, on the other hand, are frequently based on optical readouts that can be obtained by simple UV&#x02013;Vis spectrometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Refractive index changes induced by the binding of a molecule to the surface of functionalized metal nanoparticles result in spectral shifts that can be detected by a common spectrophotometer with UV&#x02013;Vis capabilities, which are specifications frequently present in most ELISA plate readers. Because ELISA is a widespread diagnostic tool, this basic equipment is available in most diagnostic laboratories, even the humblest ones. Taking advantage of this potential for immediate applicability independently of the acquisition of specific reading devices, we developed a LSPR-based gold nanosensor for the differential immune diagnostic of DENV infections.</p><p id="Par19">Despite the potential of the nanosensors described here, there are limitations and improvements that should be considered. One such limitation is the fact that spectra shifts are obtained as graphs in most spectrophotometers, and light wavelength alterations must be individually and manually compared in such devices, especially in the simplest ones. Incorporation of a software able to automatically obtain the final readouts would greatly improve the applicability of these sensing platforms and make them more operator-friendly. Another obvious question related to this platform is whether the use of recombinant proteins made in eukaryotic systems would improve the sensitivity and/or specificity of the sensors, as opposed to the bacteria-made proteins used here. It is possible that the use of proteins processed in eukaryotic cells would offer discontinuous antibody-recognizable epitopes that are not always present in proteins made in prokaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. On the other hand, adding carbohydrates to the protein backbone could result is steric difficulties to link proteins to the gold surface. Such possibilities remain to be further evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par20">The overall objective of the study was to develop and validate LSPR-based serologic nanosensors able to distinguish DENV-infected individuals from non-infected or other flavivirus-infected patients. This platform centers on the development of a fast and highly specific serologic tool based on electronic and optical properties of gold nanoparticles and their ability to quantify antigen&#x02013;antibody pairs with different affinities. Gold nanorods were selected due to the plasticity of their LSPR spectrum. As a DENV diagnostic platform, the viral envelope protein was chosen as the biological component of the sensor based on the major humoral responses generated upon a DENV infection, regardless of immunoglobulin type. A well-established functionalization method&#x02014;based on the covalent interaction between proteins and GNRs&#x02014;was used to generate sensors with long-term stability and readout repeatability. Detection abilities were characterized using a range of monoclonal antibodies concentrations and highly diluted human sera. The specificity of the sensors was determined using sera samples from a well characterized cohort of flavivirus-infected patients, including ZIKA seropositive samples obtained during the 2015&#x02013;2017 major ZIKV outbreak in Brazil. All spectra measurements were normalized to 1 and analyzed at the same wavelength in comparison to the negative controls to avoid unspecific spectral shifts. Measurements were analyzed using the OriginPro 8 software and all statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Recombinant DENV 1&#x02013;4 envelope proteins expression and purification</title><p id="Par21">The recombinant E-DENV proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> using Brazilian circulating <italic>Dengue virus</italic> nucleic acid sequences available at the NCBI (GenBank) database (DENV1E: accession number GU131863, DENV2E: accession number GU131881, DENV3E: accession number JN697379, DENV4E: accession number KP188566).

The chosen method for statistical evaluation is based on the number of samples that are classified as true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), or false negative (FN) in a diagnostic assay. In order to evaluate the diagnostic potential of the recombinant proteins in a classic ELISA test and the LSPR-Nanosensors, we calculated Total Sensitivity (TSe), Total Specificity (TSp), accuracy (AC) and the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Total Sensitivity (&#x0201c;positivity in disease&#x0201d;) refers to the proportion of subjects who have the target condition (reference standard positive) and render positive test results. Likewise, Total Specificity (&#x0201c;negativity in health&#x0201d;) is the proportion of subjects without the target condition and render negative test results. The term &#x0201c;total&#x0201d; refers to the fact that results obtained for the four nanosensors (GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E, GNR-DENV3E and GNR-DENV4E were compared to the performance of the four DENV proteins in the ELISA tests). AC is also known as &#x0201c;diagnostic accuracy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;test efficiency&#x0201d;, and represents the overall proportion of correct test results. PPV refers to the probability by which a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease, and NPV refers to the probability by which a patient with a negative test result actually has no disease. A good screening test should have high PPV and NPV. The Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov method was used as normality test to evaluate the data distribution. The ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction as multiple hypothesis tests were used to compare groups with parametric distribution and Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test with Dunn&#x02019;s correction was used to compare data with non-parametric distribution.
