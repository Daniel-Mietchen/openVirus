 <caption>
  <p>Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of the DENV recombinant proteins (DENV1E, top left; DENV2E, top right; DENV3E, bottom left; and DENV4E, bottom right) by an in-house ELISA test. Each green dot represents the serum sample of a DENV IgG-positive subject; each red dot represents the serum of an arbovirus-seronegative subject; and each black dot represents serum samples from ZIKV seropositive subjects. The gray area represents the calculated cutoff for each protein. The mean absorbance value of each group is represented by the larger horizontal lines on each row. Standard deviations are also represented.</p>
