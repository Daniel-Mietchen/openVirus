  <p>Evaluation of the LSPR-GNR-Nanosensors limit of detection using a serially diluted pool of DENV-positive human antisera. The pooled sera were diluted in 1:10 to 1:100,000 ratios and added to each specific sensor: (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) GNR-DENV1E; (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) GNR-DENV2E; (
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>) GNR-DENV3E; and (
   <bold>G</bold>,
   <bold>H</bold>) GNR-DENV4E. Reads were obtained between 750 and 900 nm wavelength range (graphs in 
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>G</bold>). Relative shifts on the region of zero of the derivative curves for different sera dilutions are shown below each graph (graphs in 
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>,
   <bold>H</bold>). The equipment wavelength accuracy is ± 3 nm and shifts equal or higher than 5 nm were considered significant. Shifts are related to the sensor added with dengue-negative sera (DENVE-NEG sera). Samples from the sera bank depicted on Table
