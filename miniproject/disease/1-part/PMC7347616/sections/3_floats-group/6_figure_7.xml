  <p>Evaluation of the LSPR-Nanosensor capability to distinguish DENV from ZIKV infections. Human Dengue virus-positive sera (DENV—red lines) and Zika virus-positive sera (ZKV—blue lines) were pooled and diluted in 1:10,000 ratios. Pools were individually added to each sensor GNR-DENV1E (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>); GNR-DENV2E (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>); GNR-DENV3E (
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>) or GNR-DENV4E (
   <bold>G</bold>,
   <bold>H</bold>). Flavivirus-negative pooled sera were used as controls (black lines). Reads were obtained between 700 and 950 nm wavelength range (graphs in 
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>G</bold>). Relative shifts on the region of zero of the derivative curves for each serum are shown below each graph (graphs in 
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>,
   <bold>H</bold>). The equipment wavelength accuracy is ± 3 nm and shifts equal or higher than 5 nm were considered significant. Shifts are related to the sensor added with dengue-negative sera (DENVE-NEG sera). Samples from the sera bank depicted on Table
