  <p>Representative evaluation of the LSPR-GNR-Nanosensors’ ability to detect low amounts of specific antibodies using different concentrations of a dengue monoclonal antibody. The nanosensor were tested with different concentrations of monoclonal antibody (commercial, DENV-specific), varying from nanograms (ng) to femtograms (fg). All tested nanosensors were capable to detect antibodies at picograms range—as shown here with GNR-DENV4E. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Absorbance spectra for pristine gold nanorods (GNR), nanorods capped with lipoic acid (GNR-DHLA) and the completed sensor (DENV4E) are shown. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Derivative calculation from the LSPR signal measured from the samples. The region of zero (derivative axis) and 750–850 nm (wavelength axis) represents the peak of the longitudinal mode. The equipment wavelength accuracy is ± 3 nm, therefore, for those tests only shifts equal or higher than 5 nm were considered significant. Wavelength shifts for different monoclonal antibodies’ dilutions are shown in (
   <bold>B</bold>). Shifts depicted at the inset table are related to the sensor with no sera spectrum (DENV4E).
