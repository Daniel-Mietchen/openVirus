  <p>Evaluation of the LSPR-Nanosensor capability to distinguish DENV specific serotypes. Serotype specific Dengue virus-positive antisera, Zika virus-positive antisera and flavivirus-negative antisera were evaluated by molecular, serologic and PRNT analyses. Each individual serum was diluted in a 1:100,000 ration and incubated with each sensor (GNR-DENV1E; GNR-DENV2E; GNR-DENV3E; or GNR-DENV4E). The Y axis in each graph represents the spectrum shift in nm; each position on the X axis represent either serotype specific dengue-positive individuals (DENV1, 2, 3 and 4), zika-positive individuals (ZIKV); or flavivirus-negative individuals (Neg). Dots represent individual serum. The gray area represents the cutoff value for each individual sensor, calculated based on the negative interaction background. The mean absorbance value of each group is represented by the larger horizontal lines on each row. Standard deviations are also represented. Samples from the sera bank depicted on Table
