  <p>Specificity of the DENV LSPR-Nanosensors. Individual sensors were incubated with human flavivirus-negative serum (blue lines), human Saint Louis encephalitis virus-positive serum (SLEV, red lines), or human Yellow Fever virus-positive serum (YFV, green lines). Specific sera were pooled and diluted in 1:10,000 rations. (
