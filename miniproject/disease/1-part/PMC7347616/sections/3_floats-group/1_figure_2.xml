  <p>DENV LSPR-Nanosensor construction. The gold nanorods were primarily linked to α-lipoic acid through interaction with the molecule’s thiol group. Subsequently, EDC and NHS reagents were added to drive and stabilize substitution reactions through which recombinant proteins were covalently linked to the α-lipoic acid on the surface of the GNRs. The protein-decorated GNRs were used as biosensors in which specific antibodies bind to their cognate proteins on the GNR surface. Antibody binding disrupts the LSPR pattern on GNRs which can result on a shift of the emitted spectrum (bottom graphs).
