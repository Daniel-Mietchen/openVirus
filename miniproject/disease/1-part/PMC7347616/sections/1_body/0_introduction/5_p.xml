<p id="Par6">When the plasmon frequency is of the same as the incident light, a resonance phenomenon occurs and results in a noticeable optical absorption. Thus, the coupling of the incident light and plasmon mode generates a sharp electric field on the surface of the metallic nanoparticles. In the spherical gold nanoparticles’ LSPR, the plasmon absorption frequency is independent of the excitation light polarization, with a peak in the 515–520 nm position, presenting low sensitivity for dielectric surface changes. Non-spherical nanoparticles like gold nanorods, however, present two LSPR modes, one transverse and another longitudinal, with incident light polarizations perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the rod, respectively. The transverse mode has low sensitivity to the dielectric surface changes, however, the longitudinal mode presents a strong polarization effect and high sensitivity to dielectric surface changes, making such particles responsive to the dielectric features of the surrounding environment

 </sup>. Therefore, any modifications around the nanoparticle, including alterations in their surface, the solvent and particle aggregation, will determine changes in the electronic properties of the nanoparticle’s surface, resulting in alterations in the patterns of the absorption spectrum. All these optical features make GNPs useful in many different biological applications, particularly to detect molecules found in low concentrations on the environment

 </sup>, and more. Here, we describe the construction and testing of a Dengue GNR-based nanosensor in which the surface E protein of each DENV serotype was individually associated to GNRs. When tested against commercial antibodies and antisera from different flaviruses-infected patients the GNR sensors were able not only to detect the presence of antibodies in very low concentrations but were also able to distinguish DENV-infected individuals from seronegative ones and from those that were infected by other flaviviruses. Because antibody detection is achieved by evaluating shifts in the light absorption frequencies of the sensor, biosensing can be made with the use of regular spectrophotometers that are usually available in public health centers at remote and under-developed geographic areas where arboviruses so frequently circulate.
