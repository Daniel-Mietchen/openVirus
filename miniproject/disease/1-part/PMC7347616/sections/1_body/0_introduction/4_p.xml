<p id="Par5">The upsurge of the Nanotechnology has induced the generation of many new materials that present potential to be used in association to antigens as diagnostic tools. Metallic gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are highly stable particles with features that make them very attractive in biological applications. Such features include attainable surface functionalization chemistry; capability to be synthesized in many different shapes; shape- and size-dependent optical and electronic characteristics; and many other pertinent properties

 </sup>. One of the most important optical features of GNPs is the fact that when they are irradiated with light of specific frequencies this results in the collective oscillation of electrons in the particle surface. Such oscillation is named Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR). This phenomenon happens when the oscillating electromagnetic field of the incident light interacts with electrons on the conduction band of the metal initiating their oscillation in resonance with the frequency of the light. As electrons oscillate, a charge separation between the free electrons and the ionic core on the metal occurs, exerting a restoring Coulomb force that causes the electrons to oscillate back and forth on the metallic surface, creating a dipole oscillation
