<p id="Par4">Flaviviruses are known to remain viremic for a relatively short period of time during infection (typically 3–7 days after the appearance of symptoms, or longer in the case of pregnant women with ZIKV infections), and this narrow window complicates the detection of virus’ nucleic acids or antigens to confirm infections

 </sup>. Therefore, serology continues to be the predominant diagnostic tool in terms of clinical practice, especially serology tests like immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Nonetheless, physicians and public health authorities must be aware of the high antigenic similarity among flaviviruses (e.g. 54–59% of amino acid sequence similarity between the DENV and ZIKV E proteins), which limits the use of serology-based tests to distinguish these infections due to intense antisera cross-reactivity between viruses

 </sup>. Such limitations in the use of conventional diagnostic methods have driven the search for new diagnostic platforms, especially those able to deliver better sensitivity and specificity scores.
