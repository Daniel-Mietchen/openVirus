<p id="Par2">Dengue is an arboviral infection that is endemic in countries of Asia, Oceania, the Americas, Africa, and the Caribbean. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 40% of the world’s population live in regions where the risk of dengue transmission is high

 <italic>Dengue virus</italic> (DENV)
 <italic>,</italic> the pathogen that causes dengue fever and other manifestations, is classified as part of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus within the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. The family was named after the 
 <italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> (YFV) and the Latin particle 
 <italic>Flavi</italic> means “of golden color”—a reference to the onset of jaundice observed in YFV-infected patients. Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses whose genome encodes just one 
 <italic>open reading frame</italic> (ORF) that codifies a single polyprotein. During the virus replication cycle the polyprotein is cleaved in three structural and seven nonstructural polypeptides by virus-coded or cell proteases
