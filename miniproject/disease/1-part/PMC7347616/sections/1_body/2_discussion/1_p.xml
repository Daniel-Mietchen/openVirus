<p id="Par13">Diagnosing DENV infections is a high priority in countries affected by annual epidemics of dengue fever. The correct diagnostic is essential for patient managing and prognostic as there are no specific antiviral drugs to treat the infection. Depending on the observed clinical developments, the infected patient may be released for home care; treated as an outpatient; or immediately admitted as an inpatient for emergency medical care. In all cases, laboratory confirmation of viral infection is crucial to the decision-making. Nonetheless, DENV infection diagnostic is no easy task, especially considering that tropical regions where dengue is most prevalent are also plagued by the circulation of other arboviruses causing diseases in which clinical manifestations are hardly distinguishable from dengue

 </sup>. To complicate matters, some of these arboviruses, such as ZIKV and YFV, are closely relatives of DENV and extensive serological cross-reactions among them have been largely documented

 </sup>. In addition, the mass application of those methods during an epidemic is virtually impossible, making more traditional serological diagnostic approaches, like ELISA and immunochromatography, the obvious and feasible choices. In these cases, however, cross-reactivity becomes an issue. In such scenario, nanostructured sensors become an attractive alternative due to their potential sensitivity and specificity aspects.
