<p id="Par15">We constructed four GNR-based sensors in which recombinant E proteins of each DENV serotype were covalently linked to the surface of the rods employing reduced α-Lipoic acid as CTAB disperser and binding agent between the gold surface and the recombinant proteins. We monitored the correct construction of the sensors employing methods that are traditionally used for this purpose, including UV–Vis spectroscopy, TEM and Zeta potential measurements

 </sup>. Having established that the nanosensors were successfully obtained, we individually tested the ability of each DENV serotype-specific sensor in recognizing correlate anti-sera while avoiding excessive cross-reactions with sera from individuals infected with other related flaviviruses, including SLEV, YFV and ZIKV. To that end, we took advantage of the LSPR property of gold nanoparticles and evaluated shifts at the observed light absorbance spectra when sensors were exposed to antibodies and sera. Our results indicated that all sensors were both highly sensitive and specific, with spectra shifts equal or higher than 5 nm when very low anti-DENV antibody amounts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) or highly diluted DENV-positive sera samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) were added. On the other hand, incubation with sera from YFV- or SLEV-infected individuals produced spectra shifts that were consistently bellow the 5 nm cutoff limit in the spectra shift (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Indeed, according to Yu and Irudayaraj

 </sup>, wavelength shifts as little as 5 nm are significant in LSPR-GNR systems, and low limits of detection using LSPR sensors as the ones described here have been documented for other nanosensing probes, especially when high affinity pairs—like antibody-to-antigen—are tested
