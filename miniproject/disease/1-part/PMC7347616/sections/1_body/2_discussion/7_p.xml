<p id="Par19">Despite the potential of the nanosensors described here, there are limitations and improvements that should be considered. One such limitation is the fact that spectra shifts are obtained as graphs in most spectrophotometers, and light wavelength alterations must be individually and manually compared in such devices, especially in the simplest ones. Incorporation of a software able to automatically obtain the final readouts would greatly improve the applicability of these sensing platforms and make them more operator-friendly. Another obvious question related to this platform is whether the use of recombinant proteins made in eukaryotic systems would improve the sensitivity and/or specificity of the sensors, as opposed to the bacteria-made proteins used here. It is possible that the use of proteins processed in eukaryotic cells would offer discontinuous antibody-recognizable epitopes that are not always present in proteins made in prokaryotic cells

 </sup>. On the other hand, adding carbohydrates to the protein backbone could result is steric difficulties to link proteins to the gold surface. Such possibilities remain to be further evaluated.
