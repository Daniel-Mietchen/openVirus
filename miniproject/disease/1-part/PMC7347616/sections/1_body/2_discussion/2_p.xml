<p id="Par14">The choice for the DENV E protein as the sensor’s probing component is based on the fact that after an infection the majority of all antibody species produced against DENV recognize epitopes that are distributed on the virus’ surface proteins, either E or M, whereas a lesser proportion of these antibodies recognizes the NS1 non-structural protein

 </sup>. Overall, serotype cross-reactive anti-E antibodies constitute the bulk of antibody responses elicited on a DENV-infected patient, followed by invariably smaller amounts of anti-(pr)M and anti-NS1

 </sup>. Conversely, any anti-DENV vaccine design must certainly include the E protein, as it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies which, despite some recent scrutiny, are still viewed as important correlates of immunological protection against the infection

 </sup>. We produced truncated versions of the proteins in which the transmembrane C-terminus of each polypeptide was removed to improve the stability of the product. It has been shown by us and others that such modification causes no disturbance to the correct folding of the DENV E protein

 </sup>. Nonetheless, bacteria-made DENV E recombinant proteins have been viewed as poor immunogens
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>, mostly because prokaryotic cells do not include post-translational modifications to the produced proteins, including the addition of carbohydrates to the polypeptide backbone. Indeed, most antibodies directed against the DENV E protein are thought to recognize discontinuous epitopes whereas only a few recognize linear epitopes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>, and the presence of carbohydrates sterically influences the selection of discontinuous epitopes

 </sup>. In fact, when we used our soluble recombinant E proteins in ELISA protocols to identify DENV-infected patients and distinguish them from either non-infected or ZIKA-infected patients we obtained mixed results. The DENV1E and DENV3E proteins were able to identify most DENV immune patients in our sera bank, distinguishing them from DENV-negative subjects and ZIKV immune individuals, although a few dengue-positive individuals were distributed bellow the cutoff area and some ZIKV-positive subjects were placed above it (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, left panels). As for DENV2E and DENV4E ELISAs, however, identification of DENV immune individuals and distinction from the other groups were quite poor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, right panels). Nonetheless, all proteins could be efficiently recognized in Western-blot experiments using an anti-DENV commercial monoclonal antibody (Suppl Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In the face of such inconclusive results and considering the economic advantages of having recombinant proteins produced in prokaryotic cells, we asked whether the construction of more sensitive diagnostic sensors could significantly enhance the diagnostic potential of the bacteria-made DENV1E to DENV4E recombinant proteins.
