<p id="Par29">In order to evaluate the ability of the constructed biosensors in discriminating flavivirus-positive and negative patients, diluted sera samples were added to the sensors. Human sera that were negative for flaviviruses were used as controls. The positive and negative sera were individually pooled according to their characterization (DENV+, YFV+/DENV−, SLEV+/DENV−, ZIKV+/DENV−, Flavivirus-), diluted in 1:10,000 ratio, and added to individual sensors (GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E, GNR-DENV3E or GNR-DENV4E). Once again, we focused on the red shifting measurements of the longitudinal peak and shifts of less than 5 nm were not considered significant. We further evaluated the specificity of the constructed sensors by analyzing their ability to discriminate sera from patients that were infected by different DENV serotypes. Serotype-specific DENV-positive sera were characterized by PCR and PRNT tests, confirming the infective DENV serotype of each individual patient. Sera from each patient was diluted in 1:10,000 ratio and individually added to the individual sensors. Spectral shifts were measured as described above. Shifts were considered in relation to sensors with no sera or sensors added with flavivirus-negative sera, as specified in each experiment or figure.</p>
