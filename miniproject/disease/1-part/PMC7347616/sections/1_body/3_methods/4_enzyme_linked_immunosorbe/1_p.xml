 </sup>. Briefly, Nunc™ Maxisorp™ 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, USA) were individually coated with 200 ng per well of recombinant DENV1E, DENV2E, DENV3E or DENV4E diluted in carbonate buffer at pH 9.6 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed and incubated with the blocking solution at RT for 2 h. Diluted patient sera (1:50) were added to the wells and incubated at RT for 60 min. Plates were, then, incubated with anti-human IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology, EUA), diluted 1:5,000 at RT for 60 min. The reaction was terminated with 100 μL sulfuric acid and the absorbance measured at 450 nm using an spectrophotometer (Asys/Hitech Expert plus, Eugendorf, Austria).
