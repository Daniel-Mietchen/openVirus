<p id="Par28">To evaluate the effectiveness of the interaction between nanosensors and antibodies, initial assays were carried out by using monoclonal anti-dengue virus 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 antibody (ab9202, Abcam, UK) and patients’ sera. To figure out the limit of detection of the GNR sensors, serial dilutions of anti-DENV antibodies, containing from 10 µg to 1 fg of total antibody mass, were added to the functionalized GNR solutions (GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E, GNR-DENV3E or GNR-DENV4E). After 30 min of incubation in ultrasonic bath at 4 °C, UV–Vis spectroscopy measurements were carried out using Multiskan GO spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Assessments were conducted independently, during three consecutive days, with three replicates each. Data plot was based on the resultant median absorbance between replicates. To more precisely measure the biosensing event we evaluated plasmon shift in each curve through the X-axis intercept of the derivative of the Gaussian peak for every curve. In all figures depicting LSPR detection, the spectra absorbance and the derivative calculus were plotted side by side. Data analysis focused on red shifting measurements of the longitudinal peak, and 3 nm was considered the equipment’s maximum accuracy. To add confidence, shifts of less than 5 nm were not considered significant. The biosensors’ limit of detection was also tested in the same way employing DENV-positive human sera diluted up to 1:100,000. Shifts were considered in relation to sensors with no sera or sensors added with flavivirus-negative sera, as specified in each experiment or figure.</p>
