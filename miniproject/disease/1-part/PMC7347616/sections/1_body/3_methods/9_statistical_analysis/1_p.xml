<p id="Par30">This experiment was analyzed as a classic diagnostic performance study, evaluating the concordance between a proposed test (the LSPR-nanosensor) and a reference standard test (in this case, the ELISA) for their ability to identify a target condition. The chosen method for statistical evaluation is based on the number of samples that are classified as true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), or false negative (FN) in a diagnostic assay. In order to evaluate the diagnostic potential of the recombinant proteins in a classic ELISA test and the LSPR-Nanosensors, we calculated Total Sensitivity (TSe), Total Specificity (TSp), accuracy (AC) and the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively)

 </sup>. Total Sensitivity (“positivity in disease”) refers to the proportion of subjects who have the target condition (reference standard positive) and render positive test results. Likewise, Total Specificity (“negativity in health”) is the proportion of subjects without the target condition and render negative test results. The term “total” refers to the fact that results obtained for the four nanosensors (GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E, GNR-DENV3E and GNR-DENV4E were compared to the performance of the four DENV proteins in the ELISA tests). AC is also known as “diagnostic accuracy” or “test efficiency”, and represents the overall proportion of correct test results. PPV refers to the probability by which a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease, and NPV refers to the probability by which a patient with a negative test result actually has no disease. A good screening test should have high PPV and NPV. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov method was used as normality test to evaluate the data distribution. The ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction as multiple hypothesis tests were used to compare groups with parametric distribution and Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s correction was used to compare data with non-parametric distribution. Cutoff values were calculated by the average of true negative sera plus two-times standard deviation values (2SD). All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.
