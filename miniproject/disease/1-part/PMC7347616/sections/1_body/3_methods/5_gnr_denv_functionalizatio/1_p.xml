<p id="Par24">Commercial Gold Nanorods [Part# A12-(10-780)-(CTAB)-(DI Water)], size 10 × 38 nm, were purchased from Nanopartz™ (US/Canada). GNRs were covalently functionalized with the DENV recombinant proteins through a carbodiimide-activated amidation reaction

 </sup> (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Firstly, we obtained a saturation curve of the reduced α-lipoic acid re-suspended in ethanol with concentrations ranging from 1 to 40 mM in order to define the concentration necessary to replace the CTAB (Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) layers on GNR surface. The α-lipoic acid (LA, Sigma Aldrich, USA) reduction in dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) was performed following a Burst protocol as described elsewhere

 </sup>. After choosing the appropriate concentration, 4 mM of DHLA was added to the gold nanorod solution (0.039 mg/mL) and the suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (UNIQUE model U5C1850, 154 W, 25 kHz) at 55 °C for 30 min followed by 2 h at 30 °C. GNRs were, then, centrifuged at 5600
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and suspended in aqueous solution. The GNR-DHLA complex was kept at 4 °C and protected from light exposure. The stability of the complex was evaluated during approximately 16 months by UV–Vis spectroscopy. For functionalization with the target proteins, the modified GNRs (GNR-DHLA) were re-dispersed in a 10 mM phosphate buffer containing 16 mM EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, USA) and 4 mM sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, USA) for 30 min in an ice bath under sonication. After another centrifugation step, GNR-DHLA was blocked with poly(ethylene glycol)-thiolate (5kD mPEG-SH, 10
 <sup>–4</sup> mM, from Nanocs Inc., USA) for 10 min in an ice bath under stirring. Finally, 100 µg of DENVE from each serotype (DENV1E, DENV2E, DENV3E and DENV4E) were individually added to the activated GNR solutions for 1 h in an ice bath under sonication. The individually obtained nanoconjugates were named GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E, GNR-DENV3E or GNR-DENV4E.
