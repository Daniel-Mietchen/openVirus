<p id="Par26">UV–Vis spectroscopy was performed on a Varioskan Flash spectral scanning multimode reader (Thermo Scientific) at wavelengths of 200–800 nm using a 96-well quartz microplate (Costar). Each sample was measured three times in all experiments and the spectrum was plotted from the resultant median.</p>
