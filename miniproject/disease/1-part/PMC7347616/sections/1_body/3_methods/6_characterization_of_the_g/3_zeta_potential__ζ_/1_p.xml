<p id="Par27">Analyses of the Zeta potential were conducted on a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 analyzer from Malvern at an angle of 173° at room temperature. A laser beam set at 633 nm was choose to measure the electrophoretic mobility of particles using principles of dynamic light scattering. The Zetasizer analyzer calculates the zeta potential of the sample using the Smoluchowski equation: ξ = μη/ε, where ξ is the zeta potential, μ is the mobility, η is the viscosity of the solution, and ε is the dielectric constant of the solvent
