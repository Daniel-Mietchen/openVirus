<p id="Par20">The overall objective of the study was to develop and validate LSPR-based serologic nanosensors able to distinguish DENV-infected individuals from non-infected or other flavivirus-infected patients. This platform centers on the development of a fast and highly specific serologic tool based on electronic and optical properties of gold nanoparticles and their ability to quantify antigen–antibody pairs with different affinities. Gold nanorods were selected due to the plasticity of their LSPR spectrum. As a DENV diagnostic platform, the viral envelope protein was chosen as the biological component of the sensor based on the major humoral responses generated upon a DENV infection, regardless of immunoglobulin type. A well-established functionalization method—based on the covalent interaction between proteins and GNRs—was used to generate sensors with long-term stability and readout repeatability. Detection abilities were characterized using a range of monoclonal antibodies concentrations and highly diluted human sera. The specificity of the sensors was determined using sera samples from a well characterized cohort of flavivirus-infected patients, including ZIKA seropositive samples obtained during the 2015–2017 major ZIKV outbreak in Brazil. All spectra measurements were normalized to 1 and analyzed at the same wavelength in comparison to the negative controls to avoid unspecific spectral shifts. Measurements were analyzed using the OriginPro 8 software and all statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.</p>
