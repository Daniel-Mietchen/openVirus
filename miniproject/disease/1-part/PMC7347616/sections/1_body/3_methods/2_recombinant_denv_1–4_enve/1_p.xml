<p id="Par21">The recombinant E-DENV proteins were expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> using Brazilian circulating 
 <italic>Dengue virus</italic> nucleic acid sequences available at the NCBI (GenBank) database (DENV1E: accession number GU131863, DENV2E: accession number GU131881, DENV3E: accession number JN697379, DENV4E: accession number KP188566). The coding genes were synthesized by Genone (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) and synthetic genes were subcloned in pET-21a plasmid vectors. The cloned genes code for the 80% N-terminal portion of the DENV E proteins, amino acids 1–404, as the removal of the protein hydrophobic C-terminus has been shown to increase protein yield during its heterologous expression as well as its immunogenicity

 </sup>. For protein purification, cells were disrupted (French Press Cell Disrupter, Thermo Electron Corporation) using a binding buffer under agitation and then homogenized. The recombinant proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions with HisTrap HP column employing an ÄKTAprime plus system (GE Healthcare, USA). Fractions were screened by SDS-PAGE, quantified by Bradford (BioRad, USA) and pools of the most productive samples were concentrated using VivaSpin filters (GE Healthcare, USA). The identity of the proteins was confirmed by western blot using anti-histidine (GE Healthcare, USA) and anti-dengue virus 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 antibodies (ab9202, Abcam, UK—according to the antibody’s datasheet this hybridoma antibody reacts with each dengue serotype in dot blot, ELISA and fluorescent antibody tests).
