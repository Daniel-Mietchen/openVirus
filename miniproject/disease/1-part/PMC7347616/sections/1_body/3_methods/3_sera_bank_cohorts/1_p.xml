<p id="Par22">For this work, we established two different sera banks. For the characterization of the first sera bank, when samples were serologically pre-tested, PRNT (Plaque reduction neutralization test) was employed as a confirmatory test. When a molecular diagnostic procedure (PCR) was used as a pre-test, samples were further confirmed through ELISA (see Suppl. Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). DENV-positive serum samples selected in this bank are originated from Southeastern Brazil outbreaks, from 2006 to 2014, a period that precedes ZIKV introduction in this geographic area. ZIKV-positive serum samples were obtained from the Minas Gerais State Reference Laboratory (FUNED/MG) and include sera from ZIKV-seropositive women that were infected during their pregnancy and/or from their children. Samples were previously tested by molecular and serological assays (see Suppl. Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The second sera bank consists of an open cohort of less-characterized sera (evaluated only by serological analysis) from patients of different age range and sex, collected from 2015 to 2017 in two different states in Brazil, SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais (see Suppl. Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Both sera banks were used throughout the study.
