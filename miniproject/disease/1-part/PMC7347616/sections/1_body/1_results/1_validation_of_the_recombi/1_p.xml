<p id="Par7">In order to build a LSPR-GNR-based sensor, we generated recombinant proteins based on the Envelope protein coding genes of each of the four DENV serotypes. The expression and purification of the different recombinant E proteins (named DENV1E, DENV2E, DENV3E and DENV4E) were evaluated by SDS-PAGE (Suppl Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A). The antigenic potential of these recombinant proteins (of approx. 50 kDa each) was determined by Western blot using a specific monoclonal antibody against

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B). Identical blots were also probed with an antibody against the histidine tail fragment to further confirm the production and purification of the recombinant proteins (Suppl Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>C). To analyze the diagnostic potential of these proteins, we developed an in-house ELISA platform and tested it against DENV-positive sera, ZIKV-positive sera and flavivirus-negative sera (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (characterization of the sera banks used here can be seen in Suppl Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The ELISA tests were able to efficiently distinguish DENV-negative sera from the sera of DENV-infected patients (comparing DENV+ and negative rows in each graph). Nevertheless, sensitivities were not robust as many patients (individual dots) still fell below the cutoff area, especially for DENVE2 and DENVE4 proteins. The global sensitivity varied from 50.9 to 80.2% whilst the specificity varied from 85.5 to 93.7%. The specificity values represent the ability of the ELISA test to distinguish dengue-infected patients from Zika seropositive individuals, in this case. All diagnostic performances and parameters of this test can be accessed at Suppl Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Definitions as well as how sensitivity (TSe) and specificity (TSp) were calculated are presented in the methods’ session.
