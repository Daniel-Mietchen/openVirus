<p id="Par12">Having established our sensors’ ability to serologically distinguish DENV from ZIKV, SLEV and YFV infections, we decided to further evaluate them by testing their ability to serologically distinguish infections caused by even more closely related viruses: in this case, infections caused by each one of the four DENV serotypes. Each individual nanosensor (GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E, GNR-DENV3E and GNR-DENV4E) was incubated with diluted sera preparations from patients that were specifically seropositive for DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4 or ZIKV infection, as well as with flavivirus-negative sera (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The UV–Vis spectroscopy analyses revealed that each specific nanosensor was capable to identify most of the correlated serotype-specific samples and distinguish them from patients infected with non-correlated serotypes. The GNR-DENV4E sensor, for instance, performed flawlessly, with no cross-reactivity to the other DENV serotypes or ZIKV above the determined cutoff value. Other sensors performed similarly, although not with the same accuracy as the GNR-DENV4E sensor. A compiled dataset of the wavelength relative shift values for each sensor in relation to the tested sera is presented on Suppl. Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>. The overall evaluation of the diagnostic performance of the nanosensors as DENV serotype-specific tools is shown on Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. All sensors presented robust diagnostic parameters, varying from 75 to 100% of sensitivity and 88.2–100% of specificity in relation to their ability to identify a correlated DENV-positive serum sample.
