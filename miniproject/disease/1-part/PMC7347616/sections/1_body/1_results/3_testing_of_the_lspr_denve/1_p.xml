<p id="Par10">Having constructed the functionalized GNR sensors, we evaluated their sensitivity and specificity through interactions with diluted samples from a panel of antibodies and sera, including dengue monoclonal antibodies, sera from dengue seropositive or seronegative human individuals, as well as sera from patients that are positive for other flaviviruses. The first test was conducted to confirm the correct interaction between proteins and the nanoparticles and the maintenance of available antibody binding sites. More importantly, having a known concentration, anti-Dengue commercial monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the minimum anti-Dengue antibody amounts that can be detected by the sensors. establish limits of detection for the nanosensors. Commercial antibodies of the same brand and batch were used in all experiments. Antibodies were tenfold diluted until concentrations of 1 fg and incubated with the nanosensors. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the spectral shifts in the GNR-DENV4E sensor for the final four dilutions in relation to the sensor with no sera added. The nanosensor was able to detect as low as 1 pg of anti-dengue antibodies with a 5 nm wavelength shift in the absorbance spectra in relation to the sensor with no antibodies added. Similar shifts were observed for the three other sensors (data not shown). Likewise, when pooled sera from dengue immune individuals were tested in our nanosensing platforms, dilutions of up to 1:100,000 induced significant wavelength shifts in the observed absorption plasmon bands, especially on the longitudinal bands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,C,E,G). The GNR-DENV4E sensor presented the best performance, with a shift of 42 nm in the 1:100,000 sera dilution range in relation to the DENV-negative sera (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>H). Nonetheless, the other three sensors performed similarly, with relative shifts between 8 and 15 nm in relation to the DENV-negative control at the highest sera dilutions (Fig.
