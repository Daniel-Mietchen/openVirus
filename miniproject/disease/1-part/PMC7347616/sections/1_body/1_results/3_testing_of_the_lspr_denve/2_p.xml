<p id="Par11">When it comes to flaviviruses’ diagnostics, however, the specificity of a given test is as important as its sensitivity, because cross-reactions among related virus species and antibodies are a real problem. To evaluate the specificity of the sensors, we tested them with sera from dengue-negative individuals as well as from individuals that were seropositive for other flaviviruses, including 
 <italic>Saint Louis encephalitis virus</italic> (SLEV) and YFV. In almost all cases, we detected no significant wavelength shifts (above 5 nm) during the UV–Vis spectroscopy evaluation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Significant spectra shifts of were observed only when DENV-negative sera pools were added to DENV3E and DENV4E sensors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F,H). Nonetheless, as mentioned before, the global emergence of ZIKV and the difficulties to serologically discriminate ZIKV infections from DENV infections added more pressure over the Public Health systems in affected countries. Therefore, we tested the ability of our GNR sensors to discriminate dengue IgM-seropositive individuals from those that were recently infected with ZIKV employing a well-characterized human sera bank (Suppl Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We observed wavelength shifts equal or higher than 20 nm for dengue sensors DENV1, 2 and 4 using 1:10,000 sera dilution ratios of dengue-positive samples, whereas same dilution ratios from ZIKV-infected patients produced between zero and 2 nm in wavelength shifts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). All shifts were observed in relation to sensors tested with flavivirus-negative sera pools. Nanosensors GNR-DENV1E, GNR-DENV2E and GNR-DENV4E showed no significant cross-reactivity with ZIKV sera and presented wide shifts when tested against the dengue-positive sera (24 nm, 20 nm, and 37 nm, respectively—Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B,D,F,H). Nanosensor GNR-DENV3E presented a narrow shift in comparison to the other sensors when tested to the serotype-specific sera (10 nm) but with no significant cross-reactivity with ZIKV sera (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F).
