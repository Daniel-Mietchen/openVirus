<p id="Par9">The efficiency of the GNR-DENVE functionalization was confirmed by three different approaches. First, we performed UV–Vis measures before, during and after the functionalization process to determine electrical changes on the GNR surface. The LSPR spectrum shifts observed after chemicals (red lines) and protein binding (blue lines) indicate the successful GNR functionalization with each DENVE protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A,C,E,G). To determine the correct plasmon shift, each LSPR curve was plotted with the correspondent calculus of the X axis intercept of the derivative of the Gaussian peak (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B,D,F,H). Second, both pristine GNRs and GNR-DENVE nanosensors were evaluated through Zeta potential analysis, and the GNR total charge modifications after each functionalization step confirmed the correct association of the GNRs to the recombinant DENVE proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>I). At last, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe surface structural modifications during GNR functionalization. The TEM images show the overall GNR structure before functionalization (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>J, top panel) and the deposition of an amorphous layer capping the GNR after the functionalization with DENVE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F, bottom panel). Taking together, these results indicate the effective interaction between the DENVE proteins and GNRs, and the correct generation of the all four DENV serotype-specific nanosensors. All tests described above are regularly used in the characterization of functionalized GNRs
