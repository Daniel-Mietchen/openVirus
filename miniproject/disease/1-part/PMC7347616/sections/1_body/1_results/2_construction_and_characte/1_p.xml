<p id="Par8">We successfully functionalized GNRs with each protein—DENV1E to DENV4E—using established protocols with modifications. The functionalization strategy, depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, consists on the attachment of proteins to the gold nanorods by covalently coupling the amine terminal functional groups of polypeptides to so called capping agents, a process well described in the literature

 </sup>. We used a reduced α-Lipoic acid (DHLA) as capping agent and sulfo-NHS (
 <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) and EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) as intermediate chemicals—the later reagents direct the formation of an ester bridge between the protein and the DHLA, resulting in the covalent interaction among these molecules. The choice of the reduced α-Lipoic acid is related not only to the its proper function as a linker to protein binding, but also as a strategy to remove the CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) monolayer covering the nanoparticles in solution. Because CTAB is related to the stability of GNRs in solution

 </sup>, it was important to analyze whether CTAB-stripped and DHLA functionalized GNRs were stable. Indeed, GNR-DHLA particles were evaluated for 16 months using UV–Vis spectroscopy and no major changes at the observed light absorbance spectra was observed (Suppl Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Consistently, there was no color change or precipitations in the stored solutions (not shown).
