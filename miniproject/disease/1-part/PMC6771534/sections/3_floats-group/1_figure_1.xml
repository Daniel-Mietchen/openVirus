  <p>Interactions of herpes simplex virus (HSV) surface glycoproteins and tegument proteins with cellular components to interfere with host defense. At least five glycoproteins, gB, gC, gD, gH, and gL, have been demonstrated to enable interactions with epithelial cellular receptors or immune cells to promote virus entry or proliferation or even to disrupt innate and adaptive immunity. In addition, some tegument proteins play important roles, for example, roles in viral proliferation, viral virulence, and host immunity evasion, through interacting with cellular molecules</p>
