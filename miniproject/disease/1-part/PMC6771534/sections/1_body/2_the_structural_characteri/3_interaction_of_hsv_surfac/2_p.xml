<p>As an enveloped DNA virus, HSV possesses several typical envelope glycoproteins,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> which play roles in binding to cellular surface receptors and mediating virus entry into cells.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref> A total of 12 glycoproteins have been found in the viral envelope, and at least five glycoproteins, gB, gC, gD, gH, and gL, have been demonstrated to enable interactions with cellular receptors to promote virus entry.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref> Reported data have suggested that gB can bind to heparin sulfate (HS) on the cell surface and couple to paired immunoglobulin‐like type 2 a receptor (PILR)
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> and that gC is also involved in these interactions.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref> Interestingly, after gB binds to its receptor, gD is induced to interact with nectin‐1 and poliovirus‐receptor‐like (PVRL1) on epithelial cells or herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM or TNFRSF14) on immune cells,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref> as gD can interact with HS.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> The binding of gD to receptors also causes the activation of gH/gL and the formation of a complex containing both glycoproteins,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref> followed by increased fusion of the viral and cellular membranes mediated by gB.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">58</xref> During this process, gC can promote virus entry into cells through binding to cellular proteins.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">59</xref> There are also data suggesting that gH/gL plays a more important role in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes and that cellular integrin is a potential receptor for gH/gL.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">60</xref> Endocytic vesicles are also a pathway of viral entry into cells.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">61</xref> These data suggest that HSV uses a more systematic strategy for entry into cells than most viruses. This strategy involves various surface glycoproteins interacting with different cellular receptors. This process implies that the basic idea of blocking virus entry into cells requires a combination of multiple neutralizing antibodies rather than a few antibodies. Furthermore, the recognition of HVEM by gD leads to viral tropism for various innate immune cells expressing HVEM, including DCs, ILCs, macrophages, NK cells, and even CD8 cytotoxic T cells.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">65</xref> Thus, HSV is capable of infecting these cells in epithelial tissue after proliferating in epithelial cells and inducing the innate immune response (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">33</xref> In light of this evidence, it is reasonable to speculate that the innate immune cells that function in phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and the transfer of stimulatory signals are hijacked and probably adopt a heterogeneous phenotype, leading to the transfer of a heterogeneous signal for the stimulation of adaptive immunity.
