<p>Observations from epidemics of HSV infection worldwide suggest a characteristic clinical feature in which a high ratio of serum positivity, which reaches more than 50% in the population, is associated with viral latency in the nervous system, which can lead to viral reactivation in infected individuals.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> This process has been demonstrated to be caused by the latent infection of neurons by HSV.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">30</xref> On the basis of data from studies of HSV pathogenesis, this conclusion is reasonable. The only uncertainty is whether viral latency, which depends on the process of viral entry into neurons from epithelial tissue, might lose control of the activated innate immune response during viral infection or still retain control because of the strong neurotropic characteristic of HSV.

 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0095" ref-type="ref">95</xref> Although there are many examples of neurotropic viruses that have the characteristics of intense neurotropism and a shorter proliferative cycle than HSV, a lower rate of neuron infection was observed for these viruses than for HSV.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">96</xref> In contrast, neuron infection by HSV is observed in 100% of virus‚Äêinfected individuals. Thus, it is logical to infer that HSV possesses the capability to interfere with innate immunity, as innate immunity is activated by viral infection in the epithelial tissue of infected individuals.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">97</xref> Data from epidemics have also suggested that the high rate of serum positivity in the population does not prevent a high incidence of HSV infection; eg, approximately 23 million new cases of HSV2 infection are reported each year.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Thus, the immune response induced in infected individuals, which usually involves specific neutralizing antibody and cytotoxic responses, is not capable of defending against viral reinfection or latent virus reactivation. This viral characteristic is reported to be an immune evasion strategy
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">98</xref> and is probably due to viral interference with the immune system by various encoded viral proteins.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">99</xref> To understand this process, it is necessary to review the details of the interactions between the virus and the innate and adaptive immune systems.
