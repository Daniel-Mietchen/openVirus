<p>Severe CNS consequences from vertical and perinatal transmission were described for the 2005 Reunion Island outbreak and the 2006 outbreak in Bellary, India [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Cardiac defects were identified in almost half of patients and included myocardial hypertrophy, ventricular dysfunction, pericarditis, and coronary artery dilatation [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported three congenital infections that occurred between 12 and 15 weeks of pregnancy during the 2005 Reunion Island outbreak [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While all fetuses died, there were no apparent malformations. Lenglet et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also showed that congenital CHIKV infection could result in miscarriage if it occurred within the first 22 weeks of pregnancy. While they showed that, after 22 weeks, congenital infection did not cause any apparent defects, there was about 50% perinatal infection risk for mothers with viremia at delivery though he did not report significant consequences or sequelae in offspring [
