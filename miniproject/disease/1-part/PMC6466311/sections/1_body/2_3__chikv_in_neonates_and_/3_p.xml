<p>At that time, it was shown that the Reunion Island outbreak strain possessed an alanine to valine substitution at residue 266 in the E1 protein [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes which has significantly increased the geography of the virus [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. However, these studies employed a strain with several other mutations such that the precise role of the A226V mutation in CHIKF cannot be defined.
