<p>Since first reported in Tanzania in 1952, CHIKV has been identified in multiple outbreaks as a cause of dengue-like illness with arthralgia in Africa and febrile hemorrhagic disease in Asia [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Misdiagnosis was common as both viruses occupy the same ecological niches and exhibit similar disease syndromes. In 2005, congenital and perinatal CHIKV infections were reported following delivery to mothers with documented viremia accompanied with symptoms of CHIKF [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both congenital and perinatal CHIKV transmissions are directly associated with infected mothers. In this review, congenital transmission is indicated when viremia and symptoms are present in mothers at least one week to several weeks prior to birth and perinatal transmission is designated when mothers exhibit symptoms with viremia within a few days prior to or following delivery. Pediatric infection is indicated in individuals over two years of age. Here, reports of congenital and perinatal CHIKF are discussed as incidence of these infections, has occurred more frequently and have increased in severity since the 2014 global expansion (

There is a significant need to understand CHIKV pathogenesis in children and neonates because the newly emergent genotypes of CHIKV cause multiple severe manifestations of infection, which can have significant, permanent consequences (
