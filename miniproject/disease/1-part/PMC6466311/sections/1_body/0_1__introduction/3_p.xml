<p>The following review describes the global reemergence and the syndromes of CHIKF in neonates, infants, and children. The various manifestations of CHIKF in infants and children are described and matched to the viral lineage that was documented in the area at the time the disease was described. The data show that certain manifestations of CHIKF occur with specific viral lineages and genetic motifs, which suggest that severe manifestations of CHIKF in the very young may be associated with the emergence of new viral lineages.</p>
