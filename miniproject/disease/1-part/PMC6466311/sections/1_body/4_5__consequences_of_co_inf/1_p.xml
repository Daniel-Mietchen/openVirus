<p>Case reports have indicated that congenital co-infection of CHIKV with another pathogen significantly increases the pathology of infection and, in most cases, leads to miscarriage. However, co-infections in children do not show increased pathology. Following the 2015 CHIKV and Zika outbreaks in Colombia, a 25-week pregnant mother was diagnosed with 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, Zika virus, and CHIKV-WH in her amniotic fluid [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Severe neurological and physical deformities were identified resulting in early termination of pregnancy [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. In March the following year, a female in her second trimester was diagnosed by RT-PCR with a CHIKV-WH-Zika virus co-infection following an abnormal sonogram, which indicated no fetal heartbeat [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. An autopsy of the fetus showed low weight along with renal and placental calcifications [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Conversely, a three-year old patient from New Delhi was co-infected with CHIKV ECSA, dengue, and 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> but fortunately was not ill enough to warrant hospitalization [
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. The strain circulating in the area at the time of this childâ€™s infection contained the E1: K211E and E2: V264A mutations, which were identified in pediatric and neonatal cases with severe cutaneous manifestations. Furthermore, infants infected with both CHIKV-WH and dengue virus during the 2014 outbreak in Colombia did not exhibit more serious manifestations of disease [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In Haiti as well, school-age children co-infected with CHIKV-WH and Zika virus did not exhibit worse disease than singly infected patients [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].
