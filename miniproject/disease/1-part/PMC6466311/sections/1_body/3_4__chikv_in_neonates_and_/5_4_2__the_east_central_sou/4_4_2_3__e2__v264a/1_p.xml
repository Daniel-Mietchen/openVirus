<p>When CHIKV emerged in the Middle East in 2011, it was shown that the ECSA lineage had lost the A226V mutation and instead encoded a change at E2: V264A, which enhanced viral transmission in

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Specifically, encephalitis, hyperpigmentation, and severe cutaneous lesions were commonly seen in neonates and infants [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Other common symptoms included lethargy, poor feeding, and hypotonia [

 <xref rid="B125-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Both patients needed support from a ventilator, but both eventually fully recovered [
 <xref rid="B125-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Reports of novel manifestations of CHIKF in infants and toddlers were also made as children began presenting with Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. While neither the K211E nor the V264A are associated with increased human virulence, other CHIKV isolated during this period in this area possessed mutations located at virulence epitopes [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. While there is likely a correlation, we could not connect these mutations with the isolates described in the above reports.
