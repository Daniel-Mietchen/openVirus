<p>The 2005 outbreak strains of CHIKV in Reunion Island possessed the E1: A266V mutation [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Vector studies showed that this mutation allowed for the virus to be transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. Albopictus</italic>, which led to a significant expansion in virus geography and emergence in temperate regions [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Thus, it was easy to associate this mutation with severe disease, especially when CHIKV with this mutation was isolated from neurologic and severe cases [
 <xref rid="B119-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. This assumption was supported by other CHIKV outbreaks with severe disease that also reported the E1 A226V mutation [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, this mutation has not appropriately been characterized for pathogenesis. Studies aimed at characterizing the A226V mutation in neuroblastoma cells and mice found significant differences in innate immune responses [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B120-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. However, these studies used clinically isolated CHIKV-ECSA with several other known mutations that could also contribute to severe disease [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>].
