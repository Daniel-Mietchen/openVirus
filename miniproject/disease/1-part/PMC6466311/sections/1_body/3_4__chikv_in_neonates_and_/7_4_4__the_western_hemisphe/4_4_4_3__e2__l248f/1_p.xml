<p>Most CHIKV-WH strains analyzed from the 2013â€“2015 outbreak in Colombia have possessed both the K221E and the E2: L248F mutations, which are also present in contemporary ECSA isolated from India and the Middle East. There is no phenotype associated with this mutation and it is unknown if this substitution contributes to viral pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. It is unclear how this substitution would induce a phenotypic change since both amino acids have short non-polar side chains. Nevertheless, CHIKV with this genotype is linked to severe congenital and neonatal CHIKV disease. In Cartagena, Colombia, infants up to 24 months admitted to the emergency department were reported to have febrile illness easily confused with dengue virus [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The mothers presented with mild dengue-like illness, but the newborns presented with maculopapular rash (one with bullous dermatitis) [

 <xref rid="B136-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. The patient fully recovered with no long-term sequelae reported at the six-month follow-up [
