<p>The substitution of a non-polar isoleucine for a non-polar valine with a similar side chain would not likely cause any significant changes in protein structure. However, this mutation occurs within the alphavirus unique domain, which contains a zinc coordination site within a protein fold [
 <xref rid="B140-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Examinations of this domain have indicated that it is necessary for viral replication and mutations in this region are unstable and reduce virulence [
