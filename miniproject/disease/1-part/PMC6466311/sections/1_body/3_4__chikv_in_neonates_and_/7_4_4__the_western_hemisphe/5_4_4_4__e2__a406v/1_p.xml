<p>The 2014 Jamaican CHIKV-WH strain caused excessive deaths, especially in children under four years of age, during the 2014 outbreak [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The death toll in Jamaica was 10 times greater than the reported CHIKV-fatalities of all Western hemisphere reports combined [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Many infants and children presented with fever, arthralgia, and a marked absence of rash or other cutaneous symptoms [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A case report of two vertically infected infants described that both developed poor perfusion leading to ischemic fingers and toes [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In addition, both infants developed significant idiopathic abdominal distension leading to rectal prolapse [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Genetic analysis of this strain showed a valine substitution at residue 406 of the E2 protein [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This is a homologous non-polar:non-polar substitution which should have little, if any, effect on the biology of the virus. Further examination of these isolates will likely yield more potential mutations associated with disease.
