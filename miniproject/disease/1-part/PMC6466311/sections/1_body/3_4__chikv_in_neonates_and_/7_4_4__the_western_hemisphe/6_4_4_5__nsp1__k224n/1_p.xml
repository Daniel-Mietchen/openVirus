<p>In 2015, a three-month old infected with CHIKV was admitted to the emergency room after returning from Honduras with fever, rash, respiratory distress and edema [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. The infant was placed on a ventilator and treated with antibiotics, vasoactives, and fluids with a diagnosis of septic shock secondary to CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. The patient fully recovered and was discharged after 10 days [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. This child was shown to be infected with CHIKV with a K224N substitution of the nsP1 gene. The nsP1 gene in alphaviruses encodes a Rossman-like methyltransferase that is involved in protein capping [

 <xref rid="B138-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. How or if modifications to nsP1 affect CHIKV virulence is unknown, but the substitution of a basic lysine for a polar, amidic asparagine could likely cause significant modifications to the protein structure and function. The K224N mutation is located in a portion of the protein associated with host cell binding [

 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Recent work to identify viral resistance to polyamine depletion in mammalian cells identified a mutation G230R, which was found to enhance viral binding with host cells [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Perhaps this mutation confers increased infectivity in humans.
