<p>Transmembrane CLRs on macrophages include receptors that can recognize mannose, fucose, and 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-glycosamine (macrophage mannose receptor; MMR) or galactose (macrophage galactose-type lectin; MGL) on IAV [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As well, both macrophages and DCs have a receptor dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing integrin (DC-SIGN) for fucosylated and high-mannose oligosaccharides [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Alternative splicing generates several DC-SIGN isoforms, including both membrane-bound and soluble forms [
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. The role of soluble DC-SIGN in immune responses is not well understood. MMR and MGL are type I transmembrane proteins with several CRDsÂ or CRD-like domains, and DC-SIGN is a type II membrane protein with a short amino terminal cytoplasmic tail, a neck region, and a single CRD.
