<p>MBL is a complement protein that is produced and secreted by liver hepatocytes, and it is normally detected in serum [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. MBL monomers of ∼32 kDa oligomerize into trimeric to hexameric structures, with trimeric and tetrameric variants being the most usual physiological forms [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. MBL is highly polymorphic in humans [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] resulting in variations in MBL serum levels [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], with ∼10–30% of the global human population being MBL deficient [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Variations in MBL levels may contribute to individual responses and may partially explain inconsistent conclusions on the MBL role in infections. SP-D and MBL both preferentially bind mannose over the galactose-type sugars found on influenza virus HA and NA [
