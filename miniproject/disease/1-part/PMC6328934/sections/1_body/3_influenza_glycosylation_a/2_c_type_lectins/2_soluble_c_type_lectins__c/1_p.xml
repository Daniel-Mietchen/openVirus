<p>SP-D is well conserved among mammals. It is synthesized by type II pneumocytes and is mainly present in pulmonary surfactant (the lipoprotein substance of the air–liquid interface in the alveoli of the lungs) of mammals including mice, ferrets, and humans [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. It is also present in tear fluid of mice and humans and probably other mammals [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. SP-D monomers (∼130 kDa each) assemble into a 520 kDa tetrameric form, and further oligomerization of up to eight tetramers can occur, depending on species [
