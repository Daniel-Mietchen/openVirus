<p>Studies in mice show a rise in SP-D level in airways during influenza infection with either A(H1N1) or A(H3N2) IAV [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. SP-D knockout mice show enhanced viral replication, lung inflammation, and morbidity after influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100â€“115</xref>], while expression of SP-D variants corrected the defects in A(H3N2) virus clearance and inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. However, mice are not natural hosts for influenza. Ferrets are considered to be a better model for human influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], but the role of SP-D in the ferret model of influenza infection is less clear. Although SP-D appears to reduce replication of highly glycosylated A(H3N2) virus in ferrets [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], it may not be a major factor in this model [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>].
