<p>Ficolins are a family of oligomeric soluble lectins with subunits consisting of CLD and fibrinogen-like domain (FBG) that are capable of interacting with glycans (including N-acetylglucosamine, fucose etc., but not mannose) on a variety of pathogens in both calcium-dependent and -independent ways [
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Like MBL, ficolins initiate lectin-mediated complement activation. In humans, three types of ficolins (L, M, and H) have been described [
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160–163</xref>]. Ficolins L and H are mainly expressed by liver hepatocytes, while ficolin M is expressed by lungs, monocytes, and spleen [
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164–167</xref>]. H-ficolin is also expressed by type II alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167–170</xref>]. H-ficolin in human serum and BALF, and a purified recombinant variant, were shown to bind to IAV, block its HA activity, and inhibit replication of pandemic and seasonal IAVs in cell cultures [
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Other studies have shown that H-ficolin and M-ficolin can inhibit replication of seasonal IAV in human monocytes [

 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Human L-ficolin and an L-ficolin-like molecule in mice were shown to bind HA and NA and inhibit IAV-infection both in tissue culture cells and mice [
