<p>While SP-D is generally anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>,
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], MBL is mainly a pro-inflammatory protein. After binding to pathogens, MBL can activate the lectin complement pathway via MBL-associated serine proteases, leading to complement-mediated lysis and/or opsonophagocytosis [
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. MBL may therefore act through both complement-dependent and independent mechanisms to neutralize influenza virus [

 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>].
