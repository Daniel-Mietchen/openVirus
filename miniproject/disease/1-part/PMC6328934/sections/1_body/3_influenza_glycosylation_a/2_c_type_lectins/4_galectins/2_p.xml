<p>The ability of galectins to bind terminal galactose residues on the surface of viruses (including influenza) and act as PRRs has been recently recognized [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The effect of galectins on influenza disease seems to depend on the type of galectin and on genetic variation as well as the virus strain. Gal-1 has been shown to inhibit A(H1N1), A(H2N2), A(H3N2), A(H5N2), A(H6N1), and A(H7N9) IAVs [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151–153</xref>], while Gal-3 enhanced A(H5N1)-induced pulmonary inflammation [
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] and Gal-9 reduced immune responses to both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) IAVs [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Genetic variants of human Gal-1 that encode higher lectin expression conferred more protection against A(H7N9) IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Intranasal treatment with Gal-1 significantly enhanced survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of A(H1N1) IAV, and GAL-1-knockout mice were more susceptible to infection. Enhancement of galectin expression by IAV–infection was reported for both humans (Gal-9) [
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>] and mice (Gal-1 and Gal-3) [
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152–154</xref>].
