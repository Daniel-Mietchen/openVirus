<p>Changes in NA glycosylation have been less dramatic than in the HA. The 1918 pandemic A(H1N1) IAV NA had four NLG sites within the stalk region (at residues 50, 58, 63, and 68) and three within the globular head (at residues 88, 146, and 235) (

While the stalk region of human IAV N1 maintained a roughly constant number of NLG sites, with sites 50 and 68 being replaced by those at residues 44 and 70, the globular head transiently added NLG at sites 365, 434, and 454. Similarly, the NA from A(H3N2) IAV and IBV have not shown obvious trends for increasing glycan count (
