<p>Contemporary human influenza virus strains have circulated in human populations for many decades, undergoing selection for resistance to human immunity as well as enhanced transmission during that period. Glycosylation of influenza virus HA, especially for A(H3N2) viruses, has been shown to have a major impact on antigenicity and is an important factor in antigenic drift [
