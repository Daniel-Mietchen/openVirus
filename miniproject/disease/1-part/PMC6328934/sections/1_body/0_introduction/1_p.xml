<p>Influenza viruses have caused epidemic and pandemic disease in humans for hundreds of years [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but the disease remains difficult to predict and prevent. Three types of influenza viruses infect humans: A, B, and C. While wild waterfowl and other birds are the primary reservoirs of influenza A virus (IAV) [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], humans are the primary host and reservoir of influenza B and C viruses (IBV and ICV, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition to the primary reservoirs, IAV can infect many other species, including domestic species such as pigs, horses, dogs, and cats [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. IBV and ICV are less broadly infectious but have been shown to infect seals [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], pigs, and dogs [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There are therefore many sources of influenza virus exposed to humans.
