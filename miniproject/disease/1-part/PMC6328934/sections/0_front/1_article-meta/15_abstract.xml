 <p>Influenza viruses cause seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics in humans. The virus’s ability to change its antigenic nature through mutation and recombination, and the difficulty in developing highly effective universal vaccines against it, make it a serious global public health challenge. Influenza virus’s surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are all modified by the host cell’s N-linked glycosylation pathways. Host innate immune responses are the first line of defense against infection, and glycosylation of these major antigens plays an important role in the generation of host innate responses toward the virus. Here, we review the principal findings in the analytical techniques used to study influenza N-linked glycosylation, the evolutionary dynamics of N-linked glycosylation in seasonal versus pandemic and zoonotic strains, its role in host innate immune responses, and the prospects for lectin-based therapies. As the efficiency of innate immune responses is a critical determinant of disease severity and adaptive immunity, the study of influenza glycobiology is of clinical as well as research interest.</p>
