<p>In the near future, more data on the immunogenicity and efficacy role of prime-boost strategies against DENV will be available. Further studies will be addressed to evaluate potential combinations, schedules of immunization, doses, and timeline between them in order to induce the proper immune response combining both arms of the adaptive immunity, but in our opinion favoring the induction of a potent cell-mediated immune response. All the epidemiological studies conducted and analyzed up to date shown that only 3â€“5% of secondary heterologous infections produce severe disease manifestations despite the existence of cross-reactive antibodies with the potential capacity to enhance the infection; therefore, prime-boost strategies can be directed to avoid the severe manifestation of the disease, inducing a polyfunctional cell-mediated immunity and efficient neutralizing antibodies.</p>
