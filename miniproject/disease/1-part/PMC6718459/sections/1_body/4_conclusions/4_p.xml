<p>Taking into account the lessons learned from previous studies conducted with DENV and other human pathogens, complementary prime-boost immunization strategy must be addressed to induce high avidity neutralizing antibodies as well as cytotoxic and IFNÎ³-secreting cells to control circulating microorganism and infected cells. Besides, in the specific case of DENV a good memory B and T-cell responses should be generated, to control the viruses after natural infection. However, factors like immunogens, combinations, order, and time between the immunogens, proper immune responses and others, constitute the main challenges for this strategy.</p>
