<p>The Cuban vaccine candidate based on DIIIC proteins could be a potential solution. These proteins form aggregates or particles after the incubation with a synthetic and immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, named ODN 39M. These particles could present quaternary epitopes in their surface for inducing high avidity neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, these proteins contain the capsid region of DENV, which is one of the main targets of cytotoxic and IFNÎ³-secreting CD4+ T cells, generated during a natural infection. Therefore, combinations of the tetravalent formulation of DIIIC proteins with other replicative or even non-replicative antigens in a prime-boost immunization regimen could be a potential solution for DENV vaccine, which is unsolved today.</p>
