<p>A prime-boost immunization strategy can be defined as a regimen of immunization with the same immunogen during the prime and booster doses or a regimen of priming the immune system with an immunogen and then boosting with a different immunogen. Several factors including the selection of target antigens, platforms of delivery, routes of immunization, doses, adjuvants, the order of antigens injections, and the intervals between different vaccinations influence the outcome of prime-boost immunization approaches (

The main objective in using this approach is to develop greater levels of immunity compared to the immune response obtained by a single vaccination or by inoculations with the same antigen. Additionally, this approach pursues to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, to induce a long-lasting immunity and to induce immunity in mucosal surfaces, in case of some pathogens (
