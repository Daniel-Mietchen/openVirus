<p>Several important issues influence the outcome of prime-boost immunization regimen of a vaccination. One of the most important is the type of vaccine that will be combined to induce the adequate immune response. Subunit vaccines usually induce humoral immune response while recombinant live vectors, DNA vaccines, and live attenuated viruses stimulate the induction of cell-mediated immunity. Moreover, the pre-immunity against vaccine vectors should be taken into account when designing the immunization schedule. The number of doses, time between them, and the route of immunization and adjuvants, could also affect the results (
