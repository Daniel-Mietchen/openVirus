<p>In the case of HIV, many complementary prime-boost immunization strategies have been evaluated and many of them are based on the priming with a live vector and boosting with a protein. However, this approach needs some improvements to achieve a protective efficacy. A potential solution could be the use of better adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity of the protein and to improve the duration of the immune response. However, the prime-boost immunization strategy is still an alternative approach for finding a cure against this important pathogen. For many years, research was focused on the induction of humoral immunity as the main arm of the adaptive immune response for a successful vaccine, but cellular immune responses have emerged as a key arm against the infected cells and viral reservoirs (
