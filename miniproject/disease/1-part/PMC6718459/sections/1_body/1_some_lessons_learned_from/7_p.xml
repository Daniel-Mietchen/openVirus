<p>Complementary prime-boost immunization strategies have also been developed to improve the CD8+ T cell response, priming with DNA, or virus like particles (VLP) and boosting with live-vectors. DNA or VLP are able to drive epitopes into the MHC class I pathway and live-vectors enhance the immune response, expressing large amounts of antigen, and stimulating a pro-inflammatory response. Moreover, the boost with VLP has several advantages vs. the boost with a single recombinant protein: (a) to present envelope antigens in their native form; (b) to facilitate the uptake by professional APCs; (c) to activate the endogenous as well as exogenous pathways leading to the presentation of viral antigens by both MHC class I and class II molecules (
