<p>Simmons et al. published the first complementary prime-boost immunization study in dengue using non-human primates (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). In this case, they evaluated in rhesus macaques three non-replicating vaccine candidates: a DNA plasmid containing the prM and E genes from DENV-2, a recombinant protein based on DIII of DENV-2 E protein linked to the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> maltose-binding protein and an inactivated virus of the same serotype. In this study, animals were immunized with three doses using seven different vaccination regimens and the authors measured the humoral immune response and the protective capacity after the homologous virus challenge. All formulations were immunogenic, but the highest neutralizing antibodies titers were detected in monkeys inoculated with three doses of the combinations DNA + protein or DNA + inactivated virus. A similar response was observed in the group receiving three doses of the protein and in animals immunized with three doses of inactivated virus. Unfortunately, despite the good humoral immune response induced in all groups of the study, protection was observed only in animals from the group that received the purified inactivated virus (
