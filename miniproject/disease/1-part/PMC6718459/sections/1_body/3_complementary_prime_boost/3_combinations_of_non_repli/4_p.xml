<p>An additional study conducted in monkeys (rhesus macaques) combined a recombinant protein that contained a maximum of 60 copies of the DIII of DENV-2 on a multimeric scaffold of 
 <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</italic> E2 (simulating to a VLP) and a DNA plasmid for expressing the DIII portion of the same virus serotype (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Booth antigens were delivered simultaneously via intramuscular injection (protein) and gene gun. The recombinant protein elicited a robust antibody response to DENV2, with neutralizing antibody responses after the first immunization and reaching high titers following the second and final boosters. Five weeks after the final dose animals were challenged with DENV2. All vaccinated macaques were protected from detectable viremia by infectious assay, while naïve animals had detectable viremia for 2–7 days post-challenge. Although the viral genome was amplified in all animals, no anamnestic antibody response was detected in vaccinated monkeys. This study constitutes an important example of the protective role of neutralizing antibodies elicited against DIII and describes an alternative approach to live-attenuated viruses for potential generation of antibodies against tertiary and/or quaternary epitopes.
