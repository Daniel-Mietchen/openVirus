<p>Experimental prime-boost immunization strategies have been evaluated by a Cuban group that developed a vaccine candidate against DENV based on the DIII of E protein and also the capsid protein of this pathogen. However, in all studies conducted by this group in monkeys, animals have been experimentally infected with DENV. The first study was reported by Valdés et al. combining a non-replicative vaccine candidate with an infective DENV-2. In this experiment, authors primed monkeys with four doses of the recombinant protein PD5 (obtained by the fusion of DIII of the DENV-2 E protein to the C-terminus of protein P64k from 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>) that it was formulated in alum and with the capsular polysaccharide A (CPS-A) from 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> too. Forty-five days after the last immunization animals were infected with a replicative DENV-2 (booster dose), simulating a live-attenuated virus. The results showed a significant increase of anti-DENV-2 antibody response measured after virus inoculation compared with the response measured in non-primed monkeys. In addition, the antibody response was similar to those measured in monkeys inoculated with two doses of the infective virus. In the same study a second group of monkeys was firstly inoculated with one dose of the infective DENV-2 (prime) and 5 months later animals were boosted with one dose of the PD5 formulation. The animals elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies, which were still detectable for more than 1 year. Additionally, the authors observed that the cellular immune response generated by DENV-2 and measured as IFNγ-secreting cells, was successfully recalled after the recombinant protein administration. Despite the use of an infective virus, this study demonstrated—for the first time—the potential advantage of a prime-boost immunization strategy based on the combination of recombinant proteins and live-attenuated viruses (
