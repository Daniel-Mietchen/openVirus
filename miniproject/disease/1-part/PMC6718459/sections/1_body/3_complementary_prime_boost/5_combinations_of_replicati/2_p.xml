<p>Another example of the combination of replicative immunogens in prime-boost immunization regimens was the study conducted to investigate the effect of the pre-existing immunity to DENV or YFV on the immunogenicity of a tetravalent live-attenuated vaccine in humans (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). In this case, three groups of participants previously inoculated with a monovalent dengue vaccine from DENV-1 or DENV-2 or the yellow fever vaccine were boosted with Dengvaxia®. The results showed that the pre-immune status increased the seroconversion rate and the IFNγ-producing T-cell helper response, upon a single injection with the tetravalent dengue vaccine, particularly against serotypes 1 and 2 (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Furthermore, viremia in individuals that were primed with the monovalent DENV vaccine was lower than those measured in the group receiving the yellow fever vaccine and in the naïve group. These results suggest that the antibody response generated against DENV-1 or DENV-2 successfully control the viremia produced by the tetravalent vaccine. Additionally, the immune response generated by the non-structural protein from YFV play a role controlling the viremia too. However, the small sample size included in this study constituted a limiting factor in the interpretation of the results; therefore, this study was considered completely descriptive.
