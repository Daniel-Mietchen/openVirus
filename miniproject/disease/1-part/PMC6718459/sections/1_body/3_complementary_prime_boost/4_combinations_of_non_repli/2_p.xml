<p>Another variant used has been the replacement of live-attenuated vaccine by replicative vectors. In this sense, replicative viral vectors, such as those based on adenoviruses or virus replicon particles (VRPs) have demonstrated their usefulness (

 <italic>in situ</italic> after immunization, thereby facilitating the induction of strong T-cell responses, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These types of responses are desirable for intracellular and highly variable pathogens and for targeting pathogen-infected cells. Moreover, T-cell responses can target epitopes that are conserved between different strains of the same pathogen (
