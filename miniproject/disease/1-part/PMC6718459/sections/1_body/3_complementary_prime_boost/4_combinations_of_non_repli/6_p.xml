<p>A similar combination was used by George et al. (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). These authors used a prime-boost immunization strategy in mice combining three variants of vaccine candidates: a DNA plasmid, a recombinant adenovirus and a recombinant vaccinia virus. All constructions included the E protein from DENV-2 as immunogen. Animals were primary immunized with each variant and 7 days after, they were boosted with one of the other two antigens. In general, the highest levels in sera of anti-E-specific IgG were observed in mice boosted with vaccinia virus. However, when vaccinia virus was used for priming the levels of anti-E antibodies rapidly decreased. On the other hand, when the cytokines production by CD4+ T cells was measured after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with the E antigen, the results showed a different behavior. Animals from the group primed with the adenovirus and boosted with the DNA plasmid showed the highest secretion levels of IL-2 and IFNÎ³. In addition, when the CD8+ T cell response was measured by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> CTL killing activity, the group primed with the vaccinia virus and boosted with the DNA plasmid showed the highest response (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). These results highlight that the pattern of immune response depends on the antigens and also on the order used during the prime-boost immunization strategy. More than one combination must be evaluated to select the best one to induce the proper immune response.
