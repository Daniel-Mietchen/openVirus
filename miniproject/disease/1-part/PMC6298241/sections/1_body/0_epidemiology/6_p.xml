<p>The seasonality of KD, with winter peaks in Japan and winter-spring predominance in the US and many other temperate areas, is highly suggestive of a viral (probably respiratory viral) etiology (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Some reports have suggested summer and winter peaks (Beijing and Shanghai), or spring peaks (Sichuan and Hong Kong), while no clear seasonality has been seen in Hawaii (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and winter predominance was reported from at least some Southern Hemisphere countries. Despite the observed seasonality, in most areas sporadic cases are recognized throughout the year, contrasting somewhat with the usual patterns commonly seen with many highly transmissible respiratory viral illnesses. Recurrent KD is defined as a new illness that meets KD criteria beginning at least 3-months and usually within 2 years after an initial episode of KD, when levels of inflammatory markers have completely normalized. Recurrence occurs in about 1% or fewer of all KD patients, and in up to 3% of those of Asian ethnicity (
