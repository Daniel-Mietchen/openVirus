<p>More than 15,979 cases of KD were reported in Japan in 2015, with local clusters occurring commonly, unlike the nationwide epidemics that occurred in 1979, 1982, and 1985â€“86 (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In those epidemics, there appeared to be wave-like spread from one prefecture to an adjacent one, a pattern very similar to the spread of specific viral illnesses like measles, for example, in Japan, thus strongly supporting an infectious etiology of KD. In Hawaii, with its complex multi-racial and multi-ethnic population, the overall annual KD incidence is about 50.4/100,000 &lt; 5 y/o; for Japanese ethnic children in Hawaii, the rate is about 210.5 and for Caucasians about 13.7, with intermediate rates for children of native Hawaiian, Chinese, Filipino and other Asian ancestries (
