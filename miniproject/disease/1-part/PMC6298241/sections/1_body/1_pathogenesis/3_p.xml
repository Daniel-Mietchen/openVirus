<p>One theory presently favored by some is that KD can result from infection with any of a wide range of infectious agents in a genetically predisposed host, and some investigators propose an immune defect in KD children. We believe that these theories fail to explain epidemiologic findings in KD. If multiple agents can cause KD, epidemics would either not be observed or specific known infectious agents would be identified by careful epidemiologic study as being associated with the epidemics. In fact, there has been an absence of association of KD with known infectious agents during epidemics and outbreaks despite careful study by epidemiologists in Japan, in the US at the Centers for Disease Control, and in other nations (

Because the vast majority of patients do not develop other health problems following KD, an immune defect seems highly unlikely.
