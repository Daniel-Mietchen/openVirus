<p>We discovered an oligoclonal IgA response in the coronary arteries of children who died from KD, and we made “first generation” KD synthetic antibodies using oligoclonal IgA heavy chains with random light chains (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These “first generation” antibodies detected antigen residing in ciliated bronchial epithelium in KD lung and in a subset of macrophages in KD but not in infant control tissues by immunohistochemistry; the antigen in lung localized to intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies that were identified using stains for protein and for RNA (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The inclusion bodies were identified in children from the US and Japan using a single monoclonal antibody, strongly suggesting a single infectious agent as the cause (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The inclusion bodies could also be identified in some KD children who died as late as months to years after onset (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Further investigations of acute phase KD lung samples showed upregulation of interferon pathway genes and virus-like particles in close proximity to the inclusion bodies by transmission electron microscopy (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, these antibodies did not identify the specific antigen by Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays, likely because of a lack of cognate heavy and light chain partners in these “first generation” antibodies. This problem has been recently overcome by preparing “second generation” antibodies from acute KD peripheral blood plasmablasts, which include cognate light and heavy chain partners and show great promise in identifying specific antigen (
