<p>The most common clinical signs of EIV infection in equids are fever, lethargy, anorexia, nasal discharge, and a nonproductive dry cough (

 </xref>). Along with loss of life, the rest period required for equine recovery can cause economic hardship in areas where people rely on equids for income, such as for transportation or milk. EIV outbreaks also can disrupt economic drivers, such as the horse racing and show industries. EIV often is overlooked as a disease threat outside of equine communities, despite its known historical commercial importance and current zoonotic potential.
