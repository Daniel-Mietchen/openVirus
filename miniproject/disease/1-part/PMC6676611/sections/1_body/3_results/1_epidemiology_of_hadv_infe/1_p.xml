<p id="Par24">This study reviewed the medical records of 1717 virologically-confirmed HAdV-infected patients. In brief, all enrolled patient should have complete physical examination record and virological workup. All cases in this cohort had HAdV isolated from viral culture from respiratory samples, including (throat swab, nasal swab, or nasopharyngeal aspirates); cases with prolonged fever or severe enough to visit ER, or warranting hospitalization received further investigation, including urine analysis, blood culture, or bacterial culture from sterile or non-sterile sites. Blood culture results were evaluated for all febrile hospitalized children in order to exclude occult bacteremia. Isolation of other respiratory pathogens including bacteria, or viruses other than HAdV was defined as co-infection. However, patients with severe definite bacterial infection, including bacteremia and urinary tract infection were excluded from this cohort. Fifty-three adult patients were also excluded. Analysis of the monthly distribution of HAdV infection showed that HAdV circulated year-round, but there were two major HAdV outbreaks during the study period (Fig.

The second wave comprised 510 patients, and occurred between week 6 and week 46 of 2014. The HAdV-positive rate was defined as the number of HAdV-positive respiratory specimens/total number of respiratory specimens X100. The baseline HAdV-positive rate was 5.45% ± 4.53% (range 0–26.3%) during 2010–2015 except for the period during the epidemics. The mean HAdV-positive rates during these two epidemics were 36.2% in 2011 and 11.3% in 2014, which were significantly higher than the non-outbreak period (
