<p id="Par34">As well as viral genomic characteristics, host susceptibility is a major risk factor for severe HAdV infection. The neurological disease, chronic lung disease, and airway anomalies were reported to be related to HAdV pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Neurological disease was particularly associated with severe pneumonia caused by HAdV3 and 7 during the 2011 epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Risk factors of hospitalization, including neurologic, respiratory, and metabolic abnormalities, were revealed to be associated with more severe HAdV disease requiring hospitalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although we did not sub-analyze the underlying disease by disease categories, underlying disease for HAdV associated hospitalization in both epidemics was demonstrated.
