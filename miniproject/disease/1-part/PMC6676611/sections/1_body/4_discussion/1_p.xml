<p id="Par32">In this study, we compared the demographics, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of hospitalization and pneumonia in patients from the 2011 and 2014 adenovirus epidemics in southern Taiwan. Genotype 2, 3 and 7 accounted for the majority of infections in the 2011 epidemic. Although genotype 3 and 7 sustained to contribute to the 2014 epidemic, these genotypes comprised &lt; 50% of cases in the 2014 epidemic. The surge of other genotypes, including 1, 4 and 6 constituted the other half of genotypes found in the 2014 epidemic. In addition to genotype, there were also differences in the clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and hospitalization between the two epidemics. Our analysis showed that the 2011 epidemic was mainly caused by HAdV3 and HAdV7, with a higher prevalence of HAdV3 compared to HAdV7 (64.7% vs. 16.7%). This finding was consistent with other epidemiological reports, showing co-circulation of HAdV3 and HAdV7 in the 2011 epidemic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The re-emergence of HAdV-7 during 2011 epidemic in Taiwan paralleled the re-emergence of HAdV-7 in southern China, suggesting possible viral spreading through a nearby country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although HAV55 and HAdV11 were also reported to be other important emergent genotypes in immunocompetent adults with severe pneumonia in China, we did not identify any HAdV55 or HAdV11 in this study [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Continuous epidemiological surveillance is still needed to monitor dynamic changes of HAdV serotypes.
