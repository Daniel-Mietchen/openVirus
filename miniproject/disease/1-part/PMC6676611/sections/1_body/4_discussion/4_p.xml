<p id="Par35">Our data showed that in both epidemics, hospitalized patients had higher WBC counts and CRP levels compared with non-hospitalized patients. Leukocytosis and elevated CRP levels are common in HAdV infection, even without superimposed bacterial infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, leukocytosis of HAdV infection could be genotype-specific, and also related to the stage of clinical infection. Lin et al. had reported that leukocytosis (WBC &gt; 15,000/mm3) was more common in HAdV2 infection, whereas leukopenia (WBC &lt; 5000/mm3) was more common in HAdV7 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Leukocytosis seems to occur in the early course of infection, whereas leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were shown to correlate with progression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This could also explain some reports showing leukocytosis as the major laboratory finding in HAdV infection, while other studies reported leukopenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In our study, we demonstrated that elevation of CRP values was an independent predictor of hospitalization in both epidemics. Previous data suggested that serum CRP levels were a better predictor of bacterial infection in febrile children compared to WBC, ANC or ABC counts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Elevated CRP levels in children with HAdV infection in the absence of secondary bacterial infection indicated that HAdV triggered an inflammatory host response similar to that of a bacterial infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, the elevation of CRP could be serotype-specific, since children infected with HAdV3 had higher CRP values compared to children infected with other genotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
