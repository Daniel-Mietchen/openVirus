<p id="Par33">The clinical presentations varied among different HAdV serotypes. Lin et al. reported that HAdV3 more likely to cause upper respiratory tract infections, while HAdV7 tends to cause lower respiratory tract infections and a more severe clinical course, including longer duration of fever and hospital stay, and need for intensive care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Many other reports also demonstrated that infection with HAdV7 was more likely to be associated pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the contrary, we found that the 2014 epidemic had a higher rate of HAdV7 compared to the 2011 epidemic (21.0% vs. 16.7%), but had a lower rate of pneumonia (1.6% vs. 3.3%). Also, when we pooled these two epidemics into analysis, we found that infection with genotype 7 was not statistically associated with pneumonia. HAdV4 caused an epidemic outbreak of acute respiratory disease (ARD) in military recruits in United States and may also result in severe pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. HAdV1 was also reported to cause severe pneumonia in immunocompetent patients in French intensive care unit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our study showed that although HAdV1 and HAdV4 were two of the emerging genotypes in the 2014 epidemic, they were not associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection (four pneumonia cases caused by HAdV1; one pneumonia case caused by HAdV4). It is therefore possible that there may have some genomic change within the same HAdV genotype, resulting in different invasiveness and virulence. Sub-serotype or phylogenetic analysis is needed for further study of serotype-specific manifestation.
