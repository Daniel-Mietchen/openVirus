<p id="Par37">As discussed by Chen et al. study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], seven species of adenovirus (Aâ€“G), including more than 79 genotypes, have been defined using a new characteristic based on genomics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Specific genotypes are often associated with particular clinical manifestations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. HAdV species B contains several types related to acute respiratory diseases (ARD), can be further classified into two subtypes B1 and B2 based on their tissue tropism. HAdV types 3 and 7 of species B are most commonly detected in patients with respiratory infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Since 2006, there are the outbreaks and severe respiratory disease worldwide, which were caused by HAdV14p1 and HAdV55 of species B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These two strains have the potential to extensively disseminate and cause severe epidemics due to the lack of herd immunity and their ability to cause more severe ARD than other adenoviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the present study, we showed that the 2011 and 2014 HAdV epidemics in Taiwan were caused by different HAdV genotypes. In addition, hospitalized patients had higher WBC and CRP levels than non-hospitalized patients. There is a need for a licensed HAdV vaccine for the general population, as the only approved live oral vaccine (comprising HAdV types 4 and 7) has only been used in the US military [
