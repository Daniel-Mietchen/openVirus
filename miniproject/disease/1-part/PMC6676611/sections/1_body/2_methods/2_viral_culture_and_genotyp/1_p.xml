<p id="Par22">Throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates were collected in viral transport medium, and inoculated into tubes containing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, Vero cells, A549 cells or rhabdomyosarcoma cells within 24 h of collection. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and viral cytopathic effect was evaluated daily for a minimum of 14 days. HAdV infection was confirmed with immunofluorescent assays using D
 <sup>3</sup> Ultra DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) respiratory virus screening and identification kit (Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH, USA). After immunofluorescent confirmation of HAdV infection, the cell culture lysate were stored at − 70 °C for further genotype determination. Viral DNA was extracted from 200 μL of the original adenovirus-positive specimen using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 1004 bp fragment of the hexon gene was PCR-amplified from 5 μL of eluted samples using primers AdTU7 (5′-GCCACCTTCTTCCCCATGGC-3′) and AdTU4′ (5′-GTAGCGTTGCCGGCCGAGAA-3′). These amplicons were then sequenced on a 3730 xl DNA Analyzer (Applied BioSystems). The forward and reverse sequences were combined using BioEdit (Ibis Therapeutics) and sequence alignment was performed with 51 previously characterized prototype viruses, as well as other characterized genotypes from GenBank and our internal sequence collection. A good genotype matche was defined as specimens which resulted in &gt; 90% alignment identify score.
