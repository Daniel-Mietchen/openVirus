<p>Two studies have provided evidence that a DNA vaccine may be a promising approach against WEEV infections. The first study developed a plasmid, pVHX-6, containing the C-E3-E2-6K-E1 of WEEV strain 71V-1658 [

Four doses of pVHX-6 delivered intra-muscular with electroporation (IM-EP) and resulted in elevated cytotoxic T cell activity and complete protection against a homologous challenge. However, the level of protection dropped to 50â€“62% when immunized mice were challenged with heterologous WEEV strains (CBA87 or Fleming). In another study, plasmids were constructed from different portions of the structural genes from pVHX-6 (i.e., pE3-E2-6K-E1, pE3-E2, or p6K-E1) and analyzed for protection against a WEEV challenge [
 <xref rid="B115-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In the absence of E1, the vaccine pE3-E2 failed to protect against a homologous challenge, but plasmids p6K-E1 and pE3-E2-6K-E1, which included E1, yielded 100% survival. Mice immunized with pE3-E2-6K-E1 were mostly protected against a heterologous challenge, but other vaccines provided limited protection.
