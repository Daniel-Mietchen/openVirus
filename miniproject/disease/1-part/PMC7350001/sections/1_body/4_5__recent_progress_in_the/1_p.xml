<p>DNA vaccinations routinely deliver a DNA plasmid encoding one or more antigens to induce an immune response. DNA vaccinations have many advantages: ability to break the cold chain, easy manipulation, large-scale manufacturing, low cost, molecular stability, and no live components [
 <xref rid="B95-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Breaking the cold chain is particularly important for field deployment and delivery in remote tropical areas. DNA vaccines may include adjuvants to stimulate the immune system and molecules to assist in cell targeting and entry. The vector design has been improved by reducing the size of bacterial backbone regions, such as in the use of bacterial RNA-based (antibiotic free) markers [

 <xref rid="B98-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Strategies to optimize the expression of antigens include the addition of an optimal promoter, immunostimulatory sequences, localization and secretory signals, Kozak sequence, and codon optimization [

Drawbacks of DNA vaccines include the potential for autoimmune responses by eliciting anti-DNA antibodies, the unlikely integration into the hostâ€™s genome, extraneous mutations, and low immunogenicity, often requiring delivery by electroporation, the use of immunostimulatory adjuvants, multiple doses, and large amounts of DNA [
