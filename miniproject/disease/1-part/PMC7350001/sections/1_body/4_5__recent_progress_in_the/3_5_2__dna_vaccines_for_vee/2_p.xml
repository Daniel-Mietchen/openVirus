<p>For plasmid DNA vaccines, sequences from TC-83 have also been explored. In one study, mice were immunized with a plasmid DNA vaccine composed in part of E3-E2-6K of TC-83 and boosted with the earlier described adenovirus vector RAd/VEEV#3 vaccine to improve immunogenicity [

This study found 83% protection against a homologous challenge but failed to assess a heterologous challenge and used four doses, which is suboptimal for a rapid response. A lack of a heterologous challenge is a major limitation in most plasmid DNA VEEV vaccine studies. In contrast, a DNA-launched live-attenuated vaccine of VEEV was created by creating a DNA plasmid encoding the complete genomic RNA of TC-83 CMV promoter and induced 100% protection against a heterologous challenge after a single dose [
