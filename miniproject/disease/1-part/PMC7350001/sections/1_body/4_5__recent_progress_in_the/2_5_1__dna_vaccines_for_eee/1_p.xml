<p>One recent study described the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine targeting EEEV [
 <xref rid="B103-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The pcDNA3.1-C-E vaccine included the structural genes C-E3-E2-6K-E1 of EEEV with expression facilitated by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The pCDNA3.1-C-E vaccine induced antiviral cytokines, high levels of neutralizing antibodies, and T cell responses, but the EEEV challenge was not assessed. Future studies should assess the ability of pcDNA3.1-C-E to protect against EEEV challenges in an animal model.
