<p>One trivalent DNA vaccine, 3-EEV, comprised E3-E2-6K-E1 from EEEV strain FL91-4679, VEEV strain Trinidad donkey, and WEEV strain CBA87 [
 <xref rid="B116-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The 3-EEV vaccine elicited antibody responses against all three targets and induced complete protection against homologous EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV challenges. A challenge with a heterologous strain was not tested, but the potential for heterologous protection was assessed by measuring neutralization activity against a panel of heterologous strains. Altogether, only three of 13 DNA vaccine studies assessed protection against a heterologous challenge; easily assessing the breadth of DNA vaccines is an obstacle in this field.
