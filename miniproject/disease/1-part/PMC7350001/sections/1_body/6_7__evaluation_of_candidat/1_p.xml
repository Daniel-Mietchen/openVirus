<p>Vaccine antigens should elicit robust cross-reactive responses against circulating viruses. Generally, antigen selection is based on well-known virulence factors or computational discovery and assessed by in vitro and in vivo methods [

Although this approach often provides protection against a homologous challenge, heterologous protection may be weak, because viral diversity was not considered.
