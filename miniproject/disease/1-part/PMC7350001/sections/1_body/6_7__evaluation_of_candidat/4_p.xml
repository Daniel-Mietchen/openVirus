<p>The coverage function decreased as more natural viral sequences were included because of increased genetic diversity among variants. Ideally, as in the case of a perfectly conserved viral protein, the fraction of 9-mers matched would remain high as more natural sequences were considered. In practice, the function decreased in a stepwise manner, reflecting the within-clade relatedness of the variants. This phenomenon is related to the known multimodal distribution of pairwise intersequence differences in the viral taxa, reflecting strains and serotypes within a viral species [
 <xref rid="B130-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Cases where a vaccine candidate matches a few heterologous 9-mers in other viral species appear as lines at or near zero over the entire set of natural sequences. A rule of thumb for comparing the distributions is to consider the area under each line and taking as optimal the distribution that includes the greatest area and, hence, the greatest coverage of vaccine-matched 9-mers among known natural sequence variants.
