<p>For encephalitic Alphaviruses, coverage of the trivalent 3-EEV vaccine is depicted by a thin black line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00273-f003">Figure 3</xref>). It shows greater coverage for EEEV than the other vaccine candidates and slightly lower coverage for VEEV. This suggests a modified trivalent Alphavirus vaccine design may enable more broadly protective cross-reactivity.
