<p>We represent the coverage of potential linear epitopes as a form of cumulative distribution function, in which the proportion of vaccine-matched 9-mers varies as a function of the proportion of natural sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00273-f003">Figure 3</xref>). For the capsid, E3, and E1, the VEEV vaccine candidates had similar coverage, but for E2 and 6K, vaccines derived from ZPC738 covered VEEV isolates at a slightly higher level compared to others. No single WEEV vaccine candidate covered all five structural polyproteins better than the others. Vaccines derived from North American EEEV covered EEEV isolates at a higher level than those derived from South American Madariaga forms. Overall, no candidate vaccine could cover all of the natural sequences at a level near 100% of the 9-mers.
