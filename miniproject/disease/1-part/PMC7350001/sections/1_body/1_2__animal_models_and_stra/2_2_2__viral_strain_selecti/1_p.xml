<p>Only a few challenge strains can feasibly be used when determining vaccine efficacy. Rationale for strain selection can depend on access to select-agent facilities (some strains are select agents; some are not) or access to BSL-3 laboratories (some BSL-2 vaccine strains of VEEV are available). Viral strains or isolates can be derived from human patient samples, equids, rodents, or mosquitos and may be selected based on the type of experiment being conducted. Rusnak et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] described criteria for VEEV strain selection and propagation in detail based on the US Food and Drug Administration Animal Rule guidelines, Department of Defense vaccine requirements, strain availability, and experience generating challenge agents within the Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group. Similar criteria were described by Wolfe et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] for trivalent vaccine candidates: (1) strains from human clinical cases or those known to be capable of causing human disease, (2) strains with a low and well-characterized passage-history and that have been sequenced periodically to identify any pertinent changes to the genome or individual genes during cell passages in mammalian or insect cells [
 <xref rid="B47-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], (3) relevant strains that are currently circulating, (4) strains that mimic a disease state in humans, (5) strains that are accessible to laboratories authorized to work with select agents, and (6) a panel of strains to test the breadth of protection [

 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Frequently used strains include VEEV Trinidad donkey, EEEV FL93-939, WEEV 71V-1658, and WEEV CBA-87.
