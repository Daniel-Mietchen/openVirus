<p>The usefulness of animal models to study any infectious disease relies on the ability of the model to reproduce characteristics of human disease. Readers are directed to an in-depth review describing animal models of Alphavirus encephalitis [
 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Briefly, horses are natural hosts and highly susceptible to epizootic strains, but they are unsuitable for routine vaccine testing due to their size, the veterinary expertise required for their use in experimental studies, and cost. Hamsters, rabbits, and guinea pigs have been used to a lesser extent. Of these animals, hamsters are the best-described and develop high titers of EEEV and WEEV in the brain, but after a subcutaneous infection with VEEV, some hamsters succumb to infection before central nervous system disease develops [

Mouse models have been studied extensively and can be used to study biodefense (aerosol infection) and mosquito transmission (subcutaneous infection). Although the subcutaneous route is traditionally administered via needle-inoculation, recent evidence from other viruses has suggested that the infection from a mosquito bite differs from a needle-inoculation in key features such as tissue tropism and replication kinetics [
 <xref rid="B45-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Most nonhuman primate studies have used cynomolgus macaques, which are anatomically and immunologically similar to humans and susceptible to various routes of infection, including subcutaneous injection and exposure to aerosols.
