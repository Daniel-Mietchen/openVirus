<p>The Vesicular stomatitis virus can induce strong cellular and humoral immune responses and has been used as a vector to protect against several viral infections [

 <xref rid="B75-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Like the rISFV-VEEV vaccine, rVSIV-VEEV conferred 100% protection against a homologous challenge in a mouse model. Evaluating the ultimate utility of this vaccine will require further testing with heterologous challenge strains: a common theme for most vaccines.
