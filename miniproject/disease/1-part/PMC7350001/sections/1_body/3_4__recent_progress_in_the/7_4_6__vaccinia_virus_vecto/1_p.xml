<p>Modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) is a nonreplicating vector that has been extensively used to deliver antigens and is approved for use in a smallpox vaccine licensed in Canada and Europe [
 <xref rid="B91-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], demonstrating the utility of this vector. In one study, MVA-BN was used to deliver E3-E2-6K-E1 of EEEV, VEEV, or WEEV in a monovalent vaccine, as a mixture of all three monovalent vaccines, or in a trivalent formulation [
 <xref rid="B81-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The mixture of the three vaccines and the trivalent formulation are among the few viral vector vaccines that can provide simultaneous protection against EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV. The mixture and trivalent formulations provided significantly higher levels of protection compared to the empty vector as a control. Although immunization with the mixture resulted in a numerically higher percentage of survival for EEEV and WEEV challenges and protected equally well against VEEV challenge compared to the trivalent formulation, either the authors did not statistically compare the vaccinations against each other or they were not statistically significant. These data warrant further analyses to determine whether a single trivalent vaccine or a mixture of monovalent vaccines provides superior cross-protection against encephalitic Alphaviruses.
