<p>Four candidate Sindbis viral vaccines: SIN-83, SAAR/TRD, SIN/TRD, and SIN/ZPC have been developed against VEEV. SIN-83 was constructed using structural genes C-E3-E2-6K-E1 from the VEEV vaccine strain TC-83 [

Mice immunized with SIN-83 developed neutralizing antibodies at slightly lower titers than TC-83 vaccination but did not cause detectable disease in mice. The SIN-83 vaccination completely protected against the intranasal and subcutaneous and partially protected against the intracerebral challenge with heterologous VEEV strain ZPC 738 [

 <xref rid="B79-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Additional chimeric vaccines SAAR/TRD and SIN/TRD expressing structural proteins from Trinidad donkey and SIN/ZPC-expressing structural proteins from ZPC 738 were created [

Safety is a concern with any live vaccine, and these vaccines are no exception. In a six-day-old mouse model of VEEV central nervous system infection, vaccination with the standard vaccine, TC-83, was lethal—100% of the vaccinated mouse pups died; however, intermediate survival (60–80%) was observed for vaccination with SAAR/TRD, SIN/TRD, or SIN/ZPC, and all mice survived vaccination with SIN-83 [
