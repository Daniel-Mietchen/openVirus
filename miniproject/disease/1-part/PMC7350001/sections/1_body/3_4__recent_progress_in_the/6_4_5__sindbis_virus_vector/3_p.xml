<p>The Sindbis virus has also been used as a vector for the delivery of WEEV structural proteins. Three vaccine candidates were constructed against WEEV, including SIN/CO92, SIN/SIN/McM, and SIN/EEE/McM [
 <xref rid="B80-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. After a challenge with WEEV strain McMillan, 40â€“100% of mice vaccinated with SIN/CO92 survived, depending on the vaccine dose. In contrast, all mice vaccinated with SIN/SIN/McM or SIN/EEE/McM survived. This provides another example of improved postchallenge survival when mice are immunized with structural proteins derived from the same strain that is used for challenge.
