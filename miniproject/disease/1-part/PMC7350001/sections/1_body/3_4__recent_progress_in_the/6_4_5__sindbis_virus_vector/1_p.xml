<p>The Sindbis virus (SIN) is an Alphavirus belonging to the WEEV complex that was first isolated from mosquitoes in Egypt and is one of the least pathogenic Alphaviruses known [
 <xref rid="B90-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Chimeric SIN/EEEV, SIN/VEEV, and SIN/WEEV viruses have been investigated for use as live virus vaccines. In one study, Sindbis virus was used for the nonstructural genes, and the EEEV structural genes C-E3-E2-6K-E1 were derived from North American (NA) strain FL93-939 to create the vaccine SIN/NAEEEV [
 <xref rid="B76-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. After immunization with SIN/NAEEEV, mice developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Following challenge with FL93-939, 80â€“100% of mice vaccinated with SIN/NAEEV survived, depending on the vaccine dose. This vaccine was also evaluated in a cynomolgus macaque model with a lethal EEEV aerosol challenge [
