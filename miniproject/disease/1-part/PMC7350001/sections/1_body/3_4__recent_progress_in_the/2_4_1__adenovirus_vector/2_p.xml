<p>The human adenovirus type 5 was also used to deliver WEEV antigens. Two studies evaluated an adenovirus vector producing E3-E2-6K-E1 (Ad5-WEEV) from the WEEV strain 71V-1658 [

In a follow-up study, a single-dose of Ad5-WEEV provided complete protection against a homologous challenge and partial-to-complete protection against a heterologous WEEV challenge. To determine if the adenovirus vector delivery of E1 alone could provide protection against WEEV, Ad5-E1 was constructed using the sequence of 6K-E1 of 71V-1658 [
 <xref rid="B72-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. A single-dose of Ad5-E1 provided complete protection against a homologous challenge, while a heterologous challenge resulted in no-to-complete protection depending on the number of days that the challenge occurred postvaccination. Overall, the robustness of adenovirus-vectored vaccines needs improvement to protect against heterologous strains.
