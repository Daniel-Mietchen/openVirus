<p>Adenovirus vectors are highly immunogenic, effective carriers of foreign antigens [
 <xref rid="B82-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and have been explored for protection against VEEV and WEEV in mouse models. The human type 5 adenovirus was used to produce E3-E2-6K of the VEEV strain TC-83 in the RAd/VEEV#3 vaccine [
 <xref rid="B67-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. For vaccines delivering TC-83 genes, a challenge with Trinidad donkey was considered a homologous strain. An immune response to a homologous challenge, which matches the vaccine strain, is less of an accomplishment than to heterologous challenge, which may indicate cross-protective responses. RAd/VEEV#3 provided almost complete protection (90%) against a homologous challenge with Trinidad donkey, but when immunized mice were challenged with heterologous strains, a variable protection (50â€“100%) was observed. RAd/VEEV#3 was further explored with the coadministration of CpG [
 <xref rid="B68-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], but CpG adjuvantation did not provide significantly better protection than RAd/VEEV#3 alone and resulted in antibody responses directed against the adenovirus vector. The E3-E2-6K sequence was codon optimized for expression in a mammalian host in the RAd/VEEV#3-CO vaccine, which provided significantly better protection against homologous challenge than the nonoptimized vaccine [
