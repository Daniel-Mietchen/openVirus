<p>Viral-vectored vaccines can express heterologous (different strain of the same virus) antigens and induce strong antigen-specific immune responses. A Vaccinia virus expressing a hepatitis B antigen was the first viral vector developed [

 <xref rid="B66-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Many viral vectors are considered live vaccines, but replication is often deficient or attenuated to increase safety; however, a reversion to virulence is often a concern. Thus, the use of safe viral vectors to deliver structural genes has gained interest. In this section, we discuss various viral vectors for the delivery of antigens of encephalitic Alphaviruses. 
 <xref rid="vaccines-08-00273-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of recent vectored vaccines.
