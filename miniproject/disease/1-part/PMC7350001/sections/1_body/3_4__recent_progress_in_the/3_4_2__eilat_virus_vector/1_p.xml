<p>Alphavirus vectors can be used to deliver antigens derived from bacteria, parasites, and viruses, including Alphaviruses of the same or different species [

 <xref rid="B84-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], was used to deliver the structural proteins C-E3-E2-6K-E1 of EEEV and VEEV [
 <xref rid="B73-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. A single dose of EILV/EEEV or EILV/VEEV completely protected against homologous and heterologous challenges, respectively. In the same study, a blending of equal parts EILV/EEEV, EILV/VEEV, and EILV expressing the structural proteins C-E2-E1 from the Chikungunya virus provided 80% protection against EEEV and 90% protection against VEEV challenges. It was suggested that reduced efficacy with the multivalent vaccine compared to monovalent vaccines may reflect an immune interference [
 <xref rid="B73-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. EILV has favorable characteristics as a vector, such as the inability to replicate in vertebrates, which makes it an intrinsically safe approach. Although several insect-specific viruses have been identified [
