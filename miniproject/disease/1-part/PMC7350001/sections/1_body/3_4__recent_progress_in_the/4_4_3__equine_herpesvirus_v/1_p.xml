<p>Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) presents suitable characteristics to be a universal vaccine vector: it can enter a wide variety of cell types, can accept large amounts of foreign DNA, and is easily maintained and manipulated [
 <xref rid="B88-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The vaccine candidate rH_VEEV used EHV-1 strain RacH to deliver a codon-optimized sequence of E3-E2-6K-E1 from TC-83 [
 <xref rid="B74-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Immunization of mice with rH_VEEV conferred no protection with the lowest vaccine dose (10
 <sup>2</sup> plaque-forming units [PFU]) up to complete protection with the highest vaccine dose (10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU) after challenge with a heterologous VEEV strain. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected, leading the authors to speculate that T cell responses or antibody-mediated protection unrelated to neutralizing activity played a role in protection. A better mechanistic understanding of rH_VEEV would be valuable for developing improved vaccines based on rH_VEEV.
