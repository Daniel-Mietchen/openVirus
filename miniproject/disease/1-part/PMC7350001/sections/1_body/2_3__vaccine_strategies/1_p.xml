<p>Currently, there are several vaccines under development to protect against encephalitic Alphaviruses. Candidate vaccines have been developed using various approaches: live-attenuated virus, inactivated virus, passive immunization, replicon particles, viral vectors, and DNA; vaccine strategies against VEEV were recently reviewed by Sharma and Knollmann-Ritschel [

While multiple types of vaccine platforms are used to combat infection of a wide range of pathogens, there are considerations to be taken into account when designing vaccines for pathogens of special interest. Live-attenuated viruses are often immunogenic, induce both cell-mediated and humoral responses, and do not require adjuvants to be effective. However, these vaccines may induce side effects, and some studies have shown that mosquitos can acquire attenuated Alphaviruses from vaccinated equids [
