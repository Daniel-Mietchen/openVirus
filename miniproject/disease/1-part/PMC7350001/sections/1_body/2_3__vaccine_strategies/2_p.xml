<p>The safety and stability of live-attenuated vaccines has been dramatically improved through rational design using techniques including codon-deoptimization, gene rearrangement, and targeted attenuating mutations. Codon-deoptimization, the replacement of commonly used codons with rare codons, can significantly reduce protein translation, which has been shown to enhance the attenuation of several live viral vaccines [

 <xref rid="B54-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Similarly, gene order in a viral genome is highly conserved, and the rearrangement of some key genes can greatly reduce viral growth rates [

Attenuating mutations have been the most common method for reducing the virulence of live vaccine strains, but some mutations are more stable than others. The rational selection of highly stable attenuating mutations has significantly increased viral vaccine safety [
