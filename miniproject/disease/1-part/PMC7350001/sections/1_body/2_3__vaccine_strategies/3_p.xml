<p>Inactivated vaccines are generally safe (unless the inactivation is incomplete, as has likely occurred with VEEV [
 <xref rid="B40-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) but may induce short-lived immunity that requires frequent booster shots. Passive immunization with antibodies (often derived from prior immunization) can protect against infectious virus challenge, but antibody targets should be considered, as protection can differ depending on the targeted epitope [

 <xref rid="B61-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Another strategy uses alphavirus replicon particles derived by deleting genes encoding structural proteins such as the capsid; these have shown to be effective both as individual and trivalent vaccines against EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV [

Viral-vectored vaccines have the advantage of inducing robust cell-mediated responses in addition to antibody generation due to their ability to generate target antigens inside infected cells. However, these vaccines may have a higher risk of inducing side effects [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and in some cases, there may be a high level of pre-existing immunity to the vector itself in target populations [

Plasmid DNA vaccines are generally safe and can induce both antibody and T cell responses but tend to induce short-lived responses and may require multiple boosts. The flexibility to rapidly generate novel sequences matching viral outbreak strains is a major advantage of plasmid DNA vaccines. This review focuses on viral vector and plasmid DNA vaccines as newer approaches for combating encephalitic Alphaviruses (
