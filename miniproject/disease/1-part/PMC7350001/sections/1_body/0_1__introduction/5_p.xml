<p>VEEV was first discovered in equines (horses, donkeys, and mules) in 1936 after an investigation into sick horses in Venezuela [

Large individual outbreaks in humans with VEEV have been reported, such as in 1995 in Columbia, which resulted in ~75,000 infections, 3000 cases of neurological sequelae, and 300 deaths. A 1971 outbreak in Texas infected 86 individuals, and at least 12 had long-term neurological complications [

 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], approximately 200,000 human cases of VEEV occurred, along with lethal infection in 100,000 equines [

In a subset of patients, severe disease can occur, beginning with flu-like symptoms and progressing to encephalitis with high mortality. Overall, 1â€“4% of VEEV patients develop neurological symptoms, which can cause lethality or lifelong damage; additionally, birth defects and fetal demise can occur in infected pregnant women.
