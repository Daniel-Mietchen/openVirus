<p>WEEV was discovered in 1930 during an encephalitis outbreak of thousands of horses and mules in California, where roughly half of the infected animals died [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. WEEV initial infection in humans is usually mild but has a lethality rate of 3â€“7%, and up to 50% of survivors have permanent neurological symptoms. Infants and very young children have the highest risk of developing neurological sequelae after WEEV infection. These neurological complications include seizures, depression, paranoia, weakness, hearing loss, anxiety, speech disorders, and intellectual defects. WEEV infections occur primarily in the Central and Western United States. Over 1250 human WEEV cases have been reported.
