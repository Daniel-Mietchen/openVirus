<p>EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV each induce outbreaks in distinct geographical regions. Previously, EEEV was classified as either North American or South American, but recently, South American EEEV has been reclassified as a Madariaga virus, based on studies suggesting that it is genetically distinct from North American EEEV [
