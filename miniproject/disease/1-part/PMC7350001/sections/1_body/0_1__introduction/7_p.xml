<p>Humans have generally been considered dead-end hosts, but recent evidence suggested that they may develop sufficiently high-titer viremia to continue the transmission cycle for VEEV [
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, concerns have been raised over the possibility that these pathogens, particularly EEEV and VEEV, could be transmitted as aerosols, making them potential bioterror agents [
 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated these pathogens as Category B organisms because of the ease of dissemination and the substantial morbidity associated with infection. There is an urgent need for a human vaccine that can be used for biothreat defense and public health, as well as protection for the agricultural community [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A trivalent vaccine that protect against EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV would greatly reduce the biological threat posed by these viruses.
