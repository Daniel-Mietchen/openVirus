 <xref rid="B140-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The approach is motivated by the high density of experimentally confirmed epitopes throughout viral proteomes, extreme diversity of known HLA alleles, and the regional variation in dominant viral strains. Rather than an over-engineer an antigen for a particular HLA type, the intent of maximizing coverage is to realize the greatest potential vaccine-induced immunity over the diversity of human populations. Driven by viral sequence data from genetic databases, it seeks to represent known diversity efficiently and is particularly useful for the design of polyvalent vaccines [
