<p>The currently used vaccine, TC-83, has a myriad of adverse effects and lacks full coverage of VEEV. There has been remarkable progress since the development of TC-83, including the development of investigational vaccines and the evaluation of their utility in a trivalent vaccine. Despite these advances, there are drawbacks to these vaccine candidates, which necessitate further work to move new therapeutics from the research stage in animal models to human use. Future studies should place an increased emphasis on evaluating protection against heterologous challenges. Rather than providing protection only against currently circulating strains, vaccine-design strategies that prioritize broadly protective immunity may reduce global health threats presented by newly emerging viruses and zoonotic spillovers. In addition, vaccine formulation and delivery method are important aspects to consider, as they influence safety and tolerability. Formulation and delivery methods that enable single-dose vaccines may improve compliance and are better-suited for rapid responses than multiple-dose vaccine administrations.</p>
