<p>Structural gene sequences were obtained from 32 published viral-vectored and plasmid DNA vaccines. These candidate vaccine sequences were derived from relatively few isolates: VEEV strains Trinidad donkey/TC-83 and ZPC738; WEEV strains 71V-1658, CBA87, CO92-1356, and McMillan-1941; and EEEV strains BeAr436087, FL91-4679, FL93-939, and NC_003899. This is a limited sampling from a large pool of genetic diversity. Polyvalent formulations improve the coverage of potential linear epitopes. The selection of optimal sequences in candidate EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV vaccines could improve the breath of coverage and could be useful in selecting optimal multivalent combinations for protective immunity across the equine encephalitic Alphaviruses.</p>
