<p>RNA vaccines have several key advantages including heightened immunogenicity, lower dosing requirements, and improved antigen expression as compared to DNA vaccines, as well as enhanced safety and reduced manufacturing time over live-attenuated vaccines [

 <xref rid="B119-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Sequence optimization and the use of modified nucleosides can increase the efficacy of RNA vaccines [

Recent advances using 1-methylpseudouridine nucleoside-modified RNA against other viruses exhibit greater stability, persistence, and immunogenicity profiles due to reduced degradation in vivo [

 <xref rid="B123-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Drawbacks of RNA vaccines include unintended immune reactions and instability in vivo and during storage, as well as multiple dosing requirements to achieve sustained protection [
 <xref rid="B119-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Self-amplifying mRNA technology utilizes synthetic RNA derived from the viral genome, which is then encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles or cationic nanoemulsions [
 <xref rid="B124-vaccines-08-00273" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. This technology has produced an mRNA vaccine encoding the genome of VEEV strain TC-83 that shows enhanced safety with similar immunogenicity as an inoculation with the live TC-83 strain and 100% protection against an aerosol VEEV challenge [
