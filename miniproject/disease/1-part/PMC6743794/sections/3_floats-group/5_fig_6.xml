   </sup>mice (n = 3 per injected group) were injected subcutaneously into the footpad with 10 μL of MAYV (10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU) or Mock. (A) Histological analysis of the mouse footpad histology sections after inoculation with Mock or MAYV. Inoculated feet were dissected, processed for histological analysis and stained with H&amp;E. In MAYV-infected images, muscle necrosis and inflammation are shown by asterisks (*), whereas “#” labels regions of edema and inflammation of the subcutaneous layer and “o” points to muscle inflammation. Images are representative of at least 20 fields of view. Scale bars: 100 μM (Left panels); 20 μM (Right panels). (B, C) The number of neutrophils (B) and the tissue damage score (C) was quantified in the footpads of these mice. (D) Articular lavage was obtained from the knees and total cell numbers were quantified by Cytospin. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s t test (M). Data are representative of two independent experiments, and asterisks indicate significant differences (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) between WT and 
   <italic>Nlrp3</italic>
