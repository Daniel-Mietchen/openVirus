  <p>Serum samples of 13 MAYV-infected patients and 19 healthy control samples were included. Samples were diluted 1:2 for caspase-1 p20 ELISA (A), 1:5 for IL-1β ELISA (B) and 1:3 for IL-18 ELISA (C). Data are represented as scatterplots showing means ± SEM of samples. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s t test. Asterisks indicate significant differences (
