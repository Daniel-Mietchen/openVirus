   </sup>mice were euthanized at 1 and 6 days after infection and the amount of MAYV RNA was quantified in the footpad (H), muscle (I) and spleen (J). Virus titers were determined in the same organs by plaque assay (K) and are represented as mean ± SD. WT,

   </sup> mice were injected with Mock or MAYV for 5 days. Footpads were obtained, and both IL-1β (L) and IL-18 (M) were quantified in the homogenate’s supernatants. Data shown are representative of three (A-D) or two (E-J) independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (M). Asterisks indicate significant differences (
