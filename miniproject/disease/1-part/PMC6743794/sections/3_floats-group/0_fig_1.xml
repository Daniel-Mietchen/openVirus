  <title>MAYV infection trigger caspase-1 activation in macrophages.</title>
  <p>(A-F) PAM(3)CSK(4)-primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with mock or infected with Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) or Mayaro virus (MAYV) at a MOI of 0.2, 1 or 5. After 24 hours of infection, the levels of IL-1β (A-C) and LDH (D-F) in the cell-free supernatants were measured. (G-I) BMDMs were infected with MAYV at a MOI of 5 (MOCK were used as control) for 24 hours infection and the cells were stained for active CASP1 (using FAM-YVAD) and analyzed as shown by the representative contour plots (G). The percentage (H) and integrated mean of fluorescence (iMFI) (I) of activated cells is shown. (J) After 24 hours of infection, supernatants (SN) and cellular extracts (CE) were harvested from MOCK or MAYV-infected BMDMs, and levels of cleaved CASP1 (p20) and IL-1β (p17) were detected by western blotting the SN and probing for the indicated proteins. As loading controls, levels of pro-caspase-1 and β-actin were also assessed in the CE. Data are shown as means ± standard deviation (SD) of triplicate samples (A-I) and are representative of three (A-J) independent experiments that yielded similar results. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s
