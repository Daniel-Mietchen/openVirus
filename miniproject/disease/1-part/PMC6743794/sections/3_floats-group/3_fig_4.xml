  <title>A mouse model to study acute inflammation by MAYV 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>WT mice (n = 5 per injected group) were injected subcutaneously into the footpad with 10 μL of conditioned media (mock), MAYV (10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU) or CHIKV (10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU). (A) Footpad thickness was measured daily (Footpad height) through the 8
   <sup>th</sup> day of infection, and (B) representative images at day 6 after infection are shown. (C) The vonFrey test was used to measure pain in the paws of mock- and MAYV-injected mice. (D) Mice were euthanized at 1, 3, 6 and 10 days after infection and the amount of MAYV RNA was quantified in the footpad, muscle and spleen. (E) Histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin) of footpad sections from control (MOCK) or MAYV-infected mice after 6 days. Ke: keratin; Ep: epidermal layer; De: dermal layer; Mus: muscle; Od: oedema; V: Vessel; PMN: polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. Scale bars = 10 μM.
