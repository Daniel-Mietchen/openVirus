   </sup>mice (n = 4 to 6 mice per injected group) were injected subcutaneously into the footpad with 10 μL of Mock, MAYV or CHIKV (10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU). After 5 days of infection, footpads were removed and single cell suspensions were obtained for FACS analysis. (A) Representative contour plots showing the frequency of NK cells (CD45+NK1.1+CD3-) in each experimental group. Graphical quantification of the percentage of NK cells (B) and its absolute numbers (C) are shown. (D-I) T (CD45+CD3+NK1.1-), NKT cells (CD45+CD3+NK1.1+) and B cells (CD45+CD19+) were assessed in injected footpads. Frequencies of these types of cells (D,F,H) and their absolute numbers (E,G,I) are shown. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s t test (M). Asterisks indicate significant differences (
