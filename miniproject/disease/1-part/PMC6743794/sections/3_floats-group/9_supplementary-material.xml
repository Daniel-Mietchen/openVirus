  <title>MAYV activates the inflammasome in BMDMs.</title>
  <p>(A) FACS analysis was employed to demonstrate the percentage of mature BMDMs in our culture at 6 days of differentiation. Initially, cells were gated to exclude doublets (FSC-A, FSC-W), and then to exclude debris (SSC-A, FSC-A). The double-positive population represents mature macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+). (B) WT BMDMs were infected with MAYV at a MOI of 5, or treated with RPMI medium (NI), or condoned media (mock), or ultrapure LPS (500 ng/ml) as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 3 or 6 hours of infection, cells were lysed and RNA was extracted for qPCR analysis of 
   <italic>Il1b</italic>. Macrophages were primed with PAM(3)CSK(4) (C,D) or left non-primed (NP) (C) for 4 hours and infected with MAYV at a MOI of 5. After 1–24 (D) or 24 hours (C), levels of IL-1β in cell-free supernatants were quantified by ELISA. (E,F) Non-treated (NT) and PAM(3)CSK(4)-primed BMDMs were infected with MAYV at a MOI of 0.2, and at the indicated times total RNA was extracted from the cellular extracts and supernatants to evaluate MAYV intercellular or extracellular mRNA levels by qPCR. (G) Gating strategy used in FACS analyses of FLICA assays employing FAM-YVAD. First, cells were gated to exclude doublets (FSC-A/FSC-H), then to exclude other debris (SSC-A/FSC-A). Data are represented as the means ± SD of triplicate samples (A, B) and are representative of at least two independent experiments that yielded similar results. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between MOCK and MAYV groups. *
