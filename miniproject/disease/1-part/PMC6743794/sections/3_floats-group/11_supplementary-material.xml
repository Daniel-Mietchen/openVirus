   </sup>BMDMs were primed with PAM(3)CSK(4) and then infected with MAYV at a MOI of 5 or mock infected for 24 hours. Cells were also treated with Nigericin (positive control) for 40–60 minutes. Cell-free supernatants were then harvested and LDH release was quantified as previously described. (B) WT,

   </sup>and

   </sup>BMDMs were infected with MAYV at a MOI of 0.2, and at the indicated times total RNA was extracted from the cellular extracts and supernatants to evaluate MAYV intracellular (B) or extracellular (C) mRNA levels by qPCR. Data are represented as the means ± SD of quadruplicate samples and are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between groups. *
