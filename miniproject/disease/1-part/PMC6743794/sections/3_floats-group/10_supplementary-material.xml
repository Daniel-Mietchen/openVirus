  <title>Fraction of infected BMDMs displaying active caspase-1 upon MAYV or CHIKV.</title>
  <p>(A) FACS analysis was employed to demonstrate the percentage of BMDMs infected by either MAYV (A-C) or CHIKV (D-F) after 8 hours of infection. The representative contour plots showing the percentages in each plot are shown (A,D), alongside the quantification of MAYV (B) or CHIKV-infected cells (E). MAYV (C) or CHIKV-infected cells (F) were also gated for active caspase-1 (FAM-YVAD). IC: isotype control. Data are represented as the means ± SD of triplicate samples and are representative of two independent experiments that yielded similar results. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between MOCK and infected groups. *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.
