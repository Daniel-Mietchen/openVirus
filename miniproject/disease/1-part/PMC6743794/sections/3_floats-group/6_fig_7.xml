   </sup>mice (n = 4 to 6 mice per injected group) were injected subcutaneously into the footpad with 10 μL of Mock, MAYV or CHIKV (10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU). After 5 days of infection, footpads were removed and single cell suspensions were obtained for FACS analysis. (A) Representative contour plots showing the frequency of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+) and inflammatory monocytes (CD11b+Ly6C
   <sup>high</sup>) in each experimental group. Frequencies of both types of cells (B,D) and their absolute numbers (C,E) are shown. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s t test. Asterisks indicate significant differences (
