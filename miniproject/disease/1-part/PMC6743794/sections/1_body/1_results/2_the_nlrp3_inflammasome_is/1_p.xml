<p>Different inflammasomes, including AIM2 and NLRP3, are activated in response to viral infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To address which inflammasome is activated upon MAYV infection, we assessed the mRNA expression of different inflammasome molecules in BMDMs by qPCR. At 3 and 6 hours post infection, MAYV induced increased expression of

 </sup>macrophages failed to induce IL-1β secretion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Importantly, live virus is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, since neither heat-inactivated nor UV-irradiated MAYV were capable of inducing IL-1β release (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). However, both NLRP3 and Casp1/11 were dispensable for LDH release (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). By using western blot we found that NLRP3 was required for CASP1 (p20) and IL-1β (p17) cleavage in response to infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Accordingly, NLRP3 was also required for CASP1 activation measured by FAM-YVAD as shown by FACS analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g002">Fig 2H–2J</xref>). To address whether NLRP3 activation by MAYV influenced viral replication, we infected
