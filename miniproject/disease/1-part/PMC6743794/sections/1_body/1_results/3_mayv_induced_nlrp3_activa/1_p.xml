<p>Cellular processes such as potassium efflux and ROS production are known to be important for NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, we tested whether potassium efflux and ROS are induced by MAYV in BMDMs. MAYV triggered both total (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) and mitochondrial ROS production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), as shown by the representative histograms and iMFI. In addition, MAYV infection also induced a significant decrease in intracellular potassium in BMDMs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). To address the importance of ROS production in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we used apocynin, which inhibits NADPH oxidase activity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We found that apocynin effectively blocked ROS production upon infection with MAYV or PMA stimulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), and this effect resulted in a dose-dependent blockage of IL-1β secretion induced by MAYV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). We then tested the effect of K
 <sup>+</sup> efflux on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to MAYV infection. We treated cells with KCl to increase extracellular K
 <sup>+</sup> and used NaCl as a control [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Treatment with NaCl did not interfere in inflammasome activation in response to MAYV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). In contrast, KCl (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3I</xref>) inhibited IL-1β release upon MAYV infection. Importantly, we measured viral infectivity and replication upon stimulation with the different treatments used and found that neither apocynin, nor NaCl or KCl affected viral infectivity at 1 hour (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3J–3L</xref>), or viral load at 24 hours (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g003">Fig 3M–3O</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that potassium efflux and ROS production are necessary for activation of the NLRP3 in response to MAYV infection.
