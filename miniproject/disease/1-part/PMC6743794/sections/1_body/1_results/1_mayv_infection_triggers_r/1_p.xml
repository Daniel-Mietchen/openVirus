<p>Arboviruses such as CHIKV and ZIKV induce inflammasome activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that MAYV could also trigger inflammasome activation in macrophages. As an experimental 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model, BMDMs were employed, since these cells are a highly pure population of macrophages (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). First, we primed BMDMs derived from C57BL/6 (WT) mice with PAM(3)CSK(4), a TLR2 agonist, for 4 hours and infected the macrophages with different multiplicities of infection (MOI) of CHIKV, ZIKV or MAYV. These three viruses induced IL-1β production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>) and LDH release (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref>) in a MOI-dependent manner. MAYV infection in unprimed BMDMs triggered 
 <italic>Il1b</italic> expression at 3 and 6 hours after infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), but it did not induce the release of significant levels of mature IL-1β (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Thus, priming with a TLR agonist is required to achieve robust release of IL-1β in macrophage cultures (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). It is possible that 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, cytokines such as TNF-α are able to prime the cells. We assayed kinetics of IL-1β release by BMDMs and found a time-dependent secretion of IL-1β (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Additionally, we measured the kinetics of viral replication in unprimed and PAM(3)CSK(4) primed BMDMs. The virus has a fast replication cycle, as MAYV RNA levels reach its intracellular peak at 6 to 12 hours, while the extracellular peak is achieved at 12 hours after infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1E and S1F Fig</xref>). Priming BMDMs did not affect virus infectivity in BMDMs but affected virus output at 24 hours (
