<p>MAYV infection elicits robust immune responses in patients during acute and convalescent phase of the disease. In addition, secretion of pro-inflammatory immune mediators during the disease has been reported [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We evaluated inflammasome-related cytokines levels in sera of confirmed MAYV-infected patients presenting acute febrile illness for five days or less during the early phase of the disease. We found that active Caspase-1 (Caspase-1 p20) levels were higher in sera of infected individuals when compared to healthy controls samples (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>). These data indicate that MAYV infection is associated with the production of inflammasome-derived components such as Caspase-1 p20, IL-1β and IL-18, supporting our assertion that the NLRP3 inflammasome is important for MAYV clinical setting.
