 </sup> and WT mice infected with MAYV at 6 dpi (

 </sup> mice (

In order to assess the inflammatory infiltrate in the joint tissue, we obtained articular lavages from the knees of mock and MAYV-injected mice. Although a considerable number of inflammatory cells was found in MAYV-infected WT mice, NLRP3 deficiency increased cellular infiltration into this joint tissue (
