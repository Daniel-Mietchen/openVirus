<p>We next addressed the role of this inflammatory platform in the recruitment of specific cellular subsets found in the footpad of MAYV-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Although the percentage of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>) and inflammatory monocytes (CD11b+Ly6C
 <sup>high</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g007">Fig 7A and 7D</xref>) infiltrating the tissue is not affected by the absence of NLRP3 or Casp1/11, all these populations decrease in absolute numbers compared to WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g007">Fig 7C and 7E</xref>, respectively). Besides myeloid cells, NK and T lymphocytes were also abundant in the footpad of MAYV-infected mice. Thus, we investigated whether NLRP3 play a role in the recruitment of these populations. We found that MAYV enhanced the percentage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>) and absolute numbers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) of NK cells (CD45+NK1.1+CD3-) in WT mice and strikingly, the deficiency of NLRP3 and Caspase1/11 promoted an increased infiltration of this subset of cells to the infected tissue. We found that MAYV did not affect the percentage and absolute numbers of T (CD3+) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g008">Fig 8D and 8E</xref>), NKT cells (CD45+NK1.1+CD3+) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g008">Fig 8F and 8G</xref>) and B cells (CD19+) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g008">Fig 8H and 8I</xref>). In addition, NLRP3 and Casp1/11 do not play a role in the recruitment of these populations. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NLRP3 activation by MAYV is important for recruitment of specific cells, induction of pain and inflammation in a mouse model of Mayaro infection.
