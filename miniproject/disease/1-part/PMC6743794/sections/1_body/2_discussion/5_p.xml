<p>Interestingly, NK cells were shown to contribute to CHIKV pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and may explain the increased footpad swelling in NLRP3-deficient mice infected with MAYV. During the acute phase of CHIKV infection there is an increased frequency of cytolytic NK cells in patients [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which could indicate a role in the control of virus-infected target cells. Nevertheless, a greater infiltration of NK cells expressing granzyme B has been correlated with increased edema and footpad swelling during the early acute phase of CHIKV infection in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Depletion of NK cells significantly reduced the first peak of swelling during CHIKV infection (3dpi), while not affecting the second peak of swelling (6dpi) of the biphasic pattern of footpad swelling [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although the greater infiltration of NK cells could lead to the increased swelling in NLRP3-deficient mice, we cannot not discard the participation of the inflammasome in edema formation, cell activation and cytokine production, given that we found no roles for NLRP3 in controlling viral titers, a finding consistent with previous studies [

Against other viruses, such as influenza, the NLRP3 activation can be either protective or detrimental depending on the stage of infection and virus load [
