<p>The NLRP3 inflammasome may act alongside other pathways during the development of disease in MAYV-infected patients. We found higher levels of caspase-1, IL-1Î² and IL-18 in MAYV-infected patients during the acute phase of the disease, showing that the NLRP3-inflammasome might be relevant during MAYV infection in the clinical setting. Recent epidemics of arboviral diseases, such as ZIKV and CHIKV, have emphasized the need for health agencies to anticipate potential emerging pathogens transmitted by arthropods. MAYV infections have been emerging in South America representing a potential threat to public health. There is an urgent need to elucidate the basic processes of MAYV pathogenesis, which is essential to better understand the disease and manage patients. In this scenario, this study advances toward the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease caused by this virus. We identified the NLRP3 inflammasome as an important pathway related to MAYV pathogenesis, paving the way to future studies exploring the mechanisms governing this disease.</p>
