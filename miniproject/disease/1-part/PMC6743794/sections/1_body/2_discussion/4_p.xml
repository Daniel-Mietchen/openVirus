<p>Our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model of MAYV acute infection demonstrates that NLR3 inflammasome signaling is associated with pain generation early during infection. This is consistent with previous studies in which NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pain induction in many disease models [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. On the other hand, the finding that NLRP3 signaling was protective for the footpad swelling at the peak of MAYV inflammation was unexpected, since it has been demonstrated that inflammasome blockage is protective against CHIKV infection [

However, our FACS data demonstrate that NLRP3 is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes to the site of MAYV infection, while limiting infiltration of NK cells. Of note, it has been reported that caspase-1-specific antagonist Z-YVAD-FMK treatment leads to a reduction in cutaneous neutrophils recruitment during Semliki Forest virus infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], demonstrating that they could have a dual role during alphavirus infections.
