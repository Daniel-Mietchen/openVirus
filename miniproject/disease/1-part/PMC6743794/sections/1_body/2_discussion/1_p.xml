<p>In this study, we evaluated whether MAYV activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and the possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this acute mouse model. Our findings demonstrate that MAYV triggers NLRP3 activation in macrophages, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many viruses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Importantly, we showed that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role during MAYV infection in our mouse model. In addition, the serum of MAYV-infected individuals contains elevated levels of active caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18, supporting the participation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the development of MAYV fever in humans.
