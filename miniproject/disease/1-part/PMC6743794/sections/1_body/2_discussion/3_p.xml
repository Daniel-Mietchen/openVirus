<p>Besides cytokine production, cell death is another common consequence of inflammasome activation. However, our LDH release data suggest that cell death is NLRP3-independent. MAYV replication in BMDMs paralleled the kinetics of IL-1Î² production, which suggests that viral replication cycle itself may account for macrophage death. The cell death mechanism remains to be determined in future studies, since other forms of inflammatory cell death, such as necroptosis, might be triggered by MAYV.</p>
