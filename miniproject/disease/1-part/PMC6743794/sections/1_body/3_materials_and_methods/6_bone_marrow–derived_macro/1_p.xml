<p>BMDMs were prepared using tibia and femur from 6- to 12-week-old mice as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Briefly, progenitor cells were isolated by flushing femurs and tibia with cold sterile incomplete RPMI 1640 (Gibco). The cells were then cultured in differentiation medium: RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FCS and 30% L-929 cell-conditioned medium (LCCM) as a source of M-CSF. After 7 days in culture, BMDMs were harvested and seeded at the required density for each experiment. An MOI of 5 and 24 hours of infection were used in the experiments
