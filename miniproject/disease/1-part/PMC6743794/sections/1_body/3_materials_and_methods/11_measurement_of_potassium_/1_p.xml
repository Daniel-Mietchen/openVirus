<p>Intracellular concentration of potassium was determined by fluorescence emission of asante potassium green-2 (APG-2, TEFLabs). BMDMs (2×10
 <sup>4</sup>) were seeded in black, clear-bottom 96-well plates, and treated with PAM(3)CSK(4) for 4 hours, then infected with MAYV (MOI of 5). After 2 hours of infection, BMDMs were incubated with 5 μM APG-2 in RPMI without FBS and phenol red for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS, and RPMI without phenol red was replaced. Nine images per well were recorded at 40× magnification with the ImageXpress Micro High-Content Imaging System and processed with MetaXpress High-Content Image Acquisition and Analysis (Molecular Devices).
