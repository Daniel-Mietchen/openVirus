<p>Virus strains used in this study comprised MAYV BeAr 20290, CHIKV BzH1 and ZIKV ZikaSPH2015. Genomic sequences of these 3 viruses were deposited in NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database under the GenBank accession numbers KT754168, KT581023 and KU321639 respectively [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Virus stocks were produced after infecting Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) with a MOI of 0.1 PFU and cultured in DMEM with 2% heat-inactivated FCS, 1% glutamine and 1% Pen-Strep. The supernatant was collected after 2–3 days of infection for MAYV and CHIKV and 5 days for ZIKV, clarified by centrifugation to remove cell debris (5500g) and aliquots were kept at −80°C. Conditioned media used for mock infections was prepared from uninfected Vero cells in a similar manner. Virus stocks were titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells using 10-fold serial dilutions of virus stocks [

To inactivate MAYV by ultraviolet light (UV), the virus was dispersed in a tissue culture dish, and a compact UV lamp was placed directly above the dish for 30 minutes. Heat-inactivated MAYV was prepared by incubating the virus at 70°C for 15 minutes. Conditioned media used for mock infections was treated in a similar manner. Virus complete inactivation was verified by the lack of virus plaques after titration by standard plaque assays on Vero cells.
