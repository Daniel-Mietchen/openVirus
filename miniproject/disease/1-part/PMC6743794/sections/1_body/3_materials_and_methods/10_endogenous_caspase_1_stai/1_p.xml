<p>Active CASP1 was measured by fluorochrome inhibitor of caspases assay (YVAD-FLICA, ImmunoChemistry Technologies), a green fluorescent dye that binds specifically to active CASP1. Briefly, 10
 <sup>6</sup> BMDMs were seeded in 12-well plates overnight and then infected with MAYV (MOI of 5) or mock infected for 24 hours. As a positive control, we used 20 μM of Nigericin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40–60 minutes. After that, cells were harvested and stained for 1 h with YVAD-FLICA, following the manufacturer's instructions. For intracellular virus staining, BMDMs were infected with either MAYV or CHIKV (MOI of 5) or mock-treated for 8 hours. After that, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% and permeabilized with 0,1% saponin. Cells were incubated for 1 hour with mouse hyperimmune sera to MAYV, CHIKV or isotype control and with FAM-YVAD fluorescent dye, following the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse hyperimmune sera to MAYV strain BeAr20290 and to CHIKV strain S27-African had their reactivity previously confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay [

Cells were then detached from the plates and the data were acquired on a FACS ACCURI C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
