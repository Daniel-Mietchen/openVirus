<p>Total RNA was extracted from 1x10
 <sup>6</sup> BMDMs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were determined in a NanoDrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 μg of the extracted RNA was used for cDNA conversion using the iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis kit (BIO-RAD) in a thermal cycler. Primers used were

 <italic>Nlrp3 and Il1b</italic> produtcs was performed using 50 ng of cDNA, 10 μM of each primer and PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reactions were performed in the QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Quantitation was performed by normalizing target gene mRNA levels to Hprt (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) levels, and infected sample values are expressed relative to the mean of mock values. Statistical significance between-groups was calculated with ΔCT values that provides the estimates of ΔΔCT values (Log2 fold change)[
