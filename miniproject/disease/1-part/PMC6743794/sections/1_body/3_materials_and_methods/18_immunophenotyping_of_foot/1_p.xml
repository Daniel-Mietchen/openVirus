<p>Mice were infected as detailed in 
 <italic>In vivo infections and footpad swelling section</italic>, and after 5 days of infection for MAYV or 6 days for CHIKV, the animals were sacrificed, and footpads were removed. Footpads homogenates were obtained after 2 hours incubation in collagenase VIII at 1mg/mL and passed thought a 70 μm cell strainer. Cells were counted and plated in 96-well U bottom. Cells were blocked with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) and then stained for flow cytometry analysis. The antibodies employed were anti-CD3ε-PerCP (BioLegend), anti-CD19-APC (BioLegend), anti-NK1.1-FITC (BioLegend), anti-CD45-APC (BD Biosciences), anti-CD11b-FITC (BioLegend), anti-Ly6G-PerCP (BioLegend) and anti-Ly6C-PE (BioLegend). Cells were also stained with a viability dye (Live/Dead fluorescent dye, Pacific Blue, Life Technologies). Samples were acquired on a FACS Verse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
