<p>6–8 week old male mice (n = 5 mice per group) were inoculated subcutaneously (10 μL) in the ventral side of the footpad with 10
 <sup>5</sup> or 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU of MAYV. Mock-infected mice were inoculated with the conditioned media (10 μL). MAYV-induced footpad swelling was assessed every 24 h by measuring height (H) or the height (H) X width (W) of the perimetatarsal area of the hind foot using Kincrome digital vernier calipers. The total area (H x W) was normalized for day 0 measurements.
