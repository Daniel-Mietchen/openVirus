<p>BMDMs were primed with 300 ng/ml of PAM(3)CSK(4) (InvivoGen) for 4 hours, treated for 2 hours with 0–50 nM of NaCl or KCl, and then infected with MAYV (MOI of 5). To inhibit NADPH oxidase, cells were treated with 50 or 100 μM apocynin for 1 hour prior to infection. After 24 hours of infection, supernatants were collected and the levels of IL-1β were measured by ELISA (BD Biosciences). The effect of these treatments on virus infectivity and virus production were measured at 1 hour, intracellularly, and 24 hours, extracellularly, after infection with MAYV (MOI of 5) by viral RNA detection by qPCR as described below.</p>
