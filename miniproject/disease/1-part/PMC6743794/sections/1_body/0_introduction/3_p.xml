<p>Inflammation is a key event during the pathogenesis of many diseases [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several studies have characterized the inflammatory process of dengue virus (DENV), CHIKV and ZIKV infection, both in animal models and humans [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, the acute phase of CHIKV infection is associated with high production of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and MCP-1, while the chronic phase is associated with other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IFN-γ and IL-1β [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Overall, these cytokines are mainly produced upon recognition of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While TLRs are found within cellular and endosomal membranes, NLRs are located in the cytoplasm. They can be activated by different types of pathogens and their associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [
