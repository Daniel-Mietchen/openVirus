<p>MAYV-induced inflammation is likely to play a key role during MAYV pathogenesis, as suggested by a study conducted in patients [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the mechanisms governing the pathogenesis of the disease remain largely unexplored. Here, we used primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) to investigate infection and replication of MAYV, we also established an adult mouse model of acute inflammation that allows the evaluation of effects of inflammasomes during the pathogenesis of MAYV. Our study highlights the key role of the NLRP3 inflammasome for pathogenesis of MAYV infection.
