Infected individuals develop Mayaro fever, a severe inflammatory disease characterized by high fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia and headache. The disease is often associated with a prolonged arthralgia mediated by a chronic inflammation that can last months. Although the immune response against other arboviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), has been extensively studied, little is known about the pathogenesis of MAYV infection. In this study, we established models of MAYV infection in macrophages and in mice and found that MAYV can replicate in bone marrow-derived macrophages and robustly induce expression of inflammasome proteins, such as NLRP3, ASC, AIM2, and Caspase-1 (CASP1). Infection performed in macrophages derived from <italic>Nlrp3</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</italic></sup>, <italic>Aim2</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</italic></sup>, <italic>Asc</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</italic></sup>and <italic>Casp1/11</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</italic></sup>mice indicate that the NLRP3, but not AIM2 inflammasome is essential for production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;. We also determined that MAYV triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and potassium efflux. <italic>In vivo</italic> infections performed in inflammasome-deficient mice indicate that NLRP3 is involved with footpad swelling, inflammation and pain, establishing a role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the MAYV pathogenesis. Accordingly, we detected higher levels of caspase1-p20, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 in the serum of MAYV-infected patients as compared to healthy individuals, supporting the participation of the NLRP3-inflammasome during MAYV infection in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Viruses transmitted by mosquitoes have recently received huge attention from the media because the epidemics caused by Zika and chikungunya virus rapidly spread to new areas and infected a large number of individuals. Mayaro is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that circulates in the Caribbean and tropical regions of Latin America. It causes a highly inflammatory disease, called Mayaro fever, and acute disease is often followed by a prolonged arthralgia mediated by chronic inflammation that can last months or years. The spread of Mayaro to urban areas is a major concern by the authorities, given that the virus has potential to cause an epidemic if spread in high-risk areas. Thus, understanding the mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of this infectious agent would be of great value to treat and prevent the disease. Here, we established an adult mouse model of Mayaro infection and demonstrated that the virus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is important to regulate this viral disease.

After the spread of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to new areas of the globe and the emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV), surveillance systems worldwide are focusing much attention on tracking the next arboviral epidemic [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Reported human cases of Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection have been limited to Central and South America, particularly to the regions around the Amazon basin [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent studies revealed the emergence of MAYV recombinants in Brazil and Haiti, and adaptation to a broad host and vector range, placing these countries as high-risk areas for the emergence of MAYV epidemics [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>MAYV belongs to the <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family and <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus, which consists of well-known pathogenic viruses, such as CHIKV, Ross River virus (RRV), Eastern (EEEV), Western (WEEV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV) viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Haemagogus</italic> mosquitoes have been documented as the main vectors of MAYV, and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> has also been found to be a competent vector, a feature that has alerted authorities to the eminent possibility that MAYV emerge as a global pathogen [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. MAYV is the causative agent of Mayaro fever, a neglected endemic infection that is characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as high fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia and headache. Similar to CHIKV infection, MAYV is associated with a prolonged arthralgia which can last for months or even years, possibly due to chronic inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the mechanisms underlying these clinical signs are still not elucidated.</p><p>Inflammation is a key event during the pathogenesis of many diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and is also the case of those caused by arbovirus [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several studies have characterized the inflammatory process of dengue virus (DENV), CHIKV and ZIKV infection, both in animal models and humans [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, the acute phase of CHIKV infection is associated with high production of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and MCP-1, while the chronic phase is associated with other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Overall, these cytokines are mainly produced upon recognition of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While TLRs are found within cellular and endosomal membranes, NLRs are located in the cytoplasm. They can be activated by different types of pathogens and their associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], or by generation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cathepsin B release [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Upon activation, NLRs trigger the assembly of cytosolic protein complexes called inflammasomes, which consists of a NLR protein, an adaptor protein, and caspase-1. This enzyme is capable of cleaving pro-IL-1&#x003b2;, producing its mature form (IL-1&#x003b2;), and inducing an inflammatory type of cell death called pyroptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although several inflammasomes have been described, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most studied. It is involved in a wide variety of diseases, such as autoimmunity, cancer and neurodegenerative and infectious diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Arboviral infections, including ZIKV and CHIKV can trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation in myeloid cells, such as macrophages, leading to an increased production of IL-1&#x003b2;, contributing to pathological inflammatory events that drive the development of both diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, whether MAYV infection leads to activation of NLRs and inflammasome assembly has never been reported <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>MAYV-induced inflammation is likely to play a key role during MAYV pathogenesis, as suggested by a study conducted in patients [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although some studies have evaluated MAYV infection in different models of mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the mechanisms governing the pathogenesis of the disease remain largely unexplored. Here, we used primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) to investigate infection and replication of MAYV, we also established an adult mouse model of acute inflammation that allows the evaluation of effects of inflammasomes during the pathogenesis of MAYV. Our study highlights the key role of the NLRP3 inflammasome for pathogenesis of MAYV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>MAYV infection triggers robust inflammasome activation in BMDMs</title><p>Arboviruses such as CHIKV and ZIKV induce inflammasome activation [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that MAYV could also trigger inflammasome activation in macrophages. As an experimental <italic>in vitro</italic> model, BMDMs were employed, since these cells are a highly pure population of macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). First, we primed BMDMs derived from C57BL/6 (WT) mice with PAM(3)CSK(4), a TLR2 agonist, for 4 hours and infected the macrophages with different multiplicities of infection (MOI) of CHIKV, ZIKV or MAYV. These three viruses induced IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g001">Fig 1A&#x02013;1C</xref>) and LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g001">Fig 1D&#x02013;1F</xref>) in a MOI-dependent manner.

Thus, priming with a TLR agonist is required to achieve robust release of IL-1&#x003b2; in macrophage cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). It is possible that <italic>in vivo</italic>, cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; are able to prime the cells. We assayed kinetics of IL-1&#x003b2; release by BMDMs and found a time-dependent secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Additionally, we measured the kinetics of viral replication in unprimed and PAM(3)CSK(4) primed BMDMs. The virus has a fast replication cycle, as MAYV RNA levels reach its intracellular peak at 6 to 12 hours, while the extracellular peak is achieved at 12 hours after infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1E and S1F Fig</xref>).

Therefore, we stained infected BMDMs with FAM-YVAD, a fluorescent dye that specifically binds to active Caspase-1 (CASP1). By FACS analysis, we gated in the FAM-YVAD+ population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1G Fig</xref>) and found that MAYV induces robust CASP1 activation, as shown by the percentage of FAM-YVAD+ cells and the integrated mean of fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g001">Fig 1G&#x02013;1I</xref>).

In addition, the serum of MAYV-infected individuals contains elevated levels of active caspase-1, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18, supporting the participation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the development of MAYV fever in humans.</p><p>Although the inflammasome is triggered by several viruses and plays an important role in the outcome of infections [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], our study is the first to identify the mechanisms of NLRP3 activation by an alphavirus. The finding that MAYV induces ROS production and potassium efflux, that are important to activate NLRP3, suggest that upon viral entry into the host cell, several PRRs may recognize the virus and affect cellular homeostasis, triggering mitochondrial and other organelle&#x02019;s damage and inducing pore formation. IL-1&#x003b2; protein secretion was abrogated by inactivated MAYV, indicating that MAYV infection is required for the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. MAYV infection increased the levels of inflammasome-related mRNAs, including <italic>Aim2</italic>. However, infection did not activate the AIM2 inflammasome, since there was no alteration on secreted IL-1&#x003b2; levels using cells deficient in <italic>Aim2</italic>. Although MAYV infection induced an increase in steady-state <italic>Il1b</italic> transcript levels, priming with a TLR agonist prior to infection is needed for significant IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, in agreement with previously published literature with other viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Besides cytokine production, cell death is another common consequence of inflammasome activation. However, our LDH release data suggest that cell death is NLRP3-independent. MAYV replication in BMDMs paralleled the kinetics of IL-1&#x003b2; production, which suggests that viral replication cycle itself may account for macrophage death. The cell death mechanism remains to be determined in future studies, since other forms of inflammatory cell death, such as necroptosis, might be triggered by MAYV.</p><p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> model of MAYV acute infection demonstrates that NLR3 inflammasome signaling is associated with pain generation early during infection. This is consistent with previous studies in which NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pain induction in many disease models [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. On the other hand, the finding that NLRP3 signaling was protective for the footpad swelling at the peak of MAYV inflammation was unexpected, since it has been demonstrated that inflammasome blockage is protective against CHIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, our FACS data demonstrate that NLRP3 is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes to the site of MAYV infection, while limiting infiltration of NK cells. Of note, it has been reported that caspase-1-specific antagonist Z-YVAD-FMK treatment leads to a reduction in cutaneous neutrophils recruitment during Semliki Forest virus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The influx of inflammatory neutrophils are associated with worsened outcomes during CHIKV infection, since they support CCR2-dependent entry of myeloid cells and increase swelling during CHIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, while neutrophils initiate counterproductive responses at mosquito bites, they are required at later stages of disease to prevent mice from succumbing to Semliki Forest virus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], demonstrating that they could have a dual role during alphavirus infections.</p><p>Interestingly, NK cells were shown to contribute to CHIKV pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and may explain the increased footpad swelling in NLRP3-deficient mice infected with MAYV. During the acute phase of CHIKV infection there is an increased frequency of cytolytic NK cells in patients [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which could indicate a role in the control of virus-infected target cells. Nevertheless, a greater infiltration of NK cells expressing granzyme B has been correlated with increased edema and footpad swelling during the early acute phase of CHIKV infection in a mouse model [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Depletion of NK cells significantly reduced the first peak of swelling during CHIKV infection (3dpi), while not affecting the second peak of swelling (6dpi) of the biphasic pattern of footpad swelling [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although the greater infiltration of NK cells could lead to the increased swelling in NLRP3-deficient mice, we cannot not discard the participation of the inflammasome in edema formation, cell activation and cytokine production, given that we found no roles for NLRP3 in controlling viral titers, a finding consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Inflammasome may present a dual role in alphavirus infections, having protective or deleterious effects. Against other viruses, such as influenza, the NLRP3 activation can be either protective or detrimental depending on the stage of infection and virus load [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition, mosquito saliva was shown to enhance inflammasome activation and Semliki Forest virus disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>The NLRP3 inflammasome may act alongside other pathways during the development of disease in MAYV-infected patients. We found higher levels of caspase-1, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 in MAYV-infected patients during the acute phase of the disease, showing that the NLRP3-inflammasome might be relevant during MAYV infection in the clinical setting. Recent epidemics of arboviral diseases, such as ZIKV and CHIKV, have emphasized the need for health agencies to anticipate potential emerging pathogens transmitted by arthropods. MAYV infections have been emerging in South America representing a potential threat to public health. There is an urgent need to elucidate the basic processes of MAYV pathogenesis, which is essential to better understand the disease and manage patients. In this scenario, this study advances toward the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease caused by this virus. We identified the NLRP3 inflammasome as an important pathway related to MAYV pathogenesis, paving the way to future studies exploring the mechanisms governing this disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The care of the mice was in compliance with the institutional guidelines on ethics in animal experiments; approved by CETEA (Comiss&#x000e3;o de &#x000c9;tica em Experimenta&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Animal da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, approved protocol number 014/2016).

Each one of these filaments was applied for approximately 3&#x02013;4 s to induce a paw-withdrawal reflex. The weakest filament able to elicit a response was taken to be the mechanical withdrawal threshold. The log stiffness of the filament is reported as log10 of the mass of the filament in mg and ranged from 0.903 (8 mg or 0.008 g) to 3.0 (1000 mg or 1 g) [<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were plotted and analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8.1 software (GraphPad, San Diego, California).
