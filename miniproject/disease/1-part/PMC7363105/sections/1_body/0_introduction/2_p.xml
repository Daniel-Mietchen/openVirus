<p>Dengue is currently the most widespread arboviral (insect-transmitted virus) disease of humans. The frequency and magnitude of dengue epidemics have increased dramatically in the past 40 years as both the mosquito vectors and the four dengue virus serotypes have expanded geographically throughout the tropics and subtropics. The principal factors driving the massive expansion of epidemic dengue are 1) unplanned urbanization, 2) globalization and 3) lack of effective mosquito control [

This results in extensive areas of household waste such as plastic containers and household water storage that provide ample breeding sites for

Tanzania has strong trade and economic links with many dengue endemic countries in South-east Asia providing a route for the introduction of new serotypes.
