<p>There is currently no antiviral treatment or vaccine against dengue, although a number of vaccines are under development [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, prevention and control of dengue virus transmission currently depends entirely on killing the mosquito vectors or preventing mosquito bites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While insecticide treated nets (ITNs) are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes bite during the day and commonly bites outdoors, rendering ITNs ineffective against them. It has been shown that efforts to control 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> are only sustainable through conscious, systematic, proactive and preventive control. Cuba has remained dengue free for 30 years by using a “set of measures directed towards the detection and elimination of possible mosquito breeding places. It hinges on weekly self-directed inspection by families and workers in their homes and workplaces” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This is an example of successful environmental management i.e. changing the environment to prevent vector breeding by destroying, altering, removing or recycling containers that provide potential mosquito-breeding habitats and should be the mainstay of dengue vector control. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> uses a wide range of confined man-made and natural larval habitats that vary enormously in the number of mosquitoes that they produce [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is therefore most cost and time efficient to target only those habitats that are most productive and therefore epidemiologically more important rather than blanket coverage all types of containers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. With this in mind, we followed up Tanzanian patients with confirmed cases of dengue during the 2014 outbreak to characterize possible risk factors for dengue during the dengue fever outbreak in Dar es Salaam “
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007278.g001">Fig 1</xref>”. We visited the homes of confirmed cases and assessed breeding sites to test a tool to predict dengue vector breeding habitat potential during the dry season (habitat suitability-score) that could be used for training larval control staff to prevent epidemics. In addition, we conducted a short questionnaire on dengue patients’ daily activities and travel behaviour around the time of infection to characterise behaviour that might increase the risk of exposure. The epidemiological and entomological characterisation of the dengue outbreak is of high importance to the Tanzanian Government to identify strategies needed for the prevention of future outbreaks.
