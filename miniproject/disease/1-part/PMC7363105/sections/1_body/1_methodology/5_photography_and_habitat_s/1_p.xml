<p>A HSS is a proposed tool to be used in assessing Aedes mosquito breeding habitats even before the rains begin. The tool utilises 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> bionomics reports of Christopher 1960 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and represents the sum of points allocated for each feature of a breeding site that makes it conducive to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> breeding “
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>”. Photographs of PBHs were taken without zooming to minimize distortion following a standard operating procedure. Photos were given enumeration number linked to the compound and the PBH. Photographs of larval habitats taken during the survey were given HSS based on criteria in “
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>”. The HSS is scored for each habitat independently with a cumulative score calculated based on each of the features present in “
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>”. For instance a breeding site with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and other mosquitoes present with accumulated clean water that is fully shaded would score 5+3+5+5 = 18 points. A household will get an average suitability score "mean habitat suitability score" based on the sum of all the breeding sites identified. A house with a higher mean habitat suitability score is more likely to be a breeding ground for Aedes mosquitoes and should be targeted for dengue vector control.
