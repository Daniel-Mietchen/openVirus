<p>To establish rainfall patterns and dengue outbreak, rainfall data from two months before the outbreak of December 2013 to July 2014 was obtained from the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA). The rainfall data were compared to dengue fever outbreak records at Mwananyamala Hospital in Kinondoni District. Dengue cases were then analysed against the rainfall data for the duration of the outbreak period. Average rainfall was plotted against numbers of dengue cases confirmed in that month with a two week time-lag between the rainfall and incidence of the cases [
