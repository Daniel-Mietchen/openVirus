<p>The study collected information on dengue patient history before and after the dengue outbreak. The data collection team visited patients’ homes and upon written informed consent they conducted a short questionnaire on behaviours that increase risks of Aedes mosquito bites and examined the environment looking for breeding sites and then collected larval mosquitoes found in and around the home. The questionnaire (Supplementary file) was developed in English then translated into Kiswahili and piloted by administering it to 3 households to check the ease of understanding. The survey collected information on disease history, outdoor activities, travel in the two weeks preceding their diagnosis, participants’ use of mosquito bite prevention and dengue awareness. Personnel administering the questionnaire did not prompt participants, and were trained to engage in conversation around the topic to gather information without listing or prompting a series of responses. In addition, inside the home and the area around the home was examined for mosquito larvae and photographs were taken of all potential mosquito breeding sites. The study was conducted after the peak of dengue infection due to delays in obtaining ethical approval although the tail end of the epidemic was ongoing.</p>
