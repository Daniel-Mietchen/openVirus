<p>All PBHs both indoors and outdoors, wet or dry were inspected and assessed for the presence or absence of mosquito larvae and pupae. Areas that qualified these criteria were photographed as possible breeding habitat for Aedes mosquitos [

Aedes larvae were collected using a larval dipper or pipette from PBHs in and around the dengue patientsâ€™ houses to within 100 metres radius or to the closest property (around 30 metres) where houses were crowded. Therefore, a larger area was observed for larger homes. All types of containers were thoroughly checked. To avoid leaving behind Aedes larvae, all larvae of any species found in a PBH were collected. The larvae were then stored at IHI insectary in emergence breeders for later identification of adults.
