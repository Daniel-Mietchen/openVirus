<p>The “Etiologies of acute febrile illness among adults attending an outpatient department in Dar es Salaam” ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01947075 generated a list of 202 adult Tanzanians with confirmed dengue fever from the out-patients department of Mwananyamala district hospital and in other health facilities in Kinondoni District (Sinza hospital, Magomeni healthcare centre, and Tandale dispensary) in Dar es Salaam. From this list, a selection of 100 participants was obtained by computer-generated randomization without repetition. Out of 100 randomly selected cases we obtained 97 cases with the remaining 3 participants lost to follow up. Only adults of over 18 years of age who were residents of Kinondoni municipality and were sick during the outbreak were interviewed as no children were included in the clinical study, although there were dengue cases among children at that time (Emiliana Athumani pers comm). It should be noted that around 200 cases in non-Tanzanian nationals also occurred but these persons were not followed up as part of this study because they did not receive treatment in Kinondoni Municipality at Mwananyamala hospital [
