<p>The highest household HSS was 24 points and the lowest had 3 points. Mean score was 10.8 points “
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007278.g006">Fig 6</xref>”. Two steps were used to validate HSS. Firstly, the assessment included all photo-scores and in absence Aedes and other mosquito larvae (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Secondly, the photoscore of the same habitats but at this time it included Aedes larvae scores after laboratory results of hatched larvae. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to assess the means difference between the two samples. There was no evidence of a difference between the two means, TTest = 1.13, p-value 0.26. HSS correctly predicted 9/12 breeding habitats positive for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> larvae in the dry season out of the twenty highest ranked PBHs by scores. It also identified that 37 out of 97 households contributed the majority of the breeding sites in the dry season and that these houses had a HSS &gt; 10. Therefore, using the HSS could reduce the number of houses visited for larval source reduction by 2/3 and still include most of PBHs “
