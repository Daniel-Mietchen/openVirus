<p>The average age of dengue cases surveyed was 32 years. There was a wide age range among cases with the oldest being 97 years old. Dengue cases of less than 18 years were not involved due to ethical reasons even though there were around 30 confirmed cases of dengue among children (Emiliana Athumani, pers comm).
