<p>The rainy season amplifies the number of Aedes mosquitoes and unusually heavy rains during climate anomalies such as El Nino are often associated with outbreaks of dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The increase in available breeding sites and consequently of the vectors is likely to have amplified dengue infection which was likely to be subclinical in a sufficient number of people to turn into an outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Nonetheless, dengue cases declined as the rainy season came to an end in July. This may also suggest that outdoor breeding habitats “
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007278.g007">Fig 7</xref>” were responsible for increasing densities of dengue vectors and may have facilitated the spread of dengue virus as has also been seen in neighbouring Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007278.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, we have seen that only 4% of breeding habitats inspected were positive with dengue larvae, it may suggest that with favourable conditions just a small vector foci is adequate to cause an outbreak.
