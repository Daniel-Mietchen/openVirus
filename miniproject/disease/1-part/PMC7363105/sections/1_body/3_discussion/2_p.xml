<p>The HSS is proposed by this study to be used as a tool for dengue mitigation before rains begin. During the dry season, the tool was able to correctly identify 75% of breeding habitats that were positive for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. The fact that only a few breeding sites produce the most mosquitoes means that the tool may help guide the effect use of limited resources for larval source management. The tool can either be used by assessing photographs of PBHs or used directly on-site as a surveillance tool. It is an easy to use tool that doesnâ€™t require formal training but to follow instructions to score points based on what the user sees. It is a tool planned to be used by house owners for assessing Aedes breeding areas in their premises. This will eventually bring vector control methods to the household level. This tool is only reported here and needs further validation in Dar es Salaam and other sites with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> to measure its efficiency for predicting suitable habitats and areas where targeted environmental management should be conducted.
