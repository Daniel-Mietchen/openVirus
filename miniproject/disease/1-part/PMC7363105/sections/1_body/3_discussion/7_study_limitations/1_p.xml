<p>This was an observational study in which we were not in control of most variables and we had to rely on information already obtained of dengue patient at the dengue clinic. The clinic was a designated hospital for all dengue patients in the whole of Kinondoni District. The study took place towards the end of both the dengue outbreak and the rainy season, which in practice limited the study to ascertain real-time relationships between cases, vectors and PBHs. Some social-environmental variables had changed, which included PBHs, removal of some waste as well as fumigation, which reduced dengue vectors.</p>
