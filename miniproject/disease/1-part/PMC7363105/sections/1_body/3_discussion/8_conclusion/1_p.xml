<p>Because dengue outbreaks in Tanzania are not spontaneous but rather related to the rainy season, it is, therefore, possible to counteract dengue outbreaks by using proactive mitigations before and during the rains. A simple tool such as HSS may be used by to inform vector control teams and communities even when there are no rains to identify PBHs, which can be removed or covered to prevent the breeding of vectors. Such tools with further testing and improvements may become very useful for the control of arboviral infections at the household level and require no special skills. On public awareness and preventive measure, the study advocates the use of mobile phones to disseminate accurate and timely health information. The thriving access of mobile phone ownership and uses should be used to deliver speedy information about dengue preparedness and prevention by utilising hotlines and tailored text messages. This had not been part of the government vector control strategy which may benefit from a shift from reactive to proactive vector control [
