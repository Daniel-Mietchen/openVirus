<p>For cattle and goats combined, the overall rate of seroconversion was 0.54 per animal-year (95% CI: 0.43–0.66), and was 0.82 per animal-year (95% CI: 0.63–1.04) during the first year and 0.24 per animal-year (95% CI: 0.15–0.38) during the second year. The associations of species, sex, study year and place with seroconversion rate in the multiple Poisson regression model are shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The rate did not differ significantly between species and sexes. However, the rate during the second study year was only a third of that during the first year (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), and significant differences were observed between locations, with Ndumo and Hlanjwana showing higher rates than Namaneni, where the lowest rate was recorded.
