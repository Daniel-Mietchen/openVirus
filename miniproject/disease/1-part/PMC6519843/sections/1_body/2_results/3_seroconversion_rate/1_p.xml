<p>Of the 279 cattle that were seronegative in June 2016 by IgG ELISA, or by ELISA and SNT if both tests were used, 103 were re-sampled between one and eight times during the study period. An additional 91 SNT-seronegative cattle were recruited at various times during the study period and re-sampled at least once, therefore 194 initially seronegative animals were sampled at least twice over periods ranging between 28 and 721 days. Assuming that seroconversions occurred, on average, midway between the last negative and first positive test, a total of 111.8 animal-years at risk were observed. Due to various factors, including logistical reasons and varying farmer compliance, the majority of animals (167/194) were followed up at four of the diptanks (Namaneni, Mpala, Shemula and Ndumo), with very few followed up at Hlanjwana (13), Madlakude (8) and Masondo (6) and none at Mbangwini and Phelandaba.</p>
