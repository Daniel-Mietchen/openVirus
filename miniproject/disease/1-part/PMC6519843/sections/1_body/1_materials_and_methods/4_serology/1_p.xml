<p>All cattle serum samples that were collected for the cross-sectional study were tested for RVFV IgG antibodies using an IgG sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with reported sensitivity of 96.3% and specificity of 99.7% in cattle [

Where possible, samples that tested positive for RVFV IgG were also tested for IgM antibodies using an IgM capture ELISA with reported sensitivity of 100% in sheep and specificity of 99.2% in cattle [
