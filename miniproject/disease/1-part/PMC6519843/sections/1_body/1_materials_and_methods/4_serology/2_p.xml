<p>Heat-inactivated serum samples were tested by the IgG sandwich ELISA using a previously described and validated method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. F96 Maxisorp Immunoplates (AEC-Amersham) were coated with anti-RVF hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid. Optical densities (OD) were measured at 450 nm. The net OD values were first recorded for each serum as the value determined with the RVFV antigen minus the value determined with the control antigen and subsequently converted into percentage of the OD value of a high positive control serum. A cut-off value optimized for this assay (PP value â‰¥30) was used.
