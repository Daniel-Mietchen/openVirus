<p>Livestock in the study area (mainly cattle and goats) belong to numerous small-scale farmers and are communally grazed. Animals range widely during the day, during the dry season foraging mainly in the floodplains, and may be confined in pens at night. Much of the area lies within a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) protection zone and cattle are brought weekly (summer) or every two weeks (winter) to diptanks where they are inspected by animal health technicians for signs of FMD and plunge-dipped for ectoparasite control using amitraz. For this inspection purpose, most cattle are individually identified using ear tags. The only vaccinations applied are those provided by the State, namely brucellosis, anthrax, blackquarter and sometimes lumpy skin disease vaccines.</p>
