<p>The study was conducted on the Maputaland coastal plain in far northern KwaZulu-Natal just south of the Mozambique border, an area with a tropical climate [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007296.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the Pongolo River floodplain, the core of the study area, the summer temperatures range from 23–40°C, winter temperatures range from 16–26°C and mean annual rainfall is 600–800 mm [

The northwards-flowing Pongolo River forms a floodplain at an elevation of 30–50 m above sea level, approximately 10–15 km to the east of the foothills of the Lebombo Mountains, which rise to about 650 m above sea level. The study area contains a mosaic of bushland, thicket, wooded grassland, riverine forest and floodplain vegetation [

The construction of the Pongolapoort Dam in 1973 largely disrupted this cycle, with flooding only occurring with heavy rainfalls or with periodic opening of sluice gates. In very dry years, permanent water may only be present in the Pongolo and Usuthu Rivers and in very few of the larger pans. This study started during a drought period when most of the pans were dry (
