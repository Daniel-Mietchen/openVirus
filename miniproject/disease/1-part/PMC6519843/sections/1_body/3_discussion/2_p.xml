<p>The study was done in an area of South Africa where outbreaks of RVF have never been reported, although occasional small outbreaks and suspected cases had occurred in the more temperate inland and coastal areas to the south of the study area between 1972 and 1986 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Elsewhere in Africa, endemic circulation of RVFV is known or suspected to occur in many areas. Limited numbers of RVFV infections were confirmed to occur in sheep and cattle every year during a seven year interepidemic period in Zimbabwe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A seroprevalence of 33% in cattle and 26% in goats was reported during an interepidemic period in outbreak-prone Garissa County, Kenya during 2013, six years after the last major outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Along the Nile River in Sudan, where outbreaks also occur, a prevalence of 33% in cattle and 34% in goats was found [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In Mauritania, also in an area that had experienced outbreaks, a seroprevalence of 15% was detected in cattle and 4% in small ruminants, and IgM and viral RNA was detected in one bovine [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A series of surveys in Mayotte found seroprevalences of up to 37% in cattle in the absence of reported outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A seroprevalence of 17% was reported in Rwanda, also in the absence of reported outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In Maputo Province, Mozambique, neighbouring our study area to the north, a survey in 2010–2011, during the large outbreak in the central interior of South Africa, found a seroprevalence in cattle of 37%, similar to that in our study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This was followed in 2014 by the detection of a small outbreak of abortion in goats due to RVFV, less than 100 km north of our study area and in the same ecological zone [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The 1.3% IgM seroprevalence in this study was comparable to that reported in other endemic areas, e.g. 0.5% in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and 0–4% in Mayotte [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], indicating the presence of low numbers of recent infections. The seroprevalence in the current study was therefore similar to or higher than those reported elsewhere in Africa where interepidemic circulation is known or suspected to occur and is consistent with ongoing or endemic circulation of RVFV with low numbers of clinical cases likely occurring but overlooked, misdiagnosed or unreported.
