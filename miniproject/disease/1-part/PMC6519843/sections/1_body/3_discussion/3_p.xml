<p>Seroprevalence was high in all age groups throughout the study area. Numerous studies have shown that seroprevalence is usually higher in older animals [

The high seroprevalence in young animals can be a result of a recent outbreak; however, it is unlikely that a large, extensive outbreak would have gone unnoticed. In addition, rainfall in the study area during 2014â€“2016 had been well below average and the study area, as well as much of South Africa had experienced the worst drought in 23 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Release of water from the Pongolapoort Dam had not occurred and most of the floodplain pans were empty. Nevertheless, permanent water was still present in the major rivers and some pans, providing breeding habitat for the mosquito vectors. It is therefore likely that the high seroprevalence in all age groups is indicative of a hyperendemic situation [
