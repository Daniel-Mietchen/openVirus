<p>The seroprevalence in livestock found in this study was much higher than the 12% observed in 1955, the only previous study done in this region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since then the human and livestock populations in the area have increased tremendously, resulting in a substantial increase in RVFV host density, and it is possible that this has changed the dynamics of viral circulation. Nevertheless, the absence of sheep, the most susceptible livestock species, and the extensive farming system with year-round breeding may be responsible for the fact that large outbreaks do not occur in the area. However, sporadic cases of abortion and neonatal mortality are unlikely to be reported and investigated and may be ascribed to other causes; in addition, disease surveillance in the area is sub-optimal and access to veterinary services is difficult. Therefore, the contribution of RVF to livestock morbidity in the area is unknown and requires further investigation.
