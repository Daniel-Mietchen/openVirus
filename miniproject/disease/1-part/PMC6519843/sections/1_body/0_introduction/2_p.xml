<p>The virus was first isolated in Kenya in 1930 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and has been endemic in sub-Saharan Africa ever since. The virus spread beyond sub-Saharan Africa when outbreaks occurred in the Nile delta in Egypt during 1977–1978 causing mortalities in both humans and livestock [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It was first recorded in Mauritania and Senegal in West Africa in 1987 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the Comoros in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Madagascar in 1990 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During the 2010 outbreaks a total of 302 human infections were diagnosed with a case fatality rate of 8% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and a loss of 19,000 head of livestock was reported. Species such as buffaloes, camels and other wildlife were also affected [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These large epidemics have occurred mainly following unusually heavy rains on the relatively dry central plateau of South Africa. However, in the periods between these large epidemics, several smaller outbreaks or isolated cases have occurred both in the interior and in the eastern parts of the country [
