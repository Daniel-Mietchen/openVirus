<p>One such endemic area may be the low-lying, tropical eastern part of southern Africa, including Mozambique and small parts of north-eastern South Africa. Very few outbreaks have been reported in Mozambique, yet there is serological evidence of widespread exposure to RVFV in livestock [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. RVFV was responsible for a small outbreak in goats in the Maputo Province, close to the South African border, in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recently, the overall seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in seven provinces of Mozambique was reported to be 37% in cattle, 30% in African buffalo (
 <italic>Syncerus caffer</italic>), and 29% in domestic ruminants in the Maputo Province [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In South Africa, RVFV was isolated from

 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and 10% of humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, subsequent efforts to detect the virus in mosquitoes in that region were unsuccessful [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There have also not been any reports of clinical cases of RVF in that region, although further south along the KZN coast there was some evidence of RVFV circulation and sporadic clinical cases in 1972â€“1973 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and in a dairy herd in 1981 [
