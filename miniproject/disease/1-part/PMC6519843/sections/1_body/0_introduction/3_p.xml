<p>The fate of the virus during the long interepidemic periods in South Africa is poorly understood. The virus has been isolated from newly emerged, unfed 
 <italic>Aedes lineatopennis</italic> (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic>) in East Africa, suggesting that it may survive extended periods in aedine mosquito eggs, which are very resilient in dry conditions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Romoser et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] provided laboratory evidence in support of transovarial transmission in artificially infected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic>, and it remains the most popular theory for interepidemic survival of RVFV; however, evidence for its occurrence in nature is limited. Other possibilities are the occurrence of low-level interepidemic circulation of virus between vectors and unknown hosts in endemic areas, or disappearance of virus from an area with later re-introduction from an endemic area via movement of infected hosts or vectors [
