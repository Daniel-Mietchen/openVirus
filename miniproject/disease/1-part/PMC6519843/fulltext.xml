However, the presence and patterns of occurrence of the virus in the eastern parts of the country are poorly known. This study aimed to detect the presence of RVF virus (RVFV) in cattle and goats in far northern KwaZulu-Natal province and to estimate the prevalence of antibodies to the virus and the incidence rate of seroconversion.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology</title><p>Cross-sectional studies were performed in communally farmed cattle (n = 423) and goats (n = 104), followed by longitudinal follow-up of seronegative livestock (n = 253) 14 times over 24 months, representing 160.3 animal-years at risk. Exposure to RVFV was assessed using an IgG sandwich ELISA and a serum neutralization test (SNT) and seroconversion was assessed using SNT. Incidence density was estimated and compared using multivariable Poisson models and hazard of seroconversion was estimated over time.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Principal findings</title><p>Initial overall seroprevalence was 34.0% (95%CI: 29.5&#x02013;38.8%) in cattle and 31.7% (95%CI: 22.9&#x02013;41.6%) in goats, varying by locality from 18&#x02013;54%. Seroconversions to RVFV based on SNT were detected throughout the year, with the incidence rate peaking during the high rainfall months of January to March, and differed considerably between years. Overall seroconversion rate in cattle was 0.59 per animal-year (95% CI: 0.46&#x02013;0.75) and in goats it was 0.41 per animal-year (95% CI: 0.25&#x02013;0.64), varying significantly over short distances.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The high seroprevalence in all age groups and evidence of year-round viral circulation provide evidence for a hyperendemic situation in the study area.

Although currently largely confined to Africa, it is of international concern due to its ability to spread and become established in areas where suitable mosquito vectors occur. Outbreaks occur sporadically, associated with conditions favourable for proliferation of mosquito populations, such as high rainfall and flooding, yet their location and timing remain difficult to predict. In other areas there is evidence that RVF virus is endemic and may circulate without causing outbreaks. However, the location and extent of such areas is poorly known, as is the transmission dynamics of the virus in those areas. In this paper, we report the existence of such an area of endemic RVF virus transmission on the tropical coastal plain of South Africa bordering Mozambique, where we found a high rate of exposure of domestic cattle and goats to the naturally circulating virus over a two-year period, with no outbreaks being reported. Research in such areas will help us to assess the potential for spread of the virus to other areas and also to better understand the behaviour of the virus during periods between epidemics.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was partially supported by the Cooperative Agreement Number 5 NU2GGH001874-02-00, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Non-vector transmission of RVFV is not considered important in livestock but humans are easily infected by contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or by inhaling infectious particles [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human infection may present in a self-limiting febrile disease with signs including fever, severe headache, malaise, muscle pain and nausea, but in severe cases can result in encephalopathy, haemorrhagic signs, retinopathy and even death. The disease in ruminants may be characterized by necrotic hepatitis but may also be inapparent or mild, and in pregnant animals usually results in abortions and neonatal mortalities [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The virus was first isolated in Kenya in 1930 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and has been endemic in sub-Saharan Africa ever since. The virus spread beyond sub-Saharan Africa when outbreaks occurred in the Nile delta in Egypt during 1977&#x02013;1978 causing mortalities in both humans and livestock [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It was first recorded in Mauritania and Senegal in West Africa in 1987 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and spread beyond mainland Africa, to Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 2000 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the Comoros in 2007 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Madagascar in 1990 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Three major RVF epidemics have occurred in South Africa, during 1950&#x02013;1951, 1974&#x02013;1975 and more recently 2008&#x02013;2011 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During the 2010 outbreaks a total of 302 human infections were diagnosed with a case fatality rate of 8% [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and a loss of 19,000 head of livestock was reported. Species such as buffaloes, camels and other wildlife were also affected [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These large epidemics have occurred mainly following unusually heavy rains on the relatively dry central plateau of South Africa. However, in the periods between these large epidemics, several smaller outbreaks or isolated cases have occurred both in the interior and in the eastern parts of the country [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The fate of the virus during the long interepidemic periods in South Africa is poorly understood. The virus has been isolated from newly emerged, unfed <italic>Aedes lineatopennis</italic> (<italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>mcintoshi</italic>) in East Africa, suggesting that it may survive extended periods in aedine mosquito eggs, which are very resilient in dry conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Romoser et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] provided laboratory evidence in support of transovarial transmission in artificially infected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>mcintoshi</italic>, and it remains the most popular theory for interepidemic survival of RVFV; however, evidence for its occurrence in nature is limited. Other possibilities are the occurrence of low-level interepidemic circulation of virus between vectors and unknown hosts in endemic areas, or disappearance of virus from an area with later re-introduction from an endemic area via movement of infected hosts or vectors [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>One such endemic area may be the low-lying, tropical eastern part of southern Africa, including Mozambique and small parts of north-eastern South Africa. Very few outbreaks have been reported in Mozambique, yet there is serological evidence of widespread exposure to RVFV in livestock [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. RVFV was responsible for a small outbreak in goats in the Maputo Province, close to the South African border, in 2014 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recently, the overall seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in seven provinces of Mozambique was reported to be 37% in cattle, 30% in African buffalo (<italic>Syncerus caffer</italic>), and 29% in domestic ruminants in the Maputo Province [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In South Africa, RVFV was isolated from <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>circumluteolus</italic> in the tropical coastal region of far northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in 1955 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and at the same time neutralizing antibodies to RVFV were found in 12% of domestic livestock [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and 10% of humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, subsequent efforts to detect the virus in mosquitoes in that region were unsuccessful [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There have also not been any reports of clinical cases of RVF in that region, although further south along the KZN coast there was some evidence of RVFV circulation and sporadic clinical cases in 1972&#x02013;1973 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and in a dairy herd in 1981 [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Various reports have inferred the occurrence of interepidemic circulation of RVFV on the basis of seropositivity in the absence of reported outbreaks or vaccination, in livestock [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] wildlife [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Two recent studies have reported longitudinal follow-up of sentinel sheep and goats in Kenya, reporting low rates of seroconversion in areas that had previously experienced outbreaks [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, no published studies have attempted to quantify the rate of seroconversion in livestock by follow-up of seronegative animals in a region where outbreaks have never been reported.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to determine whether there was evidence of recent circulation of RVFV in the tropical region of far northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to estimate the seroprevalence in cattle and goats, and to estimate the incidence rate and patterns of seroconversion in domestic ruminants over a two-year period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Pretoria (V013-16) and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Republic of South Africa, and adhered to the specifications of the South African National Standard (SANS 10386&#x02013;2008): &#x0201c;The Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes&#x0201d;. Support for the project was obtained from the Director of Veterinary Services of KwaZulu-Natal and the State Veterinarian: Jozini. Verbal consent was obtained from animal owners after the aims of the study were explained to them by the State-employed animal health technicians. Farmers were rewarded for their participation by providing them with small amounts of animal health products such as wound aerosol, topical treatments and endoparasiticides.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study area</title><p>The study was conducted on the Maputaland coastal plain in far northern KwaZulu-Natal just south of the Mozambique border, an area with a tropical climate [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] characterised by warm, dry winters and hot, wet summers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007296.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the Pongolo River floodplain, the core of the study area, the summer temperatures range from 23&#x02013;40&#x000b0;C, winter temperatures range from 16&#x02013;26&#x000b0;C and mean annual rainfall is 600&#x02013;800 mm [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The northwards-flowing Pongolo River forms a floodplain at an elevation of 30&#x02013;50 m above sea level, approximately 10&#x02013;15 km to the east of the foothills of the Lebombo Mountains, which rise to about 650 m above sea level. The study area contains a mosaic of bushland, thicket, wooded grassland, riverine forest and floodplain vegetation [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Depending on rainfall, seasonal flooding of the Pongolo, Ingwavuma and Usuthu Rivers inundates about 13,000 ha of floodplain, filling numerous pans, some of which retain water during the dry season [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The construction of the Pongolapoort Dam in 1973 largely disrupted this cycle, with flooding only occurring with heavy rainfalls or with periodic opening of sluice gates.

Animals range widely during the day, during the dry season foraging mainly in the floodplains, and may be confined in pens at night. Much of the area lies within a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) protection zone and cattle are brought weekly (summer) or every two weeks (winter) to diptanks where they are inspected by animal health technicians for signs of FMD and plunge-dipped for ectoparasite control using amitraz. For this inspection purpose, most cattle are individually identified using ear tags.

The RVFV seroprevalence in cattle in June 2016 was calculated overall and by diptank, age group (&#x02264;2 y, 2.5&#x02013;3.5 y, 4&#x02013;5.5 y, &#x02265;6 y) and sex.

The incidence rate of seroconversion over the 24-month study period (16 months in goats) was then calculated by including all animals that were sampled more than once (irrespective of date of first sampling) and that were seronegative on the first sampling. For the animals that did not seroconvert, animal-time at risk was calculated as the interval between the first and last tests. For animals that did seroconvert, the date of seroconversion was unknown, but was assumed to be the midpoint between the last negative and first positive test. The seroconversion rate was calculated as the number of seroconversions divided by the total animal-years at risk observed, with Poisson exact 95% confidence limits. Estimates were calculated overall for each species, separately for each year of the study (June 2016 to June 2017 and July 2017 to June 2018) and for cattle also separately for each diptank.

Due to various factors, including logistical reasons and varying farmer compliance, the majority of animals (167/194) were followed up at four of the diptanks (Namaneni, Mpala, Shemula and Ndumo), with very few followed up at Hlanjwana (13), Madlakude (8) and Masondo (6) and none at Mbangwini and Phelandaba.</p><p>Seroconversion, determined by SNT, occurred at some stage during the study period in 66 (34%) of initially seronegative cattle. Seroconversions were observed during every interval between samplings for the duration of the study, and at every diptank followed except Masondo, where only six animals were followed for five months each. The overall incidence rate of seroconversion in cattle between June 2016 and June 2018 was 0.59 seroconversions per animal-year (95% CI: 0.46&#x02013;0.75) (<xref rid="pntd.0007296.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Seroconversion rate varied between diptanks, with the lowest rate recorded at Namaneni (0.35 per animal-year) and the highest rates observed at Hlanjwana (1.50 per animal-year) and Ndumo (1.01 per animal-year) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007296.g004">Fig 4</xref>). There was no clear relationship at diptank level between the initial seroprevalence in 2016 and the subsequent rate of seroconversion, and the correlation between the two outcomes was not significant

A seroprevalence of 33% in cattle and 26% in goats was reported during an interepidemic period in outbreak-prone Garissa County, Kenya during 2013, six years after the last major outbreak [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Along the Nile River in Sudan, where outbreaks also occur, a prevalence of 33% in cattle and 34% in goats was found [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In Mauritania, also in an area that had experienced outbreaks, a seroprevalence of 15% was detected in cattle and 4% in small ruminants, and IgM and viral RNA was detected in one bovine [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A series of surveys in Mayotte found seroprevalences of up to 37% in cattle in the absence of reported outbreaks [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A seroprevalence of 17% was reported in Rwanda, also in the absence of reported outbreaks [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In Maputo Province, Mozambique, neighbouring our study area to the north, a survey in 2010&#x02013;2011, during the large outbreak in the central interior of South Africa, found a seroprevalence in cattle of 37%, similar to that in our study [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This was followed in 2014 by the detection of a small outbreak of abortion in goats due to RVFV, less than 100 km north of our study area and in the same ecological zone [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The 1.3% IgM seroprevalence in this study was comparable to that reported in other endemic areas, e.g. 0.5% in Tanzania [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and 0&#x02013;4% in Mayotte [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], indicating the presence of low numbers of recent infections. The seroprevalence in the current study was therefore similar to or higher than those reported elsewhere in Africa where interepidemic circulation is known or suspected to occur and is consistent with ongoing or endemic circulation of RVFV with low numbers of clinical cases likely occurring but overlooked, misdiagnosed or unreported.</p><p>Seroprevalence was high in all age groups throughout the study area. Numerous studies have shown that seroprevalence is usually higher in older animals [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], although in northern Somalia it was higher in younger animals [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The high seroprevalence in young animals can be a result of a recent outbreak; however, it is unlikely that a large, extensive outbreak would have gone unnoticed. In addition, rainfall in the study area during 2014&#x02013;2016 had been well below average and the study area, as well as much of South Africa had experienced the worst drought in 23 years [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Release of water from the Pongolapoort Dam had not occurred and most of the floodplain pans were empty. Nevertheless, permanent water was still present in the major rivers and some pans, providing breeding habitat for the mosquito vectors. It is therefore likely that the high seroprevalence in all age groups is indicative of a hyperendemic situation [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] with continuous or sporadic viral activity despite the dry conditions, and including recent viral circulation.</p><p>Rate or force of infection is a key parameter in modelling of infectious diseases in an attempt to understand the factors determining disease transmission. Our study showed a high seroconversion rate to RVFV in livestock, even during dry conditions, with substantial spatial and temporal variation. Low levels of seroconversion in sentinel sheep and goats have recently been reported in Kenya in areas in which outbreaks are known to occur [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; however, positive tests were not confirmed using virus neutralization and incidence rates were not reported. In the Kruger National Park, South Africa, seroconversion was demonstrated in 5/227 African buffalo (<italic>Syncerus caffer</italic>), indicating a low annual incidence rate of 1&#x02013;3% [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This was also in the eastern part of the country, adjacent to Mozambique, but outside the tropical zone and in a wildlife area with no livestock and a very low human population. The epidemiology of RVFV in our study area more likely approximates that in other tropical areas of Africa and therefore our results provide useful insight into the dynamics of RVFV transmission in endemic areas, both during interepidemic periods in areas where outbreaks are known to occur, and in areas where outbreaks are not reported. Specifically, the range of seroprevalence and seroconversion rates observed in our study will inform the design of further epidemiological studies in known or suspected endemic areas, as well as the modelling of RVFV transmission in such ecosystems. Knowledge of likely force of infection in endemic areas, and its seasonal variation, will also inform studies to assess the risk of spread of RVFV from such areas via animal movements.</p><p>As expected, the highest infection rate was seen during mid to late summer, when water levels are highest and mosquitoes are most abundant. However, despite the fact that rainfall was much higher during the second year of the study, the seroconversion rate was markedly lower, approximately one third of that observed during the first year. It is possible that the drought over the 1-2-year period prior to the study resulted in lower than normal infection rates with a resultant increased number of susceptible animals. This would have increased the number of viraemic animals available to infect mosquitoes, resulting in a higher than usual infection rate during the first year, followed by fewer viraemic animals during the second year. However, the suitable breeding habitat for vectors depends not only on local rainfall, but also on water levels in rivers that are determined by rainfall in their catchment areas. The important mosquito vector species in the study area, and their host preferences, are currently poorly known, and many other factors likely determine their population dynamics, most of which are poorly understood. This study showed very little difference in seroprevalence and seroconversion rate between cattle and goats, suggesting that RVFV is transmitted by one or more mosquito species without strict host preferences.</p><p>The differences in seroprevalence and in seroconversion rates between locations could not be readily explained based on geographic location or environmental factors. Two diptanks with high seroprevalence and seroconversion rates (Mbangwini and Hlanjwana, respectively) were close together and near the lower (northern) Pongolo River; however, they could not be distinguished from the other locations close to the river based on environmental or climatic variables and separate rainfall figures were not available for each location; animal management practices were also similar for all locations. Therefore, the risk and rate of RVFV infection are likely determined by a complex interplay of host, vector and environmental factors which our results show may vary substantially within a region, even over small distances. This is consistent with the marked spatial variation in seroprevalence observed in other studies [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The lack of an association between seroprevalence (reflecting past seroconversion rate) and subsequent seroconversion rate in our study, as well as the differences in seroconversion rates between the first and second years of the study, also indicates that these factors vary substantially over time. More detailed, fine-scale eco-epidemiological studies to describe the dynamics of these virus-vector-host-environment interactions are required in order to better understand the behaviour of and risk posed by RVFV in such endemic ecosystems.</p><p>The seroprevalence in livestock found in this study was much higher than the 12% observed in 1955, the only previous study done in this region [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since then the human and livestock populations in the area have increased tremendously, resulting in a substantial increase in RVFV host density, and it is possible that this has changed the dynamics of viral circulation. Nevertheless, the absence of sheep, the most susceptible livestock species, and the extensive farming system with year-round breeding may be responsible for the fact that large outbreaks do not occur in the area. However, sporadic cases of abortion and neonatal mortality are unlikely to be reported and investigated and may be ascribed to other causes; in addition, disease surveillance in the area is sub-optimal and access to veterinary services is difficult. Therefore, the contribution of RVF to livestock morbidity in the area is unknown and requires further investigation.</p><p>Likewise, the potential impact of RVF on human health in the area is unknown. It is generally considered that human infection by RVFV in southern Africa occurs mainly via contact with infected animal tissues from clinical cases and that infection from mosquito bites is less common, as most human cases have a history of exposure to infected animal tissues and the known mosquito vectors tend to be zoophilic [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, the lack of reported cases in livestock in our study area suggest that human exposure to the virus may be low. However, the last published serological surveys done in this region were in the 1950&#x02019;s, in which 16% of human sera (19/118) collected from locations within in our present study area were protective against RVFV [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To our knowledge there has never been a report of clinical RVF in humans in the area; however, the fact that malaria is common there may result in other causes of febrile illness being overlooked. In support of this hypothesis, a recent study in Maputo, 100 km north of our study area, found a 10% RVFV IgG seroprevalence in febrile patients at a primary health care facility, with seroconversion to RVFV in 5%, concluding that undiagnosed RVFV infections occur in that region and that most RVF cases are misdiagnosed as malaria [<xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, the current status and potential impact of RVFV infection in humans in our study area, and in similar areas along the coastal plain of southern Africa, urgently require further investigation.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study show the presence of RVFV antibodies and active seroconversion in domestic ruminants in far northern KwaZulu-Natal, indicating that RVFV is circulating in the area at a rate that varies by location, season and year. Further investigation should be done into the important mosquito vectors in the area, the factors affecting viral circulation and survival, and the impact of the presence of RVFV on animal and human health.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007296.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Dataset for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007296.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007296.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Final multiple logistic regression model of factors associated with seropositivity to Rift Valley fever virus in cattle at diptanks in far northern KwaZulu-Natal, June 2016.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007296.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007296.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Multiple logistic regression model of factors associated with seropositivity to Rift Valley fever virus in goats in far northern KwaZulu-Natal, February-April 2017.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007296.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the kindness and patience of the farmers and herders in the study area, as well as the generous assistance of the State Veterinarian and the Animal Health Technicians of the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Jozini District, and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife.
