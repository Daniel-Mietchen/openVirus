<p>In this study, we found that the deficiency of FKBP5 in HEK293 and A549 cells increased host susceptibility to IAV infection. Furthermore, FKBP5 preferentially bound IKKα and positively regulated RIG-I-mediated type I IFN activation. Overall, our study suggests that FKBP5 restricts IAV infection by activating RIG-I-mediated NF-κB signaling.</p>
