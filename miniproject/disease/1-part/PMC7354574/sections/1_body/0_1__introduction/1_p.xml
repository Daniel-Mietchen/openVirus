<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. IAV causes seasonal epidemics and has the potential for global pandemics [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. IAV engages with host innate immunity and instigates several innate immune signaling pathways, including TLR7 and RIG-I signaling pathways. RIG-I is a cytosolic RNA sensor that binds IAV RNA. The binding of RNA induces conformational change and several post-translation modifications, such as K63-linked polyubiquitination, which leads to the oligomerization of RIG-I. The oligomerized RIG-I further induces the oligomerization of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as CARDIF, IPS1, and VISA). The oligomerized MAVS acts as a signaling platform by recruitment of IKK and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). IKK and TBK1 activate the transcription factors, NF-κB and IRF, respectively. Then, NF-κB and IRF translocate to the nucleus and form transcriptional complexes to activate type I interferon (IFN) expression. The type I IFN acts as a master cytokine that activates hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes, which in turn inhibit IAV infection.
