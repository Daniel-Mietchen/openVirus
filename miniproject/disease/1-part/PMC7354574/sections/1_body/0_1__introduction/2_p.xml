<p>FKBP5 (also known as FKBP51) belongs to the immunophilin family that consists of FKBP and the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. The FKBP domain has peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity that catalyzes the 
 <italic>cis</italic>–
 <italic>trans</italic> conversion of peptidylprolyl bonds, a reaction that is important for protein folding. The TPR domains at the C terminus mediate protein–protein interactions [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, FKBP5 regulates the activity of several kinases, such as AKT1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), and IKK. FKBP5 acts as a scaffolding protein for AKT1 and promotes the dephosphorylation of AKT1, thereby downregulating the AKT signaling pathway [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. FKBP5 is required to maintain CDK4 levels in cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. FKBP5 also promotes the 
 <italic>cis</italic>–
 <italic>trans</italic> isomerization of the Thr172–Pro173 peptide bond in CDK4 and inhibits the phosphorylation of Thr172, an essential step for cell cycle exit and myoblast differentiation [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. FKBP5 is also found to play a role in NF-κB activation [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. FKBP5 acts as a scaffold by interacting with several components in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) pathway, including IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2); thus, activating the IKK [
