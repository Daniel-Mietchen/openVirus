<p>The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are the sentinels of the innate immune system, which discriminate the microbial components distinct from the host [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. RIG-I is a cytosolic PRR and recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or 5′ triphosphate RNA in the cytoplasm generated by RNA viruses. Upon the engagement with viral RNA, RIG-I activates signaling cascades that lead to the induction of type I IFN expression [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Type I IFN activates the mRNA expression of hundreds of ISGs, Most of the ISGs are antiviral proteins, such as IFITM3 and Viperin. In addition to ISGs, a group of antiviral host factors, termed intrinsic immunity factors, are constitutively expressed and IFN-independent. The “pre-existed” expression of these intrinsic host factors guarantees a more rapid response and a direct inhibition of viral infection [
