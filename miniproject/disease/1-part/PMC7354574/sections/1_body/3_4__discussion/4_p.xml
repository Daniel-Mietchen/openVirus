<p>The NS1 of IAV inhibits host innate immune defenses through diverse mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. First, NS1 inhibits the cellular double-stranded RNA sensors, including RIG-I, protein kinase R, and 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase. Furthermore, NS1 blocks the regulators of these sensors, such as PRKRA, TRIM25 and NF90. A recent study also found that NS1 bound the kinase domain of IKKα and IKKβ and impaired their kinase activity, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activity [
