<p>Many genes involved in innate immunity are ISGs; however, we found that FKBP5 expression was not induced by IFN and IAV in A549 cells. Our data suggest that FKBP5 is constitutively expressed. A recent study found that the expression of FKBP5 was induced by glucocorticoid in A549 cells, which facilitates the suppressive effect of glucocorticoid on pro-inflammatory cytokine production [
