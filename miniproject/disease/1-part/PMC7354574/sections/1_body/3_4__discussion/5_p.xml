<p>On the host side, the erratic activation of NF-κB is detrimental due to the overexpression of proinflammatory factors. Thus, feedback control of NF-κB activity is essential. Recently, the IFN-induced protein 44 (IFI44) was found to negatively modulate the NF-κB activity induced after viral infections [

However, what NF-κΒ-dependent genes are activated, how they are specifically activated by the virus, and how they facilitate viral infection are still not well elucidated. Nonetheless, the virus knows how to skew the balance of NF-κB activity to achieve the ideal environment for viral replication, and at the same time suppress host innate immune responses. Future work will pinpoint the mechanisms of how IAV gains the control to precisely induce the NF-κΒ-dependent genes required for viral infection.
