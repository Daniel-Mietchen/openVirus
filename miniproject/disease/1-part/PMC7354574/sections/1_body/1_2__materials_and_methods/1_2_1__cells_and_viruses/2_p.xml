<p>Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) was purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA (# 10100374). Influenza PR8-GLuc virus was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Palese and featured a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) gene inserted downstream of PB2 [

IAV was propagated in specific pathogen-free fertilized eggs Premium Plus (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA), as described by Szretter et al. [

 <sup>3</sup> TCID50 was injected through the puncture hole into the allantoic cavity. After 72 h of incubation, allantoic fluid was collected. IAV titers were determined by plaque assay as described by Matrosovich et al. [

 <sup>6</sup> MDCK cells per ml were split into 6-well plates. After 2× washes with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), serial dilutions of IAV were adsorbed onto the cells for 1 h. The cells were covered with DMEM containing 1% Avicel RC591 NF (FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, # 20233). Crystal violet staining was performed 48 h.p.i., and visible plaques were counted.
