<p>Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA, # 74106). Five hundred nanograms of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the ProtoScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, # E6300S). For one real-time reaction, 10 µL of SYBR Green PCR reaction mix (Eurogentec, Liège, Belgium) including 0.1 µg of the synthesized cDNA plus an appropriate oligonucleotide primer pair were analyzed on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method was used to determine the relative mRNA expression of genes normalized by the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The primer sequences: human GAPDH, forward primer 5′-AGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA-3′, reverse primer 5′-GGTCATTGATGGCAACAA-3′; human CXCL10 (IP10), forward primer 5′-TTCAAGGAGTACCTCTCTCTAG-3′, reverse primer 5′-CTGGATTCAGACATCTCTTCTC-3′; and human CCL5 (RANTES) qPCR primers were purchased from Qiagen (# PPH00703B-200).</p>
