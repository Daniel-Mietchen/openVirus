<p>Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, # 74106). RNA samples were sent to Novogene (Sacramento, CA, USA) for sequencing. Each sample was sequenced to generate a minimum of 20 million reads. The paired-end reads were directionally mapped to the human genome (GRCh38/hg38) using TopHat2. The Cufflink and CuffDiff analyses were performed to identify the differentially expressed genes using a fold change of â‰¥2 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;0.05.</p>
