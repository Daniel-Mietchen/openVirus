<p>The single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence targeting human FKBP5 is 5′-ATCCGGAGAACCAAACGGAA-3′. The sgRNA was cloned into LentiCRISPR v2 [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (Addgene). Additionally, 0.5 µg of the lentiviral construct was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were selected with 10 µg/mL puromycin for 14 days. Single clones were expanded for knockout confirmation by Western blotting and DNA sequencing.
