<p>The purified samples were sent for mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins found in the control group were considered as non-specific binding proteins. The SAINT algorithm (
 <uri xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saint-apms" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://sourceforge.net/projects/saint-apms</uri>) was used to evaluate the MS data [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Proteins with SAINT score &lt;0.89 or with &lt;3 peptide hits were considered as non-specific binding proteins.
