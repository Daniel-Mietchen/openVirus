<p>Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP–MS) experiments were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00672" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For the protein purification, HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged FKBP5 were collected and lysed in 10 mL of the TAP lysis buffer. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with 50 µL protein A and G resin before the addition of 20 µL of anti-FLAG resin (Sigma, # F2426) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The resin was washed three times and transferred to a spin column with 40 µL of the FLAG peptide for 1 h at 4 °C.
