<p>To determine the role of FKBP5 in IAV infection, we first depleted FKBP5 in HEK293 cells by CRISPR. In this regard, a sgRNA was cloned into the lentiCRISPR v2 containing Cas9 and transfected into HEK293 cells. After 48 h, the cells were selected using puromycin. Single clones were picked and expanded for knockout confirmation by Western blotting (WB). FKBP5 expression was abolished in CRISPR knockout cells as shown by WB (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00672-f001">Figure 1</xref>F). We also evaluated the impact of FKBP5 deficiency on the viral propagation of WSN IAV using the plaque assay. As predicted, FKBP5 knockout cells produced more infectious viral particles than the control A549 cells (
