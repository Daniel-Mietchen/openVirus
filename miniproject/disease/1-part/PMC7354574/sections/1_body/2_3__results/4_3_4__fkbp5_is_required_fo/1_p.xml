<p>RIG-I is a sensor to IAV RNA and activates the IKK and TBK1 signaling pathways to induce type I IFN expression. FKBP5 has been shown to be required for IKK activity; however, to our knowledge, whether FKBP5 is critical for RIG-I–IKK signal axis is unknown. Thus, we first stimulated the FKBP5 wild-type and knockout HEK 293 cells with poly(I:C) and examined the mRNA expression of two ISGs, IP-10 and RANTES. Real-time PCR assays showed that FKBP5 deficiency impaired the poly(I:C)-induced mRNA expression of IP-10 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00672-f004">Figure 4</xref>E) was also impaired in FKBP5 knockout A549 cells. Overall, these data suggest that FKBP5 is required for the RIG-I signaling pathway.
