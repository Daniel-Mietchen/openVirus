<p>As IAV is intrinsically sensitive to IFN, we speculated that type I IFN might regulate FKBP5 expression. Therefore, we treated A549 cells with IFN-β or infected with a PR8 IAV mutant with an NS1 gene deletion (PR8 ΔNS1). FKBP5 protein expressions were then examined. However, IFN-β stimulation or IAV infection marginally modulated FKBP5 protein levels (
