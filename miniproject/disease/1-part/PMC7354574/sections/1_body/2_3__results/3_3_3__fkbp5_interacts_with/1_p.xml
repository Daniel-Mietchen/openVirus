<p>To discover new FKBP5-interacting proteins, we performed the AP–MS analysis of the FKBP5 protein complex. First, FLAG-tagged FKBP5 was transfected into HEK293 cells to generate a stable cell line. After the stable cell line was established by puromycin selection, FKBP5 protein complexes were purified by affinity purification using the anti-FLAG antibody and were then analyzed by mass spectrometry. The AP–MS was biologically repeated twice. To efficiently reduce false positives in AP–MS, we adopted the well established statistical method SAINT [
