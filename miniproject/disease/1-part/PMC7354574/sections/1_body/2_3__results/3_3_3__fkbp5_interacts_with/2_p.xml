<p>IKK has been shown to interact with FKBP5; however, whether the endogenous FKBP5 interacts with IKK is not clear. First, we performed co-IP between FKBP5 and IKKα or IKKβ. In this regard, FLAG-tagged FKBP5 was co-transfected with Myc-tagged IKK into HEK293 cells. Interestingly, co-IP found that FKBP5 preferentially interacted with IKKα (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00672-f003">Figure 3</xref>C, endogenous FKBP5 interacted with the endogenous IKKα. Furthermore, poly(I:C) enhanced the IKKα–FKBP5 interaction. Lastly, we determined which FKBP5 domain (
