  <p>FKBP5 is required for RIG-I signaling. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) FKBP5 wild-type and knockout HEK293 cells were stimulated with 1 µg/mL poly(I:C) for the indicated times. Real-time PCR was performed to determine the relative mRNA levels of IP-10 (
   <bold>A</bold>) and RANTES (
   <bold>B</bold>). All the experiments were biologically repeated three times. Data represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. The 
   <italic>p</italic> value was calculated (two-tailed Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test) by comparison with wild-type cells. An asterisk indicates 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. (
