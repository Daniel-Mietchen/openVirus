  <p>Deficiency of FKBP5 increases host susceptibility to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. (
   <bold>A</bold>) CRISPR knockout of FKBP5 in HEK293 cells. Cell lysates were blotted as indicated. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Wild-type (WT) HEK293 and FKBP5 knockout (KO) cells were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 or MOI 1 with IAV PR8-Gluc for 24 h. Relative luciferase activities were examined. All experiments were biologically repeated three times. *,

   <bold>C</bold>) FKBP5 wild-type and knockout HEK293 cells were infected with the designated MOI of IAV PR8 for 24 h. Cell lysates were blotted using the indicated antibodies. (
   <bold>D</bold>) CRISPR knockout of FKBP5 in A549 cells. Cell lysates were blotted as indicated. (
   <bold>E</bold>) FKBP5 wild-type and knockout A549 cells were infected at MOI of 1 or 10 with IAV PR8-Gluc for 24 h. Relative luciferase activities were examined. All experiments were biologically repeated three times. *,

   <bold>F</bold>) FKBP5 wild-type and knockout A549 cells were infected with the designated MOI of IAV PR8 for 24 h. Cell lysates were blotted using the indicated antibodies. (
   <bold>G</bold>) Wild-type and FKBP5 knockout A549 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with influenza A/WSN/1933 (WSN). After the designated hour post-infection (h.p.i.), the virus titers were determined by plaque assay in MDCK cells. All experiments were biologically repeated three times.
