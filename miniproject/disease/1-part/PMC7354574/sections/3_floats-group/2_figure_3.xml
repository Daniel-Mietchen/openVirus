  <p>FKBP5 interacts with IKKα. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Map of the FKBP5 protein interaction network. FKBP5 and the high confidence candidate interacting proteins (HCIPs) are shown as square and circles, respectively. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Vector or FLAG-tagged FKBP5 was co-transfected with Myc-tagged IKKα or IKKβ into HEK293 cells. After 48 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and blotted as indicated. (
   <bold>C</bold>) HEK 293 cells were stimulated with 1 µg/mL poly(I:C) for 4 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and blotted as indicated. The same isotype Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as a control for immunoprecipitation (IP). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Schematics of the FKBP5 mutants. FK stands for FKBP; TPR stands for tetratricopeptide repeats. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged IKKα was transfected with the pCMV-3Tag-8 vector, FLAG-tagged FKBP5, or the indicated FLAG-tagged FKBP5 mutant. After 48 h, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and blotted as indicated.
