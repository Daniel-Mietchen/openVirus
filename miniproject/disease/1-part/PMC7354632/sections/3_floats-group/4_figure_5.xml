   <bold>A</bold>) A map indicating global H6Nx sequences reported in chickens. (
   <bold>B</bold>) A map showing the density of the number of different H6Nx subtypes in chickens. Most, if not all, chickens with reported AIV infections are domestic birds. Ducks, geese and turkeys have been excluded as there is no way to distinguish between whether they are of a domestic of wild nature.
