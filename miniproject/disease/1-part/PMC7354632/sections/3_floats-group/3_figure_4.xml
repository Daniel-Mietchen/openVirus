  <p>A representative phylogeny of currently available H6 HA sequences available on 
   <uri xlink:href="www.fludb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.fludb.org</uri> All HA H6 sequences with &gt;70% segment length (&gt;1222 bp) were downloaded from FluDB (7/2/2020), with flagged sequences removed. The dataset was downsampled to select a maximum of five sequences from each year from each country, and commonly used lineage-defining sequences were included. MAAFT [
   <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was used to align the segments. A phylogeny was estimated using RAXML, using the best-fit GTR+G+I model as identified using modeltest-ng [
   <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A total of 100 bootstraps replicate trees were constructed. Where specific clades in each named group was inconsistent between publications (e.g., HN573-like viruses), or lineages are identified in only one publication, specific publications are highlighted. Tips are coloured by location, and node size indicates bootstrap support for each node. Phylogenetic position of sequences used commonly to define lineages are given with stars. The most commonly used lineage nomenclature is highlighted in bold font.
