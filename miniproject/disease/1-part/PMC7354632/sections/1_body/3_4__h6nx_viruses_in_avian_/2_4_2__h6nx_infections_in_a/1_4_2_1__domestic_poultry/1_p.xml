<p>Southern China has been considered a hypothetical epicentre for facilitating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses, with increasing diversity of the influenza ecology in the last two decades [

However, due to the limited number of sequences available at the time, robust phylogeny and the identification of reassortants is extremely difficult to identify. Since 1972, infection with H6N1 LPAIV has also been prevalent in domestic poultry in Taiwan [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This is largely due to the preferred method of poultry trade in East and Southeast Asia. LBMs are a traditional component to poultry trading systems whereby live birds, which often includes chickens, ducks, quail and pigeons, are bought together in a single location from various different sources to ‘change hands’ or to be slaughtered. As a consequence, LBMs facilitate mixing of infected and non-infected birds which perpetuates the spread of AIV infection [
