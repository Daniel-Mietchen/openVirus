<p>Between 2011 and 2016, 11 surveys of AIV were performed in China that included almost the entire Chinese mainland. Epidemiological data from the study showed that the positive rate of H6 subtype AIVs in China increased each year from 2012 to 2016 [

From the perspective of host birds, the positive rates (from high to low) were geese (11.45%), ducks (3.81%), other poultry (0.57%), pigeons (0.26%) and chickens (0.11%), which is largely consistent with previous research. The positive rate of H6 AIVs in geese was significantly higher than it has been previously. This suggests that geese have begun to play an important role in the ecological distribution of H6 AIVs.
