<p>Domestic ducks are known to be particularly vulnerable to H6 AIV infections and more likely to be the major reservoirs for H6Nx viruses [

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A total of 16% (1325/8325) of samples collected from apparently healthy poultry in Southern China from 2000 to 2005 identified as H6 positive; 68.8% from aquatic poultry including domestic ducks and geese, 31.2% from minor poultry including partridges and quail, and a single isolate from chickens. H6N2 was the most prevalent subtype among all H6 viruses (79%), followed by H6N1, H6N5 and H6N6 [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A second study 2 years later found that the dominant H6N2 was replaced with H6N6 [
