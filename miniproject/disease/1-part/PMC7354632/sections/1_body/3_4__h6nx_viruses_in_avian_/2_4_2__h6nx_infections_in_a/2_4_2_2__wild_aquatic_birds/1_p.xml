<p>The H6 viruses are among the most frequently encountered subtype in both wild and aquatic birds during surveillance programmes [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The majority of H6 duck isolates belonged to a distinct group with a single gene constellation, primarily comprised of H6N2 viruses. The emergence of this novel group was identified in Southern China, and cocirculates alongside viruses from the Eurasian natural gene pool [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The emergence and presence of this single distinct group is largely contradictory to other more recent surveillance studies in the region which have found a high diversity of isolated viruses across multiple subtypes, which is typically achieved by reassortment events. However, both opposing investigations identify the importance of both domestic ducks and wild aquatic avian species in the persistence of H6Nx infections in the region, acting as part of the natural reservoir along with wild aquatic birds but also as a major poultry type that harbours endemic virus lineages [
