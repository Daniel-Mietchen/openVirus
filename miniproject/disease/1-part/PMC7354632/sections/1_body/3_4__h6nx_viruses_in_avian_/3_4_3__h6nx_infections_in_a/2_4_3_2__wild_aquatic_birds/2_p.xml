<p>During AIV surveillance in Zambia (2008â€“2009) H6N2 was isolated from wild waterfowl. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that these viruses were of Eurasian lineage [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Some gene segments were closely related to those of AIVs isolated in Europe and Asia, indicative of reassortment and subsequent spread across continents. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the internal genes revealed that several isolates contained genes of similarity predominantly observed in human influenza viruses [
