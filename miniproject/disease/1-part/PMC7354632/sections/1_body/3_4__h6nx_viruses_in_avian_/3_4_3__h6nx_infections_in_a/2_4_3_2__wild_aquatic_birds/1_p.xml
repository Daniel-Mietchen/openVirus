 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Birds intended for sale in LBMs for human consumption were sampled and a novel reassortant strain of H6N2 was identified and isolated from a Eurasian Teal. This novel virus possesses a reassortant pattern originating from differing AIV gene pools.
