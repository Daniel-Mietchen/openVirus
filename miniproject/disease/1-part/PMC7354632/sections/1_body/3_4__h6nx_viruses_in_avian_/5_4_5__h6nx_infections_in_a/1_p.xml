<p>Inter-hemispheric movement of AIV genes from Eurasia to America have repeatedly been documented, with reverse movements less common [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This may be due to the high volume of migratory bird movements from Eurasia to America, the incompatibility of the Eurasian IAV gene pool with the introduced North American genes (or vice versa) or imbalanced viral surveillance monitoring. As a result, the North American AIV gene pool has permissibly been replaced by the Eurasian lineage within a decade of introduction [
