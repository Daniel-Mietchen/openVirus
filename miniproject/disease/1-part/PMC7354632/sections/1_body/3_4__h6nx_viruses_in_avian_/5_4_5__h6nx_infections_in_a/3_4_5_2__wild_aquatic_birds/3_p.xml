<p>Analysis suggests the existence of an H6 South American lineage in which viruses do not appear to be mixing with and are evolving independently from influenza viruses in other latitudes [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. One of the HA genes appears to have derived from a virus of North American lineage, indicating the presence of more than one H6 subtype cluster. Studies also suggest limited poultry adaptation and that additional molecular changes would be required for these viruses to replicate and transmit efficiently in chickens.
