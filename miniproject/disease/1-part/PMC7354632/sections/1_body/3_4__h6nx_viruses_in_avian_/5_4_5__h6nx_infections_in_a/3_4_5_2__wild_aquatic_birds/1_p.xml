<p>AIV genome sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 109) from ducks in the Atlantic flyway were analysed to determine their genetic structure. The analyses included 25 AIVs from ducks from Newfoundland, Canada, from 2008–2011 and 84 available reference duck AIVs from the Atlantic flyway from 2006–2011 [

The three H6 genes belonged to the lineage of Eurasian-avian origin, which is known to have become the predominant H6 lineage in North America in the last decade [

In contrast to the extensive animal influenza virus surveillance activities carried out in Southern China, East Asia, Northern Europe, Australia and North America, there is very limited data available from South America. Influenza A viruses from wild waterfowl in South America were rarely isolated and/or characterised. To explore the ecology of influenza A viruses in this region, a long-term surveillance program was established in 2006 for resident and migratory water birds in Argentina—a partnership between the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), the Argentinean National Animal Health Service (SENASA), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and the University of Maryland, College Park, in the United States. AIV surveillance is carried out for resident and migratory water birds, seabirds and shorebirds along the Argentine Atlantic coast and in freshwater wetlands formed by two of the major river systems in South America, the Paraná and Uruguay rivers [
