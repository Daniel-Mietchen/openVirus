<p>In 2009 samples from birds at large commercial breeder farms in East and Southern England were tested for LPAI and H6N1 isolates were obtained. More recently, two separate outbreaks of H6N1 in commercial poultry have been detected in Northern Ireland and Scotland, respectively. H6N1 was isolated from a commercial farm in County Fermanagh in January 2020, resulting in substantial culling, following a previous reported case earlier in the month on a separate premise. In February 2020 a Scottish free-range laying flock were found to have been infected with LPAI H6N1, likely to have been contracted from wild birds. Further cases in Northern Ireland have occurred throughout February and March 2020 and similar outbreaks have been identified since in the republic of Ireland, Scotland and England.</p>
