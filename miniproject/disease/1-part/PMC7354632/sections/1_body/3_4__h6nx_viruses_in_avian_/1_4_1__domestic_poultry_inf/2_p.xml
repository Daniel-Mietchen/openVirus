<p>In the East Asian sub-region, H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6, H6N8 and H6N9 co-circulate in chicken and duck populations, undergoing frequent reassortment with other subtypes [

Weekly mortality increases between 1.6 and 5.1-fold with severe losses in broiler breeders reporting production losses up to 60% with further mortalities of up to 37% [
