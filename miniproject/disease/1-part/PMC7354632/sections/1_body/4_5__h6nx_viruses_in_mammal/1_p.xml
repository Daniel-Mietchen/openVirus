<p>Most HPAIV or LPAIV infections in humans and other mammals have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live poultry or infected poultry products such as carcasses [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. There has been no reliable evidence to suggest that the influenza viruses of avian origin are able to consistently or effectively transmit between mammals or humans following initial zoonotic spillover [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A prerequisite for AIVs to overcome the species barrier and become human-to-human transmissible is largely dependent on the HA and PB2 proteins. Human-to-human transmissible viruses should preferentially bind to α-2,6 sialic acid cell surface receptors, be able to withstand the harsh microenvironment of respiratory droplets and mammalian nasal tract, and be able to replicate efficiently in mammalian cells [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. To date, naturally occurring H6 viruses have shown varied ability to bind to α-2,6 sialic acid receptors and a distinct lack of the PB2 E627K substitution, suggesting further mutation and/or reassortment is required for human-transmissible H6 viruses to occur; however, spillover events into mammals can and do occur [
