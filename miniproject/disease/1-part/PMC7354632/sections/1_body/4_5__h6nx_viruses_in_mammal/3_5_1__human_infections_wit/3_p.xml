<p>The A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 (H6N1) and the human H5N1 and H9N2 influenza viruses possess similar genes encoding internal proteins, suggesting that H6N1 viruses could become novel human pathogens [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This A/teal/Hong Kong (HK)/W312/97 (H6N1) influenza virus is the first known isolate with seven A/HK/156/97 (H5N1)-like gene segments [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The A/teal/HK/W312/97 (H6N1) virus possesses not only these six internal protein genes but also the N1 neuraminidase (NA) gene of the human H5N1 influenza virus. This virus essentially represents the re-emergence of the H5N1 influenza viruses with a different hemagglutinin (HA) [
