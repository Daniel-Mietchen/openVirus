<p>Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] studied the prevalence of IAVs in dogs in Taiwan and identified A/canine/Taiwan/E01/2014 (E01/14). Molecular analysis indicates that this isolate is closely related to current avian H6N1 viruses circulating in Taiwan and harbours the E627K polymorphism in the PB2 protein. This polymorphism increases viral ability to replicate in mammalian species [

Phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA gene segments confirmed that E01/14 belongs to the H6N1 lineage that has been circulating in chickens in Taiwan since 1997. Although the lineage of internal gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) is composed mainly of H6N1 subtype viruses isolated in Taiwan, some H5N2 subtype isolates in the H6N1 lineage were observed [
