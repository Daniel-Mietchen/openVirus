<p>Mice are a convenient and relatively cheap model in which to study of the mechanisms of influenza virus pathogenesis and human polymerase adaptation. H6Nx viruses are able to infect and replicate in mice without prior adaptation [

These viruses have affinity for human-like receptors and are also able to transmit between guinea pigs by direct contact [
