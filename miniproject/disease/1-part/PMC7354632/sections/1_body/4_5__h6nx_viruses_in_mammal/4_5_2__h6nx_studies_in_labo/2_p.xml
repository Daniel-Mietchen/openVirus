<p>Mouse infection studies conducted by Gillam Ross et al., with 14 different H6Nx viruses of North American and Eurasian lineage, showed that multiple viruses replicated in lungs of mice, causing varied degrees of morbidity and mortality [

In general, neutralising antibodies from different H6 virus-infected mice were not capable of cross-reactivity between the different H6Nx lineages. However, a single H6 virus (A/teal/Hong Kong/312/97) was identified that induced protective immunity against viruses in the North American and Eurasian lineages [
