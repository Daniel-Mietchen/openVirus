<p>Globally H6Nx viruses are becoming an increasingly persistent burden for the poultry industry [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], with frequent introductions incurring large scale disease. H6Nx viruses also boast the most extensive host species range compared to other subtypes [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and recent evidence, explored in this review, suggests that H6Nx viruses harbour several molecular signatures indicative of mammalian adaptation therefore posing a potential risk to human health. This review aims to summarise the global distribution, evolution, host tropism infectivity and transmissibility and human health risk posed by H6Nx AIVs.
