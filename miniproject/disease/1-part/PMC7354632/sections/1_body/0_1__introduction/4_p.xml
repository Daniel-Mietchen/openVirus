<p>AIVs can be classified into two groups as a result of clinical disease or molecular signature within their HA segment; low-pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) and high-pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Specifically, a virus is considered a HPAIV if it has an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) in six-week old chickens of greater than 1.2, or causes at least 75% mortality in four to eight-week old chickens when birds are infected intravenously. The virus is also considered a HPAIV if there is a polybasic cleavage site in the HA segment; endogenous furin-like proteases activate the HA at polybasic cleavage sites to facilitate a systemic, and often fatal, infection. Only subtypes H5 and H7 have displayed this phenotype in natural isolates. Absence of a polybasic cleavage site within the HA classifies the virus as being LPAIV [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the presence of a di- or tri-basic cleavage site in the HA gene can also lead to enhanced pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. LPAIV typically causes milder clinical disease in poultry, often associated with a fall in production measures (commonly a drop in egg production with abnormal eggs), with high morbidity (&gt;50%) and low mortality (&lt;5%) [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, in some cases of LPAIV infection mortality can increase, especially in instances of concurrent or secondary infection with other diseases [
