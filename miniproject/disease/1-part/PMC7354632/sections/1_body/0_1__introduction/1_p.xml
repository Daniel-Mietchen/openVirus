<p>Influenza A viruses (IAV), including Avian Influenza Viruses (AIV), are members of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and contain a segmented, ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome. Each genome consists of eight, negative sense, single stranded viral RNA (vRNA) segments enveloped in a host-derived lipid membrane with two surface glycoproteins: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Differences in the antigenicity and phylogenetics of these surface proteins allow characterisation of AIV into subtypes H(x)N(y). Individual isolates are named according to the pattern: antigenic type (A, B, C, D), host of origin, geographical location, strain number and year of isolation [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is then succeeded by H(x)N(y) (e.g., A/American Green-winged Teal/Ohio/18OS2656/2018 (H6N1)). Where the host of isolation is Human, the host of origin is omitted from the strain name (e.g., A/Taiwan/2/13 (H6N1)).
