<p>The influenza A virus genome encodes 10 core proteins and a variable number of accessory proteins. The genome is coated in viral nucleoprotein (NP) and adopts a twisted pan handle conformation with trimeric polymerase (PA, PB1 and PB2) attached, forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The RNP is encircled by the M1 matrix protein which is surrounded by a host-derived lipid bilayer envelope in which the HA and NA as well as the M2 matrix protein are embedded [
