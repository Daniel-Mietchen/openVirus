<p>Antigenic and genetic characterisation of two novel H6N2 viruses isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in India between 2014 and 2015 revealed antigenic divergence between the two isolates; A/duck/India/11CL01/2014 (Kerala14) and A/duck/India/12CL22/2015 (Assam15). The sequence analyses indicated that both the viruses are of avian origin with Î±2,3 avian receptor specificity, low pathogenesis in poultry and sensitive to oseltamivir. However, Kerala14 (H6N2) had the V27I mutation marker indicating increased amantadine resistance in the M2 gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both the viruses belonged to distinct clades and that both viruses are novel reassortants with genetically distinct gene constellations. The results suggest independent introductions of the two H6N2 viruses and that migratory wild birds in the Central Asian flyway may be the source of H6N2 viruses in ducks in India [
