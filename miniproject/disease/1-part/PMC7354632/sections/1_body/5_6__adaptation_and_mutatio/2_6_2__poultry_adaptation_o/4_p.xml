<p>Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] found that the chicken-H6N1-190E-228G HA mutant does not have as strong binding affinity as the duck-H6N1 HA does, indicating that other amino acid substitutions in the receptor-binding site could alter the binding affinity to avian-like receptors. They also found that recent biological characterisation of 256 H6 viruses from LBMs in China revealed that around 34% of H6N2 and H6N6 viruses could bind human-type receptors while maintaining an overall preference for avian receptors [

 <xref rid="B108-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] performed a similar study to Tzarum et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] using the same Taiwan2 HA and an avian H6 HA for comparison. Functional and structural data for the Taiwan2 HAs were very similar. The avian H6 HA was found to bind better and to a broader range of Î±2,3-SAs than the human H6 HA [
