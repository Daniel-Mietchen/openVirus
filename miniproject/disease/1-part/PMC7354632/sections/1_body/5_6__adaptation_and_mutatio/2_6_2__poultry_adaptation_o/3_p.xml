<p>The evolutionary dynamics of chicken-origin H6N2 viruses isolated in South Africa between 2002 and 2013 were investigated [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Sub-lineages I and II continued to co-circulate under vaccination pressure, but sub-lineage I, from which the inactivated vaccine was derived, displayed a markedly higher mutation rate and a three-fold increase in the emergence of potential antigenic sites on the globular head of HA compared to sub-lineage II. Immunological pressure culminated in a critical phenotypic change with several isolates losing the ability to hemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes. Co-assortment of the HA, NA and M genes in the respective sub-lineages contrasted reassortment of the other internal protein genes, and the vaccine seed strain itself was the probable donor of segments to sub-lineage II field strains [
