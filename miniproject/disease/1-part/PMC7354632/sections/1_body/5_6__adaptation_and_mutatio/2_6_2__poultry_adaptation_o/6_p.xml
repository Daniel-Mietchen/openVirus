<p>Neuraminidase phylogeny showed that all N6 genes from Chinese poultry belonged to the Eurasian lineage and likely originated from H6N6 strains circulating in Eastern China during 2005 and 2006. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis identified that the PB2 gene of H6 AIVs were found in 52.5% of H5N6 AIVs isolates. Only 2% of the aquatic poultry tracheal swab samples were positive (16/911) with the other 98% of viruses isolated from cloacal or faecal swabs. This suggests that the H6 viruses isolated from this study primarily replicate in the gut [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which is not usually considered typical of LPAI infections [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>].
