<p>The HA of the 1999 and 2000 terrestrial viruses do not contain a multibasic cleavage site; but do contain a unique insertion of aspartic acid (D) in HA1 between positions 144 and 145 (H3 numbering). The NA of these terrestrial H6N1 viruses have a deletion of 19 amino acids which is a key feature of A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1). Amino acid deletions within the NA stalk are a marker of adaptation from ducks to chickens for other subtypes, including H9N2.</p>
