<p>Influenza viruses of terrestrial poultry origin differ from ancestral duck viruses by enhanced binding to different receptors. It is suggested that the adaptation to receptors in poultry can enhance the potential of an avian virus for avian-to-human transmission and pandemic spread [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The repertoire of glycan sugars in chickens differs from that of aquatic birds. Both α2,6- and α2,3-linked sialic acid receptors are present in the chicken nasal cavity, upper respiratory tract, and gut, whereas in ducks α2,3-linked sialic acid outweighs the proportion of α2,6 receptors [
