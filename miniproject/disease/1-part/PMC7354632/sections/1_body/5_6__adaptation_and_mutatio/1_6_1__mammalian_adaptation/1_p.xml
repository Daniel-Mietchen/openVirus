<p>Upon infecting a new host, the virus must successfully bind to, enter and replicate in the host cell as well as evade the innate immune response long enough for egress and subsequent transmission to a new host. Therefore, all these factors are essential in adaptation to a new host species. Several H6Nx viruses possess genetic substitutions that allow the virus to better bind to human receptors, replicate in human cells and better evade the human immune response (
