<p>In a study conducted by Li et al. all N2, N3 isolates and 89.7% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 148) of the N6 isolates obtained from Southern China between 2014 and 2016, possessed a complete NA stalk, (470 amino acids) whereas 10.3% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17) of the N6 isolates possessed an 11-amino acid deletion in the stalk region (positions 59–69). Interestingly, the H6N6 isolates with the N6-Δ11b (59–69) deletion were all clustered within the Asian H5N6 lineage. They were identified in ducks and geese, which suggested that the stalk deletion of the NA protein may not be the key factor determining the virus host range [
