<p>The E190V and G228S mutations in the HA protein, as well as the frequent genetic reassortment of the H6 AIVs with zoonotic strains (e.g., H5N6), may increase affinity for the human-type receptor [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], which would pose an increasing threat to public health. Therefore, constant surveillance of AIVs in China, where multiple zoonotic strains are known to have originated, is needed to understand the evolution and dynamic reassortment of AIVs.
