<p>The host adaptation of influenza virus is partly dependent on the sialic acid isoform bound by the viral HA. AIVs preferentially bind to sulphated or non-sulphated α2,3 isoform whereas human influenza viruses preferentially bind to the α2,6 isoform [

 <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The receptor-binding specificity of influenza A viruses is also a major determinant for the host tropism of the virus, which enables interspecies transmission. H6Nx viruses have different propensities to bind α2,3 or α2,6 SA depending on the lineage.
