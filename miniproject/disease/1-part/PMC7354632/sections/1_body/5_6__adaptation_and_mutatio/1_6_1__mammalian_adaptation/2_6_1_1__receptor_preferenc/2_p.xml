<p>Tzarum et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] investigated the receptor specificity of the Taiwan2 human H6 HA using synthetic glycans and analysed the HA crystal structure. The Taiwan2 HA contains a unique combination of key residues in the HA receptor binding site when compared to avian origin H6 AIVs, which have never been observed in human or avian influenza viruses prior. Although amino acid residues 190V and 228S were thought to potentially promote human receptor binding, Tzarum et al. concluded that additional mutations may be required to change the binding specificity from α2,3 or α2,6 SA [
