<p>Mouse infections with avian-origin H6N1 viruses found that polymorphisms PB2-E627K and PA-T97I in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) complex increased the pathogenicity of H6N1 AIVs [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In vitro and in vivo analyses demonstrated that PB2-E627K and PA-T97I mutations significantly enhance RNA polymerase activity and viral replication thus contributing to enhanced replication in mammalian cells. E627K has also been shown to increase the replication of H5N1, H7N7, H7N9 and H9N2 AIVs in mammalian cells by interacting with the human isoform of ANP32 [
