<p>A study by Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], based on the serum antibody cross-reactivity data obtained from 14 different H6 viruses from Eurasian and North American lineages, A/duck/HK/182/77, A/teal/HK/W312/97, and A/mallard/Alberta/89/85 were selected to produce live attenuated H6 candidate vaccines. Intranasal administration of a single dose of the three H6 candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) induced neutralising antibodies in mice and ferrets and fully protected mice and ferrets from homologous wild-type (wt) virus challenge. Among the three H6 vaccine candidates, the A/teal/HK/W312/97 CVV provided the broadest cross-protection against challenge with three antigenically distinct H6 wt viruses. This data supports the rationale for further evaluating the A/teal/HK/W312/97 candidate vaccine in humans [
