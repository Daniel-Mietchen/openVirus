<p>An inactivated whole virus vaccine used in South Africa, prepared from a 2002 sub-lineage I seed strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00673-f004">Figure 4</xref>) was introduced to protect birds against clinical disease, but the continued use of this vaccine has previously been shown to accelerate the antigenic drift within sub-lineage I isolates [
