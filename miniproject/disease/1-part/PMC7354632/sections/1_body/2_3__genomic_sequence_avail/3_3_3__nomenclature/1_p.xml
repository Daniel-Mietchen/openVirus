<p>All AIVs have evolved into distinct lineages, typically characterised by geographical distribution. However, the rapid evolution and persistence of the H5 haemagglutinin (HA) derived from the A/goose/Guangdong/1996 H5N1 strain prompted the development of a standard clade nomenclature system, established by the WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group. Phylogenetic analysis of H5 HA genes characterises sequences into clades based upon sequence homology and specific clade definition criteria. The nomenclature system is relatively fluid; as viruses within clades continue to evolve, new sub-lineages periodically emerge until the specific clade definition criteria are met, where they are then designated as separate clades [

Clades are defined through the sharing of a common (clade-defining) node in the phylogenetic tree; monophyletic grouping with a bootstrap value of â‰¥60 at the clade-defining node (after 1000 neighbour-joining bootstrap replicates); and average percentage pairwise nucleotide distances between and within clades of &gt;1.5% and &lt;1.5%, respectively [
