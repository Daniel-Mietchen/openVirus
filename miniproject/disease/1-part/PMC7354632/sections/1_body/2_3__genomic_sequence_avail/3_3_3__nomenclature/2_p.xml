<p>There is no universally accepted or formal nomenclature system for H6 viruses, and those clades that have been widely recognised are loosely defined. The HA H6 segment can be initially phylogenetically divided at the root into Lineage A (sometimes termed “North American Lineage”) [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] that encompasses strains from North America and Oceania, and a Lineage B (“Eurasian Lineage”) that includes strains from all continental regions [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Several well-supported clades within Lineage B are widely recognised (bold text, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00673-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Despite this, there is poor consistency between studies in exactly which phylogenetic nodes are basal to clades. Most notably, the term “HN573-like” viruses may refer to either a major clade [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], or instead to variously sized smaller sub-clades [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00673-f004">Figure 4</xref>). ST339-like viruses and ST2853-like viruses have both been interchangeably termed Group I and Group II (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). In addition, several well-supported clades have been identified and named within the literature, for example South African sub-lineages I and II (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00673-f004">Figure 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Sporadic and conflicting use of clade nomenclature between studies complicates scientific discussion of H6 evolution and diversity. To our knowledge, there has been only one attempt to propose a single global nomenclature, which analysed non-redundant H6 HA sequences between 2000 and 2014 [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Whilst the authors identified major clades Group I (mainly composed of H6N2 and H6N6 viruses from Asia) and Group II (which mostly consists of H6N1 and H6N2 viruses from Asia and around the world) and a single subdivision within one clade, the lack of a quantitative method for selecting named clades mean that the utility of this classification is limited.
