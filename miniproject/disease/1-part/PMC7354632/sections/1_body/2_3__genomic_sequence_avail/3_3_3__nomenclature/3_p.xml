<p>The lack of nomenclature, or the essential requirement for one may be the result of a lack of available sequences for H6 viruses and a low rate of poultry outbreaks compared to other subtypes. Unlike H5 viruses, H6 viruses are not listed as a notifiable disease by the OIE, which may contribute to the lack of sequence availability and have a significantly lower incidence of human infections [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00673" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally, despite persistence in wild bird populations, the predominant AIVs which are responsible for large-scale morbidity and mortality in poultry populations, H5, H7 and H9 subtypes, are prioritised in control strategies over H6 viruses. The increase in awareness, surveillance and reporting of H6 viruses may increase the availability of sequences which can be utilised to potentially establish a robust nomenclature system to monitor the evolution of these viruses. A single H6 nomenclature with clear classificatory guidelines should be proposed and adopted.
