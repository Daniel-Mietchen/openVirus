<p>As of 7 February 2020, 2501 full or majority partial (&gt;70% of segment length) HA sequences were publicly available on FluDB (
 <uri xlink:href="www.fludb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.fludb.org</uri>). Most sequences are from Asia (55%,

 <italic>n</italic> = 1039) were sampled in China. Only 2% of sequences were sampled in South or Central America or Africa (

Increasing sequencing in these regions for H6 and other AIVs is important, particularly given projected regional intensification in the poultry industry [
