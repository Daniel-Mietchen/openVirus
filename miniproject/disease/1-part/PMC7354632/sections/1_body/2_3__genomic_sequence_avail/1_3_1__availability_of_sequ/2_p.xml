<p>Subtype diversity of available sequenced strains is correspondingly higher in well-sampled regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00673-f002">Figure 2</xref>B and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00673-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), so absence of a sequenced subtype cannot be considered representative of true absence of that subtype in poorly-sampled regions. Nevertheless, the genetic sequence data available suggest that different NA subtypes of H6 AIV may be differentially prevalent across different hosts and countries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00673-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The apparent absence of whole genome sequences from H6N7, H6N8 and H6N9 in chickens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00673-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) and H6N3 in China is unusual, given the large numbers of sequences sampled from these groups. Whether this is caused by biased sampling, or by biological factors, should be investigated in greater detail.
