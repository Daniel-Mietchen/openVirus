<p>Antigenic analyses of H6 influenza viruses isolated in south-eastern China between 1975–1981 and 1997–2000 has identified two antigenically distinct groups that continue to circulate in poultry [

It is suggested that these terrestrial 1999 and 2000 A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 (H6N1)-like viruses, along with co-circulating H9N2 viruses, could have been involved in the genesis of pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses in 1997 that have caused substantial human infection [
