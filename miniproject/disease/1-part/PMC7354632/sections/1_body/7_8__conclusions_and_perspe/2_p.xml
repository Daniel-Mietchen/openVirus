<p>As evidenced by successful isolation from a human infection, and significant seroconversion rates amongst poultry workers, H6Nx viruses pose a growing threat to both human and animal health. Although due to having LPAI classification, compared to HPAI viruses, there is a relatively low mortality rate with mild disease, there is a very high reassortment rate with proven adaptive changes. H6Nx infections are becoming more poultry adapted and have demonstrated ability to change receptor binding preference in several mammalian species. There is also the pandemic potential due to various viruses acting as progenitor and precursor strains to zoonotic viruses; e.g., H6N1 and the 1997 HPAI H5N1.</p>
