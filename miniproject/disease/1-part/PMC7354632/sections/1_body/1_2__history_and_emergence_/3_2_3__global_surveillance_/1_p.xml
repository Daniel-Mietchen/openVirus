<p>Global surveillance of LPAIVs, including H6Nx, is typically poor. LPAIV are never considered notifiable viruses in poultry and cause relatively few overt human infections, therefore, infections are not often investigated in detail.

LPAIV are only generally reported through research publications, genome announcements or WHO reports (in the case of confirmed human cases), and not via governmental surveillance. Therefore, it is highly likely that H6Nx viruses are present in far more countries than reported, including in low income regions not identified in
