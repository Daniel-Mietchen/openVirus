<p>Reviewer #2: This paper is well-written and informative. The additional information in the introduction and methods have improved the article and give readers important contextual information on mosquito control. The clarifications helped to understand the spatial scale of the model and how this work applies to Aedes species. Thanks you for the additions to the discussion and the extra effort for the sensitivity analysis. This work provides a helpful basis for discussion of cost-benefit efforts in vector control management.</p>
