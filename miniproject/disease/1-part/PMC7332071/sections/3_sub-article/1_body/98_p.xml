<p>Even if we think about the edges of different neighborhoods within a city that may be treated a different times for larval control, we would have to imagine a scenario under which there is no adulticide being applied or that it is being applied infrequently enough that there is a window of time during which the adults would travel between these neighborhoods and could find untreated pools in which to lay eggs. Itâ€™s not clear that those windows of time are that great (a few days at most?) within an average city in these endemic areas. </p>
