<p>Lines 84-94 describe an interesting scenario and give good reason for asking the proposed research question, but it isnâ€™t clear to me that this scenario is applicable to Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus. The adults of these species have a very short flight span, and it seems that only under rare occasions would these adults be traveling between controlled and non-controlled patches. If we imagine control within a city, that control is already being coordinated within the city, and these Aedes species are unlikely to travel outside of the city in their adult stage. It is hard to imagine patches of adult migration range that would be under different treatment schedules. </p>
