<p>- The parameter assumptions about proportions of larvae killed in treated/untreated areas may not be accurate. If we are saying that it is not possible to treat all larval habitats because they are cryptic and/or ephemeral, then treatment doesnâ€™t make a difference to the larval survival or at least will only ever be partial. </p>
