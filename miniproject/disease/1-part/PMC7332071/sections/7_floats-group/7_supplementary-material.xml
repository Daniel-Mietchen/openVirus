  <title>Effect of treatment efficacy on the benefits of coordination when control is based on surveillance of adult mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>Blue lines (None) show the reduction in human infections when larval control is enacted only in patches that exceed the surveillance threshold. Red lines (NN) show the result when control occurs in the triggered patch and its nearest neighbors. Yellow lines (SN) show the result when control occurs in a triggered patch's nearest neighbors and second nearest neighbors. At high surveillance sensitivity, the efficacy of larvicide treatment has no impact on the benefits of coordination among neighbors. At low sensitivity, the efficacy of the larvicide treatment does affect the benefits of coordination but only when coordination reduces the treatment efficacy in each patch (right panels).</p>
