  <title>Effect of treatment efficacy on the benefits of coordination when control is based on surveillance of infected mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>Blue lines (None) show the reduction in human infections when larval control is enacted only in patches that exceed the surveillance threshold. Red lines (NN) show the result when control occurs in the triggered patch and its nearest neighbors. Yellow lines (SN) show the result when control occurs in a triggered patch's nearest neighbors and second nearest neighbors. Without costs, coordination with nearest neighbors improves infection outcomes. However, unless larvicide has very high initial efficacy, any reduction in efficacy resulting from coordination results in worse outcomes than not coordinating.</p>
