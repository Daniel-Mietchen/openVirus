<p>While we did not examine the effect of varying the magnitude of coordination costs, our findings suggest that it is likely to be important in assessing under what conditions coordination will be beneficial. It would be useful for future theoretical work to examine the threshold costs beyond which coordination ceases to be worthwhile under various circumstances. Overall, our findings suggest that greater coordination among local vector control agents has significant potential to reduce the severity of mosquito-borne epidemics, but accurate estimations of the costs associated with coordination are needed to inform best practices for mosquito control implementation.</p>
