<p>Coordinating with nearby patches may delay control implementation because it takes time for jurisdictions to communicate their surveillance findings with each other. In addition, staff employed in coordination efforts may reduce staff available for control, resulting in additional delays (even if it does not otherwise reduce efficacy). Under this “costs in time” scenario, we assumed that the greater the scale of coordination, the greater the delay it causes. Thus, nearest neighbor coordination causes control in all treated patches to be delayed by one additional day and second nearest neighbor coordination causes control in all treated patches to be delayed by two additional days.</p>
