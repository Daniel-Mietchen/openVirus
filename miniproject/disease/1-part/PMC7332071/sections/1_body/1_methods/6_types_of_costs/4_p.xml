<p>For each combination of surveillance type, treatment threshold, and cost scenario, we performed 100 simulation runs. In keeping with previous work, for each simulation run, 16 out of 20 patches were chosen randomly to participate in surveillance and treatment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This is to simulate the realistic scenario in which not all patches can participate in surveillance for reasons unrelated to mosquito or disease dynamics (such as inaccessibility or private land). We assume that the goal of mosquito control is to reduce the number of human infections during an epidemic; thus, for each run, we calculated the percent reduction in human infections compared to the case in which no control is implemented.
