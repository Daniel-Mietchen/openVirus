<p>If the agencies or individuals responsible for control have limited financial resources, money spent on coordination may mean less money available to spend on actual treatment. There may therefore be a trade-off between treatment efficacy (defined as the fraction of larvae killed by treatment) and the scale of coordination. In previous work [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], it was assumed that treatment is 100% effective (all larvae in a treated patch are killed). Under this “costs in resources” scenario, we assume that there is 100% treatment efficacy only in the absence of coordination, and that coordination reduces efficacy, with greater scales of coordination causing greater reductions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s002">S1 Table</xref>). A sensitivity analysis indicated that an initial treatment efficacy less than 100% does not substantially alter our results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s004">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s005">S2</xref> Figs). Although the magnitude of the costs in our simulation were arbitrarily chosen, our results should give insight into whether costs of coordination influence the optimal control strategy and therefore whether empirical estimation of costs is useful to inform control.
