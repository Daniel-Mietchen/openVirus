<p>The effect of coordination among patches on the efficiency of control may depend on the types of costs associated with coordination. We examined three alternate assumptions about the costs of coordination: no costs, costs in time, and costs in resources. In the “no costs” scenario, we assume coordination causes no change in the timing or efficacy of larval control. In the “costs in time” scenario, we assume coordination causes delays in treatment. In the “costs in resources” scenario, we assume that coordination reduces larvicide efficacy in each treated patch.</p>
