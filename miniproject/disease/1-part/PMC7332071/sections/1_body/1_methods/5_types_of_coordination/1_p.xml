<p>We define a patch’s nearest neighbors as all patches orthogonally and diagonally adjacent to it (adult mosquito dispersal occurs only between patches that are nearest neighbors). We define a patch’s second nearest neighbors as all patches adjacent to its nearest neighbors. For each combination of surveillance method and treatment threshold, we examined three types of coordination. In the no coordination condition, each patch was treated with larvicide the day following when its own threshold for control was exceeded (either the number of adult mosquitoes or the number of infected mosquitoes, depending on the type of surveillance).</p>
