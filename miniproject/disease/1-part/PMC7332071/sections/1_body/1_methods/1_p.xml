<p>We assume the landscape is divided into a simple 5 by 4 grid of identical habitat patches, where patch size is defined as the scale over which adult mosquitoes migrate. Because of the relatively short flight range of adult

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s002">S1 Table</xref>). We assume humans are mobile enough at the spatial scale of the model that a mosquito in any patch can bite any human (but see [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] for analyses in which this assumption is relaxed). The time scale of the model is such that we assume a fixed human population (no human birth or death).
