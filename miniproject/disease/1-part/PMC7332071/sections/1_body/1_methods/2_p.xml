<p>Mosquito population dynamics and disease transmission dynamics are described by a series of discrete time, SIR-type difference equations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These equations are the same as in [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s001">S1 Text</xref> for ease of readership). Model variables are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s003">S2 Table</xref>. During the period of surveillance and control, participating patches are treated the following day when a threshold for control is exceeded (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s002">S1 Table</xref>). For simplicity, we assume that all mosquito control targets larvae (larvicide or source reduction), a common form of control for container-inhabiting mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], in order to isolate the effects of larvicide treatment in our model, we assume that no adulticide is used. For full list of model assumptions, see
