<p>For each surveillance method, we also examined two different treatment thresholds, since previous work indicated that the sensitivity of the treatment threshold can influence the relative effectiveness of different methods of mosquito surveillance [

In the high sensitivity condition, the thresholds for treatment were: one infected mosquito for the epidemiological-based surveillance, or 10% of mean pre-control adult mosquito abundance for demographic-based surveillance. In the low sensitivity condition, the thresholds were: five infected mosquitoes for the epidemiological-based surveillance, or 50% of mean pre-control adult mosquito abundance for demographic-based surveillance (
