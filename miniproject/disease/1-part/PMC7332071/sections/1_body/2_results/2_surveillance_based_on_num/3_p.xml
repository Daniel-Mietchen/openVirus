<p>These results suggest that when surveillance is epidemiological and larvicide is highly effective, the optimal level of coordination is nearest neighbors, regardless of costs or sensitivity. Inclusion of second nearest neighbors does not substantially improve infection reduction and can even detract from infection reduction, depending on the coordination costs. It is also important to note that epidemiological surveillance was much less effective than demographic surveillance, regardless of the type of coordination employed (Figs
