<p>When surveillance is epidemiological (based on the number of infected mosquitoes) rather than demographic, we find that the effect of coordination depends on the type of costs but not the sensitivity of detection. Without any costs of coordination, coordinating with nearest neighbors achieves a greater reduction in human infections than not coordinating (
