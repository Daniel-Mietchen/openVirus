<p>When coordination is costly in time, coordination with nearest neighbors achieves the greatest reduction in human infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Coordinating with second nearest neighbors also achieves greater infection reduction than not coordinating at all but has less benefit than only coordinating with nearest neighbors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g003">Fig 3</xref>). When coordination is costly in resources, coordinating with nearest neighbors still achieves the best control outcomes, but coordinating with second nearest neighbors leads to worse infection outcomes than not coordinating at all (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In addition, when the initial larvicide efficacy is less than 100%, any reduction in efficacy as a result of coordination costs results in worse outcomes than not coordinating (
