<p>We find that when surveillance is demographic (based on the number of adult mosquitoes), the optimal level of coordination for outbreak mitigation depends on both the sensitivity of the vector control threshold and the type of coordination costs. When demographic surveillance is highly sensitive and there are no costs associated with coordination, vector control in response to the nearest neighborsâ€™ treatment thresholds being triggered has a very small benefit compared to no coordination (

In contrast, when surveillance is less sensitive and there are no costs of coordination, coordinating with nearest neighbors reduces human infections more than not coordinating. Coordinating with second nearest neighbors reduces human infections even further (
