<p>When demographic surveillance is highly sensitive, and coordination causes a delay in treatment, we find that coordinating with nearest neighbors has little effect on epidemic control outcomes compared to not coordinating (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, coordinating with second nearest neighbors has worse outcomes than not coordinating at all. In contrast, when surveillance is less sensitive, coordination with nearest neighbors improves epidemic outcomes even when coordination causes a delay. Coordinating with second nearest neighbors also improves outcomes over not coordinating but has no additional benefit over coordinating only with nearest neighbors (
