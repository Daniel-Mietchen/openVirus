<p>When we assume that coordination is costly in resources (leading to a reduction in larvicide efficacy), we find that for highly sensitive demographic surveillance, coordination with nearest neighbors leads to worse control outcomes than no coordination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, coordinating with second nearest neighbors leads to much worse outcomes than either no coordination or coordination with only nearest neighbors. However, when coordination is costly in resources and surveillance is less sensitive, coordinating with nearest neighbors is better than not coordinating. Coordinating with second nearest neighbors also improves outcomes over not coordinating but not as much as only coordinating with nearest neighbors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Though we assumed in this model that larvicide treatment is 100% effective in the absence of coordination, a sensitivity analysis found that treatment efficacy can affect the benefits of coordination (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). When surveillance has low sensitivity and treatment results in less than ~70% larval mortality, any further reduction in efficacy resulting from coordination costs eliminates the benefits of coordination.
