<p>When demographic surveillance is less sensitive or when control decisions are based on surveillance of infected mosquitoes, coordination between adjacent patches can substantially improve epidemic control outcomes compared to each patch enacting control independently. This benefit of coordination persists even when it causes a delay in treatment or a reduction in resources available for larval control. When surveillance is epidemiological, the ideal spatial scale for coordination of mosquito control is the scale over which adult mosquitoes migrate (adjacent patches). When surveillance is demographic, coordinating on a larger spatial scale can be beneficial if it does not reduce the efficacy of treatment within patches. While we assumed in this study that larvicide treatment in completely effective, assuming a lower effectiveness did not substantially alter our conclusions, except when surveillance was based on total mosquito abundance and less sensitive, and when coordination was costly in resources. In that case, a lower initial efficacy meant that any reduction in efficacy resulting from coordination costs resulted in more human infections than no coordination among patches.</p>
