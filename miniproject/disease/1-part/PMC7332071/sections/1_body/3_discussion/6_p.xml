<p>Previous work has found that larval control based on surveillance of adult mosquito numbers is much more effective at reducing human infections than control based on surveillance of mosquito infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our results show that even with coordination, epidemiological surveillance does not achieve the same reduction in human infections as demographic surveillance (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g003">3</xref>). However, in realistic epidemic scenarios, funding for control may not be available until after an infection is introduced, particularly in resource-limited areas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, chemical larvicide may have environmental side effects that must be balanced against disease prevention. While we assumed in this study that surveillance focused on adult mosquitoes, surveillance of larval mosquito numbers is used as well [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and previous work suggests that the sensitivity of surveillance information can influence which surveillance target is best for reducing human infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Given that vector control in response to highly sensitive demographic surveillance is not always possible, coordination of vector control has the potential to improve epidemic mitigation under a broad range of realistic surveillance scenarios.
