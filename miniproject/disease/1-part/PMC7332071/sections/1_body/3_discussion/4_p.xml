<p>Our simulations suggest that the ideal level of coordination in vector control efforts among neighboring patches depends on the type of cost associated with coordination, as well as both the type and sensitivity of surveillance on which treatment decisions are based. When control agencies can enact highly sensitive surveillance based on the number of adult mosquitoes, there is little to be gained from coordination, and even small costs in either time or resources are likely to outweigh the benefits. This is mostly because at high sensitivity of detection, very high reduction in infections can be accomplished without coordination among patches. However, this level of sensitivity most likely represents an uncommon, best-case scenario, particularly in low income countries.</p>
