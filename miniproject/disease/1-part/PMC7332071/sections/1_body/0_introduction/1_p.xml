<p>Recent outbreaks of mosquito-borne viruses such as Zika [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], chikungunya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] are a major public health threat in tropical regions, placing a large burden on the healthcare systems of affected countries. Dengue virus is responsible for nearly 10,000 deaths and 60 million infections annually [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while the ongoing Zika epidemic will likely have long-term public health consequences due to Zika-induced congenital microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As climate change and increased human migration facilitate the spread of these diseases to new locations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], there is an urgent need to respond quickly to outbreaks while making efficient use of the limited resources available to combat them. It is therefore vital to develop methods for predicting the extent and severity of these epidemics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and how different public health interventions will impact them [
