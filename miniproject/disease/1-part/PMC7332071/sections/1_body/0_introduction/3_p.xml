<p>Epidemiological models of these viruses must consider how vector habitat is often short-lived and patchily distributed across the landscape [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This type of habitat is prone to metapopulation dynamics, in which individual sub-populations frequently go extinct and are recolonized by adult migration [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> adults disperse over short distances [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], control measures that are conducted at the neighborhood level [e.g. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] may lead to rescue effects in which untreated patches act as source populations for adjacent treated patches [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. If juvenile population growth displays density dependence within patches [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], migration of biting adults from untreated patches may compensate for mortality in treated patches, diminishing the effectiveness of disease control. The synchronicity of treatment across patches may therefore also be important, with patches treated at different times allowing untreated patches to act as reservoirs, increasing the potential for rescue effects relative to cases in which all patches are treated at once.
