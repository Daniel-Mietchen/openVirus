<p>To answer these questions, we build on a spatially explicit SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model first presented in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We examine two different possible costs of coordination: costs in time or costs in resources. We then examine three different coordination scenarios: no coordination, coordination with nearest geographic neighbors, and coordination with both nearest and second nearest neighbors to determine the optimal level of coordination, given different assumptions about the method of surveillance used to determine treatment decisions and the costs of coordination among patches.
