<p>Metapopulation theory suggests that more uniform vector control across a landscape should reduce the size of an outbreak better than patchy control [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In practice, though, control is often implemented at the local level by individual communities or households [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], without consideration of the best timing or spatial distribution for landscape-level control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given these limitations, coordination of vector control among patches has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of disease mitigation during an outbreak [
