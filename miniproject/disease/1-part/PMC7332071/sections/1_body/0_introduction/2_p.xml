<p>Emerging or reemerging infections often have no vaccine available yet (as with Zika virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) or have vaccines with only limited availability and/or efficacy (as with dengue virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Vector control is therefore the most widely used strategy for limiting the size and severity of outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Two main vectors for these viruses are 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], both widespread urban-adapted mosquitoes whose immature larvae develop in small, ephemeral water sources, such as planters and trash cans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several strategies for controlling these mosquito populations have been used in arbovirus-endemic regions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mosquito control programs often use chemical larvicide treatment or container removal (i.e. source reduction) to reduce larval survival because it is the easiest life stage to target [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Source reduction is labor-intensive, however, with species like 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> that oviposit in small, ephemeral pools because these sites are numerous and often cryptic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Adulticide is widely used as well, either alone or in combination with larvicide [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The organization of vector control programs varies from top-down, centralized approaches, such as aerial spraying of insecticides, to community-based initiatives that provide education and/or resources to help local residents reduce mosquito survival at the household level [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Controlled studies of current mosquito control programs have found wide variation in their efficacy [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Given the cost and resource intensiveness of these programs, it is important to be able to predict which types of interventions are most likely to be effective at reducing arbovirus infections.
