Outbreaks of these diseases are likely to have long-term social and economic consequences due to Zika-induced congenital microcephaly and other complications. Larval control of the container-inhabiting mosquitoes that transmit these infections is an important tool for mitigating outbreaks. However, metapopulation theory suggests that spatiotemporally uneven larvicide treatment can impede control effectiveness, as recolonization compensates for mortality within patches. Coordinating the timing of treatment among patches could therefore substantially improve epidemic control, but we must also consider economic constraints, since coordination may have costs that divert resources from treatment. To inform practical disease management strategies, we ask how coordination among neighbors in the timing of mosquito control efforts influences the size of a mosquito-borne infectious disease outbreak under the realistic assumption that coordination has costs. Using an SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)/metapopulation model of mosquito and disease dynamics, we examine whether sharing surveillance information and coordinating larvicide treatment among neighboring patches reduces human infections when incorporating coordination costs. We examine how different types of coordination costs and different surveillance methods jointly influence the effectiveness of larval control. We find that the effect of coordination depends on both costs and the type of surveillance used to inform treatment. With epidemiological surveillance, coordination improves disease outcomes, even when costly. With demographic surveillance, coordination either improves or hampers disease control, depending on the type of costs and surveillance sensitivity. Our results suggest coordination among neighbors can improve management of mosquito-borne epidemics under many, but not all, assumptions about costs. Therefore, estimating coordination costs is an important step for most effectively applying metapopulation theory to strategies for managing outbreaks of mosquito-borne viral infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Mosquito-borne viruses, such as Zika, are an urgent public health threat, particularly in tropical, low-income regions. Vector control, the main strategy for combatting outbreaks, can be challenging because the urban-adapted, container-breeding mosquitoes that transmit these viruses often exhibit metapopulation dynamics, where mortality in one population is compensated by migration from neighboring populations. The timing and spatial distribution of vector control efforts can therefore have a large impact on their efficacy. Using a model of virus transmission and vector population dynamics, we demonstrate that local mosquito control initiatives aimed at reducing the burden of Zika and other mosquito-borne infections are most effective when there is communication of surveillance findings among neighboring control agencies and coordination over the timing of mosquito reduction treatments. We find that local communication improves epidemic outcomes even when it imposes costs to resource-limited control agencies due to gains in the efficiency of mosquito control from spatial coordination.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1640951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0233-1404</contrib-id><name><surname>Fefferman</surname><given-names>Nina H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsf.gov">www.nsf.gov</ext-link>) under grant no.

Dengue virus is responsible for nearly 10,000 deaths and 60 million infections annually [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while the ongoing Zika epidemic will likely have long-term public health consequences due to Zika-induced congenital microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in adults [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As climate change and increased human migration facilitate the spread of these diseases to new locations [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], there is an urgent need to respond quickly to outbreaks while making efficient use of the limited resources available to combat them. It is therefore vital to develop methods for predicting the extent and severity of these epidemics [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and how different public health interventions will impact them [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Emerging or reemerging infections often have no vaccine available yet (as with Zika virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) or have vaccines with only limited availability and/or efficacy (as with dengue virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Vector control is therefore the most widely used strategy for limiting the size and severity of outbreaks [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Two main vectors for these viruses are <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], both widespread urban-adapted mosquitoes whose immature larvae develop in small, ephemeral water sources, such as planters and trash cans [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several strategies for controlling these mosquito populations have been used in arbovirus-endemic regions [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mosquito control programs often use chemical larvicide treatment or container removal (i.e. source reduction) to reduce larval survival because it is the easiest life stage to target [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Source reduction is labor-intensive, however, with species like <italic>Aedes</italic> that oviposit in small, ephemeral pools because these sites are numerous and often cryptic [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Adulticide is widely used as well, either alone or in combination with larvicide [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The organization of vector control programs varies from top-down, centralized approaches, such as aerial spraying of insecticides, to community-based initiatives that provide education and/or resources to help local residents reduce mosquito survival at the household level [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Controlled studies of current mosquito control programs have found wide variation in their efficacy [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Given the cost and resource intensiveness of these programs, it is important to be able to predict which types of interventions are most likely to be effective at reducing arbovirus infections.</p><p>Epidemiological models of these viruses must consider how vector habitat is often short-lived and patchily distributed across the landscape [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This type of habitat is prone to metapopulation dynamics, in which individual sub-populations frequently go extinct and are recolonized by adult migration [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although <italic>Aedes</italic> adults disperse over short distances [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], control measures that are conducted at the neighborhood level [e.g. <xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] may lead to rescue effects in which untreated patches act as source populations for adjacent treated patches [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. If juvenile population growth displays density dependence within patches [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], migration of biting adults from untreated patches may compensate for mortality in treated patches, diminishing the effectiveness of disease control. The synchronicity of treatment across patches may therefore also be important, with patches treated at different times allowing untreated patches to act as reservoirs, increasing the potential for rescue effects relative to cases in which all patches are treated at once.</p><p>Metapopulation theory suggests that more uniform vector control across a landscape should reduce the size of an outbreak better than patchy control [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Previous work also indicates the spatial distribution of patch-level control can influence its effectiveness at mitigating an outbreak [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In practice, though, control is often implemented at the local level by individual communities or households [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], without consideration of the best timing or spatial distribution for landscape-level control [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given these limitations, coordination of vector control among patches has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of disease mitigation during an outbreak [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>However, coordination between local mosquito control agents may also incur its own costs. In the worst cases, such costs may decrease control efforts by requiring the reallocation of resources to enable the coordination itself. The largest disease burdens from <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne viruses, including Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, occur in resource-limited regions, such as southeast Asia and Latin America [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Money spent on communication and coordination among households or neighborhoods is likely to reduce the money available for implementing control.</p><p>Costs can also take the form of time delays since time spent communicating with other regions or waiting for other regions to be ready for coordinated treatment can delay the start of treatment in an affected patch. Previous findings suggest that surveillance resulting in earlier treatment after an outbreak is most effective in reducing human infections [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

We also used the metric of infected adult mosquitoes per patch to compare the effects of coordination when surveillance is based on demographic vs. epidemiological information (see [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] for description of other surveillance methods.)</p><p>For each surveillance method, we also examined two different treatment thresholds, since previous work indicated that the sensitivity of the treatment threshold can influence the relative effectiveness of different methods of mosquito surveillance [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the high sensitivity condition, the thresholds for treatment were: one infected mosquito for the epidemiological-based surveillance, or 10% of mean pre-control adult mosquito abundance for demographic-based surveillance. In the low sensitivity condition, the thresholds were: five infected mosquitoes for the epidemiological-based surveillance, or 50% of mean pre-control adult mosquito abundance for demographic-based surveillance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s002">S1 Table</xref>).

For each combination of surveillance method and treatment threshold, we examined three types of coordination.

We examined three alternate assumptions about the costs of coordination: no costs, costs in time, and costs in resources. In the &#x0201c;no costs&#x0201d; scenario, we assume coordination causes no change in the timing or efficacy of larval control. In the &#x0201c;costs in time&#x0201d; scenario, we assume coordination causes delays in treatment. In the &#x0201c;costs in resources&#x0201d; scenario, we assume that coordination reduces larvicide efficacy in each treated patch.</p><p>Coordinating with nearby patches may delay control implementation because it takes time for jurisdictions to communicate their surveillance findings with each other. In addition, staff employed in coordination efforts may reduce staff available for control, resulting in additional delays (even if it does not otherwise reduce efficacy). Under this &#x0201c;costs in time&#x0201d; scenario, we assumed that the greater the scale of coordination, the greater the delay it causes. Thus, nearest neighbor coordination causes control in all treated patches to be delayed by one additional day and second nearest neighbor coordination causes control in all treated patches to be delayed by two additional days.</p><p>If the agencies or individuals responsible for control have limited financial resources, money spent on coordination may mean less money available to spend on actual treatment. There may therefore be a trade-off between treatment efficacy (defined as the fraction of larvae killed by treatment) and the scale of coordination. In previous work [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], it was assumed that treatment is 100% effective (all larvae in a treated patch are killed). Under this &#x0201c;costs in resources&#x0201d; scenario, we assume that there is 100% treatment efficacy only in the absence of coordination, and that coordination reduces efficacy, with greater scales of coordination causing greater reductions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s002">S1 Table</xref>). A sensitivity analysis indicated that an initial treatment efficacy less than 100% does not substantially alter our results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s004">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007870.s005">S2</xref> Figs).

In keeping with previous work, for each simulation run, 16 out of 20 patches were chosen randomly to participate in surveillance and treatment [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This is to simulate the realistic scenario in which not all patches can participate in surveillance for reasons unrelated to mosquito or disease dynamics (such as inaccessibility or private land).

Population control of the mosquito vectors that transmit these infections remains the main tool for mitigating epidemics. However, the often cryptic and patchily distributed habitat in which these mosquitoes oviposit makes control resource-intensive [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and makes it difficult for all patches in the landscape to participate in surveillance and treatment.</p><p>In addition, the greatest disease burden of many arboviruses occurs in resource-limited regions of Latin America and southeast Asia [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] where there may be limited staff and funds available for vector control.

When control agencies can enact highly sensitive surveillance based on the number of adult mosquitoes, there is little to be gained from coordination, and even small costs in either time or resources are likely to outweigh the benefits. This is mostly because at high sensitivity of detection, very high reduction in infections can be accomplished without coordination among patches. However, this level of sensitivity most likely represents an uncommon, best-case scenario, particularly in low income countries.</p><p>When demographic surveillance is less sensitive or when control decisions are based on surveillance of infected mosquitoes, coordination between adjacent patches can substantially improve epidemic control outcomes compared to each patch enacting control independently. This benefit of coordination persists even when it causes a delay in treatment or a reduction in resources available for larval control. When surveillance is epidemiological, the ideal spatial scale for coordination of mosquito control is the scale over which adult mosquitoes migrate (adjacent patches). When surveillance is demographic, coordinating on a larger spatial scale can be beneficial if it does not reduce the efficacy of treatment within patches. While we assumed in this study that larvicide treatment in completely effective, assuming a lower effectiveness did not substantially alter our conclusions, except when surveillance was based on total mosquito abundance and less sensitive, and when coordination was costly in resources. In that case, a lower initial efficacy meant that any reduction in efficacy resulting from coordination costs resulted in more human infections than no coordination among patches.</p><p>Previous work has found that larval control based on surveillance of adult mosquito numbers is much more effective at reducing human infections than control based on surveillance of mosquito infections [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our results show that even with coordination, epidemiological surveillance does not achieve the same reduction in human infections as demographic surveillance (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007870.g003">3</xref>).

In addition, chemical larvicide may have environmental side effects that must be balanced against disease prevention. While we assumed in this study that surveillance focused on adult mosquitoes, surveillance of larval mosquito numbers is used as well [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and previous work suggests that the sensitivity of surveillance information can influence which surveillance target is best for reducing human infections [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Overall, our findings suggest that greater coordination among local vector control agents has significant potential to reduce the severity of mosquito-borne epidemics, but accurate estimations of the costs associated with coordination are needed to inform best practices for mosquito control implementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007870.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>This methods appendix contains the full set of SIR-type difference equations we used to model disease dynamics and mosquito population dynamics.</title><p>These equations are adapted from [<xref rid="pntd.0007870.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007870.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007870.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>This table contains the name and definition of each parameter used in the model, along with the values used in our model simulations.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007870.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007870.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>This table contains the name and definition of each variable that appears in the model.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007870.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007870.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of treatment efficacy on the benefits of coordination when control is based on surveillance of adult mosquitoes.</title><p>Blue lines (None) show the reduction in human infections when larval control is enacted only in patches that exceed the surveillance threshold.

</p><p>Dear Dr. Lemanski:</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Coordination among neighbors improves the efficacy of Zika control despite economic costs" (#PNTD-D-19-01701) for review by PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Your manuscript was fully evaluated at the editorial level and by independent peer reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important problem, but raised some substantial concerns about the manuscript as it currently stands. These issues must be addressed before we would be willing to consider a revised version of your study. We cannot, of course, promise publication at that time.</p><p>We therefore ask you to modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations before we can consider your manuscript for acceptance. Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer. </p><p>When you are ready to resubmit, please be prepared to upload the following:</p><p>(1) A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.</p><p>(2) Two versions of the manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed (uploaded as a "Revised Article with Changes Highlighted" file); the other a clean version (uploaded as the article file).</p><p>(3) If available, a striking still image (a new image if one is available or an existing one from within your manuscript). If your manuscript is accepted for publication, this image may be featured on our website. Images should ideally be high resolution, eye-catching, single panel images; where one is available, please use 'add file' at the time of resubmission and select 'striking image' as the file type. </p><p>Please provide a short caption, including credits, uploaded as a separate "Other" file. If your image is from someone other than yourself, please ensure that the artist has read and agreed to the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution License at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/content-license">http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/content-license</ext-link> (NOTE: we cannot publish copyrighted images). </p><p>(4) If applicable, we encourage you to add a list of accession numbers/ID numbers for genes and proteins mentioned in the text (these should be listed as a paragraph at the end of the manuscript). You can supply accession numbers for any database, so long as the database is publicly accessible and stable. Examples include LocusLink and SwissProt.</p><p>(5) To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/submission-guidelines#loc-methods">http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/submission-guidelines#loc-methods</ext-link></p><p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/</ext-link> PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email>figures@plos.org</email>.</p><p>We hope to receive your revised manuscript by Feb 06 2020 11:59PM. If you anticipate any delay in its return, we ask that you let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email.</p><p>To submit a revision, go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pntd/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pntd/</ext-link> and log in as an Author. You will see a menu item call Submission Needing Revision. You will find your submission record there. </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Sassan Asgari</p><p>Guest Editor</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>Serap Aksoy</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>***********************</p><p>While both reviewers have found the work and the question interesting, reviewer 2 has a major concern with the applicability of the modelling to Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti. Addressing this concern, in particular, and others are important in determining the suitability of the work for publication.</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold></p><p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p><p><bold>Methods</bold></p><p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p><p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p><p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p><p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: -Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p><p>Yes</p><p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>Yes. </p><p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p><p>n/a</p><p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p><p>No.</p><p>-Can you describe where the parameter values were derived from or the reasoning for the chosen values?</p><p>- The parameter assumptions about proportions of larvae killed in treated/untreated areas may not be accurate.

The abstract references surveillance, the title references control. Can the authors standardize those?

Spell out first instance of SIR.</p><p>7. Need instructions in the manuscript for accessing the data.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This paper considers the spread of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus between controlled and non-controlled areas and asks how coordination between these areas might benefit disease control even under conditions where this coordination is costly in terms of time or resources. </p><p>Lines 84-94 describe an interesting scenario and give good reason for asking the proposed research question, but it isn&#x02019;t clear to me that this scenario is applicable to Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus. The adults of these species have a very short flight span, and it seems that only under rare occasions would these adults be traveling between controlled and non-controlled patches. If we imagine control within a city, that control is already being coordinated within the city, and these Aedes species are unlikely to travel outside of the city in their adult stage. It is hard to imagine patches of adult migration range that would be under different treatment schedules. </p><p>Even if we think about the edges of different neighborhoods within a city that may be treated a different times for larval control, we would have to imagine a scenario under which there is no adulticide being applied or that it is being applied infrequently enough that there is a window of time during which the adults would travel between these neighborhoods and could find untreated pools in which to lay eggs. It&#x02019;s not clear that those windows of time are that great (a few days at most?) within an average city in these endemic areas. </p><p>This paper&#x02019;s hypothesis would be better supported with some description of control plans in endemic areas and more background on control in general so that the reader may better evaluate the likelihood of the situations described. </p><p>Many places use larval surveillance methods (generally cheaper and less labor-intensive than adult surveillance)&#x02026;. would the results change if larval surveillance and larval control were the focus? Can you further elaborate on this limitation?</p><p>--------------------</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
