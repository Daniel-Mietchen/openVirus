<p>The severity of outcome elicited a further investigation into the cause of disease. The clinical syndrome of decreased consciousness, fever, and seizures in absence of malaria parasitaemia (ruling out cerebral malaria) were suggestive of an encephalitis [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, parechovirus, enterovirus, mumps, and rubella virus were performed in CSF, but all were negative. Considering the absent pleiocytosis and normal CSF glucose and protein, a bacterial cause was unlikely, yet to further exclude this cause, real-time PCRs for 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> were performed. These tests also were negative.
