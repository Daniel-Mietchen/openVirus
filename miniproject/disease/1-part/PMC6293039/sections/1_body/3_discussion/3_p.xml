<p>Thus far, the patient described here is the only patient identified with a Ntwetwe virus infection. The prevalence of Ntwetwe virus infection, therefore, currently remains unknown. Phylogenetically, Ntwetwe virus clusters with the Anopheles-Tataguine clade, of which all viruses are transmitted by 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], making Ntwetwe virus a likely arbovirus. 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes are highly prevalent in Uganda [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and may thus increase the likelihood of human infections. Additionally, many orthobunyaviruses have non-human mammalian reservoirs [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Western Uganda is exceptionally biodiverse, with a high concentration of national parks, wildlife reserves, and forest reserves where such animal reservoirs may exist (

 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Besides, rapid growth in the human population and deforestation have recently increased human interactions with such animals in exactly this region [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], increasing the chances for zoonoses to emerge, as demonstrated by recent outbreaks of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever virus and Rift Valley fever virus, 2 zoonotic bunyaviruses, near Ntetwe village (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, because of the potential human exposure and severe disease of the patient, we believe there is an urgent need to investigate the prevalence of Ntwetwe virus infections.
