 </sup>. Because the serotype of the influenza virus is not included, it is not clarified in the weekly report. In Japan, type A cases often prevail prior to type B cases, but sometimes, they occur at almost the same time like in the case of the 2010â€“2011 epidemic. According to the Implementation manual for the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases Program, sentinel sites for laboratory-based surveillance are to send at least one specimen per reporting interval. If information on serotype and strain is quantitatively clarified by appropriate sampling, it may be easier to more accurately predict transmission among jurisdictions by comparing the viruses prevailing in each jurisdiction. However, it is essential to carefully examine and evaluate the cost and benefits associated with the aggregation and identification of a viral serotype or strain.
