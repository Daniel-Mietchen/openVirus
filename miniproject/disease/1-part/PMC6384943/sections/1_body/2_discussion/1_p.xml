 <sub>t</sub> was estimated using Weekly CPS of the influenza epidemic from 2010 to 2011 in Miyazaki Prefecture. Despite the deviation from their original definition, pre-epidemic warnings were issued when

 <sub>t</sub> exceeded 1.0, and the timing of pre-epidemic warning is probably reasonable even when the features associated with influenza epidemic such as human movement and serial interval were considered. It was also indicated that inter-jurisdictional infections triggered secondary epidemics in some jurisdictions.
