<p id="Par17">Our study has four major limitations partly at least due to data availability. First, the population influx and efflux among jurisdictions could have been over-estimated because the data were not summarized for a single PHC unit in the national population census though the number of people moving between cities is considered. Therefore, it is possible that the movement of populations from one jurisdiction to another could include the movement of populations from one city included in a jurisdiction to another city belonging to the same jurisdiction. However, in line with this,

 <sub>t</sub> in each jurisdiction may be under-estimated, and the conclusions of this study would not have been substantially altered. Second, analyses were conducted without identification of the viral serotype or strains because of the nature of NESID described above. The third limitation was the availability of public daily data. To our knowledge, there were no publicly available data on daily cases in each jurisdiction and on daily human movement. Thus, any difference between the movement or cases on weekdays and on weekends was not considered in this study. Consequently, there was no other way but to conduct estimations based on an approximated value. However, Weekly CPS could be assumed to have a representative as the data of the week because the pre-epidemic and the epidemic warning are originally to be issued based on Weekly CPS. One of our aims was to confirm the consistency between the two evaluations of the epidemic (i.e. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> based evaluation and that based on Weekly CPS). Therefore,

 <sub>t</sub> was assumed to be the weekly altered index in this study. At the same time, if the movement on weekend greatly contributed to the epidemic, Weekly CPS and the weekly

 <sub>t</sub> might reflect the situation to some extent. To investigate the representativeness of weekly based evaluation, difference between weekly and daily based evaluation has to be compared in future studies. The last limitation is that no difference between clinics and hospitals was considered in this study. It is likely that more patients are examined in hospitals compared with clinics. However, according to the Implementation manual for the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases Program, patient sentinel sites are supposed to be determined in order to be able to grasp the status of infectious diseases in the entire prefecture as much as possible, considering the distribution of population and medical institutions. Furthermore, the pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings were issued based on Weekly CPS, which is calculated by dividing the number of weekly reported cases by the number of influenza sentinel sites, with no coefficient reflecting the types of influenza sentinel sites. For our aim, although bias could not be ruled out, the impact of the bias would not be very large.
