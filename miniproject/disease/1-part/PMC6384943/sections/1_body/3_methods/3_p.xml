<p id="Par21">The night-time population in a national population census in 2010 was defined as the population in each jurisdiction. Human movement between jurisdictions was also quantified by a national population census conducted in 2010. The census was summarized in a unit of city, town, or village in Miyazaki Prefecture, and each jurisdiction of PHC included more than one city, town, or village. Thus, municipal night-time, day-time, and inflow and outflow populations were tallied for each jurisdiction, and we estimated the number of people who moved from 
 <italic>j</italic> to 
 <italic>i</italic> (
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub>), where 
 <italic>j</italic> also denoted nine jurisdictions and the imaginary “other prefecture”. Data on efflux and influx of population between a jurisdiction in Miyazaki Prefecture and another prefecture (i.e. Kagoshima, Kumamoto, or Oita Prefecture) as well as vice versa were not fully represented in the national population census. Thus, the population of an imaginary “other prefecture” was defined as the average population of Kagoshima, Kumamoto, and Oita Prefecture.
