 <sub>t</sub> was higher than 1.0 at all jurisdictions without Takachiho in the week of secondary epidemics when Weekly CPS was initially over 10.0. The ratio of the expected value of daily cases of infections from other jurisdictions to that of infections within each jurisdiction was evaluated to estimate the contribution of internal and external infections (namely those prevalent within and outside a particular jurisdiction, respectively) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Consequently, in Miyakonojo, Kobayashi, and Hyuga, the ratio was higher than 1.0 in the early stage of the secondary epidemic. In Miyakonojo, Weekly CPS was higher than 1.0 at the 14
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2011, and the ratios at the 10
 <sup>th</sup>, 11
 <sup>th</sup>, and 12
 <sup>th</sup> week were 2.4, 97.0, and 105.3, respectively. In Kobayashi, Weekly CPS was higher than 10.0 at the 13
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2011, and the ratios at the 10
 <sup>th</sup> and 11
 <sup>th</sup> week were 1.1 and 56.2, respectively. In Hyuga, Weekly CPS was higher than 10.0 at the 13
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2011, and the ratios at the 10
 <sup>th</sup> and 11
 <sup>th</sup> week were 7.7 and 1.4, respectively. The ratio was always lower than 1.0 from the first epidemic to the secondary epidemic in other jurisdictions except Takachiho, where no secondary epidemic was observed. Thus, it was indicated that there were two types of secondary epidemics. Infections from other jurisdictions contributed more strongly to secondary epidemics at Miyakonojo, Kobayashi and Hyuga.
