 </sup>, both type A and type B cases were prevalent during the influenza season from 2010 to 2011. The number of virus detections on the prefecture level and weekly reported cases per sentinel are shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> since the virus types and the detected jurisdiction were noted until the 51
 <sup>st</sup> week of 2010, and no jurisdiction has been noted after that. Although that surveillance did not provide a complete census, A(H3)Hong Kong were dominant until the 47
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2010, and infections in Takanabe and Hyuga in 2010 were probably due to this virus type. A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected only in Miyakonojo until the 49
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2010, and it was indicated that A(H1N1)pdm09 spread from Miyakonojo. Both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3)Hong Kong were prevalent in the first epidemic, though A(H1N1)pdm09 was not detected after 8
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2011. Therefore, it is reasonable that the secondary epidemics in all jurisdictions except Takachiho were mainly caused by A(H3)Hong Kong. Type B virus was sporadically detected throughout the influenza season from 2010 to 2011, but the association between the epidemic and type B virus was not clearly estimated.
