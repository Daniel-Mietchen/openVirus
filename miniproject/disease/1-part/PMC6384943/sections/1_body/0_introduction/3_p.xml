<p id="Par4">Pre-epidemic warnings are issued when the weekly reported number of influenza cases per sentinel (Weekly CPS) in a jurisdiction of PHC exceeds 10.0. The reference value of 10.0 was determined based on some probabilities, such as sensitivity (i.e. the probability that a pre-epidemic warning is issued within four weeks before the epidemic warning), specificity (i.e. the probability that no pre-epidemic warning is issued based on a false suspicion of an epidemic occurrence in the future) and positive predictive value (i.e. the probability that an epidemic warning is issued within four weeks after the pre-epidemic warning), which were 0.60–0.70, 0.95–0.98 and 0.20–0.30, respectively, over the last five years

 </sup>. Epidemic warnings are issued when Weekly CPS in a PHC jurisdiction exceeds 30.0. If an epidemic warning has been issued in the past week, it will not be cancelled until the value is lower than 10.0. The reference value for epidemic warnings was also set according to a 1% probability for the occurrence of a series of epidemic warnings in the past five years
