<p id="Par5">Meanwhile, the effective reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub>) is defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical case in that particular population

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. When 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> is higher than 1.0, the number of cases is expected to increase. However, it is expected to decrease when 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> is lower than 1.0. Therefore, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> is considered useful in the evaluation of the transmissibility of infectious diseases
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. However, few studies have reported on the association between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> and pre-epidemic or epidemic warnings. At present, the reference value of the pre-epidemic and epidemic warning are set based on Weekly CPS, without considering the characteristic of the infectious disease. One of our aims was to confirm the consistency between the two evaluations on the epidemic (i.e. the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> based evaluation considering factors associated with the influenza epidemic such as human movement, and the evaluation based on current reference value). We also aimed to clarify why secondary epidemics occur by estimating 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub>. In this study, a secondary epidemic is defined as a series of infected events, in which Weekly CPS exceeds 10.0 again after it had decreased to below 10.0. This is because the pre-epidemic warning is issued when Weekly CPS is more than 10.0, and the epidemic warning ends when it becomes less than 10.0.
