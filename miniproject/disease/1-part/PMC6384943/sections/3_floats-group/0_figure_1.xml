  <p>Observed and estimated epidemic cases by a spline and mathematical model. The weekly number of reported cases per sentinel (blue bar) as well as cases per sentinel estimated using a spline model (orange bar) and cases per sentinel estimated according to a mathematical model assuming the validity of the spline model (grey bar) are shown. The thresholds both for pre-epidemic (10.0) and epidemic warning (30.0) are also shown in yellow dotted line and blue dotted line, respectively. Pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are issued when Weekly CPS exceeds 10.0 and 30.0, respectively. Epidemic warnings are cancelled when Weekly CPS is lower than 10.0. Cases in Miyazaki city, Chuo, Miyakonojo, Nobeoka, Nichinan, Kobayashi, Takanabe, Takachiho, and Hyuga are shown in (
   <bold>a</bold>â€“
   <bold>i</bold>), respectively.
