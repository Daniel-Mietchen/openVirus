Currently, reference values are set for the weekly reported number of influenza cases per sentinel, and pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are issued based on these values. In this study, we examined the association between these reference values and the effective reproduction number (<italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub>) using surveillance data for Miyazaki Prefecture collected from 2010 to 2011. There are nine public health centre jurisdictions in this prefecture, and <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> exceeded 1.0 at the time when pre-epidemic warnings were issued in almost all the jurisdictions. Thus, it was indicated that the validity of the reference value was also high for influenza transmission. However, our results indicated the presence of secondary epidemic caused by infections originating both from other jurisdictions and inner jurisdictions, and it is occasionally not possible to evaluate the end of an epidemic in a jurisdiction using only the reference value of termination. It is necessary to establish new methods after considering the situation in the surrounding jurisdictions for more detailed epidemic predictions.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Seasonal influenza is a respiratory infectious disease caused by the influenza virus, and it occurs annually during winter months. In Japan, influenza is designated as a Category V infectious disease by the Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (the Infectious Diseases Control Law) executed in 1999. Based on this law, seasonal influenza is listed as a target illness of the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and specific medical facilities such as influenza sentinel sites are expected to report the number of cases to public health centre (PHCs) weekly. Data tallied up in increments of PHC. The number of patients per influenza sentinel site under the jurisdiction of each PHC is publicly available on Public Health Institute websites. Data on the reporting criteria of influenza are also provided. The administrators of influenza sentinel sites are expected to notify cases every Monday if a physician has examined a patient or deceased individual with influenza-specific clinical signs and symptoms, if a patient is suspected to have influenza or if a patient exhibits all symptoms (i.e. sudden onset, high fever, upper respiratory tract inflammation, and general malaise or other systemic symptoms). Notification is also necessary if all four symptoms are not observed, but the presence of a viral antigen is detected by a rapid diagnostic kit using nasal cavity aspirate, nasal cavity swab, and throat swab. Reporting criteria for sentinel hospitals are separately stipulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Seasonal influenza is a threat to public health, and issuing of pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings can prevent potential epidemics. A pre-epidemic warning signifies that a massive epidemic can occur within the next four weeks, while an epidemic warning is issued when there are suspicions that a massive epidemic is ongoing or has been persisting. Pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are basically issued in PHC units, contributing to the early grasp of infection spread and provision of a heads-up to PHC jurisdictions.</p><p id="Par4">Pre-epidemic warnings are issued when the weekly reported number of influenza cases per sentinel (Weekly CPS) in a jurisdiction of PHC exceeds 10.0. The reference value of 10.0 was determined based on some probabilities, such as sensitivity (i.e. the probability that a pre-epidemic warning is issued within four weeks before the epidemic warning), specificity (i.e. the probability that no pre-epidemic warning is issued based on a false suspicion of an epidemic occurrence in the future) and positive predictive value (i.e. the probability that an epidemic warning is issued within four weeks after the pre-epidemic warning), which were 0.60&#x02013;0.70, 0.95&#x02013;0.98 and 0.20&#x02013;0.30, respectively, over the last five years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Epidemic warnings are issued when Weekly CPS in a PHC jurisdiction exceeds 30.0. If an epidemic warning has been issued in the past week, it will not be cancelled until the value is lower than 10.0. The reference value for epidemic warnings was also set according to a 1% probability for the occurrence of a series of epidemic warnings in the past five years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Meanwhile, the effective reproduction number (<italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub>) is defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical case in that particular population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. When <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> is higher than 1.0, the number of cases is expected to increase. However, it is expected to decrease when <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> is lower than 1.0. Therefore, <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> is considered useful in the evaluation of the transmissibility of infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, few studies have reported on the association between <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> and pre-epidemic or epidemic warnings. At present, the reference value of the pre-epidemic and epidemic warning are set based on Weekly CPS, without considering the characteristic of the infectious disease. One of our aims was to confirm the consistency between the two evaluations on the epidemic (i.e. the <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> based evaluation considering factors associated with the influenza epidemic such as human movement, and the evaluation based on current reference value). We also aimed to clarify why secondary epidemics occur by estimating <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub>. In this study, a secondary epidemic is defined as a series of infected events, in which Weekly CPS exceeds 10.0 again after it had decreased to below 10.0. This is because the pre-epidemic warning is issued when Weekly CPS is more than 10.0, and the epidemic warning ends when it becomes less than 10.0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Descriptive epidemiological data of each PHC jurisdiction</title><p id="Par6">During the 2010&#x02013;2011 influenza season in Miyazaki Prefecture, the first case was reported in the Miyakonojo PHC; Weekly CPS in Miyakonojo was 0.3 at the 40<sup>th</sup> week in 2010 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In all the PHC jurisdictions, one or more phases in which Weekly CPS shifted from a decrease to an increase were observed, and a secondary epidemic defined in the introduction section was confirmed without Takachiho. According to a national population census conducted in 2010, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the population of each jurisdiction and the estimated number of people who moved between jurisdictions. The outflow population was large in the order of Takanabe, Miyakonojo, and Miyazaki city, and inflow population was in the order of Miyazaki city, Miyakonojo, and Takanabe. The ratio of population influx and efflux to the night-time population was large in the order of Takanabe, Chuo, and Hyuga with respect to influx and Chuo, Takanabe, and Kobayashi with respect to efflux. The epidemic ended in the 40<sup>th</sup> week of 2010, in which Weekly CPS was higher than 0 at least in one jurisdiction. Similarly, the epidemic started in the 27<sup>th</sup> week of 2011, and Weekly CPS became 0 in all the jurisdictions. Before the start of the epidemic, Weekly CPS continued to be 0 for two consecutive weeks from the 39<sup>th</sup> week in 2010, and also continued to be 0 for two consecutive weeks till the 26<sup>th</sup> week in 2011 after the end of the epidemic. Therefore, we evaluated the predictability of the spline model according to the Akaike&#x02019;s information criterion (AIC), which had the highest applicability when the beginning and end of the epidemic were set at the 38<sup>th</sup> week of 2010 and the 26<sup>th</sup> week of 2011, respectively.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Observed and estimated epidemic cases by a spline and mathematical model.

Consequently, in Miyakonojo, Kobayashi, and Hyuga, the ratio was higher than 1.0 in the early stage of the secondary epidemic.

Despite the deviation from their original definition, pre-epidemic warnings were issued when <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> exceeded 1.0, and the timing of pre-epidemic warning is probably reasonable even when the features associated with influenza epidemic such as human movement and serial interval were considered. It was also indicated that inter-jurisdictional infections triggered secondary epidemics in some jurisdictions.</p><p id="Par12">In Takachiho, two specific features were observed. One was that the lower 95% credible interval limits of <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> was not higher than 1.0 when the pre-epidemic warning was issued. Weekly CPS in Takachiho was over 10.0 at the 3rd week in 2011, and it was under 10.0 at the 8th week in 2011. The maximum value of Weekly CPS was 30.0, and it was the least among the nine jurisdictions. Furthermore, the number of influenza-associated medical facilities in Takachiho was also the lowest among the nine jurisdictions, and the estimated number of influenza patients was also the lowest. At the 3rd week in 2011, the lower 95% credible interval limits were higher than 1.0 in all jurisdictions except Takachiho. Therefore, it was likely that infection from other jurisdictions could cause the infection in Takachiho, and <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> in Takachiho at the 3rd week in 2011 could have been underestimated. The other feature was that the secondary epidemic was not observed in Takachiho. One possible reason for this might be the lowest ratio of population influx and efflux to the night-time population. It was possible that it might have been difficult for the secondary epidemic to occur since there might have been be a lower risk of infection from other jurisdictions.</p><p id="Par13">Both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3)Hong Kong were prevalent in first epidemic, and only A(H3)Hong Kong was mainly prevalent in the secondary epidemic. However, the items to be notified at influenza sentinel sites are surveillance period, name of medical facility, sex, and age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Because the serotype of the influenza virus is not included, it is not clarified in the weekly report. In Japan, type A cases often prevail prior to type B cases, but sometimes, they occur at almost the same time like in the case of the 2010&#x02013;2011 epidemic. According to the Implementation manual for the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases Program, sentinel sites for laboratory-based surveillance are to send at least one specimen per reporting interval. If information on serotype and strain is quantitatively clarified by appropriate sampling, it may be easier to more accurately predict transmission among jurisdictions by comparing the viruses prevailing in each jurisdiction. However, it is essential to carefully examine and evaluate the cost and benefits associated with the aggregation and identification of a viral serotype or strain.</p><p id="Par14">Nishiura <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the association between reporting and serial intervals, and concluded that an ideal reporting interval is the mean serial interval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Because the serial intervals of seasonal influenza, A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B range from 2 to 4 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> can be estimated with high accuracy if the reporting interval is set at approximately 3 days. Because weekly reports are aggregated in units of seven days, the average serial interval is greatly exceeded. Additionally, Nishiura <italic>et al</italic>. also proposed a correction method for estimating <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> in cases in which the reporting interval is not consistent with the serial interval. However, we focused not only on <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> estimation but also on the movement of populations and the consequent movement of infections between jurisdictions, and we used different models in this study. In the model adopted, data regarding the number of infected cases per day are necessary. Because the cumulative cases obtained by weekly reports during the epidemic roughly followed a cubic function, we estimated the number of infected cases per day by applying a cubic spline function as in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, because there were jurisdictions in which Weekly CPS and estimated value by the spline function deviated from each other, it was impossible to deny the existence of a possible bias associated with the estimated value. However, the observed and the estimated values were well-fitted, and the use of the spline function in this study was not necessarily denied.</p><p id="Par15">In Japan, the NESID has been conducted since 1999, and previous related studies have been reported. Murakami <italic>et al</italic>. analysed epidemic data from 1993 to 1997 in older regimes and suggested that the criteria for the start and end of epidemics in influenza-like disease was 30.0 and 10.0, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These criteria were re-evaluated in the year 2007 by Murakami <italic>et al</italic>., and they confirmed the presence of a few problems even if they were not modified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, in the influenza epidemic in Miyazaki Prefecture from 2010 to 2011, the epidemic occurred again even if Weekly CPS became lower than the reference value of 10.0 for the end of issuing the epidemic warning. In Miyazaki city, Chuo, Miyakonojo, Nobeoka, Nichinan, Kobayashi, Takanabe, and Hyuga, the numbers of weeks in which Weekly CPS was lower than 10.0 from the beginning of the first epidemic to the second pre-epidemic warning were 1, 1, 7, 4, 4, 5, 1, and 5 weeks, respectively. Our results indicated that there were two types of secondary epidemic defined in this study. One was caused by the infections from other jurisdictions, as was observed in Miyakonojo, Kobayashi, and Hyuga. In these cases, pre-epidemic warning effectively functioned because <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> was over 1.0 when Weekly CPS was over 10.0 again. However, to predict epidemics with high accuracy in a jurisdiction, the epidemic of neighbouring jurisdictions should be closely monitored. In other jurisdictions without Takachiho, secondary epidemics were mainly caused by the infections from the inner jurisdiction, and it was indicated that the first epidemic had not ended though Weekly CPS became lower than 10.0. There are several hypotheses to explain this. It is likely that the specific virus type was prevalent in the first epidemic, and infection with another virus type spread right after the first epidemic. In line with Murakami <italic>et al</italic>. who suggested the possibility that the local influenza epidemic would expand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, it is also possible that the distribution of influenza sentinel sites or patients did not have the representative necessary for predicting the epidemic, and Weekly CPS based prediction did not function well enough. In any case, it was suggested that the reference value based on Weekly CPS for the end of epidemic was not necessarily appropriate, and that there can be a limit to the prediction of the end of epidemic by CPS.</p><p id="Par16">In 2004, Murakami <italic>et al</italic>. reviewed pre-epidemic warnings against influenza-like diseases. They concluded that the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were 90.4, 93.7, and 23.9%, respectively, and that the validity of a reference value of 10.0 for pre-epidemic warning was high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, in this study, <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> exceeded 1.0 at the time of the issue of the pre-epidemic warning report, and we believe that new method of epidemic evaluation needs to be considered while setting the reference value for pre-epidemic warnings. Although the definition of the warning report is as described in the introduction, it was indicated that pre-epidemic warnings are useful as indices of the time to implement countermeasures against a future epidemic.</p><p id="Par17">Our study has four major limitations partly at least due to data availability. First, the population influx and efflux among jurisdictions could have been over-estimated because the data were not summarized for a single PHC unit in the national population census though the number of people moving between cities is considered. Therefore, it is possible that the movement of populations from one jurisdiction to another could include the movement of populations from one city included in a jurisdiction to another city belonging to the same jurisdiction. However, in line with this, <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> in each jurisdiction may be under-estimated, and the conclusions of this study would not have been substantially altered. Second, analyses were conducted without identification of the viral serotype or strains because of the nature of NESID described above. The third limitation was the availability of public daily data. To our knowledge, there were no publicly available data on daily cases in each jurisdiction and on daily human movement. Thus, any difference between the movement or cases on weekdays and on weekends was not considered in this study. Consequently, there was no other way but to conduct estimations based on an approximated value. However, Weekly CPS could be assumed to have a representative as the data of the week because the pre-epidemic and the epidemic warning are originally to be issued based on Weekly CPS. One of our aims was to confirm the consistency between the two evaluations of the epidemic (i.e. <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> based evaluation and that based on Weekly CPS). Therefore, <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> was assumed to be the weekly altered index in this study. At the same time, if the movement on weekend greatly contributed to the epidemic, Weekly CPS and the weekly <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub> might reflect the situation to some extent. To investigate the representativeness of weekly based evaluation, difference between weekly and daily based evaluation has to be compared in future studies. The last limitation is that no difference between clinics and hospitals was considered in this study. It is likely that more patients are examined in hospitals compared with clinics. However, according to the Implementation manual for the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases Program, patient sentinel sites are supposed to be determined in order to be able to grasp the status of infectious diseases in the entire prefecture as much as possible, considering the distribution of population and medical institutions. Furthermore, the pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings were issued based on Weekly CPS, which is calculated by dividing the number of weekly reported cases by the number of influenza sentinel sites, with no coefficient reflecting the types of influenza sentinel sites. For our aim, although bias could not be ruled out, the impact of the bias would not be very large.</p><p id="Par18">In conclusion, pre-epidemic warnings based on the current influenza surveillance system effectively functioned at least in the Miyazaki Prefecture. Considering the original definition of the pre-epidemic warning, the evaluation based on Weekly CPS was consistent with the evaluation based on <italic>R</italic><sub>t</sub>, including features of influenza. The timing of pre-epidemic warning was probably appropriate. However, the reference value for the end of the epidemic remains to be improved mainly because it did not necessarily reflect the epidemic of inner jurisdiction, at least in Miazaki prefecture. It is essential to evaluate the epidemic situation considering all the available information on the infectious disease, such as viral serotype, viral strain, and the epidemic situation in the surrounding jurisdiction. It is also necessary to establish a methodology to judge the end of the epidemic in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par19">As influenza epidemic data, we used Weekly CPS at a PHC jurisdiction (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>w</italic>)) from the 38<sup>th</sup> week in 2010 to the 26<sup>th</sup> week in 2011 in Miyazaki Prefecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Weekly CPS at one jurisdiction is calculated by dividing the number of weekly reported cases by the number of influenza sentinel sites.
