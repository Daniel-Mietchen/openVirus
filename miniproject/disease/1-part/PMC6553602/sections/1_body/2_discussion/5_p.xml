<p>However, we were unable to measure the impact of awareness of the scale of epidemics using the available data. Even though occasional peaks in the number of recorded deaths may be indicative of periods of low awareness, our analysis of seasonal trends only showed that awareness probably does not involve a strict seasonal component. Nevertheless, the effect of awareness on the reporting of LF incidence may be indirectly evident from the geographical distribution of LF cases over the last 6 years (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). The geographical area with newly reported LF cases has expanded in the last few years, presumably because of better recognition of the epidemics and improved capability of the surveillance system.</p>
