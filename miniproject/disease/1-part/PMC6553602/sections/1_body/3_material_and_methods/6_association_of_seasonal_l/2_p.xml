<p>To test for the significance of a causal relationship between the observed LF incidence and climatological variables, we employed an empirical dynamic modelling that is based on the convergent cross-mapping skill [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This method has previously been used to demonstrate the causal link between influenza transmission risk and humidity or temperature. The LF incidence was tested, searching for the significance of the association with one of the climatological variables, i.e. time series versus seasonal surrogates. The threshold of acceptance was chosen to be 0.01.
