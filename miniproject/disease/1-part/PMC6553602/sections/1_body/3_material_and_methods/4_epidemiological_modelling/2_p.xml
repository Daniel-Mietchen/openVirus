<p>First, we accounted for two transmission routes of LF infection, i.e. the animal-to-human route and the human-to-human transmission route. We specified a total exposure rate in weeks 
 <italic>w</italic> by a variable 
 <italic>e
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic>. This could be written as the sum of the two rates: 
 <italic>e
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> = 
 <italic>a
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> + 
 <italic>h
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic>, where 
 <italic>a
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic>h
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> are weekly exposure rates via animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission routes, respectively. An important estimate previously reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] indicated that 
 <italic>ca</italic> 19% of all infections are attributed to the human-to-human transmission route, leading to the following requirement: 
 <italic>h
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic>/(
 <italic>h
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> + 
 <italic>a
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic>) = 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.19. We can then express the total exposure rate 
 <italic>e
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> solely through the exposure rate 
 <italic>a
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> such that: 
 <italic>e
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic> = 
 <italic>a
  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic>/(1 âˆ’ 
 <italic>r</italic>). This expression was used in our framework to avoid a detailed modelling of the human-to-human transmission route. Owing to limited human-to-human transmission potential, we focused only on exposure to the virus through a contaminated environment.
