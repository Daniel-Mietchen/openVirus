<p>Growing human population, urbanization and global warming increase the chance of human interaction with wildlife, resulting in elevated risk of zoonotic diseases. Despite numerous publications assessing the risk factors for viral spillovers, published studies have tended to miss out quantitative estimation of their frequency and characteristics and causal links among different host species. In this study, we provide quantitative analysis of external forcing of infection, as applied to Lassa haemorrhagic fever (LF), a widespread disease in West Africa. The proposed modelling framework can be further extended to other diseases with common characteristics and viewed as key in light of anticipated emergence of a novel infectious disease in the future—the ‘Disease X’ as it was recently coined by the World Health Organization.</p>
