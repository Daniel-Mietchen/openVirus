<p>Observed LF incidence exhibits a strong seasonal component: the number of reported cases is likely to rise in the first two to three months of the year, exceeding the baseline over the rest of the year several-fold. This phenomenon can be captured by implementing a time-varied probability of exposure in our model. Two distinct time periods characterize a low and high risk of exposure to the virus. Importantly, the model fit allows the probable time boundaries of each period to be determined.</p>
