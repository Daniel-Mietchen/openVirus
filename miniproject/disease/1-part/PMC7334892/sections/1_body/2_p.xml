<p>Sugar feeding is thought to be common among most mosquito species, providing the necessary fuel for flight (
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Van Handel 1985</xref>) and is linked to survival and successful mating (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Foster 1995</xref>). Some studies have suggested that sugar-poor environments effectively limit the population or survivorship of adult mosquitoes (

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al. 2011</xref>), but 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Klowden (1986)</xref> demonstrated that host-seeking is not inhibited by sugar deprivation in female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, differing from the typical pattern seen in other mosquito species of one bloodmeal taken per gonotrophic cycle. Further research with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has suggested that they have evolved to become highly anthropophilic by feeding almost exclusively on humans with minimal feeding on sugar sources in nature (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Edman et al. 1992</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et al. 2001</xref>). Moreover, 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Costero et al. (1998a)</xref> observed a reproductive advantage in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> fed only human blood versus blood with sugar. This may partly explain 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoesâ€™ increased role in arboviral transmission in many locations.
