<p>An unexpected but interesting observation was the difference in overall mean sugar content between male 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (17.28 µg (±1.46) and 11.82 µg (±1.18), respectively); 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> had 32.8% more sugar. This difference between the species could be linked to variability in the time that feeding, swarming, and resting occurs. Reisen et al. discovered mosquitoes captured early in the morning were more likely to test positive for fructose than those captured after swarming (
