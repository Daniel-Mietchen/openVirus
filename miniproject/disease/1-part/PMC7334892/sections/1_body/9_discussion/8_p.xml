<p>Spatial heterogeneity in the availability of sugar sources is likely to influence that ability of mosquitoes to find and feed on sugar. In this study, the analysis of mean sugar content by location showed significant variation between the neighborhoods for male 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, perhaps indicating sugar-rich and sugar-poor environments. Regional variation in sugar availability was studied by 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Ibarra et al. (1997)</xref> in Southern Mexico. They found a significantly higher proportion of fructose-positive 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in sampling areas that had higher numbers of flowering plants (particularly bougainvillea and hibiscus) per house (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Ibarra et al. 1997</xref>). An interesting observation from our study was a difference between the two mosquito species as to which neighborhood had the highest mean sugar content. For male and female 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, mosquitoes collected at the Mile 5 location had the highest average sugar content, but for male and female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, La Pi√±ata seemed to have richer sugar resources. Perhaps 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes differ in their preference for certain types of plant sugars or their location of finding sugar (e.g., endophily vs exophily). A more detailed examination of the types of sugar in mosquitoes, such as those using liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, or DNA barcoding, could improve our ability to determine sources of sugar in nature (
