<p>This is also the first study to compare sugar content in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes collected by different methods in Texas. A similar study in California by 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Reisen et al. (1986)</xref> considered variation of sugar positivity in 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> mosquitoes between four methods of collection and demonstrated similar differences in the number of sugar-positive mosquitoes collected from resting traps as opposed to CO
 <sub>2</sub>-baited host-seeking traps, melon-baited carbohydrate-seeking traps, and aerial netting. For the current study, both 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> females caught in CDC Resting traps had a higher mean sugar content than those caught in the BGS2 trap, suggesting that the physiological state of the mosquito (resting or host-seeking) influences the amount of sugar detected. Aspirated 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> females had the highest mean sugar content (50.79 µg ± 19.52) of all groups and collection methods. However, the differences in mean sugar content between methods of collection was only statistically significant for female 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> and not for males, or for male and female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. We suspect statistical significance between trapping method for both sexes of both species would be observed with larger sample sizes. These results suggest that collection technique could greatly influence the results of any mosquito sugar feeding quantification study.
