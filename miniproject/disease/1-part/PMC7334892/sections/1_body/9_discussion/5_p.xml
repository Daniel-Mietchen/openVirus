<p>For Summer 2018 and Fall 2019 samples, we considered factoring mosquito wing length as a proxy for body size into our analysis. Using 3.5 Âµg as a baseline, we did not observe a significant relationship between wing length and sugar content for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus.</italic> Therefore, we did not incorporate body size into the analysis of sugar feeding in this study.
