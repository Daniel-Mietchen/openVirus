<p>This study from South Texas confirms that sugar feeding by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females is limited compared to their male counterparts, or when compared with male and female 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>. This idiosyncrasy helps explain the high propensity for vertebrate host-seeking in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females as blood meals are sought for both reproductive facilitation and energetics, thereby increasing its capacity for vector-borne pathogen transmission. In spite of this, detectable amounts of fructose were found in over 27% of the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females that we collected. This apparently higher rate of sugar feeding by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females in South Texas compared with other locations could be one factor resulting in lower human biting rates and, therefore, lower rates of arbovirus transmission. From our data, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> consistently took sugar meals in both fall and summer. However, we observed that the mean sugar content of mosquitoes was significantly influenced by trapping method. Future studies should examine how physiological condition and time since sugar meal influences results from wild populations. Sugar is an important component in many surveillance and control strategies for both 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, but determining preferred sugar sources is the critical next step to improving the effectiveness of these tools.
