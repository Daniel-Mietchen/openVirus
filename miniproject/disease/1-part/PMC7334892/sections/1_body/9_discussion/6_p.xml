<p>Another important consideration is the time since the last sugar meal. Presumably, mosquitoes caught at the time of feeding would have greater sugar content compared with those who had fed 2–3 d previously. This would likely explain why our 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> female which was aspirated from vegetation had 214.65 µg sugar. Rate of digestion would also influence the quantity of sugar detected. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Edman et al. (1992)</xref> released sugar-fed 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and were unable to detect sugar in the recaptured females after 4 d, suggesting they were not actively consuming more sugar in the wild. This concurs with Costero et al. who were able to detect sugar in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> up to 4 d post feeding on a 10% sucrose solution (
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Costero et al. 1998b</xref>). Other researchers have demonstrated nectar-fed mosquitoes can be anthrone-negative in as little as 20 h of digestion (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Andersson and Jaenson 1987</xref>). Therefore, further study comparing the rate of sugar digestion between 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes in a controlled laboratory environment is also warranted. If 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females are taking more frequent sugar meals in this location, the result could be fewer blood meals as demonstrated in the laboratory by 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Klowden (1986)</xref>.
