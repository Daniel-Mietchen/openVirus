<p>We collected additional 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in October 2019 and performed both ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ anthrone tests. The ‘hot anthrone’ test is a quantitative assay for total carbohydrates, while the ‘cold anthrone’ test demonstrates the presence of fructose and fructose-yielding carbohydrates (

 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Van Handel 1972</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Van Handel 1985</xref>). Using the ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ anthrone tests on a subsample of mosquitoes allowed us to compare our results with prior studies, which only utilized the ‘cold’ test. Using 7 µg as the baseline value as recommended by 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Costero et al. (1998b)</xref>, we found more than four times the percentage of females with detectable amounts of fructose (27.39%) than 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females in Puerto Rico (6%), as reported by Costero et al. and over eight times the percentage (3%) found in Thailand by 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Edman et al. (1992)</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document frequency of fructose feeding among female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> that is only slightly less than that of male 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti.</italic> Our observations indicate sugar feeding by female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is occurring in South Texas, suggesting surveillance and control methods that utilize sugar could be effective. Furthermore, increased sugar feeding could be allaying blood feeding frequency, as demonstrated by 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Foster and Eischen (1987)</xref> and may decrease pathogen transmission compared with nutritionally stressed mosquitoes, which 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Vaidyanathan (2008)</xref> demonstrated with 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and West Nile virus.
