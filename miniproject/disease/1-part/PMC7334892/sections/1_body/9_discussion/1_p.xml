<p>Previous studies indicate female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes feed preferentially on human blood, and rarely on sugar (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Edman et al. 1992</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et al. 2001</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Spencer et al. 2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Scott and Takken 2012</xref>). Our results support these observations showing that sugar content in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females was significantly lower than males in both seasons, and significantly lower than both male and female 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes. Female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes contained approximately 2 to 3 times less sugar than their male counterparts, or both male and female 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> in Fall of 2017 and Summer of 2018. We also compared the percentage of mosquitoes deemed ‘positive’ for sugar feeding and while the average sugar content of female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes was significantly lower than males, a substantial percentage of females (48.91%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 366) had a total sugar content ≥3.5 µg (~ 2 SDs above mean baseline value), suggesting sugar consumption was common in this region during these time periods. In a previous study, 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Costero et al. (1998b)</xref> adjusted this baseline for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females to 7 µg based on the fact that females fed only blood had a constant background detection of sugar that was higher than those fed only water, and also with the assumption that most field-caught females contained some blood in their abdomens. While we did not observe any blood in our specimens, if we were to apply this cutoff for considering a ‘positive’ result, only 99 out of 366 (27.05%) 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females would remain positive for total sugar.
