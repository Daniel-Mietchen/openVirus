<p>As early as 1873, adult 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes were observed sucking nectar from the flowers of 
 <italic>Ramnus frangula</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Knab 1907</xref>), and in 1958, both sexes of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes were observed frequently visiting flowers for nectar (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Downes 1958</xref>). However, we also know that nearly all female mosquitoes require a bloodmeal to develop eggs, and in some environments, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> have adapted to seldom feed on sugar, deriving needed energy from blood meals alone (

 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et al. 2001</xref>). Mosquitoes can become vectors of disease when they acquire blood from an infected host, but the frequency of biting may be allayed by sugar feeding. Hence, the choices mosquitoes make in obtaining food resources greatly impact pathogen transmission dynamics.
