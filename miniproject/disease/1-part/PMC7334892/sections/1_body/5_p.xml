<p>For male 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, sugar-feeding positively influences probability of survival, longevity, male reproductive physiology, including excitation of the antennal fibrillae, and insemination rates (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Chadee et al. 2014</xref>) and thus is an important factor in effective deployment of the Sterile Insect Technique and other genetically modified mosquito control strategies. The lethality of ATSB against female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes has been demonstrated in laboratory and field settings (
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Khallaayoune et al. 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Qualls et al. 2014</xref>), but the components which attract mosquitoes are still being studied. For example, Scott-Fiorenzano et al. found 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> more attracted to ATSB with the host kairomones lactic acid and octenol added as opposed to fruit-based attractants (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Scott-Fiorenzano et al. 2017</xref>). This concurred with 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Fikrig et al. (2017)</xref>, who found floral-based attractants and sugar mixtures previously identified in literature to be ineffective lures to ATSB stations or Gravid 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> Traps. Many contemporary mosquito management tools exploit mosquito sugar feeding behavior.
