<p>To quantify total sugar content of all mosquitoes, we utilized the hot anthrone test developed by Emile Van Handel (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Van Handel 1967</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Van Handel 1985</xref>). We validated the assay on laboratory colonies of 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (Sebring) and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Liverpool) reared from eggs in larval trays stored in a 37°C incubator with a 12:12 (L:D) h cycle. Larvae were fed a mix of liver powder and Brewer’s yeast in a 12:8-gram ratio per 100 ml sterile, deionized water (
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Puggioli et al. 2017</xref>). Baseline values were established by rearing 10 male and 10 female unfed mosquitoes of both species. Approximately 24 h post emergence, the mosquitoes were euthanized at −20°C and analyzed with the hot anthrone test.
