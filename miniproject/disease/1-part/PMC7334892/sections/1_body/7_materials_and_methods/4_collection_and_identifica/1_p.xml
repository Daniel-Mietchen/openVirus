<p>Collection techniques included Biogents Sentinel 2 (BGS2) (Biogents, Inc., Moorefield, WV), CDC Resting Traps (BioQuip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and Prokopack aspirators (John W. Hock Co., Gainesville, FL). BGS2 traps were placed outside the home, within one to three meters of the residence. Likewise, CDC resting traps were placed outside the home and separated from the BGS2 by one to three meters. Traps were allowed to operate for 24 h. All aspiration was conducted outside of the home for a 10-min period at each location in the natural vegetation as well as in and around sheds, abandoned vehicles, and wood piles. Mosquitoes were collected in the mornings between 8:00 and 11:00 a.m. Mosquitoes were collected from 30 unique residences in Indian Hills, 22 residences in La Pinata, 11 residences in Tierra Bella, 2 residences in Mercedes La Mesa, and 1 residence at the Mile 5 location. Mosquito specimens were transported to the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research &amp; Extension Center in Weslaco, TX, alive on ice packs in coolers, sorted by sex, and identified morphologically using
