<p>For the hot anthrone analysis, sugar standards were prepared by dissolving 25 mg of glucose in 25 ml of 25% ethanol to produce an initial 1:1 (50 µg/50 µl) concentration. From this, the following dilutions were prepared: 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20. A comparative blank was prepared with only 25% ethanol. Standards were run in duplicate for each 96-well plate with samples. For the cold anthrone analysis, fructose standards were prepared in the same manner with the exception of using 25 mg of fructose instead of 25 mg of glucose.</p>
