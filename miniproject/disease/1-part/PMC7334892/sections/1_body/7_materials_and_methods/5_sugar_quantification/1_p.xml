<p>After species and sex were confirmed, each mosquito was placed into a disposable, 75 mm glass test tube (VWR) and heat fixed for 30 min at 100°C to ensure that enzymatic activity ceased (Techne Dri-Block, Techne Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The entire mosquito (minus the right wing for those samples used as a proxy for mosquito size) was then homogenized in the test tube using a glass pestle. To each tube containing the homogenized mosquito, 200 µl of 2% sodium sulfate (NaSO
 <sub>4</sub>), followed by 1.5 ml of 1:2 chloroform methanol solution was added and stirred. The glycogen was absorbed to the NaSO
 <sub>4</sub> precipitate. Sample tubes were then centrifuged at 450 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min. Being careful not to disturb the pellet containing glycogen, the supernatant was carefully transferred to a new test tube and allowed to evaporate to approximately 200 µl by leaving the tubes open inside the fume hood for approximately 48 h at room temperature, or with the assistance of a heating block set to 95°C.
