<p>Subsequently, 750 mg of anthrone was mixed in by swirling. The reagent was allowed to cool and stored at 10°C. To each sample tube (containing ~200 µl of supernatant) and each of the 12 standard tubes, 3 ml of anthrone reagent was added. At this point, for the cold anthrone test, the samples and fructose standards were allowed to remain at room temperature for 75 min. Following this, each standard and sample tube was vortexed thoroughly and 100 µl of the resulting mixture was pipetted into a 96-well spectrophotometer plate. For greater accuracy, technical duplicates were analyzed and the average was taken. All tubes were then heated at 95°C for 17 min, allowed to cool for 10 min and vortexed to thoroughly mix. The presence of total carbohydrates was indicated by a greenish-blue color that tended to be most intense at the top of the tube, thus mixing was imperative. Using a fresh tip for each sample, 100 µl was transferred into the designated well on the 96-well spectrophotometer plate, in duplicate, as was performed with the cold assay. The plate was then analyzed on a spectrophotometer (Epoch, BioTek Instruments, Inc.) set for 625 nm. The quantity of fructose or total carbohydrates in the mosquito samples was determined by taking the optical density (OD), subtracting the value obtained for the blank (25% ETOH and anthrone) and then dividing the result by the slope obtained from the standard curve generated using the fructose or glucose standards. All total sugar and fructose values are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM).</p>
