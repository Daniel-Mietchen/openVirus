<p>To evaluate the effect of sugar content on wing length of female and male 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> we used a generalized linear model for count data on JMP 14 (SAS Institute Inc., NC) (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Dobson and Barnett 2008</xref>). For both the hot and cold anthrone tests a Poisson distribution with a log link function was used, with a Maximum Likelihood estimation method. The residuals were used to evaluate normality by Q-Q plots and the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test.
