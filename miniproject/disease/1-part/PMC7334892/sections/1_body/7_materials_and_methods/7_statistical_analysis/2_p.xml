<p>We used the Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test in GraphPad Prism 8.1.2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to detect differences in mean sugar content between male and female mosquitoes of both species, and also to detect differences in season. To compare percentages of mosquitoes containing ≥3.5 µg sugar content, a Chi-square analysis was performed. We also used Fisher exact test to compare percentage of fructose-positive mosquitoes. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare trapping method for each species and sex. Finally, we performed a Kruskall-Wallis, one-way ANOVA for each species and sex to detect significant differences between the mean sugar content at each location.
