<p>Alternatively, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes exhibit enhanced survivorship with increasing sucrose meal concentrations, but their ability to transmit West Nile virus actually decreases (

 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bowen 1992</xref>). Significant differences in longevity and fecundity of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens pallens</italic> were observed in mosquitoes reared on different flowering plants and seed pods (
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. 2016</xref>). Accordingly, heterogeneity in sugar resources could have a profound effect on when and where populations of mosquitoes can support arbovirus transmission among 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species as well.
