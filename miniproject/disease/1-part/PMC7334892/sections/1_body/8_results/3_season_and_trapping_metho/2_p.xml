<p>Both 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> females caught in summer 2018 with the resting trap had higher mean sugar content than their male counterparts. Additionally, female 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> caught in summer with an aspirator had the highest mean sugar content at 50.79 ± 19.52 µg (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> captured by CDC resting traps had significantly more sugar content than those captured by BGS2 for females (CDC resting: 23.86 ± 8.00 µg vs BGS2: 13.73 ± 3.21 µg; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0094) but not for males (CDC resting: 7.19 ± 1.85 µg vs BGS2: 13.60 ± 2.90 µg; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.4109) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The mean sugar content for female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was higher for specimens captured by resting traps and aspirator than for specimens captured by BGS2, although the difference was not statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.2761).
