<p>When compared by season and trapping method, the data follows a similar pattern. 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females had significantly less sugar content than 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> males in fall (September–December 2017 and October 2019) (9.29 ± 1.17 µg, 18.11 ± 1.58 µg, respectively) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and in summer (June 2018) (4.71 ± 1.51 µg, 9.58 ± 2.72 µg, respectively) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) No significant difference was observed between female and male 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> for fall (11.32 ± 1.75 µg, 11.84 ± 1.39 µg, respectively) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0518) or summer (22.85 ± 4.80 µg, 11.74 ± 2.03, respectively) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.6337) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Male and female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> captured in fall had significantly higher levels of total sugar from those captured in summer, but this was not observed in 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> samples collected in October 2019 were also analyzed by trapping method and location, but no significant differences were observed.
