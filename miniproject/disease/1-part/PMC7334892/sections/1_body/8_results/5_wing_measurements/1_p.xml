<p>Wing measurements were successfully obtained from 139 of 174 (79.9%) mosquitoes captured in summer, 2018 and 285 of 300 (95.0%) mosquitoes captured in fall, 2019. The mean wing length (±SEM) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> male and female mosquitoes was 2.01 ± 0.02 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 147) and 2.54 ± 0.02 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 183), respectively. For 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> male and females, the mean wing length (±SEM) was 2.55 ± 0.04 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26) and 2.81 ± 0.05 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 48), respectively. A statistically significant correlation between wing length and sugar content was not observed for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> males nor females using either cold (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.202) or hot (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.739) anthrone tests (

 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> wing length compared to sugar content using the same criteria and found no significant relationship (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.373) using the hot anthrone test (
