<p>The mean sugar content for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females was 8.63 µg (±1.03), compared to 15.02 µg (±1.98) for 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> female mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supp Table 2 [online only]</xref>). Among the male mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> had higher levels of sugar than 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, 17.28 µg (±1.46) and 11.82 µg (±1.19), respectively. After removing mosquitoes containing &lt;3.5 µg sugar from the dataset, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females had significantly less mean total sugar content of 17.00 µg (±1.90), compared to 24.40 µg (±3.06) for 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> females (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0050). Significant difference was also found in males with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> having mean total sugar content of 26.11 µg (±2.03), compared to 15.81 µg (±1.48) for 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0032). The difference in mean sugar content between male and female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was found to be significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) but there was no significant difference (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.207) between male and female 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0018) between male and female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes was also observed using the cold anthrone test where we detected 8.78 μg (±1.05) in males and 6.74 μg (±0.78) in females (
