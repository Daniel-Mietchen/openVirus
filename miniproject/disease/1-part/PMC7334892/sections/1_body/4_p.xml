<p>Our ability to conduct vector surveillance and control is inextricably linked to the feeding strategies and biology of these mosquitoes. For example, host-seeking traps are often baited with CO
 <sub>2</sub> or octenol and gravid oviposition traps use water with organic material whereas DNA preservation cards and attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSBs) exploit sugar consumption for surveillance and control. In Australia, researchers demonstrated the efficiency of detecting arboviruses on honey-soaked nucleic acid preservation cards placed in CO
 <sub>2</sub>-baited box traps (
