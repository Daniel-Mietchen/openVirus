 <p>This study would not have been possible without the support and willing participation of the residents in our study sites of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Additionally, we would like to thank the members of the team based at the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research and Extension Center in Weslaco, TX, for field collections, including Ester Carbajal, Edwin Valdez, and Courtney Avila. We would like to also thank Dr. Wendy Tang, Helena Hopson, and Victoria Kamilar for their invaluable assistance in the College Station laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University. Funding was provided by National Institutes of Health R21AI128953 and Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research Insect-Vectored Diseases Seed Grant.</p>
