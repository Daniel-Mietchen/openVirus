 </sup>. This antagonism of the type I IFN receptor (Ifnar) signaling in a species-specific manner by ZIKV explains the more severe pathogenesis of ZIKV infection in mice with immature or compromised immune systems compared to adult immunocompetent mice, and why disruption of the Ifnar1 signaling increases susceptibility of mice to lethal ZIKV infection. Accordingly, wild type mice treated with blocking anti-

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice following lethal ZIKV challenge. ZIKV-IG treatment at 24 hrs post-infection increased survival by reducing viral burden and ZIKV-induced tissue damage and inflammation in several key organs. These findings demonstrated that a single dose of ZIKV-IG is efficacious against lethal Zika disease in a highly stringent mouse challenge model.
