All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol number AP028-SS1-0615/AP00001029. All experiments included age- and sex-matched mice. At 5–6 weeks of age, mice were randomized at first by gender and secondly per weight. Mice were inoculated intravenously
