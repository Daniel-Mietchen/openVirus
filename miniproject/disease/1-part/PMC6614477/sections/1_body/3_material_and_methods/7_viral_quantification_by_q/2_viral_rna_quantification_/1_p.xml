<p id="Par24">RNA from serum and homogenized tissues were isolated using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), respectively. ZIKV RNA levels in sera and tissues were quantified by qRT-PCR. Specific primers and probes used are listed in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. Tissue RNA levels were normalized to 18S as described for Dengue RNA

 </sup> and expressed as genome equivalent per 18S (GE/18S), while serum RNA levels were expressed as GE/mL.
