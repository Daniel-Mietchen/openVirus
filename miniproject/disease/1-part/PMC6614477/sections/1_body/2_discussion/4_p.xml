 </sup>, treatment with various sub-protective doses of ZIKV-IG showed no evidence for ADE of ZIKV infection in our mouse model as suggested by both survival and viral RNA results. No increase in mortality or viral burden were observed even using low ZIKV-IG concentrations which are potentially sub-neutralizing. However, viral load data obtained through focus forming assays using BHK cells may not be appropriate for drawing conclusions around the presence or absence of ADE as BHK cells lack expression of Fcγ receptors that support the ADE mode of infection.
