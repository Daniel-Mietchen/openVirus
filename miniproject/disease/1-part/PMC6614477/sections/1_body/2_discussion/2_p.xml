 <sup>−/−</sup> mouse model of lethal ZIKV infection prevented both severe disease development and mortality. In addition, ZIKV-IG reduced ZIKV burden and ZIKV-induced tissue damage in target organs, confirming therapeutic potential against ZIKV infection. Recent outbreaks of several emerging and re-emerging viral diseases for which no approved treatment or vaccine exists have rekindled interest in the development of plasma-derived immunoglobulin therapeutic products. In our current study, we used human polyclonal IgG antibodies purified from convalescent donor plasma containing high titers of anti-ZIKV Abs. Plasma collection was based on criteria set by FDA and Emergent’s standards for virus screening and donor qualification. The immunoglobulin fraction was purified using a validated hyperimmune platform manufacturing process
