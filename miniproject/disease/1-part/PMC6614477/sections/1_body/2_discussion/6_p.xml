<p id="Par15">In summary, we report that a single administration of 50â€‰mg/kg of ZIKV-IG 24 hrs after infection protected mice against lethal ZIKV infection. Non-protective doses of ZIKV-IG did not induce ADE of ZIKV infection. These results provide the evidence that, at appropriate doses, ZIKV-IG treatment could be effective at preventing the deleterious effects of ZIKV in humans. Therefore, further testing in relevant pregnancy models to determine the impact of treatment on maternal and fetal infection is warranted.</p>
