<p id="Par5">To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ZIKV-IG against ZIKV infection, 
 <italic>Ifnar1</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with ZIKV (strain FSS13025, 1.0 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU/mouse, retro-orbital (r.o.) route) and then treated with ZIKV-IG (50, 10, 2, 0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg, r.o. route) 24 hrs post-infection (p.i.). ZIKV-IG used for this study exhibits high neutralization activity against multiple ZIKV strains, including strain FSS13025 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Animals were observed daily for survival, body weight changes and clinical signs of disease for day 21 p.i. For the entire study, vehicle control has been used as a negative control because the outcomes for animals treated with vehicle control were not significantly different to those observed in animals treated with a naïve-ZIKV-IG placebo, and significant differences were observed between 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG treated mice and both vehicle control (p = 0.0022) and naïve-ZIKV-IG (p = 0.0022) treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). A dose-dependent effect on mortality, weight changes and severity of ZIKV disease was observed in ZIKV-IG treated animals compared to those treated with vehicle control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Specifically, mice treated with the highest dose of ZIKV-IG (50 mg/kg) displayed a 100% survival rate, which was significantly greater than controls (0% survival, p = 0.0005), and similarly high survival rate was observed in mice treated with 10 mg/kg as compared to control mice (87.5% survival, p = 0.0042). Survival rates in the lower dose groups of 25%, 0%, and 0% (2, 0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively) were not statistically different than for control animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Similar patterns were observed in analysis of median time to death, with statistically significant increases in median time to death compared to controls for the 50 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose groups (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0008, respectively) but not for the lower dose groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As with mortality, the 50 mg/kg dose group showed reduced morbidity compared to the control group, with significantly different weight change and clinical score outcomes over the 21-day observation period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>). The 50 mg/kg dose group exhibited little to no weight loss and clinical signs of disease, while the 10 mg/kg dose group showed reduced morbidity compared to controls, but only in terms of clinical score outcomes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) and not in terms of body weight (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). In contrast, the lowest dose groups ( ≤ 2 mg/kg) exhibited progressive deterioration of weight (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and clinical score (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) beginning at day 6 p.i. and extending to time of death or severe disease necessitating euthanasia. These data indicate that the 50 mg/kg dose is the most efficacious of the doses tested against ZIKV infection in this mouse model.
