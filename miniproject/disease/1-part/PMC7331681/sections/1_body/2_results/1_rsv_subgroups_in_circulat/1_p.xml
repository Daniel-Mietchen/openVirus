<p id="Par9">Respiratory samples were from children with the mean age of 2.45 years and a male-to-female ratio of 1 to 0.8. From January 2012 to December 2018, approximately one in ten samples (13.2%, 1,082/8,209) tested positive for RSV. Among RSV-positive samples, 46 children contributed two RSV-positive samples on two separate occasions (median time between infections, 13 months; range, 4–35 months) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). One child tested positive for RSV every year from 2016 to 2018. Most children who tested positive for RSV were one year of age or younger, and the average age of children with RSV infection did not appear to change from year to year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The highest proportion of monthly RSV-positive samples appeared between July and November, which coincided with the local rainy season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although both RSV-A and RSV-B co-circulated during this time, RSV-A predominated in 2012 and 2018, while RSV-B was predominant in 2017. Both subgroups co-circulated equally from 2014 to 2016.
