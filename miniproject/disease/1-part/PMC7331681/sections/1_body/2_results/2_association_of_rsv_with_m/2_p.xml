<p id="Par11">Assuming that future disease incidence can be predicted based on historical observations, we performed the ARIMA test and fitted the actual observed incidence of RSV with several univariate ARIMA (, , )(, , ) models using different orders. Among the ARIMA univariate models, the ARIMA (1,0,0)(2,1,0)
 <sub>12</sub> had the best-fitted performance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We next examined several ARIMA models with one or more climate factors at significant lags to find the most appropriate models. From several significant multivariate models, we first tested the ARIMA model for one climate variable as input series. The model with temperature at lag 4 had the smallest AIC and smallest predicted RMSE. We further screened the ARIMA models including two or three climate factors for coefficients presenting the highest significance. For two or three climate factors, no model was found to improve the AIC, fitted or predicted RMSE (data not shown). However, the ARIMA (1,0,0)(2,1,0)
 <sub>12</sub> model with temperature at lag 4 appeared most suitable. From January to December 2018, the forecasting of the monthly incidence of RSV with ARIMA (1,0,0)(2,1,0)
 <sub>12</sub> utilized temperature data from the previous four months, which yielded the prediction of the expected results for RSV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). When considering the lag periods (delays in effect) of 4 months for the influence of temperature on the number of RSV cases, the ARIMAX (1,0,0)(2,1,0)
 <sub>12</sub> with temperature forecast model closely resembled the actual observed incidence of RSV for 2018 and was within the relatively large 90% confidence interval.
