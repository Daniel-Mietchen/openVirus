<p id="Par10">Since the prevalence of RSV spiked periodically and appeared seasonal, the potential association between increased RSV activity and various climate factors was examined. Annual fluctuations in the RSV prevalence appeared to coincide with the amount of rainfall and relative humidity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In some years, RSV activity increases with the increasing rainfall and relative humidity with no lag time (lag 0). However, associations between RSV with the wind speed and temperature showed lags of several months. We therefore performed Spearman’s rank correlation test, which suggests that peak RSV prevalence may lag the wettest month of the year by up to two months (lag 1 and lag 2) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Interestingly, peak monthly prevalence of RSV may occur as long as four months after the month with the highest average temperature (lag 4). Analysis using partial correlation similarly confirmed the association for most climate factors, although correlation observed between RSV activity and relative humidity over lag 0 was not significant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
