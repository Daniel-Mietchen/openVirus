<p id="Par8">To test the model-based prediction of RSV infections derived from meteorological data, another ARIMA model was used for the time period from January 2012 to December 2017 (referred to as the estimation period) and evaluated by comparing the predicted versus the observed incidence of RSV for the entire 2018 year. Using the ARIMA model based on the monthly number of RSV confirmed cases, we then examined the relative risk and lag effects in greater detail by fitting lag models that included relative humidity, rainfall, temperature, and wind speed terms at each lag period for as long as 4 months. Root mean square error (RMSE) was used to compare the prediction accuracy from each model, and the model which has the lowest RMSE was deemed as the best model. For statistical tests, P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using R software, version 3.6.1 (

Moreover, the sequence stationarity was tested by the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test using the R software, version 3.6.1, which enabled the use of untransformed time sequence monthly percentage of RSV from 2012 to 2018.
