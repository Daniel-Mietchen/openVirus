<p id="Par7">We used the time series approach involving monthly data to examine the associations between RSV confirmed cases and climate variables. Relationships of RSV incidence with meteorological factors were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation. To remove collinearity among variables, partial correlations were evaluated. The RSV data set was plotted as a time series and assessed for stationarity using theÂ augmented Dickey-Fuller test for unit roots. Multiple time series analysis was based on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Prediction of the value of the target variable with a linear function of lag values (autoregressive) and an effect from recent random shock values (moving average) self-selected the most suitable ARIMA model for the influence of meteorological factors based on past incidence of RSV. ARIMA models have the flexibility to control the autocorrelation of time series data, and the Box-Ljung test was used to test the null hypothesis that the autocorrelations of the residual time series were equal to zero. An ARIMA model for the monthly incidence was then developed following the Box-Jenkins approach
