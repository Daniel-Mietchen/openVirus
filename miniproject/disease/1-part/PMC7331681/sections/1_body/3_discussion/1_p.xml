<p id="Par12">Although children get respiratory infections year-round, our multi-year observation of ILI samples testing positive for RSV overwhelmingly predominated in the second half of the year between July and November (mean 18.9%, ± 11.2%) compared to December to June (mean 2.4%, ± 3.6%). The yearly unimodal peak for RSV, particularly around September of 2012 and October of 2013, was also observed in the study conducted by Thailand Ministry of Public Health in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

 </sup>. Although both RSV genotypes co-circulate, one dominating genotype in some years is not uncommon. When we examined potential association between peak RSV infection and meteorological data over these seven consecutive years, we observed the strongest correlation of peak RSV detection with certain local climate factors. Highest RSV infection incidence positively correlated with rainfall (r = 0.41, P &lt; 0.001) and relative humidity (r = 0.27, P &lt; 0.05), which were not unexpected given that wet weather naturally increases the humidity. In contrast, RSV incidence negatively correlated with monthly mean temperature (r = − 0.25, P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate analysis using data from the previous six years showed that the best forecasting model was able to trace the observed RSV incidence in 2018, which served as a proof-of-principle for the utility of infection forecast when climate factors especially temperature were considered.
