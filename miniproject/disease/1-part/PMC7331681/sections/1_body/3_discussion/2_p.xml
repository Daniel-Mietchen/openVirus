<p id="Par13">Since there is currently no licensed vaccines nor effective antivirals for RSV infection and it is a major respiratory virus of concern among infants and very young children, continuous surveillance of RSV circulation and the ability to anticipate seasonal upsurge in cases provide a crucial tool in order to mitigate the risk of RSV transmission. Neighboring countries in the region including Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia share similar climate and socioeconomic factors as Thailand, but are limited in local virological surveillance and laboratory confirmation of RSV in real-time. Thus, accurate forecasting of potential infection annually combined with other measures may be important in limiting the extent of RSV infection requiring hospitalization in resource-constrained economies.</p>
