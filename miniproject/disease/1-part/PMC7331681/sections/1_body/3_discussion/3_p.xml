<p id="Par14">Studies to understand how weather patterns influence RSV seasonality in the tropics have not always been unequivocal. A previous multi-country study showed that the onset of RSV season consistently occurred during the periods of above average rainfall, humidity, and temperature in Thailand, but not in Bangladesh where the weather is also moist and tropical

 </sup>. There, historical prevalence of RSV appears to be associated with rainy days but not absolute rainfall. In contrast to our findings, that study showed that an increased RSV activity was significantly correlated with low relative humidity. The authors suggested that the number of rainy days rather than the absolute amount of rainfall may affect human behavior and thus dictate the risk of respiratory infection. The occurrence of rain but not the amount of rainfall was also associated with the magnitude of RSV infection in a tropical island of Lombok, Indonesia
