<p id="Par15">This study has several limitations. Analysis of future trends in RSV incidence alone, although potentially useful, may not be conclusive and is subject to the altering dynamics of societal (political protests, lock-downs, and social distancing) or environmental (such as heat waves, droughts, and massive floods) factors previously encountered in Thailand. It is also difficult to account for human behavior (such as increasing sedentary lifestyle and tendency to congregate in indoor air-conditioned buildings among city-dwellers) or co-circulation of other respiratory viruses in the infection forecast. Furthermore, data on RSV cases under hospital-based settings may not reflect those of the medically non-attended, the community, or the entire country at large. With larger dataset of reliable epidemiological data (regional collaboration comprising of multi-national sites with similar climato-geographical features) and more frequently captured environmental data (hourly or daily instead of monthly), these ARIMA models may be sufficiently refined to provide reliable yearly forecast of RSV onset and peak useful for public health officials in preparing for and to respond to RSV epidemics. Further understanding of the impact of environmental factors on the prevalence of common respiratory viruses can be useful and important in predicting their seasonality.</p>
