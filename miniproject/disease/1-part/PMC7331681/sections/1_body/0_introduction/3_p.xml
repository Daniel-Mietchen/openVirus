 </sup>. Thus far, there has been no studies examining any potential linkage between weather pattern and RSV infection cycle in Thailand. Forecasting the dynamics of RSV infection, which is responsible for a sizable portion of lower respiratory tract infection among infants and young children and for which no approved vaccines nor antivirals are available, could be useful towards evaluating the epidemiological burden of RSV in the region. Here, we analyzed the pattern of laboratory-confirmed RSV prevalence from 2012 to 2018 and variations in the climate factors including the amount of average rainfall, relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed by using correlation analysis. Using the time series models approach, which assumes that prevalence data from the past several years can predict future trends and captures any lagged relationships among variables, we retrospectively forecasted RSV activity and compared the model with the actual incidence. Knowledge of the impact of climate variables on RSV seasons in Thailand may be useful in predicting the magnitude of the annual RSV infection in the region and assist in the planning of healthcare resources to handle this important respiratory infection.
