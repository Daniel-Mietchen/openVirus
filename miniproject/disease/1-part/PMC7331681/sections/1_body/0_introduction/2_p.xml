<p id="Par3">The observed differences in RSV activities among countries located at similar latitudes from the equator, and cities within the same country, suggest that local weather pattern may partially play a role in dictating RSV seasonality. For example, a number of retrospective studies using epidemiological surveillance data in Brazil have shown different seasonal pattern for RSV attributable to the widely diverse regional climate characteristics there

 </sup>. In addition, findings in previous studies have at times been contradictory. Despite the shared geographical proximity, any slight differences in climate, socio-economy, cultural practices, and time of study among neighboring countries may influence observation outcome. Therefore, regional data are needed to most accurately forecast the onset or height of RSV activity in a given locality.
