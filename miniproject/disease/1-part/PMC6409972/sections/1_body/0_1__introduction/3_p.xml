<p>In South Africa, little is known about the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of human RVFV exposure in the farm environment [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of RVFV and to identify hotspots of exposure and factors associated with RVFV infection amongst farmers, farm workers, and veterinary personnel in an epidemic-prone area in South Africa (the central plateau) four years after the 2010â€“2011 outbreaks. A better identification of these factors will aid in improvement of targeted prevention measures. Further, we aimed to estimate the number of human RVFV infections that had occurred in the farm population in the study area during the previous outbreaks. This study was conducted within a one-health framework for the investigation of the epidemiology of RVF in South Africa.
