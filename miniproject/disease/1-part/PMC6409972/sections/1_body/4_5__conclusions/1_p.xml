<p>Our study showed that one in ten individuals in at-risk occupations was seropositive in a region with three previously documented, large RVFV outbreaks. The study highlighted the increase in seroprevalence in people that had experienced more outbreaks. While seropositive status should provide long-lived immunity in an individual, the level identified here is not adequate for herd immunity. For that reason, prevention efforts should in the first instance be directed toward ensuring herd immunity is reached in livestock through vaccination on these farms to prevent the occurrence of outbreaks and subsequent zoonotic exposures in humans. As a second line of defense, our research identified exposure factors which could be targeted for reducing overall infections in populations during future outbreaks, including safe handling and animal slaughtering practices and wearing adequate protective equipment during injection, sample collection, slaughtering and processing of infected meat for consumption and precautions against mosquito bites. </p>
