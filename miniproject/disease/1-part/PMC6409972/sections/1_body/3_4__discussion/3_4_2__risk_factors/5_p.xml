<p>An age-dependent RVFV antibody increase has been consistent across various studies [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and can be explained by the fact that older persons have had more opportunity to acquire viral infections and the RVFV IgG persists [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Using age categories, we demonstrated that seroprevalence was highly associated with the likely number of epidemics experienced during a personâ€™s lifetime. This does not exclude the possibility that some exposure may have taken place during interepidemic periods but we know that in our study area the vast majority of exposure would have taken place during epidemics.
