<p>This identifies local clusters (of farms) that have higher seropositivity values than expected by random chance (hotspots). We used Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) as interpolation method that averaged the 
 <italic>z</italic>-scores of the measured farm points to predict the 
 <italic>z</italic>-score for the location points without measurement in the interpolated raster cell surface to create the hotspot layer. We also predicted mean RVFV seroprevalence of people that had worked/lived at that farm for four years or longer by fitting a logistic regression model to age data in Stata. We subtracted predicted from actual mean farm seroprevalence of human RVFV and ran a hotspot analysis on the difference in seroprevalences. This was done to verify whether external factors other than age caused hot and cold spots.
