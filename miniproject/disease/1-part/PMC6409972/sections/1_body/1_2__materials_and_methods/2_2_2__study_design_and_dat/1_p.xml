<p>We conducted a cross-sectional serological survey during October 2015–February 2016 using single stage cluster sampling of healthy participants aged &gt;11 years in a 40,000 km
 <sup>2</sup> area situated between Bloemfontein (Latitude: –29.081885; Longitude: 26.162902 and Mokala National Park (Latitude: –29.132526; Longitude: 24.322333) in the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces. This area experienced a high number of RVFV infections in livestock during 2010–2011. For the survey we targeted individuals at high risk for RVFV infection, including livestock and game farmers and farm workers, and members of livestock (cattle, sheep, or goats)-owning households (livestock farm population; LSFP); and para-veterinary workers and veterinarians (animal health-care workers; AHCW). We estimated a sample size of 770 individuals for an expected RVFV seroprevalence of 50% with 95% confidence intervals, 5% precision, 0.2 intra-cluster correlation, and an average cluster (farm) size of 6.
