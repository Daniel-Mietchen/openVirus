<p id="Par3">Before 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics. Dengue fever is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the regions of Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, the Western Pacific, the Americas. The three last ones are the most seriously affected regions

 </sup>. In Africa, the first reported dengue fever outbreaks occurred in Zanzibar in 1823 and 1870. Several other African countries including Burkina-Faso, Egypt, South Africa and Senegal, reported unconfirmed outbreaks of dengue fever in early 1900s. Although many outbreaks arenâ€™t ever officially reported, between 1960 and 2017, more than 20 laboratory-confirmed dengue epidemics were reported in more than 20 African countries

 </sup>. A systematic review without meta-analysis by Humphrey and colleagues conducted for Middle East and North Africa have shown a median seroprevalence of dengue infection in general population of 25% (range from 0 to 62%) with most of the seroprevalence studies reported from Red Sea region of Pakistan

 </sup>, to date there is no study accurately investigating the epidemiology of DENV infection among febrile and apparently healthy populations in this continent. In order to fill this gap, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim to determine the prevalence of DENV infection in Africa. This review would help better characterize the epidemiology in the continent and build effective interventions to curb the burden of dengue fever in the continent.
