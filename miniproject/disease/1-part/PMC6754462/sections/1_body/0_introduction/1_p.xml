<p id="Par2">The incidence of dengue fever has grown in the last decade worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are at risk of infection and about 390 million of dengue infection occur each year in people worldwide among which 96 million (25%) clinically manifest the disease

 </sup>. DENV is transmitted by two main epidemic vectors: 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. These vectors have become widely distributed across tropical and subtropical region and spread globally with the advent of global phenomena such as urbanization, high rate of population growth, inadequate water supply, sewer, poor waste management system, and international travel
