<p id="Par5">We considered observational studies (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort). Studies in which DENV infection were imported were excluded. Studies had to be conducted out of outbreak periods. DENV infection had to be diagnosed by the detection of the three biological markers of DENV including RNA, Immunoglobulins (Ig) M, or G; among people residing in Africa. Studies lacking or with no extractable primary data, and/or explicit methods description, were excluded. In the case of missing data, we contacted authors.</p>
