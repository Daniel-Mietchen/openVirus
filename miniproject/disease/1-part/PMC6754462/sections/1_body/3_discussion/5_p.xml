<p id="Par21">There was also a heterogeneity in prevalence according to geographical areas. Since not all regions and countries were represented, this finding needs a cautious interpretation. In addition, the UNSD of the Africa continent is only an administrative subdivision and could not efficiently map the epidemiology. We found that western Africa had the highest IgG seroprevalence in febrile participants and the highest IgM seroprevalence in apparently healthy individuals, that western and central Africa had the highest IgG seroprevalence in apparently healthy individuals, and that central Africa had the highest IgM seroprevalence and RNA prevalence in febrile participants. Higher prevalence in both western and central Africa may be the reflection of weak quality of infrastructures in urban areas in these regions, weaker healthcare systems, and optimal ecological environment and climatological patterns for lifecycle of DENV. However, studies are needed to deeply investigate the heterogeneity of epidemiology of DENV infection between and within countries of the continent. It would be better to have the geospatial distribution of DENV vectors in the continent to better understand the distribution of DENV infection among humans. Heterogeneity in the prevalence of dengue infection in Africa may also be due to the difference of the immunity of human across the continent and the heterogeneity of vectors distribution
