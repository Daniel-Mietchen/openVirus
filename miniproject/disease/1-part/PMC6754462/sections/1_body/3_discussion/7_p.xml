<p id="Par23">This review has some limitations. They may be a heterogeneity between diagnostic tools used in different included studies. Other sources of heterogeneity not explored in this study, because they are not reported in primary studies, include the difference in the prevalence of DENV in vectors, the difference in the immunity of humans, the difference in serotypes and genotypes of DENV, and ecosystem of different study places across the continent. All countries were not represented in this systematic review. This can hinder the generalization of our findings. Although there were some limitations, this is to the very best of our knowledge, the first review with meta-analysis summarizing data on the epidemiology of DENV infection in febrile and apparently healthy populations living in Africa. We have performed a comprehensive search of the literature and included independent reviewers for study selection and data extraction to avoid biases. Almost three quarters of the included studies were assessed as having low risk of bias. This suggest that we can be confident in the quality of findings this review. In addition, our main findings were in the range to that of sensitivity analysis considering only studies with PNRT for DENV confirmation; highlighting the robustness of our findings.</p>
