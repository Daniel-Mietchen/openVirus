  <title>The emergence of the 1918 flu during World War I.</title>
  <p>This photo shows soldiers at Camp Funston in Fort Riley, Kansas, in late November of 1918. This camp is where some of the very first cases of the 1918 flu were reported, earlier in the year of 1918, and then again just around the time that this photo was taken [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Based on this, some of the soldiers shown are very likely infected with the 1918 influenza virus at the time the photo was taken. The soldiers are watching a Thanksgiving football game, and it is interesting to speculate that this dense human crowd may have set the 1918 flu, a respiratory virus, onto its disastrous course.
