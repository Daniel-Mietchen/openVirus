<p>Significant effort has been put into understanding the factors that contribute to the spread of zoonotic viruses through the human population once an animal virus has begun the process described above. Factors that facilitate spread of viruses through populations can include high population density, the presence of viral vectors, and many others [

However, less investment has been made in finding the animal viruses that have the greatest potential to begin these zoonotic events in the first place. In the following essay we will argue that, while humans are constantly exposed to animal viruses, those animal viruses with real potential to replicate themselves in a human cell are exceedingly rare. We assert that host genetics plays a major role in determining which animal viruses will be able to make copies of themselves in the human body. This is because animal viruses that pose the greatest risk to humans will have few (or no) genetic barriers to replicating themselves in human cells, thus requiring minimal mutations to make this jump.
