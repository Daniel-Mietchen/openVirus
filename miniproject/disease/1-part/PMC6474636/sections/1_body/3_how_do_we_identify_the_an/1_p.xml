<p>The key to identifying the animal viruses that are most likely to harm humans boils down to understanding “thick” versus “thin” barriers to zoonosis. We must identify the human proteins (restriction factors, receptors, other cellular proteins) that are currently protecting us from each class of animal virus with high zoonotic potential. Such blocks may include restriction factors like APOBEC3H or Tetherin, or incompatible host proteins like ANP32A or RanBP2, all of which were discussed above. Based on this, we can then determine for which animal viruses our resistances are few (a thin barrier to zoonosis) versus many (a thick barrier to zoonosis). Based on historical zoonoses (a partial list is shown in

 </bold>), it is straightforward to identify the predominant virus families on which these efforts should be focused. Identifying genetic blocks to animal virus replication in humans will require significant laboratory experimentation. Furthermore, the human blocks will be unique for each animal virus of interest. While it may sound laborious, virologists are already well on their way to identifying genetic barriers that protect humans from key families of animal viruses (
