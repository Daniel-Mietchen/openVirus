<p>Nonspecific immune barriers, including skin, mucosa, and chemical defenses (for example, stomach acid), play a key role in blocking animal viruses at portals of entry into the human body. However, even if these barriers are penetrated and an animal virus gains access to human cells of its target tissue type, productive replication is still far from guaranteed. To launch even a first round of viral replication, animal viruses will need to avoid interaction with a suite of constitutively expressed human innate immunity proteins present inside of human cells, namely restriction factors and pathogen sensors that can activate the interferon response. If the animal virus is successfully recognized by any of these human proteins, this will potently block viral replication and will limit even initial rounds of animal virus replication. For example, several human restriction factors are efficient at blocking replication of primate-derived simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), and this was important in the emergence of HIV in humans. SIV from chimpanzees (SIVcpz) adapted to overcome the human restriction factors APOBEC3H and Tetherin, giving rise to pandemic HIV-1 group M (

As such, restriction factors may provide immediate protection against animal viruses but tend to be less useful once these viruses have adapted to humans and evolved to evade them. For this reason, restriction factors and other components of innate immunity seem to be highly relevant to protecting us from zoonotic viruses and less relevant to protecting us from human viruses [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The complex array of restriction factors and innate immune sensors encoded in the human genome means that most animal viruses would need to escape multiple immunity proteins simultaneously. For this reason, animal virus escape from human innate immunity is probably quite rare.
