<p>Alternately, perhaps humans have historically been infected by very few animal viruses (&lt;0.1% of the total in nature) simply because the opportunity for animal viruses to infect humans is very limited. Certainly, an animal virus that never comes into contact with humans would have no path for infecting them. If opportunity is key to understanding the main bottleneck in zoonosis (green arrow, pinhole model,

 </bold>), then we would expect that zoonosis would occur more commonly from the animals that we domesticate, and indeed this does appear to be true [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Yet our relationship with animals goes well beyond domestication. In a world of over 7 billion people, there are a staggering number of collisions occurring between people and animals every day. Further, human overcrowding has increased the chances that zoonotic viruses will circulate in human populations long enough to be detected. Yet, still, only 219 viruses have ever been identified in human infections [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Rather than opportunity being limiting, itâ€™s more plausible that we are actively protected from the vast majority of these collisions with animal viruses. In the following section, we discuss the remarkable ways that the human body defends itself against animal viruses. Notably, what protects us from animal viruses is often different than what protects us from human viruses.
