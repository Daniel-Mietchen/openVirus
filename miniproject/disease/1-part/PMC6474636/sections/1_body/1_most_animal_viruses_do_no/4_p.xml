<p>Experimental virologists know all too well how difficult it is to get viruses to infect alternate hosts. Virologists attempt “reverse zoonosis” all the time in the process of establishing animal models for human viruses, with very poor success. It is almost always impossible to get human viruses to replicate unaltered in any laboratory animal precisely because most viruses are exquisitely adapted to their natural host. HIV is a prime example. For 30 years, scientists have tried to get HIV to replicate in laboratory animals (or cells derived from laboratory animals), including numerous species of monkeys, rodents, shrews, dogs, cats, rabbits, pigs, and cows [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this case, a major obstacle is presented by restriction factors, which are antiviral proteins of the innate immune system that are constitutively expressed, lying in wait in mammalian cells should viruses come along. The macaque monkey is the most common experimental model for HIV/AIDS research, but macaques encode at least five restriction factors (tripartite motif containing 5, alpha isoform [TRIM5α], Tetherin, SAM and HD domain containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase 1 [SAMHD1], MX dynamin-like GTPase 2 [MX2], and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3G [APOBEC3G]) and one incompatible cell-surface receptor (CD4) that block HIV replication [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, macaques have a massively expanded MHC class I locus compared to humans, making it extremely difficult for HIV to evade T-cell immunity and establish persistence in these animals [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Together, these factors create multiple genetic barriers to HIV in the macaque host, meaning that scientists have to alter the virus in significant ways in order to get it to replicate in these animals (

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Yet, again, dengue virus does not replicate to high titers in any of these animals [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In mice, several innate immunity proteins block dengue virus from replicating to high titers, so, in this case, scientists genetically modify mice to lack key immunity pathways [

  <xref rid="pbio.3000217.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
 </bold>). This explains one reason why mice are such a popular model organism: when no species can be found that will support the replication of a human virus, mice afford an opportunity to knock out host immunity genes in order to create an animal that will support viral replication. Additionally, mice can be modified to express human versions of proteins that support virus infection. For instance, creation of transgenic mice expressing human versions of the cellular receptors used by poliovirus and hepatitis C viruses leads to enhanced viral infection because these human viruses are not compatible with the mouse orthologs of their receptors (

 </bold>). In other cases, blocks to human viruses in animals are extreme, and it has been more practical to study related animal viruses in their natural hosts (

  <xref rid="pbio.3000217.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
 </bold>). If we assume that the success of reverse zoonosis reflects the success of zoonosis, then decades of work modeling human viruses in animals would suggest that zoonosis is exceedingly difficult to achieve.
