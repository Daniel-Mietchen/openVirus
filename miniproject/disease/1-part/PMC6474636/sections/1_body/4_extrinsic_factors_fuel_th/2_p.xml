<p>Unique human situations and behaviors are often factors in defining the scale of epidemics. The strong human desire to care for sick family members has promoted the spread of Ebola virus whenever it strikes, and it has been heartbreakingly stated that “one of the tragedies of Ebola is that it spreads through love” [

If we do begin to identify the relatively rare animal viruses with thin genetic barriers to replication in human cells, then we may be able to use global data on key epidemiological and ecological parameters to understand where conditions exist that will promote rapid spread once animal virus replication in an initial human host has occurred [
