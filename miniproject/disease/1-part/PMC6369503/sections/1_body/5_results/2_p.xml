<p>Using PCR, we amplified a segment of the MDV genome in ZIKV 
 <italic>strains A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic> to confirm coinfection with MDV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>B); an immunofluorescence assay was also performed. The immunofluorescence assay confirmed the presence of the ZIKV E-antigen in the cytoplasm and coinfection of both ZIKV 
 <italic>strains A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic> with MDV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>C). Furthermore, the inability of an anti-MDV monoclonal antibody to recognise 
 <italic>strain B</italic> P.0 suggests that different MDV strains were coinfecting the ZIKV strains. To address this, we determined the nucleotide sequence (from PCR product) of the MDV present in both ZIKV strains. Despite the short viral genomic region analysed (265 bp), the nucleotide identity was 95.4% between the MDVs present in each ZIKV strain, which confirmed different viral strains. This could be explained by 1) the different passage history of the two ZIKV strains; 2) divergent evolution of both MDV strains due to the maintenance in C6/36 cell culture. However, we could not confirm any of these hypotheses once we do not have information on the ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic> passage history before samples were sent to our Laboratory. Despite that, results suggest that the contamination originated from two different sources (
