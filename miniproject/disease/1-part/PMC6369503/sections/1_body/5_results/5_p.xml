<p>Additionally, to confirm the exclusion of MDV from ZIKV strains, we performed three additional passages of ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> P.3/A549 and 
 <italic>strain B</italic> P.3/A549 using the C6/36 mosquito cell line, as this cell line is susceptible and permissive to MDV. After the third passage in C6/36 cells, nucleic acid was extracted from the supernatants, and RT-PCR and PCR for ZIKV and MDV, respectively, were performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>B). These results demonstrated that successive passages of MDV-contaminated ZIKV strains in A549 cells are effective for removing MDV contamination from ZIKV samples (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>C). Additionally, ZIKV titration after each passage in cell culture showed a ZIKV recovery rate between 10
 <sup>4</sup> to 10
 <sup>7</sup> FFU/mL (data not shown). After passages in A549 and C6/36 cells, the cytopathic effects observed in C6/36 cells were no longer apparent compared to previous infections prior to the removal of MDV (Figs 1A and 2D). As infection with ZIKV induces cytopathic effects on C6/36 even after the elimination of MDV, some damage on C6/36 cells could be observed when compared to mock-infected cells (
