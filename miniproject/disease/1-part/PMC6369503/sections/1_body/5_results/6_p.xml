<p>To further confirm the elimination of MDV from each ZIKV strain, C6/36 cells were infected with a different MOI of ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> P.3/C6/36 and ZIKV 
 <italic>strain B</italic> P.3/C6/36. After 72 h, the supernatants and cell pellets were tested for MDV using PCR. Even after infection with a high MOI [10], MDV was no longer detected in these ZIKV stocks. These results confirmed the efficiency of this protocol in the removal of MDV contamination from ZIKV strains (
