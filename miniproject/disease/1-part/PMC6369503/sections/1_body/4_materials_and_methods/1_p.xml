 <italic>Virus stocks production</italic> - Two different ZIKV strains were recently sent to our laboratory. The ZIKV strain of Asian origin was named 
 <italic>strain A</italic>, and the strain that resembled African origin was 
 <italic>strain B</italic>. As those samples were sent to our laboratory without information on viral passage history we identified both samples of ZIKV 
 <italic>strains A</italic> and 
 <italic>strain B</italic> as zero (P.0). Both P.0 viral supernatants were used to infect C6/36 cells (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CRL-1660™) that were cultured in L-15 media supplemented with 5% FBS, 25 µg/mL gentamicin and 0,26% triptose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, New York, USA) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for viral stock production.
