<p>Additionally, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used for the molecular detection of MDV. Briefly, total nucleic acids from the supernatant and pellet of C6/36 cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Blood samples from ZIKV infected mice were collected one to four days post inoculation, and nucleic acids was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A total of 500 ng of nucleic acids was reverse transcribed using 300 ng of random primers. The resulting cDNA was used as a template for PCR with the primers DensoBR07_F (5’-ATTGTTGGGAGCATGACGGA-3’) and DensoBR07_R (5’-CAACGGTTTGACCAGCGAAA-3’) resulting in 212 bp of amplification. To test for the presence of densovirus in the mosquitoes that fed on ZIKV infected mice, the total nucleic acids from individual mosquitoes was extracted and pooled to prepare cDNA. During the replication cycle of MDV the ssDNA genome produces mRNA,
