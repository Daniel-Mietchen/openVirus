<p>In this study, we identified the presence of two different 
 <italic>Brevidensovirus</italic>, here designated as mosquito densovirus (MDV), contaminating two ZIKV strains; one strain is of African origin, and the other strain is of Asian lineage. These strains were sent to our laboratory for research purposes. We also provide two simple strategies to remove MDV contamination from ZIKV strains using vertebrate cells as a bottleneck for MDV replication.
