<p>Regarding the protocol used for MDV clearance from ZIKV stocks, additional care should be considered. First, it has been already shown that vertebrate cells and some supplies used in cell culture, like fetal calf serum, could also harbor contaminant viruses.

 </xref>. Ideally, the source of cells used for virus growth and titration should be tested for the presence of contaminants. Also, for virus evolution studies, the protocols suggested here could impact on the results, as they are based in successive viral passaging in cell culture or mice, which could introduce genetic mutations in ZIKV genome. It has been shown that a single passage in cells could influence the genetic diversity of Chikungunya virus.

 </xref> Furthermore, successive passages of ZIKV in vertebrate (Vero cells) or invertebrate (C6/36 cells) cells influence plaque sizes, kinetic and restriction to grow. In addition, four mutations were identified associated with plaque size that might have influence on ZIKV biology.
