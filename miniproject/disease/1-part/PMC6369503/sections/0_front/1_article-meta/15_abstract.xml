  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p> The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemics that affected South America in 2016 raised several research questions and prompted an increase in studies in the field. The transient and low viraemia observed in the course of ZIKV infection is a challenge for viral isolation from patient serum, which leads to many laboratories around the world sharing viral strains for their studies. C6/36 cells derived from 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> larvae are commonly used for arbovirus isolation from clinical samples and for the preparation of viral stocks.

  <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
  <p> Here, we report the contamination of two widely used ZIKV strains by 
   <italic>Brevidensovirus</italic>, here designated as mosquito densovirus (MDV).
  </p>

 <sec>
  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p> Molecular and immunological techniques were used to analyse the MDV contamination of ZIKV stocks. Also, virus passages in mammalian cell line and infecting susceptible mice were used to MDV clearance from ZIKV stocks.</p>

  <title>FINDINGS</title>
  <p> MDV contamination was confirmed by molecular and immunological techniques and likely originated from C6/36 cultures commonly used to grow viral stocks. We applied two protocols that successfully eliminated MDV contamination from ZIKV stocks, and these protocols can be widely applied in the field. As MDV does not infect vertebrate cells, we performed serial passages of contaminated stocks using a mammalian cell line and infecting susceptible mice prior to re-isolating ZIKV from the animalsâ€™ blood serum. MDV elimination was confirmed with immunostaining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and analysis of the mosquitoes that were allowed to feed on the infected mice.</p>

  <title>MAIN CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p> Since the putative impact of viral contaminants in ZIKV strains generally used for research purposes is unknown, researchers working in the field must be aware of potential contaminants and test viral stocks to certify sample purity.</p>
