<p id="Par19">The epidemiology of YF in West and Central Africa was well described in the 1960s to 1980s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] following a long cross-section follow-up of virus circulation during and outside of epidemic periods. It is possible, schematically, to restrict the zones of virus circulation to three regions: a) the main one that harbors the endemic sylvatic cycle, i.e., the natural focus, b) a border zone of emergence, actually a latency area ensuring a transition between the latter and c) the zone of epidemics, visible part of the iceberg, made up of regions inhabited by varying densities of human populations (Fig.
