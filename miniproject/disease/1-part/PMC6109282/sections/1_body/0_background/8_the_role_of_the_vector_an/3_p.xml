<p id="Par34">The molecular phylogeny of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> strains confirmed the African origin of the species although genetic variability reflected massive mixings due to multiple importations over time from all continents, and human intervention for controlling mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. In addition, genetic heterogeneity resulted in a high variability in susceptibility to viral infection according to vector strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. The original strain – now known as 
 <italic>A. aegypti formosus</italic> as opposed to the subspecies 
 <italic>A. aegypti aegypti</italic>, which is the domestic and urban form of the species – is still present in African jungle where the larvae grow in tree trunks, and whose females are not anthropophilic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. aegypti formosus</italic> is involved in the transmission of YF in nonhuman primates within the sylvatic cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. It is not known whether the domestication of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, which led to its diffusion in America, was earlier or contemporaneous with its transport during the slave trade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. In either scenario, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> adaptation to human populations in West Africa was early, which explains the many large urban epidemics in this part of the continent at the end of the eighteenth century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. On the other hand, in East Africa, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> does not seem to have adapted to the anthropization of the environment, as evidenced by the scarcity of urban epidemics up to the present day [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>].
