<p id="Par35">The colonization of Asia by 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> was later, probably at the end of the nineteenth century when it was revealed as an urban vector of dengue fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. Phylogenetic data suggest that the Asian strain originates from the Americas and not from East Africa as might have been expected, probably because of the poor adaptation of the East African strain to humans and its poor susceptibility to the YF virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. In addition, the genetic homogeneity of Asian strains of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> suggests that the introduction was recent and accomplished by a limited number of entries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. However, although the current strain of 
 <italic>A. aegypti aegypti</italic> is monophyletic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>], it has important local polymorphisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>] that could explain, at least in part, the variability of the vector competence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>,
