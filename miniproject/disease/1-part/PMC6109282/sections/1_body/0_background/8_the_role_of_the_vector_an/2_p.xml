<p id="Par33">These two species, in particular 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, favor the transport of the virus because of the resistance of their eggs to the desiccation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] that leads to the resilience of the YF virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. The spread of YF probably occurred at the same time as that of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. The short flying distance of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, especially 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, leaves no alternative other than passive transport, especially by the transportation of humans or goods [
