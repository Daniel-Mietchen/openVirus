<p id="Par2">Brazil has experienced an exceptional yellow fever (YF) outbreak since December 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). After the last major epidemic (1935–1940), sporadic cases were regularly reported from endemic states – mainly the Amazonian states – with some incursions into those of the Southeast (Minas Gerais and São Paulo, respectively in 2002 and 2008) and South (Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul in 2008), until today (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Preceded by an upsurge of epizootics in monkeys since 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the current epidemic resulted, from 1 December 2016 to 8 May 2018, in 2050 confirmed cases of yellow fever including 681 deaths, indicating a case fatality rate of 33.2% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), while a further 1300 cases are still under investigation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite a rapid and appropriate response, the epidemic spread to the east and south of the country, including areas generally considered non-endemic. This extension reproduces almost identically the course of all the epidemics observed in Brazil, including those following the reappearance of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in the 1970s, after an attempt to eliminate the vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, in Brazil, this epidemic and the previous ones are marked by the role of wild vectors, 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> sp., involved in the sylvatic cycle, while 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, which induce epidemics in urban and peri-urban areas, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], do not seem to be involved in the transmission of the virus at this stage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].
