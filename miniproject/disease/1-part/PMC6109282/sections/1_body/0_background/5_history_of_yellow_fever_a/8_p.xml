<p id="Par13">While an African origin of YF is established, a new question arises: how did it cross the Atlantic Ocean? At the time of the slave trade, the duration of the journey between African and American coasts was longer than 1 month whereas the severe conditions of the crossing certainly did not favor the survival of the patients [

Incubation (3 to 6 days) and viremia (less than 10 days before the acquired immunity does not make it disappear) are too short for the virus to have been carried by slaves, if we admit the likelihood that some of them may have been infected at the time of their departure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It is now accepted that the transfer was carried out via the mosquito

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The circulation of the virus and the development of the epidemics for which it is responsible are inseparable from the vectors.
