<p>In Brazil there exists an elevated risk for the emergence and/or spread of new arboviruses to humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This country has large urban centers with a high population density that are infested by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> that transmit arboviruses to man [
 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The prevalence and dispersion of arboviruses has rapidly increased globally in recent years coinciding with improvements in global transportation, adaptation of its arthropod vectors to urbanization, failure to contain increases in the mosquito population and deforestation [
 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These arthropods apparently rapidly adapt to enhanced exposure to humans and domestic animals [
