<p>Real–time PCR for enteroviruses was performed according to a methodology described by Volle et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The CLART
 <sup>-</sup>Entherpex (BioMérieux—Ivry-sur-Seine, France) kit was used to identify eight human herpesviruses: HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), VZV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein- Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and the three major enteroviruses, poliovirus (PV), echovirus (E) and coxsackievirus (CV). The methodology is based on the detection of the amplification by RT-PCR of a fragment located between 106–328 pb, which is detected by a low density micro-matrix platform (Microarray).
