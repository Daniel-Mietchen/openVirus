The distribution of encephalitis cases were from the metropolitan region, coastal and inland regions of São Paulo state as well as from other states in Brazil (Acre, Amazonas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Pará and Paraná). Suspicious patients were referred to the Special Analysis / Liquor Department of the Central Laboratory of HCFMUSP, where the aspiration of CSF was performed from the lumbar region of the spinal cord. Collected material was sent for biochemical, microbiological and cytological analysis. From each sample collected, 1 mL was set aside for molecular investigation of viral agents. Research on human subjects was conducted after Hospital das Clínicas—University of São Paulo’s Institutional Review Board (CAPPesq) approval, online registration #8874/12. All patients provided written informed consent prior to CSF collection. In the case of patients under 18 years old, written consent was obtained of their parents or legal representatives.
