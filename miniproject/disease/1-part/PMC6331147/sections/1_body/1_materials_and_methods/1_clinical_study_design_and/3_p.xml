<p>Physical characteristics of CSF were performed by visual observation of color and appearance before and after centrifugation. CSF biochemistry was performed by an automated method using the Modular Analytics System (Roche—Switzerland). The cytological analysis of CSF was performed by manually using a Fucks-Rosenthal camera for global counts of red blood cells, leukocytes and tissue cells. A differential leukocyte count was performed by CytospinTM (Cytospin TM 4 Cytocentrifuge—Thermo Fisher Scientific—Massachusetts, USA). The pellet fraction was affixed to slides and staining was performed using the Hemogram Slide Ink equipment (Vyttra Diagnósticos—São Paulo—Brazil) and a Colorgram kit (Wright-Giemsa-Leishman).</p>
