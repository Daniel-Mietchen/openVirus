<p>The two positive SLEV CSFs were both from women, 32- and 40- years-old, living in metropolitan SÃ£o Paulo. One presented with facial palsy while the other had an uneventful clinical course without any adverse sequelae. Both SLEV samples underwent nucleotide sequencing to confirm their identity. The fragment obtained for the initial analysis was 232 bp. The sample from the Group 1 patient was 98% similar, and for the Group 2 patient 95% identical to SLEV isolated from the BsAsARG-10 NS5 gene (Sequence ID: gb JQ003910.1).</p>
