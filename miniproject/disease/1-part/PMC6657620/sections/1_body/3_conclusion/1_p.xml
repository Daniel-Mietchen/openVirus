<p>Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing Abs can offer heterosubtypic protection against IAV. However, the Abs that recognize highly conserved epitopes are subdominant during the course of a natural infection or after vaccination. Therefore, efforts to build a universal vaccine with these antigenic determinants are being made, along with strategies for increasing their immunity. Nevertheless, despite the significant advances on the knowledge of heterosubtypic humoral immunity and the biology of B cells in animal models, further studies in humans are needed to define the viability of using them as a component of an anti-IAV universal vaccine or as a therapeutic measure.</p>
