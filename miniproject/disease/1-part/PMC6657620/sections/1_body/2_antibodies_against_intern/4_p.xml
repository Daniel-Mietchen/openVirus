<p>LaMere et al. described in mice that anti-NP IgG Abs also contribute to the protection against IAV in a mechanism dependent on CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and Fc receptors (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). This can be explained because anti-NP Abs can associate with viral proteins (probably from dying infected cells) forming immune complexes (IC), which are captured by dendritic cells via FcγR, and promoting a sustained antigen presentation to CD8 T cells. All of this contributes to memory development (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). In accordance with this, when aged mice with a depressed cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response received artificial IC consisting of a NP-specific mAb and the influenza virus, the CTL response was restored, along with an enhanced dendritic cell function and an increment of IFN-γ by CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
