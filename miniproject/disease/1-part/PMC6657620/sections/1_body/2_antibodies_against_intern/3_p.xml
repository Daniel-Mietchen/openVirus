<p>Previous studies have shown that NP can be expressed on the surface of influenza virus-infected cells (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>–
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>), however evidence for Fc-mediated effector functions of anti-NP Abs is controversial. Regarding ADCC, despite Varderven 
 <italic>et al</italic> reported that healthy individuals had anti-NP and anti-M1 Abs capable of activating NK cells through FCγRIII, these Abs had no killing activity on target cells

Contrarily, Jegaskanda et al. found in human sera higher titers of NP-specific ADCC-Abs reactive to avian influenza strain H7N9, as compared with HA- or NA-specific ADCC-Abs reactive to the same strain. In addition, these Abs correlated with ADCC-Abs reactive to NP in the seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), suggesting that they could be induced by seasonal infections or by vaccination (
