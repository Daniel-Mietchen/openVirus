<p>For seasonal vaccines, the main mechanism of protection is the induction of neutralizing Abs specific for the globular domain of HA. This parameter can be measured by hemagglutination inhibition or neutralization assays, where a serum titer â‰¥40 is correlated to protection. Unfortunately, the effectivity of these vaccines depends on the accuracy of the virus strain selection process coordinated by the WHO. An inaccurate selection of strains may explain why the vaccines have shown low levels of protection in certain years (
