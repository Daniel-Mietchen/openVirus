<p>Currently, there are three types of licensed human influenza vaccines: trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV/QIV) live attenuated vaccines (LAIV) and the recombinant vaccine Flublok. TIV/QIV are administered intramuscularly. They are non-adjuvanted inactivated vaccines composed of three or four circulating influenza virus strains (H1N1, H3N2, B; or two B strains for QIV). The strains are grown individually in embryonated chicken eggs and manipulated to harbor all internal genes from the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus and two HA and NA genes corresponding to the circulating strains each year. There are three types of inactivated vaccines: whole virus vaccines, split virus vaccines, and subunit vaccines. In whole-virus vaccines, the allantoic fluid is harvested after the culture, and the virus is chemically inactivated with formalin or Î²-propiolactone. Split-vaccines add an extra step with detergent to make it less reactogenic by removing RNA. In subunit-vaccines, the HA of each virus is further purified. On the other hand, LAIV consist of cold-adapted virus, and they are administered intranasally. They do not replicate well in the lower respiratory tract, but they do in the nasal cavities. Flublok is a trivalent recombinant hemmaglutinin influenza vaccine, licensed by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) in 2013, that contains HA antigens derived from the three influenza virus strains recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) annually (
