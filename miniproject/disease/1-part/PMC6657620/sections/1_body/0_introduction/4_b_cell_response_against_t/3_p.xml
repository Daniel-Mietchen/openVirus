<p>Once the influenza antigens reach the draining lymph nodes, two types of B cell responses take place: the extrafollicular (EF) and the germinal center (GC) responses. Within the first days of infection (48â€“72 hpi), Abs are secreted by extrafollicular plasmablasts (short-lived antibody secreting cells). These early specific Abs play an important role in dealing with primary infections, because they contribute to ameliorate the disease outcome. This is mainly a T-dependent response, although some minor T-independent responses have been documented (
