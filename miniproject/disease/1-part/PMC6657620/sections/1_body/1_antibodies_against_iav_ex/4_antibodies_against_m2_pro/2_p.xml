<p>The density of M2 in the virion is low (approximately 60 molecules/virion) compared to the high concentration of HA or NA on the viral membrane. These major glycoproteins also exert an allosteric blockade of M2, which makes it difficult to be reached by B-cell receptors and thus, it generates minimal immunogenicity during a natural infection. However, the N-terminal ectodomain of M2 (M2e) has been targeted in the design of a “universal vaccine,” because it is highly conserved among influenza strains, and because the capacity of anti-M2e Abs to generate heterosubtypic protective responses has been observed in mice (
