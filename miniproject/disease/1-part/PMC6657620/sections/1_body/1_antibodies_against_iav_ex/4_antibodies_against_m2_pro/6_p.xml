<p>In general, the levels of M2-specific Abs in sera of IAV infected patients are low and non-durable (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). However, one study has suggested that anti-M2 Abs may increase with age after a pandemic strain appears. It is explained that a recall humoral response to this protein could be boosted, since the presence of anti-M2 Abs after infection with the pH1N1/2009 strain was detected in nearly 50% of the samples tested, even before anti-HA Abs specific to this strain could be identified (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>).
