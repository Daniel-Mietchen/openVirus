<p>In contrast to the globular domain of HA, the stem domain (or stalk domain) of HA is far less variable, and it has been shown to induce broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs). In 1993, Okuno et al. described for the first time a mAb (C179) specific for the HA stem region in mice. It had no hemagglutination inhibition activity (HAI), but it was capable of neutralizing H1 and H2 viruses (group 1) (
