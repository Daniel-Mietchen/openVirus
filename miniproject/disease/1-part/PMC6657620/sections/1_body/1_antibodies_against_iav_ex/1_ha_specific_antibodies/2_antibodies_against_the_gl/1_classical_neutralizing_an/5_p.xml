<p>An important feature of the neutralizing anti-IAV Ab response, predominantly involving the globular domain of HA, is the phenomenon called 
 <italic>original antigenic sin</italic> (OAS). The term was coined in 1960 by Thomas Francis to describe the fact that in humans, influenza virus infections in childhood leaves an immunological imprint that results in high Abs titers against the childhood encountered virus after being boosted by new drifted virus (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These Abs are mainly directed against the conserved epitopes present in the different virus strains. A possible explanation for this phenomenon, is that there is a competition between memory B cells specific for the first strains and naïve cells specific for the new strain, which need to meet more requirements for activation, such as higher antigen doses (
