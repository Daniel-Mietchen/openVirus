<p>Furthermore, anti-head broadly neutralizing mAbs whose epitopes are farther from the RBS have been described. Ohshima et al. isolated mAbs F045-092 and F026-427 from human B lymphocytes. These mAbs showed activity against the H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 viruses, and their epitopes were also found to be on the globular head of HA (
