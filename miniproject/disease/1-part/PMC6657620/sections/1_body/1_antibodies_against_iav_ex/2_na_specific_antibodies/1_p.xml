<p>Neuraminidase is the second most abundant glycoprotein on the surface of the influenza virion. It is a homotetramer with a mushroom-like form, and it plays two major roles during the IAV infection: It promotes adhesion to the receptors on the epithelial cells because it degrades mucus, and it facilitates viral exit by breaking the interactions between sialic acid and the newborn virions. Neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir act by inhibiting the last step and causing virus aggregation on the cell surface. Each NA monomer is composed of approximately 470 amino acids that form four domains: a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain that is 100% homologous among influenza strains, a transmembrane hydrophobic domain, and a stem-shaped C-terminal domain of variable longitude, which ends in a globular domain where the enzymatic site is located (
