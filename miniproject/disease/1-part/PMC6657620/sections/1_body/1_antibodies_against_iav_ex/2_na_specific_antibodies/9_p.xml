<p>Regarding cross-protection of anti-NA Abs, mice vaccinated with different recombinant NA resulted in reduction of mortality against influenza virus challenges with heterologous (not heterosubtypic) strains. This protection was dependent of specific-NA Abs, as shown by passive transference experiments (

Additionally, Sandbulte et al. found that anti-N1 Abs can protect mice from a lethal challenge with the avian H5N1 subtype when previously immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding for N1 from human virus A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1). Furthermore, they showed that human Abs detected in 81.6% (31/38) of the subjects were capable of inhibiting NA activity against the avian strain, suggesting that the incorporation of NA to TIV vaccines or the natural infection could offer protection against new pandemic strains such as H5N1(

In this respect, Gillim-Rose and Subbarao debated Sandbulte's hypothesis pointing out that these data are still insufficient to predict a protective heterologous response to H5N1 in the human population. In consequence, forthcoming studies should focus on the magnitude and biological advantage of cross-reactive N1 Abs before considering the inclusion of this IAV protein in a vaccine (
