<p>NA-specific Abs induce infection-permissive immunity by limiting the viral load through interference with the exit of the virions. In other words, they do not prevent infection, but they contribute to ameliorate the clinical symptoms of disease. Among these Abs, those that are directed to the enzymatic site have the highest activity of neuraminidase inhibition (NAI), because they apparently limit the access of natural substrate to the catalytic site (
