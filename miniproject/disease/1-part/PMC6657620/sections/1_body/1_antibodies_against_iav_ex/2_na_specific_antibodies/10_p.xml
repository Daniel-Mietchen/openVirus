<p>Up to now, discussion has focused on the possible incorporation of NA in an anti-influenza vaccine. However, more information is required to determine the amount of antigen, the serologic data of NAI titers, and the type of vaccine to achieve the best protective immune response in humans. In this regard, present vaccines are designed for the production of anti-HA Abs, while the NA content has not yet been standardized (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Attenuated vaccines present the same concern as a natural infection, since they contain a considerable higher proportion of HA than of NA (5:1) in the virion, which leads to an antigenic competition, where the HA-specific B-cell response overcomes the NA-specific B cell response (

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). However, this antigenic superiority of HA over NA in terms of antibody production observed both in the natural infection and with vaccination is lost when proteins are administered separately and in the same proportion (

However, it seems that current data on NA-immunity is still insufficient. In this regard, for a more specific review, a recent publication addressed thoroughly the major knowledge gaps, pointing out the actions that should be taken on this matter (
