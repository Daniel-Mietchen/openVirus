  <p> Effect of Rev-erb ligands on Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication. A, Huh7 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 1) and treated with indicated compounds (10 µM) or DMSO solvent control at 1 hpi. Supernatants were titered at 24 hpi. B, Huh7 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 5) and treated with different concentrations of SR9009 at 1 hpi. Supernatants were titered at 8, 24, and 48 hpi. C, Huh7 cells were infected as in (B), and protein lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis at 6, 12, and 24 hpi. D, Huh7 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 5) and treated with SR9009 at 1 hpi. At 23 hpi, puromycin was added to the culture supernatant at a final concentration of 10 µg/mL, and whole-cell lysate was harvested 1 hour later (24 hpi). Protein samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Values are the means±SD. Significant values are defined by
