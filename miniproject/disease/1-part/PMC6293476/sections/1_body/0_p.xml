<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that belongs to the alphavirus genus [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. After mosquito bite, CHIKV replicates locally in the skin, causes viremia, and disseminates to the joints and muscles [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately 85% of infected individuals develop symptoms, including rash, fever, and severe joint pain, which are usually self-limiting. Chronic arthralgia, however, can persist for months, and sometimes years, for a subset of patients [
