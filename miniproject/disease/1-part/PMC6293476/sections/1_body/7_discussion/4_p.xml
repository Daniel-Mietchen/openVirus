<p>Repurposing of compounds originally developed for in vivo metabolism studies, such as SR9009, is a promising avenue for identifying potential antiviral therapeutics, but additional work needs to done to establish the mechanism, specificity, and safety. It is conceivable to improve the therapeutic index by utilizing both virus-targeting compounds/antibodies and host-targeting compounds for combinatorial effect to decrease viral burden, pathogenesis, and epidemic spread.</p>
