<p>During the course of alphavirus infection, the translational machinery is altered in such a way that host protein synthesis is halted whereas viral protein synthesis is permitted [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To determine if host translational shutoff still occurs in agonist-treated cells, infection was allowed to proceed as described before in the presence of SR9009 or DMSO, and at 23 hpi, puromycin was added to the culture media for 1 hour before harvesting whole-cell lysates. Mock-infected cells incorporated puromycin efficiently, whereas puromycin detection in infected cells was drastically reduced (

 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Even though SR9009 reduced synthesis of viral capsid protein, there was no proportional increase in puromycin detection. These results show that the early events of the viral life cycle (RNA synthesis and translation shutoff) are not conspicuously perturbed by the compound.
