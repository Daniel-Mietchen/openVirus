<p>To determine if Rev-erb ligands, reported in the literature to have beneficial in vivo effects in mice [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], can modulate alphavirus replication, we tested 3 structurally similar synthetic compounds. SR9009 is an agonist [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], whereas GSK4112 is a first-generation compound with weaker potency [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. GSK2945 was reported to have antagonist function [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Huh7 cells, which are highly permissive for CHIKV replication, were infected with CHIKV (MOI 1) and treated with the 3 compounds (10 Î¼M) or DMSO. Titration of supernatant at 24 hours postinfection (hpi) showed that GSK4112 led to a 9-fold decrease in viral titer, whereas the effect of GSK2945 was less than 2-fold (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication at MOI 5 (
