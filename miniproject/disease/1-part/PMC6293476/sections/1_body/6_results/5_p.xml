<p>To determine if interferon signaling plays a role, we co-treated cells with SR9009 and ruxolitinib, a Jak inhibitor that efficiently suppresses the interferon signaling pathway, and found no difference in viral titer even at conditions that prevented ISG15 induction (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). We also rule out failure to cleave the polyprotein as a potential mechanism, as there was no accumulation of higherâ€“molecular weight E2E1 protein, and degradation is most likely not the cause of the phenotype, as MG132 (proteasome inhibitor), NMS-873 (ERAD inhibitor), and bafilomycin A (autophagy inhibitor) failed to rescue the levels (
