<p>The alphavirus genome encodes for 2 polyproteins: an early nonstructural polyprotein that becomes sequentially cleaved to carry out viral RNA synthesis and a late structural polyprotein that produces the capsid and envelope proteins [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Time-course immunoblot analysis of infected cell lysates showed that the levels of the nonstructural proteins nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 were slightly lower in cells treated with SR9009 (
