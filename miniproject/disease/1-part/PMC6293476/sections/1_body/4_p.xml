<p>As Rev-erbα/β are amenable to pharmacological manipulation both in vitro and in vivo, we tested the effects of Rev-erbα/β ligands on CHIKV and ONNV replication. We report that cultured cells exposed to the agonist SR9009 inhibit alphavirus replication at a late step, namely at the level of viral structural protein accumulation. In addition, SR9009 attenuates alphavirus-triggered inflammatory gene expression in a murine macrophage cell line. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of principle that a synthetic agonist of a host nuclear receptor can inhibit arboviruses.</p>
