After mosquito bite, CHIKV replicates locally in the skin, causes viremia, and disseminates to the joints and muscles [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately 85% of infected individuals develop symptoms, including rash, fever, and severe joint pain, which are usually self-limiting. Chronic arthralgia, however, can persist for months, and sometimes years, for a subset of patients [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There are no approved vaccines or therapeutics against CHIKV.</p><p>Although CHIKV normally causes sporadic outbreaks, large epidemics have been documented. From 2004 to 2011, an epidemic that began in Kenya spread to India and Southeast Asia, affecting 1.4&#x02013;6.5 million people [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2013, the virus initiated a large epidemic in the Western hemisphere, spreading extensively in the Caribbean and the Americas, with more than 1 million suspected cases [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Additional arthritogenic alphaviruses of clinical significance include Sindbis virus, Ross River virus, Mayaro virus, and O&#x02019;nyong&#x02019;nyong virus (ONNV) [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. So far, these alphaviruses have not caused large outbreaks on the scale of CHIKV epidemics. An exception is ONNV, which is transmitted by <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitos and infected more than 2 million people in East Africa from 1959 to 1961 before smoldering out [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Viral replication is a spatially and temporally regulated sequence of metabolic reactions within the host cell that results in accumulation of biomass in the form of viral particles that reinitiate the same cycle in the neighboring cell. Thus, manipulating the host cell to render the intracellular environment hostile to the replication cycle is 1 method of inhibiting viruses. Rev-erb&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; belong to the nuclear receptor family of genes and are ubiquitously expressed transcriptional repressors that, upon binding to endogenous heme in the ligand binding domain, recruit corepressors to downregulate target genes involved in circadian rhythm, metabolism, and inflammation [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the liver, Rev-erb&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; prevent metabolic dysfunction and lipid accumulation, whereas in the muscle, Rev-erb&#x003b1; is required to maintain optimal mitochondrial function and exercise endurance [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. The presence of a ligand binding domain allows these factors to be pharmacologically exploited, and synthetic agonists have been developed that target Rev-erb&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; to improve metabolic dysfunction of diet-induced obesity in mice and inhibit inflammatory response in immune cells [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>As Rev-erb&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; are amenable to pharmacological manipulation both in vitro and in vivo, we tested the effects of Rev-erb&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ligands on CHIKV and ONNV replication. We report that cultured cells exposed to the agonist SR9009 inhibit alphavirus replication at a late step, namely at the level of viral structural protein accumulation. In addition, SR9009 attenuates alphavirus-triggered inflammatory gene expression in a murine macrophage cell line. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of principle that a synthetic agonist of a host nuclear receptor can inhibit arboviruses.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Cells, Compounds, and Antibodies</title><p>Details are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Viruses</title><p>CHIKV strain 181/25 was obtained from infectious clone plasmid pSinRep5-181/25ic (Addgene: 60078) by generating viral RNA as described previously [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and transfecting BHK-21 cells using TransIT-mRNA transfection reagent (Mirus Bio).</p><p>ONNV strain SG650 and Zika virus strain FSS13025 were obtained from the University of Texas Medical Branch World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses.

GSK2945 was reported to have antagonist function [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Huh7 cells, which are highly permissive for CHIKV replication, were infected with CHIKV (MOI 1) and treated with the 3 compounds (10 &#x003bc;M) or DMSO. Titration of supernatant at 24 hours postinfection (hpi) showed that GSK4112 led to a 9-fold decrease in viral titer, whereas the effect of GSK2945 was less than 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, the more potent agonist SR9009 led to a &#x0003e;100-fold decrease in infectious progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication at MOI 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>&#x02003;Effect of Rev-erb ligands on Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication.

At 23 hpi, puromycin was added to the culture supernatant at a final concentration of 10 &#x000b5;g/mL, and whole-cell lysate was harvested 1 hour later (24 hpi).

Cells were infected with CHIKV and treated with SR9009 as before. At 12 hpi, cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody against double-stranded RNA. We did not observe any striking difference in the localization or level of dsRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitative assessment of viral RNA synthesis was performed with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at 12 and 24 hpi. There was no significant difference in the levels of CHIKVE1, and the only statistically significant difference in the level of CHIKVnsP2 was at 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Cell viability was not affected as assessed by MTT assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, viral RNA synthesis and toxicity do not account for the antiviral activities of the Rev-erb ligand.</p><p>The alphavirus genome encodes for 2 polyproteins: an early nonstructural polyprotein that becomes sequentially cleaved to carry out viral RNA synthesis and a late structural polyprotein that produces the capsid and envelope proteins [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Time-course immunoblot analysis of infected cell lysates showed that the levels of the nonstructural proteins nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 were slightly lower in cells treated with SR9009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In contrast to the moderate effects on nonstructural proteins, SR9009 caused a more pronounced reduction of both viral capsid and envelope proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). By performing a time-of-addition study, we found that even treating cells beginning at 6 hpi caused dramatic reduction in viral titer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), consistent with SR9009 inhibiting a relatively late event in the replication cycle. The compound also showed a reduction in viral titer and structural protein levels in infected human foreskin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>During the course of alphavirus infection, the translational machinery is altered in such a way that host protein synthesis is halted whereas viral protein synthesis is permitted [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To determine if host translational shutoff still occurs in agonist-treated cells, infection was allowed to proceed as described before in the presence of SR9009 or DMSO, and at 23 hpi, puromycin was added to the culture media for 1 hour before harvesting whole-cell lysates. Mock-infected cells incorporated puromycin efficiently, whereas puromycin detection in infected cells was drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Even though SR9009 reduced synthesis of viral capsid protein, there was no proportional increase in puromycin detection. These results show that the early events of the viral life cycle (RNA synthesis and translation shutoff) are not conspicuously perturbed by the compound.</p><p>To determine if interferon signaling plays a role, we co-treated cells with SR9009 and ruxolitinib, a Jak inhibitor that efficiently suppresses the interferon signaling pathway, and found no difference in viral titer even at conditions that prevented ISG15 induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). We also rule out failure to cleave the polyprotein as a potential mechanism, as there was no accumulation of higher&#x02013;molecular weight E2E1 protein, and degradation is most likely not the cause of the phenotype, as MG132 (proteasome inhibitor), NMS-873 (ERAD inhibitor), and bafilomycin A (autophagy inhibitor) failed to rescue the levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, SR9009 does not markedly affect the synthesis of VSV proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Thus, SR9009 preferentially blocks CHIKV translation.</p><p>ONNV is the arthritogenic alphavirus most closely related to CHIKV and has the potential to spread from Africa [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similar to CHIKV, SR9009 reduced ONNV replication &#x0003e; 2 log<sub>10</sub> fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, SR9009 failed to appreciably inhibit VSV replication and only moderately affected Zika virus replication, with a 6-fold reduction at the highest concentration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>&#x02003;SR9009 preferentially inhibits alphavirus replication and suppresses inflammatory gene expression in murine macrophage cell lines. A, Huh7 cells were infected with O&#x02019;nyong&#x02019;nyong virus (ONNV; MOI 5), GFP-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP; MOI 0.5), or Zika virus (ZIKV; MOI 3) and treated with increasing doses of SR9009. Supernatants were titered at 24 hpi. B, Huh7 cells were infected with ONNV (MOI 10) or left uninfected. At 6 hpi, cells were trypsinized and seeded on top of Raw264.7 cells pretreated for 1 hour with SR9009 (final = 10 &#x000b5;M) or DMSO. Twenty-four hours later, total RNA was harvested from the co-cultured cells and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with murine-specific primers.

As macrophages play a role in alphavirus-induced arthralgia and infection causes cytopathic effect [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we sought to determine whether inflammation in macrophages can be subdued by SR9009. Huh7 cells were infected with ONNV (or left uninfected) and seeded on top of murine Raw264.7 macrophage cells that were pretreated for 1 hour with SR9009 or DMSO. The in vitro co-culture simulates contact of macrophages with infected cells. Twenty-four hours after co-culturing, intracellular RNA was harvested for qRT-PCR analysis using primers that only detect murine mRNA. When Raw264.7 cells were co-cultured with ONNV-infected Huh7 cells, there was elevation in mRNA levels of CCL2, IL6, TNF&#x003b1;, and MMP9 that were reduced by SR9009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The interferon-stimulated gene Tetherin showed a statistically insignificant downward trend with SR9009 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results show that in addition to inhibiting alphavirus replication, Rev-erb agonist may also downregulate host inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Chikungunya virus circulates in a sylvatic cycle between nonhuman primates and mosquitos in Africa, but spillover infection of humans can lead to an urban cycle and outbreak under the right ecological conditions [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Due to the explosive and unpredictable spread of this highly debilitating virus, surveillance is necessary, as well as the identification of pathways that can be manipulated in a targeted manner to block virus multiplication.</p><p>Rev-erb &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; are ubiquitously expressed ligand-activated transcriptional repressors with diverse physiological functions, including circadian rhythm, inflammatory response, central carbon metabolism, and lipid homeostasis, and synthetic agonists have been developed that ameliorate metabolic dysfunction in mouse models [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We report that the same compound, SR9009, also inhibits alphavirus (CHIKV and ONNV) replication in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Although nonstructural protein levels were slightly decreased, viral RNA accumulation was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The most pronounced defect was observed at the level of structural protein synthesis. Host translational shutoff still occurred in the presence of SR9009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), and there was no accumulation of unprocessed polyprotein or evidence of enhanced degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that even though viral translation is poised to be favored after host translation is blocked, subgenomic RNA translation is still inhibited. Although the mechanism is not clear, SR9009 might modulate the composition of the endoplasmic reticulum to hinder proper insertion of viral polyprotein. Alternatively, the ribosomal complex or subunit that is required during alphavirus replication, but not VSV or flavivirus replication, may be altered such that ribosomal loading of RNA or translation initiation is prevented. Further studies are required to pinpoint the mechanism that targets alphaviruses.</p><p>Rev-erb &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; also repress inflammatory response in macrophages [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and this may be physiologically pertinent to alphaviruses, as macrophages are involved in joint damage induced by infection and host response [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In an in vitro co-culture system, we show that Rev-erb agonist can suppress macrophage transcript levels of select inflammatory genes (IL6, TNF&#x003b1;, CCL2, and MMP9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), which are involved in rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and implicated in alphavirus-induced joint pathology [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additional studies may be warranted to determine if Rev-erb agonists can suppress arthritogenesis after CHIKV infection in vivo. Plasma levels of SR9009 have been reported to reach up to 20 &#x003bc;M in murine studies [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], near the range we tested in our in vitro studies (10&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;M).</p><p>Repurposing of compounds originally developed for in vivo metabolism studies, such as SR9009, is a promising avenue for identifying potential antiviral therapeutics, but additional work needs to done to establish the mechanism, specificity, and safety. It is conceivable to improve the therapeutic index by utilizing both virus-targeting compounds/antibodies and host-targeting compounds for combinatorial effect to decrease viral burden, pathogenesis, and epidemic spread.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s7"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
