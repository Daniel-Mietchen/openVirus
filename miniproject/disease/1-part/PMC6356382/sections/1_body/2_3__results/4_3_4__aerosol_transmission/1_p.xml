<p>Two groups of nine mice were i.n. inoculated with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 Î¼L of either SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2. An equal number of sentinel mice were housed separately. The infected and sentinel mice were separated by a double-walled mesh wire, which prevented direct contact but facilitated aerosol transmission. As expected, all the animals in the infected groups displayed detectable viral RNA loads in the lungs at 3, 5, and 7 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). The viral load of the infected animals peaked at 7 dpi at 10
 <sup>6.67</sup> and 10
 <sup>6.43</sup> RNA copies/g for SCYA201201 and SA14-14-2, respectively. None of the sentinel animals displayed detectable viral RNA loads at 3 dpi, but two out of three SCYA201201-infected mouse lungs displayed 10
 <sup>2.8</sup> RNA copies/g at 5 dpi. At 7 dpi, viral RNA was detected in the lungs of three out of three or two out of three mice with an averaged titer of 10
 <sup>4.38</sup> and 10
 <sup>2.73</sup> RNA copies/g in the SCYA201201 and SA14-14-2 groups, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). A higher titer of infectious virus was found in the lungs of the SCYA201201-infected mice on 3, 5, and 7 dpi when titrated by the plaque assay. In contrast, SA14-14-2 was only found at 5 and 7 dpi. Infectious viruses were detected at 7 dpi in the sentinel mice of both virus infection groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). However, a neutralization antibody was not detected in all the serum samples of the infected and sentinel mice on 3, 5, and 7 dpi. Our results indicate that JEVs are capable of aerosol transmission in mice under experimental conditions.
