<p>In this study, we examine the capabilities of two different genotypes of JEVs, which also differ in virulence, to transmit in mice via either contact or aerosol routes. The designed studies aim to determine the potential of viral shedding and transmission to better understand non-vector-borne disease outbreaks. First, we define the tissue tropism of both viruses when administered via the intranasal route, then we determine the dose response to JEV infection in the mouse lung and the potential of contact transmission of JEV in mice. Finally, we determine the potential of aerosol transmission among mice.</p>
