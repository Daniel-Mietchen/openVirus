<p>As evidenced for other arthropod-borne viruses, a combination of factors ranging from environmental factors to viral genetic changes may have contributed to the selection and spread of new epidemic variants of ZIKV through a naïve population in tropical and subtropical areas. Currently, the occurrence of human ZIKV infections has dramatically decreased in Latin America. This decrease may be partially due to the population’s previous experience with natural ZIKV infection and the subsequent development of immunity.

 </xref> Additionally, other seasonal changes can influence the biology of vectors and can affect host-pathogen interactions; this generates a variation in the timing and severity of epidemic dynamics, as has been demonstrated by studies on other infectious agents.

 </xref> Although a decrease in ZIKV transmission has been observed in the last two years, human cases are sporadically detected, which highlights the possibility of a new epidemic event. Clarifying the dynamic of ZIKV infections between animals, human hosts and vectors should aid in preventing new epidemic outbreaks and in developing strategies for controlling ZIKV infections.
