 <italic>In vitro kinetics infection</italic> - To perform the biological characterisation studies of recent ZIKV clinical isolates we used two well-characterised ZIKV strains, MR766 and PE243, as reference viruses. The African ZIKV MR766 strain (GenBank accession number NC_012532) was originally isolated in 1947 from a rhesus monkey. The Asian ZIKV PE243 (GenBank accession number KX197192) was isolated in Recife from a patient with classical symptoms of ZIKV infection in 2015. The ZIKV strains ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261, ZV BR 2016/16288, MR766 and PE243 were used to infect mammalian (Vero E6, Huh7.5 and A549 cell lines seeded into 96-well plates at densities of 1.5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and insect (Aag-2, AP61 and C6/36 cell lines seeded into 96-well plates at densities of 1.5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 3 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 8 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well, respectively) cells at an MOI of 0.1 and 1 for one hour. After, the viral inoculum was removed followed by the addition of the appropriate media. The percentage of infected cells was evaluated 24, 48 and 72 hours post infection (h.p.i.) by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G2; ATCC HB-112). The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. The images were obtained with the Operetta CLS high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer) with a 20x objective and were quantified using Harmony software (PerkinElmer).
