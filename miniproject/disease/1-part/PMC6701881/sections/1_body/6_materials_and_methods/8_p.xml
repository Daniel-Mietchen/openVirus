 <italic>Sequence analyses</italic> - Two different datasets were used for the phylogenetic analysis. For dataset 1, only the sequences with 100% query coverage in a Blast (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) search using ZV BR 2016/16288 as the query were selected. The sequences were aligned using ClustalW as implemented in BioEdit version 7.2.6.1 and were manually edited in the ORF region to avoid codon disruption by inserted gaps. Dataset 2 comprised sequences presenting 100% query coverage in a Blast search using ZV BR 2016/16288 ORF as the query. The sequences were codon aligned using Muscle as implemented in MEGA 7.0.26. Redundant sequences, sequences which presented no information regarding the country or collection date, and the sequences of synthetic constructs were excluded from both datasets. RDP4 Beta 4.97 was used to identify potential recombinants and to exclude them from the alignment as described in. ModelGenerator v0.85 was used for the selection of a nucleotide substitution model. Phylogenetic tree inference was performed in MrBayes v.3.2.6. using three hot chains and one cold chain and was run for 1 million (dataset 1) or 6 million (dataset 2) generations with a 25% burn-in. FigTree v.1.4.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and Inkscape 0.92 were used to edit the tree. The HMMTOP tool (http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/), which was run with the default settings, was used for the prediction of the transmembrane helices in the NS2A protein. The hydrophobicity plot of the NS4B protein was computed using the ProtScale tool (https://web.expasy.org/protscale/) based on a Kyte &amp; Doolittle scale with the default settings. For the RNA secondary structure prediction in the 3â€™UTR, the mfold web server (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form) was used with the default settings. Only the highest revised free energy structure is presented.
