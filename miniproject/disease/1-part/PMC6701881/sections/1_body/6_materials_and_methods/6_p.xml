<p>The complete genomes of the ZIKV isolates were obtained by sequencing the overlapping PCR products. The viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and was reverse transcribed with Improm-II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 10 µM random primers. PCR was performed using the LongRange PCR kit (Qiagen) with 0.8 µM primers [

The amplicons were purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche) or QIAquick Gel extraction Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced by Macrogen DNA sequencing service (Seoul, South Korea) in an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using specific ZIKV primers [
