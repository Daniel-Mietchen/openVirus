 <italic>Human monocyte-derived Dendritic Cell culture and ZIKV infection</italic> - The peripheral blood samples were obtained by venipuncture from six healthy donors after written consent was given (Committee of Research Ethics from Fiocruz- CAAE: 49931415.7.1001.5248/Fiocruz). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained by density gradient separation with Ficoll-Paque PLUS at a density of 1.077 g/mL (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). CD14
 <sup>+</sup> cells were purified by positive selection with human anti-CD14 Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. For dendritic cell differentiation, CD14
 <sup>+</sup> cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza) containing 100 IU/mL penicillin (Gibco), 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), 10% FBS supplemented with 25 ng/mL interleukin-4 (IL-4) and 12.5 ng/mL granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and were incubated at 37ºC in 5% CO
 <sub>2.</sub> Three days later, new media was added, and the cells were incubated for 4 more days. The monocyte-derived Dendritic Cell (mdDC) differentiation was confirmed by flow cytometry using anti-CD11c-PE-Cy5, anti-CD209-APC and anti-CD14-BV450 antibodies (all from BD Bioscience, CA, USA).
