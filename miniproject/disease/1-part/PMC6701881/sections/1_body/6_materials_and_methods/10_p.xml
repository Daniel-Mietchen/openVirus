 <italic>Virus biological characterisation</italic> - Initially, an infection kinetics assay was performed using the MOIs of 0.1 and 1 for 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i to select the best time point and MOI to carry the biological characterisation experiments in the different cell lines. Vero E6, Huh7.5 and A549 cells were infected with the ZIKV strains using an MOI of 0.1 and a period of incubation of 48 h. AP61 and C6/36 cells were infected with the ZIKV strains using an MOI of 1 and a period of incubation of 72 h. The cells were plated in 96 well plates, and after the period of incubation, the cells were fixed with methanol:acetone (v/v). The expression of viral E protein was analysed by immunofluorescence using an anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G2), as described above. In addition, the same infection was performed in 24 well plates. The cell supernatants were collected for virus titration by focus-forming assay, and the total RNA was extracted from cells for subsequent ZIKV genome RNA quantification. For all the experiments, the mock-infected cells were used as the negative control for the infection. The statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. The differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05.
