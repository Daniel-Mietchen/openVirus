<p>Attempts to isolate the ZV BR 2015/15098 in cell culture were not successful. Therefore, two-day-old BALB/c mice (n = 5) were inoculated intracranially with the serum sample (~ 20 ÂµL). Ten days post-inoculation, the virus was recovered from two of them. The passage 0 (P0) corresponds to a 10% mouse brain suspension in PBS. ZV BR 2015/15261 viral isolation (P0) was performed on C6/36 cells for 22 days of culture, with medium exchange occurring at day 8. The isolation of ZV BR 2016/16288 was successful in both the C6/36 and Vero E6 cells, with the virus collection occurring on day 17 post-inoculation. The viral isolations were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence
