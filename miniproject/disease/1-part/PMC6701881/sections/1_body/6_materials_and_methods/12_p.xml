 <italic>ZIKV genomic RNA quantification</italic> - RNA was extracted from mock- or ZIKV-infected cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s recommendation. ZIKV RT-qPCR was performed in a 20 μL reaction master mix (Promega) containing 10 ng of sample RNA, 500 nM of the ZIKV1086 and ZIKV1162c oligonucleotides and 200 nM of ZIKV1107-FAM probe according to a previously described protocol.

 </xref> For the analyses of mosquito cells, RT-qPCR using 250 nM of the primers 18SF (5’-CCCGTCGGCATGTATTAGCT-3’) and 18SR (5’-CACGGCCGGTACAGTGAAAC-3’) was performed for the amplification of the 18S rRNA gene, which was used as housekeeping gene for those cells. The housekeeping genes were included in all analyses for data normalisation. The relative ZIKV genomic RNA expression level was determined by calculating the 2
