<p>The ZIKV genome consists of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 11 kb in length. The viral RNA architecture is composed of two noncoding regions at the 5’ and 3’ extremities flanking a single open reading frame (ORF). The viral ORF encodes a polyprotein that, after cleavage by viral and host cell proteases, generates three structural proteins [capsid (C), premembrane (prM) and envelope (E)] that constitute the viral particle and encode seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) that are mainly involved in viral replication and immune system evasion.
