<p>Aiming to evaluate the ability of different ZIKV isolates from Brazil to infect a primary human cell target, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDC) were used. After a 24 h infection period, it was possible to demonstrate the presence of envelope protein (4G2
 <sup>+</sup>) of ZIKV in mdDCs infected with the three clinical isolates of ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>A-B). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the frequency of mdDCs (CD11c
 <sup>+</sup>/CD14
 <sup>-</sup>/CD209
 <sup>+</sup>) infected (4G2
 <sup>+</sup>) with ZV BR 2015/15261 (25.54% ± 21.12) was similar to the frequency of infection with ZIKV PE243 (27.47% ± 16.98) and ZIKV MR766 (24.84% ± 20.49). Conversely, the ZIKV strains ZV BR 2015/15098 (8.31% ± 6.29), that presented a better viral fitness on A459, Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cells, as well as the ZV BR 2016/16288 (10.40% ± 6.03), were shown to be less efficient in infecting mdDCs compared to the infection efficiencies of the ZV BR 2015/15261, PE243 and MR766 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>A-B). Unlike the high infection rates observed after 48 h in mammalian cells or 72 h in insect cells, the mdDC infection rates with all ZIKV strains tested decreased over time (data not shown). The virus titration of cell culture supernatants confirmed the results of the abilities of viruses to replicate and release infective particles in cell supernatants (
