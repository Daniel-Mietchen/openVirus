  <title>midpoint-rooted consensus tree of Zika virus (ZIKV) complete genome sequences inferred through Bayesian methodology using MrBayes v.3.2.6. based on the general, time-reversible model with gamma-distributed rate variation (GTR+G). The numbers shown to the left of the nodes represent posterior probabilities (ngen = 1000000). The sequences of the third passage of the Brazilian isolates reported in this manuscript are depicted in bold face. The map indicates the places of origin of the samples and the distance in kilometers between them. The following criteria was used for the identification of sequences included in this analysis: GenBank accession number/two letter country abbreviation/year of isolation. Information on country codes can be found in the Supplementary data.</title>
