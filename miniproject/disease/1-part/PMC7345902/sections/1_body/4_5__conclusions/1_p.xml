<p>Our results suggest that the RT-RPA could be an alternative to real-time PCR in low resource settings. This field deployment contributed to the evaluation of the feasibility to implement point of need arbovirus diagnostics in primary care settings and showed that RT-RPA can be a reliable and accurate diagnosis tool for the detection of NMFI in low-income settings. However, studies with larger cohorts are needed.</p>
