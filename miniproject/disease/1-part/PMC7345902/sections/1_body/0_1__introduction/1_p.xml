<p>In Africa, fever is the most common symptom leading patients to seek health care [

 <xref rid="B3-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With encouraging gains in malaria control in Sub-Saharan African countries, the incidence of this disease is in decline, leading to a decreasing proportion of febrile illness attributable to malaria. Between 2000 and 2013, malaria mortality rates decreased by 47% globally, and by 54% in sub-Saharan Africa—the region most affected by the disease—whereas the proportion of patients presenting with non-malaria febrile illness (NMFI) increased, respectively [

 <xref rid="B5-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although resulting in a higher mortality than malaria, NMFIs are not being reliably diagnosed due to the lack of accurate, rapid and affordable diagnostic tests, and also due to poor access to diagnostics facilities in many resource-poor endemic settings [

 <xref rid="B7-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The objective of this study was to determine potential arboviral etiologies of NMFI in children in a low resource setting, using mobile recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)—a real-time isothermal amplification technique [
 <xref rid="B8-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For this purpose, we conducted a prospective arbovirus investigation in children seeking healthcare, at a health centre in the Dakar suburb of Medina Gounass, during a period of six months—from September 2015 to March 2016. The mobile suitcase laboratory has also been successfully used for Ebola virus detection [
