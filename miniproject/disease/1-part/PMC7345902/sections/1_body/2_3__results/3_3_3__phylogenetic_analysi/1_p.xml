<p>Finally, the sequence of the CprM gene of the two isolates was determined and deposited in genbank (accessions numbers MK940790 (Medina gounass 1/2015), and MK940791 (Medina gounass 1/2015)). Both strains were completely homologous (100%), with no nucleotide difference. A basic local alignment search tool for nucleotide (BLASTN), using the obtained C-prM gene sequence, showed 100% identity with the DENV-1 isolates collected in Guangzhou, China, in 2014 (KP279753.1). A calculated phylogenetic tree clustered the determined DENV-1 sequences with Asian strains, supported by high bootstrap values (
