<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained DENV C-prM gene sequences yielded 100% identity with the isolates collected in Guangzhou, China, in 2014. A calculated phylogenetic tree clustered the determined DENV-1 sequences with Asian strains, supported by high bootstrap values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00408-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This finding suggests an importation of the virus to Senegal from Asia, via acutely viremic cases or by infected mosquitoes or their eggs. Indeed, in recent years, international travel and trade activity between the Asian and African continents has increased considerably [

Another example is the first case of RVFV infection, detected in China from a patient returning from Angola in 2017—while this virus was previously restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, it has been spreading in the Arabic peninsula since 2000 [
