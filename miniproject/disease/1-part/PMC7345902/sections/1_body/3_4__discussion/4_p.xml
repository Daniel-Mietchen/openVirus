<p>The border between interepidemic and epidemic prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is difficult to assess, as noted by a study on febrile patients in Ibadan, Nigeria [
 <xref rid="B26-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which determined a prevalence of 35% of dengue infection through NS1 antigen detection. The infected patients secrete large quantities of soluble NS1 (sNS1) into the bloodstream, with concentrations of up to 50 Âµg/mL [
 <xref rid="B27-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Soluble NS1 (sNS1) can remain in the blood for 9 days, and persist for up to 18 days in some patients [
 <xref rid="B28-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], exceeding viremia which lasts up to 6 days. This makes NS1 a good biomarker of acute illness as it provides a wide window for DENV detection. It has been suggested that combining NS1 detection with IgM detection can outperform PCR [
 <xref rid="B29-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; however, the use of NS1 detection in the routine screening in dengue epidemics, as a prerequisite for hospitalization, has been questioned [
 <xref rid="B30-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, fieldable ELISA systems which would allow for a comparison between the ratios of DENV NS1-Ag and DENV-RNA, are not currently available.
