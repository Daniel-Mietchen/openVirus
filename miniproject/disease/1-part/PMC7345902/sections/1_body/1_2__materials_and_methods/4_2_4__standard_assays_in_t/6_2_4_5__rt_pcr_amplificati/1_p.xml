<p>To define the serotype of the isolated DENV strains, viral RNA was extracted from 200 μL of DENV infected C6/36 culture supernatant, using the QIAmp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The C-prM gene was amplified using the primers (DS1/DS2) described by Lanciotti et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For cDNA synthesis, 10 μL of viral RNA was mixed with 1 μL of the random hexamer primer (2 pmol), and the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 2 min. The reverse transcription was performed in a 20 μL mixture containing 2.5 U RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 1 μL of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) (10 mM each DNTP), and 5 U of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), which was incubated at 42 °C for 60 min. The PCR products were generated using DS1/DS2 primers at 10 µM concentration. Five microliters of cDNA were mixed with 10× buffer, 3 μL of each primer, 5 μL of dNTPs 10 mM, 3 μL of MgCl2, and 0.5 μL of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Amplicons of the expected size (520 bp) were purified from the agarose gel, with the QiaQuick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as specified by the manufacturer. Both strands of each amplicon were Sanger sequenced out-of-house (Genewiz, Germany). The sequences were merged using EMBOSS Merger software, and final results were analyzed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST,

The nucleotide sequence alignments were generated using the ClustalW algorithm, and Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were inferred for each serotype using Mega software version 6 [
