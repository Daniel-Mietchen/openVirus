<p>We determined the presence of DENV, YFV, RVFV, CHIKV and ZIKV IgM in our samples by a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC ELISA), following a published protocol [
 <xref rid="B21-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For the coating step, a monoclonal capture antibody (anti human IgM) was added to a 96-well microtiter plate, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The human sera were heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min), and screened at a dilution of 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), supplemented with 0.05% Tween and 1% milk powder. After washing the plate three times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, a 1/100 dilution of the different serum samples and controls were added in duplicate to the plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The wells were washed three times, specific and non-specific antigens were deposited, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After another washing step, the specific immune ascites were added to each well. After incubation and washing, a conjugate (peroxidase labelled antibody specific to mouse IgG) was added and allowed to react for 1 h at 37 °C. A tetra-methylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added to the IgM conjugate complex, and the coloration reaction was stopped with sulphuric acid. The intensity of the coloration was proportional to the level of virus specific antibodies present in the serum. An ELISA microplate reader showed the optical density (OD) of the absorbance—an OD unit ≥ 0.2 was defined as a positive IgM.
