<p>The NS1 antigen assay was performed using the Platelia
 <sup>TM</sup> Dengue NS1 Ag-ELISA kit (Biorad Laboratories, Marnes-La-Coquette, France), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The capture and revelation steps were performed using a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb). The presence of the NS1 antigen in a sample was assessed by the formation of an immune-complex MAb-NS1-MAb (peroxidase). Briefly, 50 μL of the serum sample, 50 μL of the sample diluent (Diluent R7), and 100 μL of the diluted conjugate were added to each well precoated with the anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody. For each assay, positive and negative controls, as well as calibrator sera, were included. The plate was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. After six wash steps—using 250 µL of washing solution (R2)—160 µL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added to each of the wells, and the plate was further incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, followed by the addition of 100 μL of stop solution (1N H2SO4). With the spectrophotometer optical density (OD) readings were measured at wavelengths of 450 nm/620 nm, were obtained and the index of each sample was calculated with the ratio OD of samples/OD of calibrators. Sample ratios &lt;0.5, between 0.5 and 1.0, and &gt;1.0 were classified as negative, equivocal, and positive, respectively.
