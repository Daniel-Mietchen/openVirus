<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 100 μL of human sera, using the QIAmp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reduced input of 100 µL serum for this kit had been validated in-house. The RNA was eluted in 60 μL of elution buffer and placed on ice. To confirm the detection obtained in the field, real-time RT-qPCR assays for DENV [

 <xref rid="B20-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were performed using the Quantitect Probe RT-PCR Master Mix (Qiagen). Briefly, the detection was performed using ABI7500, using the following temperature profiles for all RT-qPCR assays: RT at 50 °C for 10 min, activation at 95 °C for 15 min and 45 cycles of 2-step PCR— at 95 °C for 15 sec and 60 °C for 1 min.
