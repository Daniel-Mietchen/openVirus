<p>Virus isolation was attempted for samples positive with RPA/RT-qPCR. A 200 µL sample was diluted at 1:10 in a Leibovitz 15 medium (L15), then added to a 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask monolayer of C6/36 cell line at 80% confluence, followed by incubation at 28 °C for 1 h, to allow virus adsorption. After incubation, the L15 medium containing 5% FBS, 1% penicillin streptomycin, and 0.05% de fungizone, was added to the flask and incubated for 10 days, or until observation of a cytopathic effect (CPE). To assess viral infection, indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) was conducted as previously described [
 <xref rid="B22-diagnostics-10-00408" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The flask content was transferred to a 15 mL tube, and clarified by low-speed (2500 rpm) centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was harvested and stored at −80 °C, while the cells were washed three times in PBS 1×, resuspended in 4 mL of PBS 1×, and then dispensed onto a glass slide. After complete drying, the cells were fixed in cold (−20°) acetone for 20 min. Staining was performed with a DENV specific hyper-immune mouse ascitic fluid, diluted at 1/40 in PBS 1×, as the first antibody. Then, the cells were incubated for 30 min with the second antibody (1/40 goat anti-mouse IgG, 1/100 Evan’s blue, diluted in PBS 1×). The slides were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Eurostar III plus, Euroimmune).
