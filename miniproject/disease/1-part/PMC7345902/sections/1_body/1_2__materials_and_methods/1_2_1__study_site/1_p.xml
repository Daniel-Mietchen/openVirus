 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00408-f001">Figure 1</xref>)—the capital city of Senegal, West Africa. Built in 1971, this health centre located at Pikine-Guediawaye has an outpatient department with care activities focused on mother and child health. It is also involved in the national program on immunization, in nutritional programs and in family planning. With 22 qualified staff, the health centre has 6 consultation rooms (including one for vaccination), a laboratory and a nutritional service. With around 1,000,000 inhabitants, Pikine-Guediawaye is an agglomeration of well-established traditional villages, and interspersed recent settlements, the latter mostly located in flood-prone areas, where housing is officially forbidden. The western part of these towns is located on the edge of a vast area of permanent marshland (Grande Niaye), where natural marshy hollows and furrows dug for market garden irrigation, as well as areas of prolonged stagnation of rainwater, are observed year-round. With a high density of housing (9200 inhabitants/km) in proximity to stretches of water and stagnant wetlands, the population lives in an under-serviced peripheral area, in crowded conditions, with poor water supply and sanitation, and dirt paths between dwellings and open sewers.
