  <p>Phylogenetic tree based on the C-prM gene sequences using the maximum likelihood (ML) method, showing the relationship of 2 from 3 isolated viruses in this study (darkred circle) with 40 global samples of dengue virus (DENV), and Kimura 2 parameters; the gamma distributed (K2+G+I) nucleotide substitution model was used. The yellow fever 17D (FJ654700.1) was used as the outgroup.</p>
