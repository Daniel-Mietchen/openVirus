<p>EV-A71 is currently an important, threatening infectious agent in the world. It can cause severe neurological disorders and death in infected young children. Due to the lack of effective control measures, the development of effective vaccines is urgently needed for prevention and control of EV-A71 infections. Currently, several candidates for an EV-A71 vaccine exist, including a formalin-inactivated whole virus vaccine, DNA vaccines, VLP and recombinant protein vaccines. Monovalent EV-A71 vaccines are expected to be marketed soon in mainland China, if the process of production goes well. It has been estimated that EV-A71 vaccines will be effective and cost-saving in most developing countries

Currently, inactivated EV-A71 vaccines can protect against EV-A71 but not against CV-A16 infections. All of these EV-A71 vaccines remain in the initial stages of development. Stability, purity and cost of production are the primary future challenges for these vaccines.
