<p>Close person-to-person contact is considered the most common route of EV-A71 transmission. In areas where EV-A71 circulation is present, especially because the clinical manifestations of the majority of EV-A71 infections are mild or asymptomatic, public health interventions, such as the promotion of hand washing, are necessary for the effective prevention of EV-A71 infection. Because effective treatment may not always be available, the best way to control and eradicate EV-A71 infection is to develop an effective vaccine. Several EV-A71 vaccines have been produced
