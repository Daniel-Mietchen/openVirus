<p>What might cause severe or fatal clinical presentations of EV-A71 infection? Based on the results of one autopsy, EV-A71 infection can lead to severe or fatal disease due to pulmonary edema. The mechanism of pulmonary edema among patients with severe EV-A71 infection is currently unclear. Evidences

 </xref> suggest that the brainstem involvement characteristic of EV-A71 infection may be an important etiological mechanism of neurogenic pulmonary edema. Virus-host interactions significantly influence viral replication, virulence and pathogenicity during the viral life cycle
