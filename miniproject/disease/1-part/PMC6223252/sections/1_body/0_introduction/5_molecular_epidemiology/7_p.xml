<p>Comparing the epidemics that have occurred over the past four decades, the epidemiologic features of EV-A71 infections appear to be changing. EV-A71 infection has emerged as an important public health problem around the world. No association has been established between genotype and disease severity

From 1900 to 2016, infections were successively caused by viruses of subgenogroup B0, B1and B2, followed by a shift in this predominance to those belonging to subgenogroups C1, C2, C3, C4a and C4b. A molecular epidemiological study suggested that the evolution of the EV-A71 virus has global characteristics. Global herd immunity against C1 and C2 viruses could possibly explain why epidemics caused by subgenogroups B4 and C4 are restricted to the Asia-Pacific region
