<p>Virus-like particles (VLPs) for EV-A71 are similar in morphology to the natural viral capsid structure and have been developed as potential vaccines

 </xref> . Vaccination with an EV-A71 VLP vaccine showed significant potency against lethal challenge in newborn mice. However, an ideal enterovirus vaccine should be effective against both EV-A71 and Coxsackie virus-A16 (CV-A16) infections. Consequently, a bivalent enterovirus vaccine based on chimeric EV-A71 virus-like particles (ChiEV-A71 VLPs) has been proposed

  <sup>47</sup>
 </xref> . In chimeric EV-A71 VLPs, the neutralizing epitope SP70 within the capsid protein VP1 of EV-A71 was replaced by CV-A16. Chimeric VLPs are able to elicit protective neutralizing antibodies against EV-A71 and CV-A16 in mice

  <sup>47</sup>
 </xref> . Although studies have demonstrated that VLP vaccines can induce protective neutralizing antibodies and show cross-protective efficacy against different EV-A71 subtypes not present in other experimental vaccines, these vaccines have a lower efficacy than inactivated vaccines. They must also be further studied.
