<p>Influenza viruses have two main modes of mutational change: antigenic shift and antigenic drift enabling repeat infection [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Antigenic drift is the accumulation of small mutations in the viral genome leading to antigenic changes over time [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Conversely, antigenic shift is an abrupt change in that results from the rearrangement of genomic RNA segments between two or more influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Antigenic Drift leads to seasonal influenza epidemics while shift is the cause of pandemic influenza virus outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Both avenues lead to antigenically divergent viruses that may no longer be fully recognized by the immune system.
