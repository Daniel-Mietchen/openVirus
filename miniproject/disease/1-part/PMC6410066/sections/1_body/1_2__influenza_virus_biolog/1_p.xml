<p>The segmented RNA genome of the influenza virus family (Orthomyxoviridae) facilitates antigenic variability [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, influenza C and D viruses are not regarded as health threats. In humans, influenza C virus causes mild illness while type D virus is incapable of human infection [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The surface of influenza C virus is defined by a single spike protein referred to as hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein (HEF) [
