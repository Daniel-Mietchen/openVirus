<p>Immune regulation in infants and children is significantly skewed toward Th2 responses and highly regulated by the interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) response network compared to adults [

 <xref rid="B119-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Furthermore, it is well known that children and infants have different clinical outcomes to influenza virus infection and vaccination compared to adults [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], which may be due to the immature respiratory tract or immune system in the young. Tissue damage in the lung can obstruct the narrow immature airway, cause surfactant deficiency, and lead to collapsed lungs and respiratory distress [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] have investigated the immune responses of younger animals and shown age-specific immune responses such as the development of iBALT (inducible Bronchus Associated Lymphoid Tissue) in the lungs of young animals following influenza virus infection [

Despite this evidence, we are unaware of any sequential influenza animal models that imprint during infancy and reinfect during adulthood. The respiratory tract of infants is significantly different from that of the adult, and responds differently to insult. Since the infant lung is not considered mature until 36 months postpartum [
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], it is essential that animal models of recurrent influenza infection take age into account. Having a more complete understanding of influenza infection during youth and the immunity gained will guide vaccine development.
