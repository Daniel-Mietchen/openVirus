<p>Humans build a complex immune history due to repeated exposures with new influenza strains from infection and seasonal vaccinations. The influence of preimmunity was first proposed in the 1960s. Dr. Thomas Francis Jr. suggested that a personâ€™s first influenza virus infection would be deleterious to the clinical outcome of the next infection and referred to this as 
 <italic>Original Antigenic Sin (OAS)</italic> [

The re-stimulated memory immune responses directed toward epitopes of the first virus were thought to cause enhanced disease by failing to control the second viral infection [

 <italic>Negative Interference, Back-boost,</italic> or
