<p>To gain an appreciation for the MsHo memory responses versus primary immune signatures, gene expression from ferrets exposed to homologous reinfection of 2009 H1N1-&gt;2009 H1N1 (21 day recovery period) were compared to the immune responses of ferrets primarily infected with 2009 H1N1 and sH1N1 separately [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Global immune responses in ferrets were evaluated by gene expression profiling. MsHo reinfection 21 days following the initial exposure led to decreased interferon and innate immune responses indicating the inhibition of viral infection. Specifically, the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-10 (CXCL10) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-5 (CCL5) expression which are typical immune markers of viral load were absent day 1 post infection. Furthermore, there was robust gene induction of the T and B cell associated transcripts IGHM (Ig mu chain C region), IGHG (Ig gamma chain C region), and CD8A during MsHo reinfection, indicating the stimulation of previously generated adaptive immune cells [
