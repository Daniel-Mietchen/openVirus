<p>Monsubtypic homologous (MsHo) reinfection occurs when a preimmune host is re-exposed to the same or slightly drifted influenza virus strain. To investigate the nuanced humoral antibody changes that are elicited during MsHo reinfection with a drifted virus, Linderman and Hensley exposed BALB/c mice to inactivated A/PuertoRico/8/1934 virus and 28 days later performed a re-exposure with a drifted strain, A/PuertoRico/8/1934-S12a [

Since the majority of the epitopes remained constant, this experimental strategy allowed the humoral responses to be analytically parsed in respect to antigenic variability. Both previously existing antibodies, as well as novel antibodies, were elicited during the MsHo re-exposure, suggesting that both the reactivation of memory responses as well as novel immune targeting occur during MsHo reinfection of drifted strains [
