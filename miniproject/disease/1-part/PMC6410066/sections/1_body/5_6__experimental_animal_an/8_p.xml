<p>Each year, H1N1, H3N2, B-Yamagata, and B-Victoria influenza virus strains circulate in the human population. Despite the continuing circulation of both A and B influenza viruses, there is a paucity of information regarding heterotypic infection-reinfection events. This is surprising since sequential heterotypic infections in the human population are possible both interseasonal as well as intraseasonal. In the northern hemisphere, the influenza season begins in October lasting until April and peaks early January. Typically, in each season influenza A cases are prominent in the first half to three quarters of the season [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] suggesting viral interference or the opportunistic infection of influenza B viruses in immunosuppressed hosts. One human study documented sequential infections in the same host. Specifically, children who required medical intervention were documented to have been infected with an influenza A strain and then reinfected with an influenza B virus during the same season [

This study provides evidence that the heterotypic infection-reinfection occurs at an observable frequency and can lead to severe disease without cross-protection. Moreover, other studies have showed prominent co-infections of influenza A and influenza B viruses [
