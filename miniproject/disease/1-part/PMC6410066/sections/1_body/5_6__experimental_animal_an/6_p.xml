<p>Heterosubtypic sequential infections (example H1N1 -&gt; H5N1) have also been shown to induce antibody responses directed toward the HA stalk [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Epidemiological data has shown that people imprinted with HA group 1 H1N1 viruses prior to 1957 were protected from severe disease by later infection with high pathogenic avian viruses (H5N1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00122-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Since H5N1 is also a group 1 virus, the authors hypothesize that the order of virus infection H1N1-&gt;H5N1 will invoke a strong antibody response directed toward the HA stalk since the head region is too divergent to recall HA head reactive memory B cells. The authors also gave evidence that those born during the circulation of H3N2, a group 2 HA virus, would not be protected from H5N1 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Together the authors concluded that activation of stalk-specific memory B cells was the immunological mechanism leading to protection from highly pathogenic H5N1 infection. This study and others involving human serology and epidemiology are placed in historical context in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00122-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Another study identified a human monoclonal antibody that was extremely broadly reactive toward the stem of both group1 and group2 viruses [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This antibody (MED1882) was found to use the heavy chain VH6-1 gene and was functionally protective during adoptive transfer experiments in mice and ferrets. The antibody binds to the virus in the hydrophobic groove of the HA protein fusion domain. The authors hypothesize that the generation of this antibody occurred following sequential influenza infections which occurred during the donorâ€™s lifetime which encompassed exposures to sequential MsHe viruses in the course of historical influenza pandemics: H2N2 -&gt; H3N2 -&gt; H1N1. Relatedly, other researchers have leveraged the sequential infection strategy for generating stalk specific antibody responses [

 <xref rid="B99-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Specifically, one strategy has been to prime the host with HA molecules from one virus strain and boost with a chimeric HA molecule containing the stalk region from the original influenza HA protein but an HA head containing little a.a. homology (exotic head) [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. This exposure order will predominantly stimulate memory B cells producing antibodies targeted to the stalk representing a possible vaccination strategy.
