  <p>Schematic of Influenza A, B, and C virus structure. Influenza A is defined by its surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of which there are 18 HA and 11 NA. Influenza B viruses are categorized into two lineages (B/Yamagata and B/Victoria). The surface of both A and B viruses contains HA, NA, and the M2 proteins. Internally, A and B viruses both have eight genomic segments. Influenza C viruses have only one external spike protein (HEF) which functions both in viral entry and egress and an ion channel M2 protein. Type C viruses have 7 internal genomic segments. M1 protein line the envelope internally adjacent nuclear export protein (NEP) proteins for type A, B, and C viruses. The genomic segments are encapsidated by the NP protein and form the ribonucleocapsid with the polymerase proteins Polymerase acidic (PA), Polymerase basic 1 (PB1), and Polymerase basic 2 (PB2).</p>
