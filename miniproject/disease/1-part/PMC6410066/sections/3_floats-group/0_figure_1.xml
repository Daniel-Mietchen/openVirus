  <p>Influenza immune background development following recurrent infections and vaccinations. The schematic illustrates possible immune fluctuations following influenza virus infection or vaccination. Immune fluctuations and potential protection can be conceptualized at both the individual or population level. The heterogeneity of the immune background is dependent on the sequence of virus exposures and their genetic and antigenic relatedness. Immune specificity that is gained during influenza virus immune imprinting during infancy or childhood leading to the generation of virus-specific T and B cells are retained at some level throughout life. T = T cell; B = B cells; Y = antibodies.</p>
