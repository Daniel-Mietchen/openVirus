<p>Despite the importance of NiV as an emerging disease with the potential for pandemic, no therapeutics or vaccines are approved for use in humans or livestock species. Due to the lethal nature of NiV infection, producing a safe, live attenuated vaccine with no potential for reversion is difficult. However, recombinant NiV mutants, attenuated in hamster and ferret models, have been shown to generate strong neutralizing antibody responses (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). More commonly, NiV vaccine approaches have focused individual candidate antigens delivered as subunit vaccines or using viral vectors. The most studied vaccine candidate is the soluble form of the G protein (sG) from the related Hendra virus (HeV). HeV and the NiV Malaysia strain share between 68 and 92% amino acid homology between their proteins; with F and G proteins sharing 88 and 83% homology, respectively (
