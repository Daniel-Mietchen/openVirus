<p>NiV infection is currently classed as a stage III zoonotic disease, meaning it can spill over to humans and cause limited outbreaks of person-to-person transmission (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). NiV outbreaks have been recognized yearly in Bangladesh since 2001 as well as occasional outbreaks in neighboring India (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These outbreaks have been characterized by person-to-person transmission and the death of over 70% of infected people (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In May 2018, the first ever outbreak in southern India was reported. A total of 19 NiV cases, of which 17 resulted in death, were reported in the state of Kerala. 
 <italic>Pteropus giganteus</italic> bats from areas around the index case in Kozhikode, Kerala, were tested at the National High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory at Bhopal. Of these, 19% were found to be NiV positive by RT-PCR (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). NiV has been found to survive for up to 4 days when subjected to various environmental conditions, including fruit bat urine and mango flesh (
