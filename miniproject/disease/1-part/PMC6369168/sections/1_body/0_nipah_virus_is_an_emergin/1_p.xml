<p>Nipah virus (NiV) is an enveloped, single stranded, negative sense RNA paramyxovirus, genus 
 <italic>Henipavirus</italic>. The natural hosts and wildlife reservoirs of NiV are Old World fruit bats of the genus 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Both Nipah and the related Hendra virus possess a number of features that distinguish them from other paramyxoviruses. Of particular note is their broad host range which is facilitated by the use of the evolutionary conserved ephrin-B2 and â€“B3 as cellular receptors (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The NiV attachment glycoprotein (G) is responsible for binding to ephrin-B2/-B3 (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Following receptor binding, the G protein dissociates from the fusion (F) protein. Subsequently, the F protein undergoes a series of conformational changes which in turn initiates fusion of the viral and host membrane allowing entry (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). During viral replication, the F protein is synthesized and cleaved into fusion active F1 and F2 subunits. These subunits are subsequently transported back to the cell surface to be incorporated into budding virions, or facilitate fusion between infected and adjacent uninfected cells (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This cell-to-cell fusion results in the formation of multinucleated cells called syncytia, and greatly influences the cyopathogenicity of NiV as it allows spread of the virus, even in the absence of viral budding (
