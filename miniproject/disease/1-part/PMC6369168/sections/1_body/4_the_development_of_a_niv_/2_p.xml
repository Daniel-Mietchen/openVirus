<p>The sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks means that the commercial development of NiV vaccines for use in pigs (other livestock or humans) is limited and animal health companies are of the opinion that NiV vaccines will have limited marketability. Our ongoing studies should help facilitate this by developing a safe and efficacious prototype NiV vaccine that is amenable to “surge production” and discrimination of infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA) capability. Subsequent development and licensure of this vaccine will require engagement with international, regional, and national agencies and the creation of dependable markets via the establishment of NiV vaccine banks. The OIE World Fund manages vaccine banks and the delivery of vaccines for avian influenza, rabies, foot-and-mouth disease, and peste de petit ruminants (

Critically these vaccine banks can be rapidly deployed when required and this model appears most appropriate in the context of reactive emergency vaccination programmes to aid NiV outbreak control. Vaccines can play a major component in an emergency response against emerging infectious disease, with the main aim to reduce virus spread between susceptible hosts (

Factors such as: herd density, production systems, the presence of susceptible wildlife, the impact on export trade and current opinions on economic vs. ethical factors will likely play a role. One strategy to halt a NiV outbreak would be to deploy a stockpiled vaccine for ring vaccination around the NiV affected area. This approach was utilized in the 2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea and showed great promise in terms of disease containment and elimination (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) or mRNA vectored vaccine (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The highly unpredictable nature of NiV outbreaks means that it is highly unlikely that NiV vaccines would be used routinely by pig producers. One strategy that could help ensure that immunity to NiV is maintained in pig herds could involve the engineering of NiV G into a live attenuated viral vaccine, such as pseudorabies, which are widely used in countries at-risk.
