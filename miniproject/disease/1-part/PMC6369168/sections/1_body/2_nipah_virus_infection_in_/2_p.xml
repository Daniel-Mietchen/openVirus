<p>In an experimental infection study, pigs were inoculated subcutaneously with a NiV isolate from the central nervous system of a fatally infected human patient. Infection elicited respiratory and neurological symptoms consistent with those observed in naturally infected Malaysian pigs, which included febrile illness, incoordination, mucosal nasal discharge, and persistent cough (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). All infected animals showed a transient increase in body temperature between 4 and 12 days post-infection. Two of these animals developed transient respiratory signs, mild depression and a hunched stance. Both these studies concluded that NiV infection in pigs had no pathognomonic features i.e., the clinical signs observed were non-specific. This can make field diagnosis of NiV infection in pigs difficult, as observed in the outbreak in Malaysia (
