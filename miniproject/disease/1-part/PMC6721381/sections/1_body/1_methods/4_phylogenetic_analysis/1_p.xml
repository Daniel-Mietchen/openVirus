<p id="Par18">All 36 nucleotides sequences that we obtained conbining some other M sequences of typical 
 <italic>Seoul virus</italic> that have been stored in GenBank were aligned with ClustalX [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], trimmed off terminal un-aligned regions using Gblocks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and constructed into a neighbor-joining tree using MEGA 7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] with the maximum composite likelihood mode for distance calculation and 1000 replications for bootstrapping. The partial M segment of a strain of 
 <italic>Hantaan virus</italic> was used to root the tree. Amino acids sequences of 36 
 <italic>Seoul virus</italic> were also aligned using same method mentioned above to figure out the variations with significance and the strain isolated from Qinhuangdao City, Hebei province in 1993 was used as a reference.
