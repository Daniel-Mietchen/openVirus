 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and here we have only collected epidemiological data of cases that with typical HFRS symptoms. Cases of HFRS, as one of category B notifiable infectious diseases in China, have been reported to the National Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS) in real time (within 12â€‰h). NIDRIS was implemented since 2004 and has covered all health care institutions across China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Epidemiological data of HFRS patients used in this study were mainly collected from NIDRIS and data before 2004 were supplementally retrospected from our manual records. Before 1982, HFRS cases were only defined by a national standard of clinical criteria. Since 1982, cases were further confirmed by detecting specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) against hantavirus antigens in serum samples.
