<p id="Par22">All 11 cities of Hebei province have ever been reported the HFRS cases, while the main outbreak areas shift gradually (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). If we divided Hebei province into three part (southern, central and northern area), the long-term surveillance revealed that the high incidence area had altered from southern and central area to northern area, especially in the northeast of the province (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, d). During the Phase I HFRS epidemic, most cases were reported from the cities in sourthern and central area and fewer cases were reported from the northern cities. Since Phase II, the proportion that cases from northern cities of provincial total incidences increased progressively. So far, cases from Tangshan and Qinhuangdao, which located in the northeast of the province, had accounted for nearly 90% of the total incidences.
