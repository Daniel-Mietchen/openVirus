<p id="Par20">People in any age group, from infants to elderly people, are considered to be generally susceptible for HFRS infection. While, the middle aged people (20 to 59 years old) accounted for the most (84.8%) cases. In addition, long-term surveillance also showed that annual age-peaks of HFRS patients were mildly but continuously aging since 1988 when age information of cases start to be collected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Expectantly, the gender of more susceptible population was invarible throughout that male patients with higher incidence always accounted for approximate 70% of the total number of HFRS cases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Farmer still was the most dominant occupational factor (data not shown), which was also consistant with that of other areas in China [
