<p id="Par24">The lung tissues of all captured rodents had been detected of the hantavirus antigen by IFA. The result showed that the virus-carrying rates of field rodents were much lower than that of rodents living in the residential area (U = 551.0,

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). All field rodents were detected as hantavirus free only except the rodents captured from Dingzhou City in 2010. The residential rodents of most surveillance points stably possess relative low virus-carrying rates (under 5%), while the virus-carrying rate of rodents captured from Luan county located in northeast of the province had kept a high level during the third epidemic.
