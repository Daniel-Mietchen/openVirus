<p id="Par13">As a member from 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, hantavirus possesses a tri-segmented and negative single-stranded RNA genome consisting of small (S), media (M) and large (L) segment, which encodes nucleocapsid (N) protein, glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. During the virus replication, GPC will be co-translationally cleaved into the glycoproteins Gn and Gc by cellular signal peptidase. The heterodimer of Gn and Gc will be finally constructed into spikes and appeared upon the virion surface [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Meanwhile, GPC gene was considered as common genetic variable site in different hataviruses making it ideal segment for genotyping [
