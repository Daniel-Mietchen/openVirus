  <p>Attenuation and reversion mutations in the IAV polymerase complex. Attenuation mutations in the IAV polymerase: The locations of various IAV mutations found in the MDV LAIV and in revertant strains are shown as CPK spheres on the background of the polymerase complex colored as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f002">Figure 2</xref>, with some subunits being shown as surfaces and others as cartoons in various orientations as needed for clarity. A dynamic version of this figure where the molecules can be rotated in real time is available on-lines as 
   <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00560">Figure S2</xref>. Mutations in the US LAIV MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 are shown in red. Mutations present in the Russian LAIV MDV Len/17 or Len/47 (A/Leningrad/134/57 H2N2) strain are shown in magenta or blue, respectively. PB2 mutations V478L (Len/17) and S490R (Len/47) are not indicated in the structure. For more information see
