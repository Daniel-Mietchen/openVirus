<p>IAV NP is a multifunctional basic protein essential for the replication of the viral genome and its transcription, which in crystal structures forms a trimeric complex [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. While the IAV polymerase heterotrimer complex (PB2, PB1, and PA) is able to synthesize short RNAs, NP is required for the processivity of the polymerase on long RNA templates [

 <xref rid="B111-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. NP contains an RNA-binding region at its N-terminus region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f003">Figure 3</xref>D) and two domains responsible for NP-NP self-interaction, at the center and C-terminal region (

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that IAV NP also binds through its N-terminal and C-terminal region to the viral polymerase subunit PB2 [

 <xref rid="B113-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], suggesting a potential role in the regulation of the viral polymerase activity. Besides the structural functions of IAV NP as component of the viral cRNP or vRNP, NP also facilitates vRNP import into the nucleus through its two NLS located at the N-terminal and central regions (

 <xref rid="B116-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Finally, IAV NPâ€™s interaction with the viral M1/NEP complex is required for the translocation of vRNPs from the nucleus to the cytosol of infected cells at the latest steps of the replication cycle of IAV [
