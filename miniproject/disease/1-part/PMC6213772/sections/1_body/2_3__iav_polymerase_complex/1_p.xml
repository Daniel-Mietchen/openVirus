<p>The analysis of viral polymerases and their crystal structures have drastically improved our knowledge of viral infection, replication, and pathogenesis. Importantly, the polymerase of IAV has been shown to also be important for virus adaptation to new host species and it is involved in the emergence of zoonotic IAV strains [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Moreover, since viral polymerases are important for replication and transcription of the viral genome, they represent excellent targets for the development of novel antivirals. The study of IAV polymerase structure has been challenging until recently since researchers were not able to express the intact viral heterotrimer polymerase complex (PB2, PB1, and PA) maintaining its catalytic activity. However, this drawback has been partially solved by studying the structure of the polymerase complex from bat IAV (H17N10), IBV, and ICV [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The bat IAV and IBV polymerases similarity to human (or avian) IAV polymerase is 70–80% and 30–40%, respectively [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] could increase our current understanding of the mechanism driving viral polymerase activity or the interaction between the different polymerase subunits and the vRNA and/or cellular host factors [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Remarkably, there are high similarity between the determined polymerases structures with bound promoters for bat IAV and IBV [

 <xref rid="B82-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Importantly, this new knowledge will also allow researchers to rationally develop attenuated forms of the viruses that could be implemented as potential LAIV for the treatment of influenza viral infections. Likewise, information obtained from the viral polymerase complex structures would allow the rational design of novel antivirals targeting specific polymerase functions and/or components for the treatment of influenza viral infections [
