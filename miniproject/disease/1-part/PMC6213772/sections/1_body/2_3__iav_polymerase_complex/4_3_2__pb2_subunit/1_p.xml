<p>The main role of IAV PB2 polymerase subunit is the production of 5′-capped RNA molecules from cellular pre-mRNAs, which are used as primers to initiate viral transcription [

 <xref rid="B87-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. PB2 contains multiple functional domains necessary to perform viral RNA synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). The N-terminal domain of IAV PB2 contains the PB1 interacting region (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) while the C-terminal domain contains an RNA binding domain and a NLS for nuclear import from the cytoplasm (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Upon infection, PB2 is located mainly in the nucleus, although PB2 has also been identified in the mitochondria [

 <xref rid="B93-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The C-terminal two-thirds of IAV PB2 contains the cap-binding domain (CBD) and the “627-domain” [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Within the CBD, two aromatic residues (F404 and H357) are involved in the binding to the cap structure for the cap snatching process in which a cellular mRNA is cleaved a few nucleotides after the 5′ cap, similarly to other cellular cap-binding proteins, such as the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) [

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. It has been reported that the PB2 subunit is an important determinant of virulence and a host range restriction of IAV and this characteristic has been mapped mainly to amino acid at position 627 and the surrounding region [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Avian IAV contain a glutamic acid (E) at position 627 while human IAV have a lysine (K) [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Although the role of this residue for host adaptation is not totally understood, it has been described that PB2 binding to the cellular nuclear protein ANP32A could be involved in the mechanism of host adaptation [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Moreover, Nilsson et al. have recently showed that the 627-domain is essential for the accumulation of the cRNA replicative intermediate in infected cells and this domain is also essential for both viral replication and transcription [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. However, other amino acid residues located in other viral genes have also been described to be important for virus host adaptation for IAV [

 <xref rid="B94-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. PB2 is also able to bind NP and the amino acids involved in this interaction are located in the middle and C-terminal region of IAV PB2 (
