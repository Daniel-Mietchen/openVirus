<p>Similarly, Noton et al. described the characterization of an avian influenza virus (A/chicken/Rostock/34 H7N1) ts NP mutant (M239L) (

 <xref rid="B152-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. This mutant virus was generated by chemical mutagenesis in the 1970s. Importantly, introduction of this ts NP M239L amino acid change in the backbone of PR8 reproduced the ts phenotype [

Despite a 100-fold drop in viral titers at the restrictive temperature (39 Â°C), the PR8 NP M239L ts mutant virus did not show differences in gene transcription, genome replication and/or viral protein synthesis as compared with PR8 WT virus [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. However, the ts mutant PR8 NP M239L virus released about six-fold more virus particles than the WT PR8. Interestingly, the viral particle/plaque forming unit (PFU) ratio of the ts mutant PR8 NP M239L was 50-fold higher than that of PR8 WT, with numerous virions exhibiting a nonstandard morphology [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Authors revealed that the NP ts mutation M239L affects the NP-M1 interaction and most probably the assembly of viral particles [

Importantly, this study demonstrates that ts IAV can be affected in one or more viral life cycle steps, from viral RNA synthesis to virus morphogenesis and release. Moreover, this study further confirms that ts amino acid substitutions in a specific IAV strain could display a similar ts phenotype when introduced in a different IAV backbone [
