<p>Public health concerns associated with influenza viral infections in humans are intensified by the limited therapeutic options to combat viral infections and prevent the rapid-spreading of influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Up to now, only a few therapeutic choices to control influenza infections are licensed and they are limited to two classes of FDA-approved antivirals targeting the viral matrix 2 (M2) ion channel protein (amantadine or rimantadine) or the sialidase active site of the viral NA protein (oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir) [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. M2 inhibitors are only efficient against IAV, and they have shown serious side effects and low efficacy since most of the currently circulating IAV have acquired resistance to them [
