   <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), 319 virus and gene/protein interactions were retained. Among the 128 nodes, 14 gene targets of FDA-approved drugs were identified by a custom Perl script that identifies direct as well as alternative gene name matches in the DrugBank flat file version 3.0 (
   <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).
