  <p>Dextromethorphan efficacy assessment in ferrets. Ferrets (
   <italic>n</italic> = 9) were treated orally every 8 h for 5 days or until sacrifice on day 3 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4), starting 1 day before infection with 2 mg/kg dextromethorphan or 2.5 mg/kg oseltamivir, corresponding to recommended human doses. The animals were infected intranasally with 10
   <sup>5</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> of A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Nasal washes were collected daily, and titers were quantified by limited dilution method. For the first 4 days, animals were monitored twice daily and daily thereafter for weight 
   <bold>(B)</bold> and clinical signs 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. The clinical score represents a composite score of body temperature, activity, nasal exudate, and respiratory signs scored on a 0-1-2 scale with 0 representing body temperatures ≤39.3°C and the physiologic state, 1 temperatures 39.4–39.9°C, calm behavior, low amounts of clear exudate, and occasional sneezing or congestion, and 2 temperatures ≥40.0°C, depressed behavior, larger amounts of yellow or brown exudate, and frequent sneezing, coughing and/or dyspnea. Symbols represent group averages, and error bars indicate the standard error mean. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test was used for statistical analyses (
