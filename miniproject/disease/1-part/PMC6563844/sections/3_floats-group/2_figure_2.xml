  <p>Validation and inhibitory concentration determination of candidate drugs. Replication inhibition of the different drugs. MDCK cells were pretreated for 8 h and infected with the influenza strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 (H1N1pdm09) 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, or A/Victoria/36/2011 (H3N2) 
   <bold>(C)</bold> at a MOI of 0.01 in the presence of 10-fold serial drug dilutions. After 16 h, the supernatant was harvested and the amount of virus quantified by limited dilution method. Bars represent the average of three independent duplicate experiments, and error bars indicate the standard deviation.
