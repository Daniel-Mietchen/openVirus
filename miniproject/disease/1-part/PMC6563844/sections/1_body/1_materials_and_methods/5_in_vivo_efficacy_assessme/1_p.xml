<p>All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the SingHealth IACUC Committee or the German competent authority (Regierungspraesidium Darmstadt) and carried out according to Singaporean or German Animal Welfare Law, respectively. Groups of 4–6 week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Janvier Labs) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (100/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infection with 1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of PR8 in 30 μl of DMEM. Based on the tolerated doses published for the respective drug (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), a dose-finding study was performed, resulting in the following doses used in all mouse experiments: 50 mg/kg/day for oseltamivir phosphate, 40 mg/kg/day for naltrexone, 100 mg/kg/day gallium nitrate, 80 mg/kg/day for ketotifen, and 60 mg/kg/day for dextromethorphan. Animals were gavaged once daily starting 1 day before infection. Three days after infection, the mice were sacrificed and the viral titer in the lungs was determined. Toward this, the lung was weighed and homogenized in 500 μl DMEM with 3 × concentrated penicillin/streptomycin using 2 ml homogenizer tubes (Lysing matrix D, MP Biomedicals) and the Precellys 24-Dual Homogenizer (Peqlab). The titer in the supernatants was quantified by limited dilution method on MDCK cells and expressed as TCID
