<p>To evaluate the treatment effect on disease severity in a more clinically relevant situation, groups of male, and female adult European ferrets (
 <italic>mustela putorius furo</italic>, bred in-house) without antibodies against circulating seasonal influenza A virus strains were treated orally every 8 h with either oseltamivir (2.5 mg/kg, Roche) or dextromethorphan (2 mg/kg, Procter, &amp; Gamble) following the manufacturer's dosing and treatment recommendation, starting 24 h before infection, or left untreated. For infection, animals were anesthetized with ketamine and medetomidine (2/0.2 mg/kg), and then inoculated intranasally with 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> H1N1pdm09. Treatment was continued until day 4 post-infection. During that time, clinical signs, body temperature, and weight were assessed twice daily, and then daily until day 7. Respiratory signs, sneezing, nose exudates, congestion, and activity were scored using a 0–1–2 scale. Zero indicates minimal deviations of the physiologic state, 1 indicates moderate nasal discharge, congestion, and/or occasional sneezing, and calm demeanor, and 2 indicates severe nasal discharge and/or labored breathing, dyspnea, frequent sneezing, and depression. Nasal washes were collected every day for the first 4 days and on day 7. Toward this, 500 μl of PBS was administered in one nostril and expectorate was collected in 50 ml centrifuge tubes. This procedure was repeated twice to obtain a minimal volume of 400 μl. The virus titer of the nasal washes was determined by limited dilution method.
