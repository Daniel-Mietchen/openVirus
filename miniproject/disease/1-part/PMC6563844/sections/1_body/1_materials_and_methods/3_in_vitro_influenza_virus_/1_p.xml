<p>All compounds were purchased from Sigma and diluted in either water, phosphate buffer saline (PBS), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) to stock concentrations of 0.5 M, and DMEM was used for all further dilutions. For the initial efficacy screen, 12-well plates seeded with MDCK cells were pretreated with the respective compound for 8 h with 50 or 500 μM of each compound. The cells were then washed with PBS, infected with the PR8 at an MOI of 0.01, and cultivated in TPCK-DMEM (0.75 μg/ml) containing the same drug concentration. Sixteen hour post-infection, the supernatant was stored at −80°C, and the amount of virus was quantified by limited dilution method and expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>). To evaluate the inhibitory effect of the lead compounds in more detail, the experiment was repeated including additional drug concentrations and different influenza A strains.
