<p>Watanabe et al. previously described a network of 128 consensus human host genes that were identified in at least two separate experimental screens to be important for the virus life cycle in the host cell (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The 128 gene nodes from this network were originally connected by 431 edges, which constituted the basis for our analysis. We re-analyzed the network and added new edges from co-expression and protein-protein interaction data. For the co-expression, 62 human microarray datasets from NCBI GEO (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) with minimum 25 samples available (to limit to larger studies) were used to search for correlations between pairs of genes. For a given gene, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is calculated for every other gene over the 62 datasets. PCC &gt;0.5 or smaller than âˆ’0.5 was considered for establishing 4,482 co-expression links between gene pairs. Five hundred and seventy-four protein-protein interaction links were derived from our in-house integrated protein interaction database, which is a collection of experimentally determined protein-protein interactions and contains data from 10 publicly available resources (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A Perl script was written to format the nodes and edges for GraphViz Version 2.38 [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Fifteen drugs were selected based on oral bioavailability as well as different degrees of connectivity of the respective target genes in our network, price, and low organism toxicity.
