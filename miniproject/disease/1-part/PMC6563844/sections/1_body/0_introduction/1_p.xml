<p>Influenza A viruses are one of the most important respiratory pathogens. Annual epidemics represent an important disease burden and cause an estimated 250,000–500,000 deaths worldwide, and occasional pandemics are associated with increased morbidity and mortality (

 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and have a segmented negative-sense RNA genome (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Their envelope contains the ion channel forming M2 protein and the hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins. Based on the antigenic properties of these viral glycoproteins, influenza A viruses are classified into different subtypes. To date, 18 hemagglutinin (H1–H18) and 11 neuraminidase (N1–N11) subtypes have been identified (
