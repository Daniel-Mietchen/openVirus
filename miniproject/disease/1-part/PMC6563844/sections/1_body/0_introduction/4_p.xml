<p>Whole genome siRNA screens have yielded a list of promising candidate proteins and pathways involved in the influenza virus life cycle (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Watanabe et al. previously described a network of 128 consensus human host genes that were identified in at least 2 separate of these experimental screens to be important for the virus life cycle in the host cell (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In this study, we re-analyzed the network of consensus cellular candidate proteins from these screens and overlapped it with databases of known cellular targets of already licensed drugs, which would thus be immediately available in case of a pandemic. The anti-influenza activity of the top candidates was then first evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, followed by an efficacy assessment of the most promising drugs in mice and ferrets.
