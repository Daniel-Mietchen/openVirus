<p>With the exception of bat-associated subtypes (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), all influenza A virus subtypes can be found in wild aquatic birds, which are their natural reservoir. From these animals the virus can spread to domestic poultry or directly to humans and other mammalian hosts (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Pandemics occur if such a new subtype acquires the ability to infect and transmit in the human population. Over the last 20 years, there have been regular introductions of H5N1 strains and occasional cases of H7N1 and H9N2 infections, mostly associated with outbreaks in poultry (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Since March 2013, human infections with a previously undescribed H7N9 virus were observed, which also circulates in domestic birds without causing severe disease (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Even though the production of influenza vaccines is well established, and the regulatory process allows for rapid strain update or exchange, it takes 4â€“6 months until a vaccine against a newly emerging subtype is available in sufficient quantities (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).
