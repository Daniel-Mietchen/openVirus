<p>Thus, antiviral drugs are an essential component of pandemic response scenarios and play an important role in reducing disease severity during seasonal influenza epidemics. Two classes of approved drugs against influenza A virus infections have been available for years: adamantane-based M2 ion channel blockers, which prevent acidification of the endosome and therefore release of the viral particles into the cytosol (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and neuraminidase inhibitors, which prevent the release of newly formed viral particles from infected cells (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In both cases, resistant viruses emerged rapidly after the onset of widespread use, and at this time, all circulating human influenza A viruses are adamantane-resistant (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and the number of neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses is rapidly increasing (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Earlier this year, baloxavir marboxil, a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, has been licensed in Japan for the treatment of influenza virus infections (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and favipiravir, an inhibitor of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is in advanced clinical development stages (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), so additional treatment options are becoming available. Repurposed drugs targeting cellular instead of viral proteins are considered a promising complement, on the one hand because of the potential for efficacy against a broader range of viruses using the respective pathway, and on the other hand due to the reduced probability for acquisition of resistance-conferring mutations without fitness cost (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
