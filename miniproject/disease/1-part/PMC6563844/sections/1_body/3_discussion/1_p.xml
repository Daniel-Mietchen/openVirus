<p>Antiviral approaches targeting cellular proteins or pathways involved in the viral life cycle rather than viral proteins directly have great appeal as they are thought to be less prone to resistance development and may be effective against different strains and even different virus families (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). For influenza virus, several whole genome siRNA screens have been published in recent years (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), allowing the cross-matching of host proteins required for influenza replication with known cellular drug targets. Using this approach, we identified a short list of 15 FDA-approved candidate drugs, of which naltrexone, gallium nitrate, ketotifen, and dextromethorphan were able to inhibit viral replication

 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation in mice revealed that dextromethorphan was the most promising candidate. Dextromethorphan treatment of ferrets infected with a H1N1pdm09 strain had no effect on viral load or body weight, but resulted in a significant reduction of clinical signs, supporting its further consideration as an influenza treatment option.
