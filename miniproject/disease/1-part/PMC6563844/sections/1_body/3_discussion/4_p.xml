<p>Ferrets closely mimic the course of influenza disease seen in humans (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Seasonal and pandemic 2009 influenza viruses thus cause a mild to moderate disease of 3â€“5 days duration (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), making it challenging to discern modest differences in disease severity and pathological and virological parameters. While oseltamivir reduced viral load and clinical disease, and prevented weight loss, dextromethorphan treatment only reduced disease severity, and seemed to slightly increase the weight loss compared to untreated animals. However, this seemingly small effect may make the difference between seeking medical attention or just staying at home, and may also reduce the days of lost productivity during the annual epidemics. Future studies are warranted to evaluate if combination treatment increases the efficacy of oseltamivir or other virus-targeting drugs, especially when treatment is started after the onset of clinical disease. There may also be room for short-term treatment at higher doses, given that the dosing regimen used here did not exceed recommended human weight-adjusted doses. Considering that dextromethorphan-containing drugs are frequently used as over the counter remedies for influenza and influenza-like respiratory infections, a more detailed evaluation of its efficacy, especially in combination with other influenza-specific drugs, would be warranted.
