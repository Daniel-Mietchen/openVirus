<p>High-throughput siRNA screens have opened a new avenue for drug repurposing (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). This is of special relevance for infectious disease targets with lesser market potential, as the development of new drugs is time consuming and costly (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The severe side effects associated with the chemotherapeutics and immune modulators often found among the top hits may not be acceptable in the context of the target disease, so they are usually not evaluated any further. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> efficacy assessments of the remaining hits are amenable to medium or high throughput screening, allowing a rapid identification of the most promising candidates (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Here we show that an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy assessment of such candidates is warranted even if the EC
 <sub>50</sub> is in the Î¼M range and the SI is consequently low, especially if the drug has a broad therapeutic range, as they may be attractive options for treatment in combination with antivirals or other drugs targeting complementary cellular pathways involved in the viral life cycle.
