<p>To calculate the EC
 <sub>50</sub> for each drug against the different viruses, a more sensitive modified plaque assay was used, which assesses the percent plaque reduction at the respective drug concentration (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Using 5-fold decreasing drug concentrations, again starting at 500 μM, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of oseltamivir carboxylate ranged between 5 and 200 nM, with PR8 being most effectively inhibited (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5 nM), while the EC
 <sub>50</sub> for H1N1pdm09 was around 200 nM (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Naltrexone inhibited both H1N1 viruses with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> between 5 and 50 μM but was less efficient against the H3N2 virus, whereas gallium nitrate, ketotifen, and dextromethorphan displayed EC
 <sub>50</sub> between 5 and 50 μM against all three viruses (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). To determine the selectivity index (SI), the cytotoxic concentration for each of the drugs was determined in MDCK cells using an MTT assay. While the SI for oseltamivir carboxylate was between 2,000 and 100,000, the SI for the drugs targeting cellular proteins ranged between 10 and 1000 with the SI of dextromethorphan being between 50 and 100 across different viruses (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
