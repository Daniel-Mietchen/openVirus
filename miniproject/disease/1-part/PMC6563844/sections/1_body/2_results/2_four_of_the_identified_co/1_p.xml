<p>To identify candidates with influenza virus inhibitory activity, cells were pre-treated with the respective drug at 50 and 500 μM, and virus titers were quantified 16 h after infection with PR8, which corresponded to the peak titer in the untreated samples. Four of the compounds, isoproterenol, alendronate, vinblastine, and irbesartan, displayed pronounced toxicity at the 500 μM concentration, and no antiviral activity at a 10-fold lower concentration (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Adenosine triphosphate, etidronic acid, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, L-glutamic acid, thalidomide, amiloride, and dacarbazine had no antiviral activity (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, these 11 compounds were excluded from further evaluation. The four remaining compounds, gallium nitrate, naltrexone, dextromethorphan, and ketotifen, were able to inhibit infection at doses above 50 μM without causing toxicity (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Gallium nitrate is used to treat cancer-associated hypercalcemia, since it prevents osteoclastic activity, by inhibiting ATPase-dependent proton pumps (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These pumps, including the vATPase (ATP6V1B2, 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are also involved in acidification of the endosome, which may explain its inhibitory effect on influenza A viruses (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Naltrexone, a competitive opioid receptor agonist which primarily targets μ- and to a lesser extent the κ-opioid receptors, and dextromethorphan, a σ
 <sub>1</sub>-receptor, and μ-opioid receptor agonist, can both act on the σ
 <sub>1</sub>-receptor (OPRS1) (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). OPRS1 is involved in diverse intracellular processes (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), including the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which may be the basis for its antiviral activity against influenza. Ketotifen, a histamine H1 receptor blocker (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), was found to block 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), which is upregulated in influenza A virus-infected cells (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).
