<p>To determine whether the antiviral activity of these four potential candidates extended to circulating seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1 influenza strains, A/Victoria/36/2011 (H3N2), and A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 (H1N1pdm09) were included in the study. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate was used as a positive control. Using the same experimental setup with 10-fold decreasing drug concentrations starting at 500 μM, oseltamivir carboxylate completely inhibited replication of all three strains at concentrations higher than 5 μM (

While the extent of inhibition varied for each of the viruses, this tendency was consistently observed, thereby validating our initial findings.
