<p>To assess the therapeutic potential of dextromethorphan in an animal model that reproduces the course of disease seen in humans (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), ferrets were treated every 8 h with either commercially available oral dextromethorphan formulation at a dose of 2 mg/kg, or oseltamivir solution at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. This schedule was in accordance with the recommendation for dextromethorphan treatment of patients, and the doses were within the weight adjusted human dose range. Drugs were given for the first time 24 h prior to infection and treatment was continued for 5 days. Nasal washes were collected daily, and the animals were evaluated twice daily for weight loss, temperature, and clinical signs.
