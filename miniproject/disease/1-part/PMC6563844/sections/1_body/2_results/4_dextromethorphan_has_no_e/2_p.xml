<p>While oseltamivir phosphate treatment resulted in a 10-fold reduction in nasal wash titers during the first 2 days, dextromethorphan had no effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), and none of the treatment approaches affected lung viral titers in animals sacrificed on day 3 (data not shown). In all three groups, the titers peaked on day 2 post-infection and then gradually decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Dextromethorphan-treated animals also experienced a similar gradual weight loss of &lt;10% seen in non-treated control animals, whereas there was no reduction in body weight in the oseltamivir group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the control group, clinical signs and fever became first apparent 36 h post-infection, peaked after 48 h, and then gradually decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Dextromethorphan treatment resulted in a significantly lower peak score (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Even though the effect was less pronounced compared to oseltamivir phosphate treatment, which only resulted in a minimal clinical score peaking on day 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), it illustrates the potential of repurposing drugs targeting cellular factors involved in the viral life cycle.
