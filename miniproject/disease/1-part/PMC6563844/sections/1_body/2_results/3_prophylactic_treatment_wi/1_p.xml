<p>To gain first insights in the ability of the four candidate drugs to reduce virus replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, C57BL/6 mice were treated orally once a day starting 1 day before infection with the respective drug. For all drugs, the initial doses were chosen based on published tolerated doses (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and optimal concentrations were determined in an initial dose-finding study (data not shown). Comparison of lung virus titers at peak infection and survival curves revealed that statistically significant differences could be attained with smaller groups if lung virus titers were measured, since drug treatment delayed but did not completely prevent mortality (

 <sub>50</sub> PR8, sacrificed 3 days post-infection, and the viral load in the lung was quantified. Oseltamivir phosphate was most effective, reducing lung titers 28-fold, followed by dextromethorphan, which resulted in a more variable but significant reduction. Ketotifen was less effective, but still lowered lung viral titers around 8- to 10-fold, while naltrexone and gallium nitrate treatments had no significant effect (
