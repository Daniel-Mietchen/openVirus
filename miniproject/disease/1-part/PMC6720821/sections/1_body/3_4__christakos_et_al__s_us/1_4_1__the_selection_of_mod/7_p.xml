<p>In this book, the spread of the Black Death in the years 1346–53 is presented over 180 pages on the basis of all available historical evidence at the time, handled according to the medievalist historian's craft, and in corresponding empirical detail. This maximum empirical material is analysed, epidemiologically structured, and put in a superordinate or synthetical epidemiological perspective in a separate section called “Patterns and Dynamics of the Black Death.” On this basis, it was concluded that all movements and features of the spread of the Black Death conformed to the conventional view of bubonic plague as rat-and-rat-flea-borne [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They do not dispute or challenge this material or the synthesis but tacitly pass them by.
