<p>In 2005, Christakos et al. published a treatise focused on epidemic modelling of the Black Death. It was likewise based on the application of the Reed–Frost model with explicit references to Scott and Duncan's use of it and as originally presented by Maia [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They do so despite having noted, as it transpires from a paper published about simultaneously, that Scott and Duncan emphasized that the Reed–Frost model “can only explain simple infectious diseases and cannot represent infections with multiple hosts, such as the bubonic plague” [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They also do not specify that these restrictions also included bacterial diseases, such as plague. The fact that the Reed–Frost model cannot be used to “represent,” i.e., to model bubonic plague for several sufficient conditions, because it is a bacterial disease with an animal reservoir and transmitted by insects, means in methodological terms that that the Reed–Frost model cannot be used when a central issue is whether or not historical plague was bubonic plague, a crucial condition also ignored by Scott and Duncan.
