<p>Christakos et al. supplemented the Reed–Frost model with the so-called Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) mathematical method. The inclusion of BME purportedly makes it possible to produce space-time epidemic maps that “account for the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Black Death” in the form of “correlations between spatial and temporal mortality structures” and much more. This is supposed to introduce the spatial dimension of the development of epidemic mortality which allows identification of epidemic diseases according to characteristic spatiotemporal features, in this case implicitly irrespective of the kind of contagion or means of transmission and spread [
