<p>Instead, they present it incorrectly in general terms as “the well-known model” of Reed and Frost but only mention Maia (1952) and Scott and Duncan (2001). This implies that their source of information on the Reed–Frost SIR model is second-hand, taken from the latter work where it has been selected and formed for the two authors' use, which explains that they do not consider any of the strong reservations and limitations emphasized by Maia. This can also explain that Abbey's article [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] is unknown to all five authors. They mention that there “is no shortage of epidemic models,” but claim that all of them, “despite their sophistication,” are more deficient than the Reed–Frost model because they “seem to disregard” that “in real-world situations, the epidemic variables are fundamentally spatiotemporal” [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This is evidently not correct. Moreover, here the term spatiotemporal is used as an empty concept. A historian or social scientist would have used or added a term implying a specific societal texture with specific properties for dissemination of epidemic disease. In practice, Christakos et al. use temporal models without spatial variables. Clearly, the general presentation of the Reed–Frost model and the argument for the choice of this model are sharply at variance with Maia's (and Abbey's) views. There is no indication that the Reed–Frost SIR model should be a well-known, highly considered, or much used model.
