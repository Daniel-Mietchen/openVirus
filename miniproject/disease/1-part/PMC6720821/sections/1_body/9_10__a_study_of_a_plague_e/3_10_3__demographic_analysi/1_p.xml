<p>At the time, dead were normally buried the next day, which puts the information in the burial register in temporal perspective. The first plague victim was interred on 7 September after 3 days of illness and would then have been infected on about 30 August, and the second plague burial occurred on 22 September, 15 days later. This period is much too long for interhuman infection by human ectoparasites according to the known duration of the period of incubation and illness. It implies a sudden end of the spread of the incipient epidemic, which did not occur and, thus, invalidates the human ectoparasite assumption. Instead, the period of delay fits nicely with rat-and-rat-flea-borne plague where the flea causing the first infection or another flea from the same source would have sought out its true host and triggered a rat epizootic. The rat epizootic would take 10–14 days before the colony was so depleted that rat fleas that had accumulated on the remaining rats, at the death of their host often would not find a new host. After 3 days of starving, these fleas would feed on human beings in their proximity, and the first death would usually follow about 2 × 3–5 days later. This is a process that would take in all 19–27 days, on the average 23 days [

As pointed out earlier in the discussion of the Black Death epidemic in Givry, the 23 days elapsing between the first plague case and the second represent proof of the initial phase of an epidemic of rat-and-rat-flea-borne bubonic plague. The Indian Plague Research Commission (IPRC) early established that there was an interval of 3.5 weeks [
