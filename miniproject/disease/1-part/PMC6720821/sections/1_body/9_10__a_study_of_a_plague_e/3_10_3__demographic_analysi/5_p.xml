<p>It is not correct that this seasonal pattern of a plague epidemic, the sharp decline with cold weather followed by recrudescence with the advent of warmer spring weather, could be a unique case [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is the typical feature of plague epidemics that break out in the autumn and do not have time to complete the course of spread among the local rat colonies before halted or sharply reduced by the advent of cold autumnal and wintry weather. Plague epidemics with this seasonal pattern are called transseasonal epidemics [
