<p>As fur fleas, rat fleas enjoy a comfortable microclimate in the rat fur also in wintry climate and with ready opportunity for feeding. The rat-flea population declines because the replenishment is hampered by chilly floors or ground with harmful effects on ova and larvae. The crucial point in the decline is not the slow decline in the flea population, as assumed by Whittles and Didelot, but that the prevalence and levels of plague bacteraemia in rats sharply decline when temperatures fall below about 10Â°C. For this reason, the rates and levels of plague infection acquired by feeding rat fleas fall steeply, and the epidemic returns to a smouldering enzootic form until the advent of warmer spring weather (if it does not become extinguished) [
