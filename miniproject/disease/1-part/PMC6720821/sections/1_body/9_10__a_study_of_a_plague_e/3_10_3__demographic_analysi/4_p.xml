<p>The steep fall in plague cases with the advent of cold weather should acutely raise the questions of whether human plague cases actually functioned as sources of potential lethal doses of infection of feeding human lice and fleas.

In addition, there is the likewise crucial question of the ability of human fleas and lice to transmit the infection, their vector capacity, which is another neglected but necessary condition for the viability of the hypothesis of a predominant (or significant) role of human ectoparasites in the transmission of plague.</p>
