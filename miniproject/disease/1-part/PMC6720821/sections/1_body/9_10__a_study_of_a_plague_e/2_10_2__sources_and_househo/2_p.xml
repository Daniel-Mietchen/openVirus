<p>Previous studies of the plague epidemic in Eyam are entered in References, but Whittles and Didelot do not mention that, over a generation ago, Bradley studied the plague epidemic in Eyam on the basis of a professional and complete family/household reconstitution combining the use of the parish registers and the hearth tax register [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It is also not mentioned that Bradley's reconstitution was used for a stringent in-depth epidemiological analysis by Coleman, the epidemiologist, also over a generation ago. Both scholars emphatically assert that the epidemiological analysis shows the characteristic features of rat-based-rat-flea-borne bubonic plague [
