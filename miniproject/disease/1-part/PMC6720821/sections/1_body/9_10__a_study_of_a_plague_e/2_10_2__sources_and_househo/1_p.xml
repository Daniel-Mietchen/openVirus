<p>Whittles and Didelot claim that they combined the 1664 hearth tax record for Eyam and the Eyam parish register to reconstruct the household structure for all persons living in the parish during the time of the plague. This implies that their analysis purportedly also includes the historical demographic method of family/household reconstitution which permits to trace the dead to their habitation as they are entered in the parish burial register with usable information on location of dwelling. This should allow a good spatiotemporal analysis of the epidemic, following in considerable individual detail the territorial spread of the epidemic in the township over time by individual deaths. Importantly, this should make the use of a mathematical epidemiological model quite superfluous because it represents the empirical testing of the modelled analogy that otherwise would, on methodological principle, be required for empirically valid epidemiological inference. There is, however, scant evidence of such material and demographic epidemiological analysis in the article.</p>
