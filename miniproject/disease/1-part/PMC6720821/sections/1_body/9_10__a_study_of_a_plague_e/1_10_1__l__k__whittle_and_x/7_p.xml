<p>Empirical testing should include the prevalence and levels of bacteraemia in human plague cases which would determine the possible prevalence and level of infection of feeding human fleas or lice and whether or not feeds would meet the criteria for transmission of potentially lethal doses for human beings. Whittles and Didelot do not really relate to the question of human plague bacteraemia. As for the necessary condition of a viable mechanism of transmission, they argue for the hypothesis of early-phase transmission [
