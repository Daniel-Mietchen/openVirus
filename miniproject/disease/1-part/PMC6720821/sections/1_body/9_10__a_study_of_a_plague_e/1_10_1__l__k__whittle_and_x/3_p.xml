<p>The SEIR model assumes that survivors of a disease carry lifelong immunity [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], which is a standard condition of all basic SIR models. This reflects, as pointed out, that, in practice, the use of (basic) SIR models is limited to viral diseases which often confer lasting immunity in survivors and are spread by interhuman cross infection by physical contact or droplets. The epidemic dies out when “the virus cannot find enough new susceptible people.”
