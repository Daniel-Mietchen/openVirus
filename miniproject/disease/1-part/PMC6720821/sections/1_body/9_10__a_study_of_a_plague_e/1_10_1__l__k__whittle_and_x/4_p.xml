<p>As pointed out earlier, survival of bubonic plague confers only a brief and weak immunity, as is usual with bacterial diseases, and also that historical sources record many cases where a person contracts plague twice and also three times in the same epidemic [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This problem is ostensibly resolved because Whittles and Didelot point out that “no recovery is allowed for in their model” [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which seemingly eliminates immunity as an issue. However, in historical plague epidemics as well as in modern plague in early developing countries roughly around a hundred years ago, the lethality rate was about 80% and the survival rate a significant 20% [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is an additional ground that the model will malfunction. However, also other basic empirical data are neglected to the same effect. They introduce, for instance, a “naïve assumption of a fixed 11-day infection period before death, as employed in previous modelling studies (n. 34-6),” which again also refers to the modelled presumption of no survivors. It also reflects that users of mathematical models generally stay within the arena of mathematical models and hypothetical simulation with input of data. They often show little interest in the huge amount of accumulated medical and historical data on bubonic plague which is needed for adequate empirical testing of the modelled epidemic analogy. They do also not consult any of the outstanding medical standard works on bubonic plague for empirical data, in this case on the duration of incubation and of the course of illness which indicate a usual incubation period of 3–5 days and a course of illness also of 3–5 days, on the average of about 8 days [
