<p>Most limitations on the usage of the SIR mathematical epidemiological model and the version of the Reedâ€“Frost model specified above, also the temporally extended version, pertain also to the SEIR model. Use of this variant does not affect the principal methodological problems and the fallacious implications for the epidemiological study of plague epidemics when it is clear, among other things, that plague is a bacterial disease transmitted by hematophagous insects as intermediary agents and with a zootic reservoir of infection. Against this backdrop, it is surprising that Whittles and Didelot can state that their model accounts for the possibility of both rodent-to-human and human-to-human transmission as well as the known household structure (see below). It provides, though, ostensibly, the opportunity to resort to rat-flea-based explanation when the facts on the ground evidently are incompatible with human-to-human transmission by human ectoparasites.</p>
