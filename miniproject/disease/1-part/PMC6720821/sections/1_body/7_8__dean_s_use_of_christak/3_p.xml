<p>The recent article by Dean et al. [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], “Human Ectoparasites and the Spread of Plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic,” presents to a large extent the gist of Dean's thesis and the advice given by her supervisors or mentors of whom all but one are among the coauthors. The main difference is that the article contains more examples of SIR models with presentations of mortality data from plague epidemics based on purported correct historical information. However, these examples are presented without (the thorough) source-critical discussion of the historical data that historical demographers would insist upon to ensure the quality and usability of the material and to enable adequate testing of the modelled analogy by relevant empirical data. Unsurprisingly, this material is severely flawed.
