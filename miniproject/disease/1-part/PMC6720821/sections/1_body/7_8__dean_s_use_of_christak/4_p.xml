<p>For reasons, in this thesis, the works of Christakos and Olea et al. and the use of them are not explicitly mentioned, instead only the term SIR-based models is consistently used, in reality the version of the Reedâ€“Frost SIR-based model used by Christakos et al. This includes also the reuse of Christakos et al.'s model of plague deaths in Givry by month, purportedly with an entirely different outcome: now, it did not show that the Black Death was a Filoviridae disease but was, instead, caused by the bacterium 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> and transmitted by human fleas and lice, as in Dean's thesis. This shows again that by this use of mathematical (epidemiological) models, preconceived views can be corroborated, also entirely opposite views, depending on the input and simulation of data. The discussion of Dean's thesis here pertains therefore also to this article but will be supplemented by some direct comments on this article.
