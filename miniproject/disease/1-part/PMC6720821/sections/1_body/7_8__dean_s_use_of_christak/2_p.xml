<p>These are all works that by intensive use of SIR mathematical epidemiological models in the form of the (extended) Reed–Frost model, according to Christakos et al., allegedly invalidated that historical plague could have been bubonic plague. Instead, it allegedly proved that the Black Death and later plague epidemics of the second pandemic were an entirely different disease, a Filoviridae disease transmitted by direct infection of contaminated cells. Nonetheless, Dean, using the same model and material, allegedly succeeded in reaching an entirely different conclusion, namely, that the Black Death and later plague epidemics of the second pandemic were not a Filoviridae disease spread by direct infection of contaminated living cells but was indeed bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> and (purportedly) transmitted by (so-called) human fleas and lice. This shows again that by this use of mathematical epidemiological models seemingly anything can be proved. Because SIR mathematical epidemiological models, such as the Reed–Frost model, can only be used to model viral diseases (according to many strongly restrictive conditions) and because SIR models cannot be used to model “Diseases with multiple hosts, such as insect vectors and animal reservoirs,” Dean's thesis has very serious and basic weaknesses. The pivotal importance for Dean's thesis of the intensive use of Olea and Christakos' article “on duration of urban mortality” [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] shows, for instance, in her statement that it contains a dataset of plague outbreaks in 53 cities that purportedly, without (superfluous) support from a medievalist or historical demographer, had “reliable information for the initial population size and the duration of the epidemic.” Furthermore, the “linear regression obtained in their (Olea and Christakos': my insertion) study formed the basis with which to compare the models we made to historical data from the Black Death.” The lack of historical and demographic competence shows again. Dean's assertion that “weekly and monthly mortality information for historical epidemics can often be obtained from gravestones, burial records, or registered wills” is erroneous from ignorance. Only continuous burial registers for a known population can be used for this purpose and that is not even the case for the burial register of Givry. The appropriate adverb is not often but never.
