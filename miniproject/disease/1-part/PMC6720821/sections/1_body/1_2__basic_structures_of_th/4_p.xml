<p>The so-called Reed–Frost model was not published by Reed and Frost, and they never called it the Reed–Frost model. It was first scholarly presented by J. De Oliveira Costa Maia in the 
 <italic>Journal of Human Biology</italic> in 1952 with strong emphasis on the model's great limitations and shortcomings. Maia emphasized on the first page that “As presented, the theory applies only to simple situations as illustrated by an outbreak of measles in a closed group” [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the latter is another general condition for the use of a SIR model. A closed group is a theoretical demographic or epidemiological concept referring to a constant or a self-contained group/community of people without emigration or immigration of members (including births), an artificial social construction which offers certain opportunities for hypothetical demographic and epidemiological analyses. It is accompanied by other artificial conditions inherent in the SIR model spelled out by Maia: “[.] a closed population [.] in which people intermingle fairly uniformly,” because that makes it “plausible” that “every individual will have the same number of contacts.”
