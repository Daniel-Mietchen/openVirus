<p>Bacterial diseases are not included, also because they quite generally do not confer lasting immunity on survivors. This is also the case with bubonic plague, and survivors generally acquire only weak and brief immunity [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is reflected in the numerous cases of survivors of plague disease who fall ill by plague again and also three times in the same epidemic who are mentioned in historical sources [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This was also noted in connection with modern bubonic plague in India, China, and Vietnam, [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; Langen and Liechtenstein state on the experience with plague epidemics in Java: “reinfection with plague may occur within a few months; surviving an attack gives but a very limited immunity” [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This shows, for starters, that bubonic plague cannot be modelled by SIR models including the Reed–Frost version of the model because it is a bacterial disease and because it does not confer lasting immunity.
