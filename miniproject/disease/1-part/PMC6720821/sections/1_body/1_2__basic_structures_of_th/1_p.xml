<p>The Reedâ€“Frost mathematical epidemiological model is central, and it has been used by Scott and Duncan [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Christakos et al. [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (and in several other articles below), and, in reality, by K.R. Dean [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Whittles and X. Didelot [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Dean et al. [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], purportedly to prove alternative theories on the microbiological nature and/or the epidemiology of the Black Death and the subsequent epidemics of the second plague pandemic. The model's name refers to two scholars at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, L. J. Reed and W. H. Frost who worked on it in the late 1920s.
