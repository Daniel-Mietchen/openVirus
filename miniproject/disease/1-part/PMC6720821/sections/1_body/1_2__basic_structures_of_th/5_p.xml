<p>Maia also underscored that the underlying theory of the model “cannot explain,” for instance, “Diseases with multiple hosts, such as insect vectors and animal reservoirs” [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which also are general conditions for the use of SIR-based models. This means that Maia made it entirely clear that the Reed–Frost SIR model could not be applied on epidemics that were or were suspected of being bubonic plague, which are by wide consensus transmitted and disseminated by bloodsucking (hematophagous) insects and associated with rats and rodent reservoirs. Such use would independently, on both the latter points, be fallacious. By implication, this applies generally to SIR-based models.
