<p>These data represent conclusive empirical evidence which can explain that all scholarly studies of historical plague epidemics by use of mathematical epidemiological S(E)IR models have produced erroneous outcomes by malfunction because they have been used outside their range of application. This evidence explains why the S(E)IR models malfunction when they are used to identify the microbial agent and epidemiological dynamics of the plague epidemics of the past and indicate completely different diseases and mechanisms of transmission. (5) Studies show that plague-infected black rats have a prevalence and levels of plague bacteraemia that make them extremely good sources for heavy infection of fleas that can enable them to transmit lethal doses of plague bacteria. (6) Laboratory studies show that the black-rat flea 
 <italic>Xenopsylla cheopis</italic> has a superior vector capacity for transmission of lethal doses of plague.
