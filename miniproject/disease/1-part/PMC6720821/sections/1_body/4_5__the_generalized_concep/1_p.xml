<p>For the central thrust of their study, Christakos et al. claim to have established and analysed “urban data from 53 cities, with 200 to 120,000 residents.” The defining numbers show that their data include settlements of all sizes from small village (or hamlet) to metropolis [

The generalized usage of the words urban and city to signify the whole range of sizes of human settlements is unexplained, unprecedented, and at variance with common usage, and with the usage of historians and social scientists, and also with the definitions of dictionaries of English, which are similar. According to the 
 <italic>Cambridge Dictionary online</italic>, “A city is a large town,” a town is “usually larger than a village but smaller than a city,” a village is “a group of houses and other buildings that is smaller than a town, usually in the countryside,” and a metropolis is “a very large city.” According to the same dictionary, the concept of urban has the meaning “of or in a city or town” [

Also Christakos et al.'s usage of the concept of urban is, unexplained and unprecedented, also used synonymously with city to cover also the full range of rural settlements, from small village (or hamlet) to large village. In Table 8 of their book, for instance, the English manors of Cuxham and Fingrith are designated cities together with big cities, such as Bruges and Rouen, and together with metropolises such as Paris and Florence [
