<p>Hankin and Greenwood were rightly convinced of the validity of their finding but could not explain it. In a sweeping and general fashion, the central principle of epidemiology predicts that no matter by what means or method a disease is transmitted from person to person, morbidity and mortality rates will increase with increasing density of the susceptible population. However, diseases that are not transmitted directly from person to person, such as, for instance, rat-and-rat-flea-based bubonic plague, can exhibit a different pattern. In the case of diseases spread by interhuman cross infection, the density pattern is, so to speak, one-dimensional, comprising only humans: the density of susceptible humans will decide the powers of spread. In the case of rat-and-rat-flea-based plague, the density pattern is three-dimensional, comprising the density not only of humans but also of rats and rat fleas. The latter two density factors will tend to covary strongly and, therefore, to override the significance of the density of humans. Rats are social animals defending territories. This means that, in the countryside, at least one rat colony will normally coreside with a household, among the substantial tenantry other colonies often also in the barn, byre, or storerooms, whereas in urban environments several households would usually crowd together within the territory of a rat colony. The ratio of humans to rats and fleas will, accordingly, tend to be lower in urban environments than in rural settlements, and there would be more persons to share between them the dangerous rat fleas let loose from an afflicted rat colony [
