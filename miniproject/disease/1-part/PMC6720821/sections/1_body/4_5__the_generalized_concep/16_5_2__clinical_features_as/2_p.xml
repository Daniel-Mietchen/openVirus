<p>The Black Death broke out in Marseille on 1 November 1348, contaminated by a ship arriving with goods from Genoa. Recently, a paleobiological study of plague graves from the Black Death near Genoa identified

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and further to other towns and cities from where there also are extant contemporary clinical descriptions of the disease which include buboes. From Chalon, important (remains of Roman) roads ran north-westwards and northwards in the direction of Reims [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In Reims, a list was kept during the Black Death which identified persons who had been miraculously healed from plague disease by intercessory prayer to St. Remi, the city's protector saint. Some of the entries include basic clinical descriptions as proof that the disease really was plague, and many of them refer to buboes with specific locations [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. All information on normalcy and locations of buboes is consistent with modern bubonic plague, only with bubonic plague and is, thus, a defining feature of bubonic plague [
