<p>There is much more epidemiological evidence supporting the notion that the disease was ordinary bubonic plague. The slowly developing early epidemic phase in August with a few burials about every day was followed by a sudden strong upsurge in burials in September which reflects the widespread and intense phase of the underlying rat epizootic. At the turn of the month, a slow decline set in followed by a strong decline from mid-October and the disappearance of burials in the third week of November. In the spring, the Black Death broke out in this region and expanded widely [

Christakos et al. do not attempt to explain why a disease spread by direct transmission of contaminated living cells between diseased and healthy persons should display this rhythm of seasonal development: the association with warm and temperate weather, the disappearance with cold and wintry weather, and why or how it should recrudesce after a long winter break. In winters, people crowded closer together to keep warm and reduce fuel expenses, which reduces interpersonal distance and enhances infection by contact, droplets, and lice. Without alternative empirical-based explanation, this usual epidemic pattern of bubonic plague invalidates their model-based hypothesis (see below).
