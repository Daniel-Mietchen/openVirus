<p>Christakos et al. claim that the pattern of mortality from the first cases in early July 1349 to the last in mid-November can be shown by the Reed–Frost model to exhibit the clear characteristics of a Filoviridae disease. However, when studied according to the temporal unit of day, the early phases of the epidemic developments as displayed in the original table is, for all practical purposes, incompatible with Filoviridae diseases. Filoviridae diseases have a normal incubation period of 8–10 days (an exceptional case with an incubation period of 21 days is recorded), [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] when the course of illness with contagiousness begins with a median duration of 8 days (an interquartile range of 7 to 11) [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This is the case also for other viral diseases with relatively short courses of contagious illness which, by their epidemiological nature, are characterized by continuity of infection and cases. Instead, it is concordant with another defining feature of bubonic plague, the latency period, the “silent” period between the first arrival of an infective rat flea in a community to the first or next human death(s): on 5 July 1348, there were two burials corresponding to the normal (pre-plague) monthly mean, then followed a burial on 17 July and one the next day, which were followed by several brief breaks of a few days distributed among a day with a burial or a few days with a few burials, before the burials began to assume continuity by day in early August.
