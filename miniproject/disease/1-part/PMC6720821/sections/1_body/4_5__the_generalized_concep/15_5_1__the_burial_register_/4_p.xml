<p>In this case, the latency period is followed by the slow and “sputtering” development of the endemic phase of bubonic plague, reflecting the early epizootic phase in the rat colonies before it slowly translates into the early epidemic phase in early August. This shows that the usage of feeding mathematical models with burials according to units of time of a month veils or conceals important epidemiological features with defining properties for identification of the disease. Christakos et al. do not examine any other option than the Filoviridae theory, for instance, whether the form of the epidemic could conform to bubonic plague, which could not be performed by model, only by epidemic analysis.</p>
