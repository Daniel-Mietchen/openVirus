<p>In the case of bubonic plague, the first deaths would reflect the arrival of one or more infective rat fleas by merchandise or with a traveller about ten days earlier. This estimate relates to a retrogressive timeline consisting of a couple of days from death to burial and eight days representing the average duration of the equally long normal courses of illness and time of incubation, indicating 25 June as the day plague contagion arrived. If this infective flea or another flea with the same provenance infected a preferred host, a rat, about the same day and triggered the beginning of the rat epizootic, a latency period of 19–27 days would ensue before the first human death occurred in this chain of epidemic events. This includes the duration of the rat epizootic of 10–14 days, 3 days of fasting for rat fleas that do not find a new rat host, and then leap onto human beings in their proximity, and the two periods of incubation and course of illness before the first human death [

This long silent period, denoted a latency period, is a characteristic feature and defining feature of rat-based-rat-flea-borne bubonic plague [
