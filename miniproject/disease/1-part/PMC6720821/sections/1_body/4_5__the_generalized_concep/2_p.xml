<p>This does not mean that the five authors do not know the meaning of the word city and its conceptual relationships with other concepts denoting various categories of settlement size with associated social and economic structures. It is the strained solution of choice to an insurmountable problem. In the specific context, this usage of the concept of city contains a central assertion that demographic structures of population size and density combined with various social and economic structures do not significantly affect epidemiological functionality: this include the exposure to infection and the susceptibility to importation of diseases into local society, the powers of spread of epidemic diseases within settlements of all sizes irrespective of economic and social structures. Whatever combination of these demographic, social, and economic categories, they allegedly produce similar rates of morbidity and mortality. Christakos et al. stated that they wished to include spatial variables, but instead appear to make efforts to exclude spatial variables, in this case associated with the crucial epidemiological dimensions of population size and density.</p>
