<p>This epidemiological model provides a basic explanation for why, in the case of bubonic plague, the severity of impact on human populations declines with mounting density of human settlement. This finding is of crucial importance. Only an epidemic disease with these disseminative properties could possibly have brought about the demographic developments observed in the Late Middle Ages when around 90% of the population lived in the countryside. Christakos et al.'s focus on urban plague is misplaced.</p>
