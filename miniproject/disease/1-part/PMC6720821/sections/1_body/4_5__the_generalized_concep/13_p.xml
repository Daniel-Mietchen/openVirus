<p>On p. 206, in Chapter V(D, f) on “Some Comparisons with Bubonic Plague,” Christakos et al. presented Figure 7, a map allegedly showing the main features of the “Propagation of the modern bubonic plague in India (adapted from Plague Research Commission, 1912).” In References A, the entry of this reference is supplemented with the page reference 207–242. This is apparently a spurious reference because no such map is presented by the IPRC anywhere in their reports: the given pages in volume 12 of 1912 contain IPRC's four reports (term here used for research articles) nos. XLVIII-L and half of report LI, which do not relate to the spread of plague in India. This is not a misprint or scribe's error, the volume of 1913 does not contain reports by the IPRC, and the volume of 1911 contains reports by IPRC's epidemiological specialist Greenwood to the opposite effect. As pointed out earlier, Hankin and Greenwood compared their studies of the spread of plague in India with the spread of the Black Death in England and concluded that the pattern of spread of these plague epidemics was similar. This apparently spurious map and reference with accompanying comments are the consequence of a completely erroneous identification of the disease and the distortions of the mathematical epidemiological model which engender a strong need for construed support.</p>
