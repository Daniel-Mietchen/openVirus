<p>One point remains to be explained: the tendency of mortality rates to rise again in big cities and metropolises. Because they would be surrounded by walls, the price of building sites was so high that it induced the building of multistorey houses, quite often with two or more living units at the same level. This would create new ecological niches or habitats for black rats where colonies would settle in the space provided by floors, in the walls between living units, and in the ceiling or roof, according to a pattern observed also in India, “the fact that 
 <italic>R. rattus</italic> lived at all levels of the houses and therefore in close contact with man” [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This would produce the effect of increasing the number of rats and fleas relative to the human population within the territories of rat colonies, causing mortality rates to rise again and to surpass the level characteristic of towns but not of villages.
