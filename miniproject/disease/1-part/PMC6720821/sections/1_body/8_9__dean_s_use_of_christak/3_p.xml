<p>Kermack and McKendrick's objective was to gain “insights” into “the process by which epidemics in limited populations run their peculiar courses and end in final extinction,” which is the ordinary use of SIR models. Dean inferred by analogy from Kermack and McKendrick's SIR-based mortality curve to (1) the general usability of similar mortality data by the Reed–Frost version of a SIR-based model to make (2) an allegedly valid inference to mechanism(s) or mode of territorial spread. This is not only a false claim on behalf of the Reed–Frost SIR model but it also ignores that analogies only can be used to construct working hypotheses that can and must be tested by adequate empirical data. Such testing is dispensed with at the cost of making the claim fallacious also on this point. Kermack and McKendrick just assumed that the mortality curve in Mumbai was due to rat-based-flea-borne plague, and they do not suggest that this premise could be inferred from the form of the curve they presented.</p>
