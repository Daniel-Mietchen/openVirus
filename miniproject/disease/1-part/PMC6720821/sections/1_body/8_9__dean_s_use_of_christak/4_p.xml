<p>Dean's wish to identify the type of epidemic without “contact tracing” refers to the standard procedure of historical demographers when performing such a study. This is the hard work of family reconstitution of a local population on the eve of the epidemic on the basis of parish registers or combined with other registers providing information on households and their location. As the epidemic progressed, this individualized population material permits the identification of the dead (buried) persons and the linking of them to specific households and specific dwellings or houses or streets and, thus, to establish the network or chain of cases according to the spatiotemporal dynamics of transmission of the infection. This has been performed in some way in a substantial number of studies, in relation to, e.g., the plague epidemics in the East Devon town of Colyton in 1645-46, in the northern German town of Uelzen in 1597, in studies of the epidemic in the Derbyshire village of Eyam in 1665-66, in studies of five streets in Bristol in the plague epidemics of 1575 and 1603, and in the district of Jordaan in Amsterdam [

In the latter study, the patterns of spread of the plague epidemics of 1617 and 1624, according to individualized burials and location of dwellings, were also compared with the pattern of local distribution of deaths caused by the (“Spanish”) influenza epidemic in the same and quite unchanged district in 1918. In this way, the disparate and highly distinct patterns of spread of rat-and-rat-flea-borne plague and spread of flu by interhuman cross infection with virus-infected droplets were demonstrated. Without exception, this very best approach produced conclusive epidemiological evidence that the plague epidemics were rat-and-rat-flea-borne bubonic plague. The presumption or hypothesis that infectious or contagious diseases can be identified by modelled curves showing mortality over time is mainly an illusion. This can only be performed on diseases with a unique pattern of development of mortality over time, which must, then, first be identified and shown to be operative in the type of society in question.
