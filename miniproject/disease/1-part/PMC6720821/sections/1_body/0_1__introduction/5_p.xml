<p>According to the methodology of (social) science, analogues cannot be true (or false) or prove something to be true (at some level of tenability). The essence of models is that they can provide guidance for the construction of working hypotheses that can be empirically adequately tested or of experiments which provide empirical data suitable for testing. Scientists tend to ignore that many social scientists consider that mathematical models are not “meaningfully applicable” in the study of social contexts and, in casu of historical (plague) epidemics. Historians consider that the study of historical epidemics requires good knowledge and understanding of the specificity of the historical society in question: the functions of the interaction of its economic, political-administrative, and cultural structures as expressed in people's activities, beliefs, behavioural patterns, and motives, which structured the societies and engendered the dynamics of epidemic spread.</p>
