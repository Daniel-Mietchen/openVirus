<p>This article does not criticize the S(E)IR models or other mathematical epidemiological models per se but the erroneous use of them, in this case on historical plague epidemics. The S(E)IR models are good for their intended use and do not need further development, if possible. What is needed is a higher awareness and better understanding of their area of application, the range and limitations of uses, and better historically relevant scholarly competence.</p>
