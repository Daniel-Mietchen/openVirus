<p>Relating to the theory of early-phase transmission of plague by fleas, B. J. Hinnebusch (Chief of the Plague Section of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH, NIAID) pointed out, among other things, that results presented by scientists on the purported efficiency of early-phase transmission apparently were based on mathematical models using estimates of important parameters with little or no experimental (i.e., empirical) support [

Recently, the validity of this serious criticism was demonstrated when he showed, together with two coauthors, that the claims associated with the original experiments could not be reproduced. The results of the mathematical model were ipso facto shown to be untenable and that early-phase transmission would be significant only in highly susceptible rodent populations experiencing a high flea burden and not in the case of human plague [
