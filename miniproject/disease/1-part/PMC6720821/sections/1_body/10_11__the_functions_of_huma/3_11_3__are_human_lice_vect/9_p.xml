<p>In its first set of experiments, IPRC performed also an experiment where plague-diseased guinea pigs and healthy guinea pigs were allowed to run free in a room, simulating the situation in an infected rat colony. When the fleas were removed but not the lice, nothing happened, despite the fact that the LD
 <sub>63</sub> of guinea pigs is 1 plague bacterium; when fleas were introduced, the epizootic, once started, spread “from animal to animal, the rate of progress being in direct proportion to the number of fleas present,” which settled the matter [

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], data which also could usefully have been applied in this context because human beings live much more often in proximity with commensal or peridomestic black rats than with laboratory rabbits. Houhamdi et al.'s experiments can mainly be considered artificial laboratory constructions without relevance for the understanding of epidemic plague.
