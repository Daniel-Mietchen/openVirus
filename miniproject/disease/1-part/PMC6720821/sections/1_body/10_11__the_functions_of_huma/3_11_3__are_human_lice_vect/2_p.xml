<p>Blanc and Baltazard performed experiments with 63 lice which presumably were predominantly adults, an assumption that will also maximize the volume of blood and possible contamination by 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. Because there tend to be more females than males in a normal lice population [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], it seems reasonable to suppose that 60% were females. Recent research has shown that an adult female louse (imago) imbibes, on average, 0.0001579 mL = 0.1579 
 <italic>μ</italic>L per blood meal, an adult male 0.0000657 
 <italic>μ</italic>L [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and take on the average three feeds per day [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This means that 63 adult lice, distributed on 38 females and 25 males on the average, imbibe 0.0229281 mL = ∼0.023 mL or ∼23 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of blood a day. For practical or pedagogical reasons, the following estimates will take as a point of departure that a level of bacteraemia of 1000 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>/mL of blood implies that each 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of blood contains on the average 1 plague bacterium. This implies that a batch of lice with the presumed composition and feeding habits which had ingested 23 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of blood in the past 24 hours would altogether be infected by 23 plague bacteria when feeding on a person with a level of bacteraemia of 1000 bacteria/mL of blood, a level measured only in one of 271 individually studied human plague cases, albeit with large margins. Also as an approximate estimate to be considered within substantial margins of error, this is an important analytical tool which, in the light of the presented data on human plague bacteraemia, puts in perspective claims that lice can play an important part in the transmission of bubonic plague, a negligible part would be more accurate, as maintained by Girard in 1943 [
