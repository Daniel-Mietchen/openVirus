<p>Houhamdi et al. used bacterial strains of the plague “biovar Orientalis” [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], which has been shown not be representative of historical plague. This means, as pointed out, that coauthors M. Drancourt and D. Raoult's consistent identification of this “biovar” in their historical research must be due to laboratory contamination [
