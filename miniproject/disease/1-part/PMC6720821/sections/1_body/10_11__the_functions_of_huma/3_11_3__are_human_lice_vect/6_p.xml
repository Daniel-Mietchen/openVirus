 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> has also not adapted by highly reduced size to being transmitted by being scratched into bite wounds but preserved a stable and normal size [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Plague bacteria are evolutionarily pro-selected according to high virulence which is crucial for the ability to produce biofilm or blockage and consequent transmission (pigmented hemin storage, hms+), while low-virulent strains are out-selected [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This process of evolutionary selection accounts for the very high and stable virulence and also size of plague bacteria [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This stands out in contrast to 
 <italic>Rickettsia prowazekii</italic> that by evolutionary adaptation to be scratched through tiny bite wounds has only one-sixth the size of plague bacteria [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This is the reason that human plague cases normally develop buboes because the contagion is deposited by fleas at an intradermal level in the catchment area of the lymphatic system and is drained to lymph nodes which swell upon infection. Only human plague cases who develop secondary bacteraemic plague by leakage of bacteria into the blood stream from buboes worn down by toxins also display petechia. In contrast, cases of exanthematic typhus rarely develop buboes while petechia are a regular feature, confirming that the bites of lice and the size of 
 <italic>Rickettsia prowazekii</italic> produce regular bacteraemic infection by scratching of lice faeces or the body juices of crushed lice through the bite wound.
