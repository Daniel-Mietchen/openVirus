<p>The IPRC's study of the fully distended midgut of a female black-rat flea showed a feeding capacity of 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L. Recently, a new study showed that the average blood meal taken by the black-rat flea 
 <italic>X. cheopis</italic> was 0.41 
 <italic>μ</italic>L for females and 0.18 
 <italic>μ</italic>L for males [

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. These studies may not differ, and it is the size of blood meals that is the crucial measurement. A preliminary study of blood meals taken by female human fleas (
 <italic>Pulex irritans</italic>) showed an average size of 0.32 
 <italic>μ</italic>L [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Because the latter study was considered preliminary, the measurement of the average size of female rat fleas' meals will be used below to ensure that estimates are based on solid empirical data, are within wide margins of safety, and error on the high side.
