<p>Plague experiments cannot be performed on human beings for evident ethical reasons, and rodent data must suffice as a base for a tentative inference to LD
 <sub>50</sub>. Relevant data are few also in this case. 90% of black rats survived primary inoculation with 5,550 plague bacteria, corresponding to LD
 <sub>10</sub>, LD
 <sub>50</sub> must be significantly higher. LD
 <sub>50</sub> of a species of highly susceptible ground squirrels was 6,070 plague bacteria [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which arguably could be usable as a cautious LD
 <sub>50</sub> for human beings of ∼6,000 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This means that female/male human fleas must feed on blood containing at least 2.7 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> or 7.2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> bacteria/mL to ingest this number of plague bacteria. By a huge margin, this requirement is met only by the human case with the unique/extreme level of bacteraemia of 4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> or 0.4% of all 272 human plague cases individually examined for level of plague bacteraemia. This evidence also explains that no concrete case of interhuman cross infection of bubonic plague was observed in the big plague epidemics in India, China, Java, and Madagascar or in the large epidemics in Egypt and Vietnam, according to the huge syntheses of plague studies given in the standard works on plague. This is put in perspective by the fact that native huts and hovels swarmed with human ectoparasites [
