<p>This is concordant with the fact that transmission of plague by human fleas is not observed in large-scale laboratory experiments [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. IPRC noted that 
 <italic>Pulex irritans</italic> could transmit plague to healthy guinea pigs if fed on extremely bacteraemic rat blood, 10
 <sup>9</sup> bacteria/mL, which never occurs in human beings by vast margins. They recorded 3 successful transmissions out of 38 experiments with batches of 20 fleas, i.e., 720 fleas, a transmission rate of 0.14% under extremely favourable conditions. Because transmission by blockage/biofilm was not known, the mechanism of transmission of lethal doses of plague bacteria to the guinea pigs was not observed and will remain uncertain [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Guinea pigs are, however, exceptionally susceptible to plague infection, studies show that infection by 1 plague bacterium killed two-thirds of guinea pigs, i.e., LD
 <sub>63</sub> = 1 [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This means that the transmission of lethal doses of plague infection to these guinea pigs probably occurred by the mechanical method, biting by mouth parts still soiled with blood containing one or a few plague bacteria, which would be without significance for human beings. This observation is concordant with the fact that transmission of bubonic plague by human ectoparasites never has been observed during bubonic plague epidemics.
