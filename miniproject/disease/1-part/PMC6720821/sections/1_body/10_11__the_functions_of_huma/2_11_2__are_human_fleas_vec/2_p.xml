<p>Mass studies of human plague bacteraemia were performed on patients in Mumbai's plague hospitals around 1900 and several quite large studies by American physicians during the Vietnam War when there were quite big plague epidemics with 4,500–5,600 recorded cases in the three peak years of 1965–67 [

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. These studies showed that, respectively, not more than 45% and 30% of human plague cases developed plague bacteraemia, or conversely that 70–55% did not and could not serve as sources of infection for feeding fleas or lice. 244 individual studies of the level of bacteraemia were also performed at some advanced point of the disease or repeatedly during the (remaining) course of illness which supplemented the 28 cases individually studied by IPRC [

These studies showed that the huge majority of bacteraemic plague patients developed only slight levels of bacteraemia and that levels did not change significantly during the last half or latter course of illness and also that there was an insignificant incidence of change from nonbacteraemic to bacteraemic form [
