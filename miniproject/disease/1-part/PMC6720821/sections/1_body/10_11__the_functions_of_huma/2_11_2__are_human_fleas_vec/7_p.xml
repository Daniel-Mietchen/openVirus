<p>Only the extreme outlier with a level of bacteraemia of 4 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> bacteria/mL, which, according to the sexed infection gauges, would infect feeding female or male fleas (
 <italic>X. cheopis</italic>) with, respectively, ∼16,400/∼7,200 bacteria, seems, in this context, to be of interest with respect to potential for infecting feeding fleas with LDs. This technical and statistical argument, based on hard scientific data, implies that 99.6% of all fleas which feed on human plague cases for all practical purposes will be infection free at the time of the next blood meal.
