<p>In a treatise designed to show that historical plague cannot have been bubonic plague but was a Filoviridae disease, Scott and Duncan tacitly chose to use an epidemiological model which cannot be used to test historical evidence on epidemics which were or could be suspected of being due to bacterial infection or transmitted by insects, such as bubonic plague. As such the whole treatise is based on a fallacy of methodology. This should have been known by Scott and Duncan who explicitly inform that they base their knowledge of the Reed–Frost model on Maia's article. Indirectly, this is corroborated by a statement on p. 355: “typhus epidemics do not follow Reed and Frost dynamics because it is a disease with an arthropod vector.”</p>
