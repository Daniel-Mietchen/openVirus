<p>Scott and Duncan used the Reed–Frost model to analyse various historical plague epidemics, and it consistently confirmed the revolutionary theory that historical plague had to be a Filoviridae disease, (a variant of) Ebola disease, or Marburg disease [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to the Reed–Frost model, historical plague epidemics allegedly exhibited a pattern of spread formed by the direct exchange of infected cells containing viral particles between a diseased [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (or objects contaminated by fresh body fluid of a diseased) and a healthy person [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This type of disease has never been transmitted outside a range of African countries stretching from the southern coasts of West Africa to Sudan, where it has a zootic reservoir [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this zootic reservoir, Filoviridae diseases circulate among animals which do not live in the territories ravaged by the Black Death and the second pandemic or in the countries where the third plague pandemic spread. Scott and Duncan performed these analyses without discussing the methodological principles or problems involved in the use of the Reed–Frost theory and without discussing them in the light of the array of necessary conditions for its use laid out by Maia (and Abbey). In this context, let it suffice to point out that (1) epidemics of bubonic plague in general do not conform to the pattern of spread of Filoviridae epidemics formed by direct physical transmission of viral particles in cells, as observed in Africa [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and (2) that scientific studies on Filoviridae diseases do not contain a single human case with bubo(es), a defining feature of modern and historical plague [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (although rare cases of enlarged lymph nodes have been reported, as should be expected) [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
