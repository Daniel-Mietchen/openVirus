<p>Conventional inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), generally delivered through subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, are today still the most efficient, valuable, and low‐cost tools to effectively reduce influenza virus infections and subsequently morbidity and mortality.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> This parental administration is able to increase the serum antibody level in the systemic immune compartment, but it is not able to trigger a local mucosal immune response at the site of primary infection, that is, an induction of sIgA which exhibit a wide cross‐protection activity. This represents a limit for conventional inactivated influenza vaccines in conferring full protection against infection.
