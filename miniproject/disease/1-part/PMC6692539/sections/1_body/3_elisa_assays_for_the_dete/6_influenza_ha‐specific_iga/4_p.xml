<p>One approach may be to use the “limit of blank” according to the following formula: “
 <italic>Average of background signals (OD
  <sub>Blank</sub>) plus 2 standard deviations.”

An alternative possibility is the calculation of the cutoff value as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that shows an absorbance value &gt;0.2 of the OD value after subtraction of the background as previously described.
