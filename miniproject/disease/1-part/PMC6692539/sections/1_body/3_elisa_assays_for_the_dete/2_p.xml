<p>According to the type of influenza vaccine used and the route of administration, specific compartments of the human immune system are stimulated. A local mucosal immune response is elicited by natural infection or intranasal vaccination, while a systemic immune response develops after parenteral vaccination.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">69</xref> As a consequence of stimulating different components of the immune system via mucosal or parenteral application of vaccines, the induction of serum hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) antibody titers, which are still considered as the gold standard in assessing influenza vaccine immunogenicity, is generally lower after intranasal vaccination than those elicited by intramuscular vaccination

 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref> Of out a couple of laboratory tests that can be used to assess influenza antibody levels, the enzyme‚Äêlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most favorable one to measure the mucosal immune responses.
