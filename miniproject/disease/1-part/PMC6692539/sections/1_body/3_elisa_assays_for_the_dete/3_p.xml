<p>Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay can accurately measure the concentrations of different classes of antibodies that are able to bind to influenza virions or purified HA proteins.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">70</xref> Many different protocols and standard kits are currently available on the market, but they are all based on the same principle. Generally, HA protein or whole influenza virus is pre‐adsorbed to the wells of an ELISA microplate; different sample dilutions are then added, followed by the addition of the labeled secondary antibody, which is able to detect the immunoglobulins of interest. A colorimetric reaction is obtained upon the addition of a substrate. An important feature of the ELISA assay is that it can measure different classes of IgG, IgM, and IgA present both in serum and in mucosal samples.
