  <title>Viremia and viral RNA detected in bodily fluids by day post-inoculation.</title>
  <p>Viremia and viral RNA detected in subcutaneously inoculated African green monkeys (panel A, B, C and D); intravaginally inoculated African green monkeys (panel E, F, G and H); intrarectally inoculated African green monkeys (panel I, J, K and L). Circles and/or dotted lines connecting points represent genome copies in log
   <sub>10</sub> c/mL. Squares and/or solid lines connecting points represent virus titers in log
   <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL. The lower limit of detection for genome copies was 3.0 log
   <sub>10</sub> c/mL. The lower limit of detection for virus titers was 1.0 log
   <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL.
