This was a transient event in AGM5 and AGM7 lasting a single day. However, AGM6 continued to display lymphadenopathy involving the axillary or inguinal lymph nodes at multiple time points. Menstruation was observed in AGM8 during inoculation, as well as at 3 and 28 DPI; but was not observed in AGM5, AGM6 and AGM7 at inoculation or post-inoculation. Potentially clinically significant marked increases or decreases in laboratory values observed in infected animals for at least two days during the study period were: alanine aminotransferase, amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, glucose, hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, red blood cell count, and white blood cell count (
