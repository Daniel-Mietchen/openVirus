<p>Viremia (infectious virus) was detected in 75% of AGMs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008107.g002">Fig 2</xref>) between 5 and 7 DPI (viremia mean duration: 3.0 d), with a mean peak titer in the sera of 4.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL. vRNA was detected in the blood of all viremic AGMs ranging from 5 to 12 DPI (mean duration 4.3 d) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008107.g002">Fig 2</xref>), with a mean peak vRNA load of 6.9 log
 <sub>10</sub> c/mL. AGM5 displayed the highest detectable viremia and vRNA load in the blood at 7 DPI, reaching a titer of 4.4 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and a vRNA load of 7.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> c/mL. vRNA was first detected in the oral swab of AGM6 at 6 DPI and was detectable in AGM6 and AGM7 through 12 DPI, while vRNA was detected in oral swabs of AGM5 at 7 and 9 DPI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008107.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The mean peak vRNA load in oral swabs was 5.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> c/mL. Infectious virus was detected in oral swabs from AGM5 at 7 and 9 DPI (2.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and 1.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, respectively), AGM6 at 7, 9 and 12 DPI (1.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, all days), AGM7 at 12 DPI (1.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL), and AGM7 at 12 DPI (1.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL). vRNA was detected in the vaginal swabs of AGM5, AGM6 and AGM7 by 2 DPI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008107.g002">Fig 2</xref>), with a mean peak vRNA load of 4.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> c/mL. Infectious virus was detected in vaginal swabs from AGM5 at 2 and 5 DPI (1.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, both days), AGM6 at 2 and 5 DPI (1.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and 1.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, respectively), and AGM7 at 2 DPI (1.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL). Although we did not detect viremia or vRNA in AGM8, all AGMs seroconverted by 15 DPI (
