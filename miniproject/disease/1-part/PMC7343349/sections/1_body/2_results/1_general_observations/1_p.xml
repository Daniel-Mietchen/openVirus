<p>Throughout the course of the study, none of the infected AGMs exhibited rash, ocular abnormalities, joint swelling, decreased motor function, cough, changes in urine output, abnormal stool, decreased food consumption, pyrexia or weight loss (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), and virus was isolated in a subset of these vRNA positive specimens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008107.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In addition, prolonged viral shedding with high viral loads/infectious virus were detected/isolated in the vaginal swabs of a female AGM inoculated intrarectally (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). With the exception of the female AGM who seroconverted in the absence of detectable viremia or vRNA, all infected AGMs displayed robust virus neutralizing antibody titers (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). We observed a 1:1 ratio of male to female AGMs infected by the subcutaneous or intrarectal routes, indicating a similar susceptibility to ZIKV infection for both male and female AGMs.
