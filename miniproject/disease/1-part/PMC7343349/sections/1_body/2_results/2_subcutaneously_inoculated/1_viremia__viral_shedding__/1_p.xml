<p>Viremia (infectious virus) was detected in all AGMs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008107.g002">Fig 2</xref>) ranging from 1 to 7 DPI (viremia mean duration: 4.3 d), with a mean peak titer of 2.9 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL. vRNA was also detected in the blood of all AGMs ranging from 1 to 7 DPI (mean duration 5.0 d) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008107.g002">Fig 2</xref>), with a mean peak vRNA load of 6.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> c/mL. AGM3 displayed the highest detectable viremia at 6 DPI (3.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL), while AGM2 displayed the highest detectable vRNA load in the blood at 5 DPI (6.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> c/mL). All four AGMs had vRNA detected in oral swabs (

 <sub>10</sub> c/mL. vRNA was first detected in the oral swab of AGM1 at 3 DPI and was detected up to 15 DPI in AGM3. Infectious virus was isolated from oral swabs in AGM1 at 3 and 4 DPI (1.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL both days), AGM2 at 2 and 7 DPI (1.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and 1.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, respectively), AGM3 at 7 DPI (1.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL), and AGM4 at 5 and 7 DPI (1.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and 1.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, respectively). vRNA was not detected in any vaginal swab from the two female AGMs. By 15 DPI, all AGMs had seroconverted (
