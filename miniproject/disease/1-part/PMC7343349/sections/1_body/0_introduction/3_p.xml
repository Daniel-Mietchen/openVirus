<p>The majority of experimental animal work to date has been carried out in immunosuppressed mice to study specific aspects of transmission or viral pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], however these models are generally lethal and do not recapitulate human infection. Thus, immunocompetent nonhuman primates (NHPs) have remained the gold standard for modeling transmission risk and studying viral pathogenesis. Uniform infection is generally achieved following subcutaneous inoculation of macaques using a ZIKV dose similar to that inoculated by a mosquito bite [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], whereas two studies reported non-traumatic intravaginal inoculation of macaques using a dose that recapitulates human semen viral loads resulted in considerably less transmission potential [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. We previously modeled ZIKV sexual transmission risk in rhesus (

 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) macaques, however only 50% of the exposed macaques of each species became infected following intravaginal inoculation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Researchers elsewhere investigating intravaginal ZIKV transmission reported similar results in rhesus macaques, but used repeated exposures or medroxyprogesterone, a progesterone-based contraceptive that thins the vaginal epithelium, to initiate successful transmission and subsequent infection in some resistant macaques [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Thus, a highly sensitive intravaginal transmission model is needed to study acute pathogenesis. As such, there is an immediate need to investigate infection dynamics in additional NHP species.
