<p>In this study, we model mosquito and sexual transmission of ZIKV–two principle modes of virus transmission. Herein, we report ZIKV infection dynamics and moderate-duration shedding in AGMs infected by concurrent subcutaneous, intravaginal or intrarectal inoculation; and we describe a highly sensitive non-traumatic intravaginal ZIKV transmission model. We observed viremia and shedding in bodily fluids followed by a strong virus neutralizing antibody response, in the absence of overt clinical illness–infection dynamics similar to those reported in the majority of human infections. These three AGM ZIKV models will be crucial for investigating viral pathogenesis, screening antivirals and vaccine candidates, as well as providing critical data on the role of the AGM as an enzootic amplification host.</p>
