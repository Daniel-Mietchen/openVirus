<p>Although ZIKV is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infective mosquito, the virus is unique among flaviviruses, as it can also be sexually transmitted [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. High vRNA loads (7.5–8.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL) have been reported in the semen of some patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], with virus isolations being made up to 69 days post-illness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While, reported cases involving male-to-partner sexual transmission have occurred within 41 days post-illness onset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], vRNA has been detected in the semen of previously infected males up to 9 months post-illness onset) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Hence, prolonged viral shedding in the semen of previously infected males’ points to the potential for long-duration super-shedders. Though the majority of sexually transmitted ZIKV cases described in case reports have involve male-to-female or male-to-male transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], ZIKV has also been isolated from vaginal secretions (≥14 days post-illness) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and vRNA has been detected for up to 180 days post-symptom onset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], indicating the potential existence of female long-duration super-shedders. The isolation of infectious virus in vaginal secretions coupled with epidemiological case reports suggest ZIKV could potentially be transmitted from infectious females to their sexual partners [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus, male-to-female, male-to-male, female-to-male or female-to-female sexual transmission could result in virus transmission following the resolution of clinical illness. Nevertheless, in regions with active virus circulation this mode of transmission is generally masked by the primary transmission mode, mosquito-to-human transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As such, case reports involving sexual transmission primarily involve the female or male sexual partners of males who were infected with ZIKV while traveling to regions with active virus circulation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
