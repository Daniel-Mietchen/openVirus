<p>Zika virus (ZIKV; family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>), a TORCH pathogen, recently initiated a series of large epidemics in virus-naïve tropical regions that were perpetuated by mosquito-to-human and sexual transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008107.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The majority of human ZIKV infections are asymptomatic (≥80.0%) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], thus resulting case reports severely underestimate the true burden of disease. Symptomatic cases generally display a self-limiting febrile illness with common signs and symptoms including rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, conjunctivitis, retro-orbital pain, edema, pruritus and/or fatigue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A subset of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections result in severe clinical manifestations including congenital birth defects (i.e. ZIKV congenital syndrome) or Guillian-Barré syndrome [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ZIKV strains comprise at least two phylogenetic lineages, African and Asian, constituting a single serotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While only virus strains from the Asian lineage have been reported to be teratogenic, experimental evidence is mounting that infection with strains from either lineage can result in neurological involvement following 
 <italic>in utero</italic> transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the lack of reported congenital birth defects in Africa may be a result of misdiagnosis, underreporting, and/or ZIKV exposure prior to puberty leading to subsequent protective immunity during a woman’s reproductive years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Viremia in immunocompetent adults is generally transient, with only a fraction of cases displaying vRNA in the blood for an extended period of time [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As ZIKV has been detected and/or isolated from a variety of bodily fluids including semen, vaginal secretions and saliva [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], these specimen types are often used in the diagnosis of active ZIKV infection.
