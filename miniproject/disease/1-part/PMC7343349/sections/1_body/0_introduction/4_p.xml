<p>We speculated the African green monkey (AGM: 
 <italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic>) would be more sensitive to infection and display a higher transmission potential than rhesus macaques, as the geographic distribution of the AGM overlaps many regions with enzootic ZIKV circulation in Africa. Furthermore, there are multiple attributes that would make the AGM a valuable alternative to the rhesus macaque for modeling ZIKV transmission and infection. Both wild and captive AGMs are widely utilized in biomedical research, as such their biology is well characterized [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], comparisons between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are more appropriate than those studies utilizing discordant cell lines and NHP species. In comparison to the rhesus macaque, the AGM is smaller and easier to handle, and their weights are generally sufficient to permit blood draws over multiple days. The gestation of the AGM is similar to that of rhesus macaques (approx. 165 days) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], making them suitable to explore 
 <italic>in utero</italic> ZIKV transmission and pathogenesis. Importantly, the AGM is not an endangered species, and is more easily sourced than Indian rhesus macaques.
