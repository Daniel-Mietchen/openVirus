<p>We utilized the sylvatic ArD 41525 strain of ZIKV (Genbank Accession: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KU955591" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">KU955591</ext-link>), which was isolated from a pool of 
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> mosquitoes collected in Eastern Senegal in 1984 (passage history: AP61#1, C6/36#1, Vero #3). This isolate was kindly provided by Drs. Robert Tesh and Scott Weaver at the University of Texas Medical Branch. We selected this strain due to its low passage history, an intact N-linked glycosylation site [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Furthermore, this strain was isolated in a region within the known distribution of AGMs. Before study initiation, the virus challenge stock was confirmed to be pure, free of 
 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> spp. and its entire genome was sequenced [
