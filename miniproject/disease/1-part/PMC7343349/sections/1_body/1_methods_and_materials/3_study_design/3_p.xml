<p>Prior to the initiation of experimental work, AGMs were acclimatized to their study environment for a period of 14 days (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each inoculation group was comprised of four AGMs. Two females and two males were anesthetized and then subcutaneously inoculated between the scapulas with 4.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU of ZIKV in 1 mL PBS. Four female AGMs were inoculated intravaginally with ZIKV as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Briefly, anesthetized AGMs for intravaginal inoculation were placed in dorsal recumbency with their hips elevated above their torso at a 30˚ angle. A dose of 6.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU of ZIKV in 2 mL of PBS was then administered to the vaginal canal using a lubricated size 7FR infant feeding tube (Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, St. Louis, MO, USA). AGMs remained in dorsal recumbency with hip elevation for 20 minutes. An additional four AGMs (2 females and 2 males) were intrarectally inoculated with ZIKV as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Briefly, anesthetized AGMs for intrarectal inoculation were placed in an inverted Trendelenburg position (25˚ to 30˚ down angle) and a lubricated size 7FR infant feeding tube (Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals) was inserted 3 to 5 cm into the rectum. A 10 mL, 0.9% sodium chloride flush was administered to soften impacted fecal material lining the rectum, after which 6.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU of ZIKV in 3 mL of PBS was administered. AGMs stayed in dorsal recumbency with hip elevation for 20 minutes.
