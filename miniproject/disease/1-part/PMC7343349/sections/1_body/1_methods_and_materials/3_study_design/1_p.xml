<p>The goal of the study was to determine if AGMs were susceptible to ZIKV infection by subcutaneous, intravaginal or intrarectal inoculation. Sample size estimates were based on historic reports of ZIKV experimental infections involving NHPs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and the results of our recent intravaginal and intrarectal studies in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Power analysis with the type I error rate set to 0.05 indicated that a group size of four individuals had an 80% probability to detect infection following subcutaneous, intravaginal or intrarectal inoculation with ZIKV. Experiments were carried out simultaneously to assess the potential for temporal variation in AGM infection dynamics. Inoculation doses were based on the anticipated natural ZIKV dose that would be inoculated via infective mosquito feeding (subcutaneous route), or through sexual transmission via infective semen (intravaginal and intrarectal route). Investigators were not blinded during the course of the study.
