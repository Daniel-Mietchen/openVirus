<p>Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) were used to determine seroconversion in AGMs inoculated with ZIKV as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Serum samples were first heat-inactivated at 56°C (30 min) and subsequently serially diluted 2-fold in PBS, mixed with an equal volume of 3.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL of ZIKV after which they were incubated for 1 h at 37°C (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). Confluent Vero cell monolayers in 6-well plates were inoculated with a serum/virus mixture in triplicate. Plates were incubated at 37°C (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) for 5 days and then fixed and stained as described above. PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> titers were calculated and expressed as the reciprocal of serum dilution yielding a &gt;80% reduction in the number of plaques. At -21 DPI, none of the AGMs had titers of 1:20 or higher, indicating these animals had not been previously infected with ZIKV. Post-exposure sera were screened on 7, 15, 21 and 28 DPI for neutralizing antibodies. We considered those AGMs with a four-fold or greater rise in titers to have seroconverted (≥1:160).
