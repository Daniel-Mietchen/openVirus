<p>As previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], virus titration was performed on confluent Vero cell (CCL-81, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) monolayers in six-well plates by plaque assay. Wells were infected with serial 10-fold diluted virus in media comprised of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA), supplemented with 50 μg/mL gentamicin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% v/v non-essential amino acids (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA); media was further supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL of amphotericin B (Gibco), 100 U/ml of penicillin (Sigma), and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma) for oral and vaginal swab specimens for infectious virus quantification. Virus or specimens were allowed to absorb for 1 hr at 37°C and cell monolayers were overlayed with 3 mL of 1% w/v Sea-Plaque agarose (Cambrex Bio Science, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) in media. Cells were incubated at 37°C (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) for 4–5 days and then fixed with 4% formalin (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Corning Life Sciences) for 24 hrs. The agarose overlay was removed and cell monolayers were fixed and stained with 2% crystal violet (Sigma Aldrich) in 70% methanol (Sigma Aldrich). Excess stain was removed under running water. Results are reported as the number of plaque forming units (PFU)/mL, with a lower limit of detection of 1.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL.
