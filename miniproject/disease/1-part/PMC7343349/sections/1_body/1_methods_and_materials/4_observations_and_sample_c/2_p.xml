<p>Comprehensive metabolic panels were performed on serum using a Piccolo Xpress Chemistry Analyzer and Piccolo General Chemistry 13 Panel (Abbott Point of Care, Princeton, NJ, USA). Complete blood counts were performed on whole blood using a CELL-DYN 3700 system (Abbott Point of Care). Due to our sampling schedule and the weights of the AGMs, we were only able to collect a limited amount of blood at each time point. Therefore, whole blood was used to attempt detection of vRNA (RT-qPCR), and sera were used to attempt detection of viremia (plaque assay) and virus neutralizing antibodies (PRNT
 <sub>80</sub>) (
