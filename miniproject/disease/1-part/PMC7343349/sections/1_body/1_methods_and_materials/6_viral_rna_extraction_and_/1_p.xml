<p>As previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], vRNA was extracted from whole blood, saliva and vaginal specimens inactivated in TRIzol LS Reagent (Ambion) using the phenol-chloroform extraction technique. Viral RNA was then quantified using primers and a probe targeting envelope gene bases 1188â€“1316 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] in a BioRad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). A standard curve was generated against a synthetic oligonucleotide and genome copies were expressed as log
 <sub>10</sub> copies (c)/mL, with a lower limit of detection of 3.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> c/mL.
