<p>Although infection by all three routes resulted in similar viremia profiles, the onset of viremia was delayed by two to three days in intravaginally and intrarectally inoculated AGMs compared to subcutaneously inoculated AGMs. A similar delay in viremia has been previously reported in ZIKV sexual transmission experiments involving NHPs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Of interest, we detected prolonged oral shedding and the presence of infectious virus in subcutaneously and intravaginally inoculated AGMs. While experimental evidence indicates there is less potential for transmission via infectious saliva [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Our results are similar to the majority of human case reports, which describe a generally asymptomatic infection despite low-level viremias and the detection of vRNA shedding in bodily fluids.
