<p>Sexual transmission likely accounts for a substantial number of asymptomatic ZIKV cases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that AGMs are highly sensitive to ZIKV infection following intravaginal inoculation. Infection with ZIKV through vaginal secretions has been identified as a possible transmission mode, and there is at least one well documented case of suspected female-to-male transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In this study, a female AGM infected intrarectally displayed high vRNA loads and prolonged shedding of infectious virus in vaginal secretions, supporting clinical and epidemiological evidence of transmission to a sexual partner via this route. While the rate of intrarectal transmission was not as high as that observed in the intravaginally inoculated AGMs, it is important to remember that inoculation was by a one-time, non-traumatic inoculation event; thus repeated exposures, rectal trauma resulting in micro-tears during intercourse and/or the presence of co-infections could increase the chances of viral transmission [
