<p>The susceptibility of AGMs via all three-transmission routes has implications for zoonotic virus amplification and maintenance. The geographical range of 
 <italic>Chlorocebus</italic> spp. overlaps with multiple sylvatic ZIKV mosquito vectors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Chlorocebus</italic> spp., including the AGM, are known to inhabit locations with reported ZIKV epizootics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The observed viremias among all infected AGMs in this study were sustained and likely reached titers needed to infect a portion of the principle sylvatic mosquito vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In addition to mosquito transmission, the sensitivity to infection via intravaginal or intrarectal routes indicates the potential for sexual transmission between AGMs. Mating behaviors within AGM populations could exacerbate this potential as dominant males mate with the majority of females in a group and have multiple mating encounters with each female during the mating season [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Viral shedding in the vaginal secretions of female AGMs would also increase the chance of mucosal transmission during grooming, male-to-female mating, female-to-female genital investigation or female-to-female rubbing–all of which have been observed in 
 <italic>Chlorocebus</italic> spp. in the wild [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Male-to-male mounting or anal penetration has been reported among various NHP species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], and may serve as another potential transmission mode.
