<p>Even though the clinical signs and symptoms associated with ZIKV infection are now well defined, there is little published data on laboratory values of clinical interest. Notwithstanding, a recent well-documented case series involving 18 patients reported elevated liver enzymes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], a subset of ZIKV-infected AGMs in this study displayed elevated liver enzymes consistent with acute liver involvement that resolved following the clearance of viremia. While it is also possible repeated anesthesia may have influenced some laboratory values [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], it is important to note that human infection with Spondweni virus, the closest related virus to ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], has been reported to result in acute liver injury in some patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Although reported cases of liver involvement among ZIKV patients maybe uncommon, patients with liver disease or those with comorbidities that impact liver function should be monitored for acute liver injury.
