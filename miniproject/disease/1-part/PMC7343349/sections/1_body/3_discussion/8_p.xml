<p>Our study has some limitations. This was a pilot study designed to investigate the susceptibility of AGMs to ZIKV infection following subcutaneous, intravaginal or intrarectal inoculation; consequently, the study was not designed with the statistical power to perform statistical analyses of chemistry, hematology or temperature data. Nevertheless, we were able to infer ZIKV-associated transient hepatic involvement based on elevated transaminase levels, similar to studies reported elsewhere [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. While a single uninfected intrarectally inoculated AGM displayed a substantial increase in transaminases, this AGM had historically displayed liver enzyme levels (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase) at the high-end of normal or slightly above normal; and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels observed during the study were consistent with this AGMs historic values pre-exposure. Though we were able to detect acute axial and inguinal lymphadenopathy in the majority of viremic AGMs (SC and IVAG), manual abdominal examination may have failed to reveal lymphadenopathy in the abdomen of AGMs. Therefore, future studies should consider the use of ultrasound imaging, which could also be used to detect other transient pathologic changes associated with ZIKV infection. Although infection dynamics and the lack of overt clinical signs among infected AGMs are similar to those reported in the majority of human infections, it is possible that we did not observe the full spectrum of disease presentation (i.e. severe disease) due to the size of our animal cohorts.
