<p>The speed by which ZIKV spread once being introduced into the New World is uncommon among arboviruses, which are generally maintained in transmission cycles involving arthropods and virus amplification hosts in the absence of sexual transmission. The ability of a TORCH pathogen to be transmitted by hematophagous arthropod vectors requires sensitive animal models to study transmission risk and viral pathogenesis, as well as to screen antivirals and vaccine candidates. In this study, we report ZIKV infection dynamics and viral shedding in AGMs infected via subcutaneous, intravaginal or intrarectal inoculation to model mosquito-borne and sexual transmission. Our results indicate that ZIKV infection of AGMs by these routes, strain and doses produce a mild asymptomatic infection characterized by viremia, viral shedding and a strong virus neutralizing antibody responseâ€“recapitulating generalized human disease course.</p>
