<p>Our results and recent work demonstrating ZIKV sexual transmission in macaques [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], support the possibility that sexual transmission may be more common than previously suggested among various NHP species involved in ZIKV enzootic cycles. Furthermore, recent work in macaques demonstrated the potential for oropharyngeal ZIKV transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It is therefore possible that in nature, grooming or biting by infectious AGMs shedding virus in the saliva may serve as a tertiary transmission mode, as reported in SIV transmission between AGMs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], could further potentiate ZIKV transmission through grooming, biting or sexual transmission. Moreover, dispersion by infected males or troop-to-troop contact could consequently initiate epizootics in virus-naïve areas or groups. Such a cycle, coupled with transovarial transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], may partially explain the long periods of increased ZIKV enzootic activity reported in Uganda and in Senegal [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008107.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Furthermore, the wide range of ecological niches
