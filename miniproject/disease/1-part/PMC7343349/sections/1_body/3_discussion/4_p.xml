<p>While ZIKV-infected AGMs did not display overt signs of disease, lymphadenopathy was observed in some AGMs during physical examinations. We found that the route of inoculation coincided with external lymphatic drainage, associated with axillary (subcutaneous route) and/or inguinal (intravaginal route) lymphadenopathy. Although we did not observe acute axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy in AGMs infected via the intrarectal route, we speculate that infection could result in intra-abdominal lymph node changes. However, abdominal palpation would likely be insufficiently sensitive to detect minor-to-moderately enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen and may require the use of ultrasound imaging. To our knowledge lymphadenopathy has not been previously reported in ZIKV-experimentally infected NHPs, though several studies reported vRNA persistence in lymphoid tissues [
