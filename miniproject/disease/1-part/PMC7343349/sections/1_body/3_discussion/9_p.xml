<p>In summary, we report the first subcutaneous, intravaginal and intrarectal models of ZIKV infection in AGMs that recapitulates infection dynamics and lymphadenopathy reported in human casesâ€“providing a single, easily-sourced NHP species to model mosquito and sexual ZIKV transmission. These models will be critical for investigating viral pathogenesis, as well as screening antivirals and vaccine candidates. Additionally, our results indicate the AGM is an enzootic amplification host and sexual transmission between AGMs may contribute to the maintenance of ZIKV in nature.</p>
