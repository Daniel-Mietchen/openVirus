  <p>Summary of the wide host range of influenza viruses. Few host species are susceptible to infection by all the four known influenza viruses (influenza A virus—IAV, influenza B virus—IBV, influenza C virus—ICV and influenza D virus—IDV), while others are known to be infected by only specific influenza viruses. Cattles are the major known reservoir of influenza D virus; however, other small ruminants and humans have shown susceptibility to IDV infections in different conditions.</p>
