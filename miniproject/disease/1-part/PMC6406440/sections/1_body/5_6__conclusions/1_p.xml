<p>Influenza viruses have been the cause of significant concern to human and animal health worldwide. The virus not only causes morbidity and mortality, but its frequent infection also leads to socio-economic loss. Among the four genera, the influenza A viruses have been reported to be of significant concern owing to its ability to infect a wide range of hosts, and thus gaining the potential to jump the species barrier. Wild birds are the major reservoirs of IAVs [
