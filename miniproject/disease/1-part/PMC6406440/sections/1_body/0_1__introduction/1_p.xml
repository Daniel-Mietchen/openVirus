<p>Influenza viruses belong to the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, which consists of four generas: Alphainfluenzavirus (Species: Influenza A virus (IAV)), Betainfluenzavirus (Species: Influenza B virus (IBV)), Gammainfluenzavirus (Species: Influenza C virus (ICV)) and Deltainfluenzavirus (Species: Influenza D virus (IDV)) [

 <xref rid="B2-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They are enveloped viruses with segmented genome, comprising of single stranded negative sense RNA. Influenza viruses cause acute respiratory illness and of the four known types, the 
 <bold>influenza A virus</bold> is a significant public health concern with highest rates of morbidity and fatality [

 <xref rid="B5-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They have a wide host range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-08-00192-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and often jumps the species barrier [
 <xref rid="B7-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The emerging and reemerging threats due to IAVs are mainly due to two major events: Genetic drift and genetic shift [

 <xref rid="B8-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,

 <xref rid="B11-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. 
 <italic>Genetic drift</italic> is caused by point mutations in genes of the virus due to an error-prone RNA polymerase. Since the mutations take place in the genes encoding for the antibody binding sites, this event is responsible for (i) frequent influenza epidemics and (ii) the requirement of annual influenza vaccine formulations. 
 <italic>Genetic shift</italic> is the result of genetic re-assortment between the genes of two or more different strains of influenza virus infecting the same cell in a host. This event occasionally generates novel combinations of the two major surface glycoproteins of the virus: Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Since both genetic drift and genetic shift leads to changes in the genetic makeup of the virus, the existing immunity in the host may or may not provide complete protection and thus leads to multiple infections. Pigs, quails and bats have been reported to be the mixing vessels, because they co-express both SAα2,3-Gal and SAα2,6-Gal receptors required for binding with avian and human IAVs [
 <xref rid="B12-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Genetic shift has created novel influenza virus strains with the ability to sustain efficient human-to-human transmission, and thus accountable for several influenza pandemics in the past [

 <xref rid="B11-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A total of 18 novel HA (H1-H18) and 11 NA (N1-N11) have been identified till date, of which most of the possible combinations of 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been reported in water fowl which is the main reservoir of IAVs [

 <xref rid="B16-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The recently identified H17-18 and N10-11 have not been reported in birds and have been found in bats [

 <xref rid="B18-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To date, only 3 HA (H1, H2, and H3) and 2 NA (N1 and N2) subtypes have been reported to cause sustained, human-to-human transmission leading to influenza epidemics [
 <xref rid="B19-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Apart from the human influenza strains, there are several low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) that have been in circulation in wild aquatic birds and poultry thus posing a severe threat to public health. Few of the avian virus strains, such as the H5N1 and the newly emerged H7N9, have infected humans and thus are a significant cause of concern worldwide [
