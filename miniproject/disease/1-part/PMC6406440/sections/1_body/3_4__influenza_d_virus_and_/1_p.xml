<p>Studies show that IDV shares approximately 50% homology to human ICV and isolation of IDV from both swine and bovine indicates the possibility and potential of IDV to have successful transmission to other mammals, including humans [

They further observed that the seroprevalence rate of IDV in the IAV infected animals were much higher than the animals infected with only IDV, however this observation will need to be validated with a large statistically significant study covering more geographical areas of the world [
