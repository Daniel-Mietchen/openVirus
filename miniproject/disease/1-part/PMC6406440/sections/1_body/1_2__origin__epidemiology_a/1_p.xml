<p>Influenza viruses affect the human population in all age groups with an estimation of 5–10% in adults and 20–30% in children [
 <xref rid="B35-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Of the approximately 3–5 million people who develop severe influenza infection, almost one million die annually [
 <xref rid="B35-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Both influenza A and B viruses are known to cause annual epidemics and a strict surveillance program throughout the world is in action to monitor the slightest changes in their genome due to genetic drift or shift. IAV has also been associated with several pandemics in the past however, the IBV and ICV has never been the cause of any pandemic scenario owing to their limitation of host range and less frequent mutations reported till date [

 <xref rid="B9-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The surveillance activities related to ICVs have not gained much importance compared to IAVs and IBVs as it has been associated with mild clinical conditions. The ICVs, apart from infecting humans, have also been reported to infect pigs in China (1981) [
