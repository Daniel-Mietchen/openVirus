<p>Soon after the first isolation of IDV in Oklahoma, similar viruses were isolated from other part of the USA [

 <xref rid="B41-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], as well as other countries, such as Mexico [
 <xref rid="B38-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], China [

 <xref rid="B43-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], Japan [

 <xref rid="B40-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The IDV was also detected from equine populations and small ruminants, such as sheep and goat from the USA and Canada [

 <xref rid="B49-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Although the study revealed a seroprevalence of 5.2% for sheep and 8.8% for goats suggesting that small ruminants could potentially be reservoirs of IDV and help transmit the virus to other domesticated animals [
 <xref rid="B40-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], no IDV antibody was detected in the poultry [
 <xref rid="B40-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Surveillance studies in China also reported that IDV was detected in goats and pigs [
 <xref rid="B43-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The study showed that influenza viremia, as an indicator of disease severity, was observed in almost 30% of the cases with either acute infection or before the death of the host. An interesting observation was also revealed that IDV was detected in rectal swabs thereby raising the possibility of IDV to replicate within the intestinal tract similar to IAV and IBV [
 <xref rid="B43-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In Japan, the virus has been in nationwide circulation in the cattle population for at least last seven years and the related study revealed that the rate of positivity of IDV infection tended to increase with the age of the animal and further indicated a horizontal transmission of the virus within a herd [
