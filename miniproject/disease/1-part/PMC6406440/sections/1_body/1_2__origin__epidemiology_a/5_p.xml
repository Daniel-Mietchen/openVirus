<p>Other reports revealed that newborn calves among the cattle had high levels of maternal antibodies against IDV which subsequently declined after six months of age showing both their exposure to the virus and vulnerability to IDV infection [

 <xref rid="B41-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These studies also report that the IDV has been in circulation in the US cattle population much earlier than it was actually identified as a novel virus. Analyses were performed on the archived sera and it was observed that the circulation dates back to almost 2003 [

 <xref rid="B41-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A similar study conducted on a large number of animals revealed that IDV has been in circulation in North and West Africa since at least 2012 in cattle and small ruminants [

 <xref rid="B33-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Surveillance on feral swine in the USA also showed a coinfection of IDV and IAV in the same host, thereby increasing the chances of reassortment and creation of novel virus strains [
 <xref rid="B53-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The study also showed that the cattle shed IDV up to nine days post infection (dpi) while the swine shed the virus up to 5 dpi and attributed this difference to the predominance of virus in the upper respiratory tract in cattle while in the lower respiratory tract in swine [
 <xref rid="B53-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Studies based on experimental infection in cattle showed that IDV was detected in both upper and lower respiratory tract however, the clinical signs and symptoms were mild [
