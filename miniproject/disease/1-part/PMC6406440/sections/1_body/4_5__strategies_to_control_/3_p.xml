<p>Strategies like the bioaerosol surveillance at the humanâ€“animal interface may be advantageous in terms of low cost and less invasive sampling to detect novel influenza viruses [

Aerosol surveillance for respiratory viruses at an international airport in the USA from January to March 2018, revealed that few specimens were positive for IDV and adenovirus suggesting the feasibility of employing bioaerosol surveillance techniques in public transportation areas. This study, however, was performed on a very small sample size thus, a more elaborative analysis would be required to strengthen such findings [
