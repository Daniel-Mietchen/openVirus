<p>Surveillance activities against influenza viruses have been implemented worldwide to timely diagnose and prevent the spread of infection. A recent study developed and evaluated a real-time RT-PCR assay to detect the IDV in short time. The assay showed high sensitivity and specificity and can be used for diagnostics and as a confirmatory test for IDV infections [

Kishimoto et al., also described the development of one-run RT-PCR assay to not only detect IDV, but also 15 other respiratory pathogens, thus providing a quick and sensitive method to detect a wide range of respiratory viruses in the bovine respiratory disease complex [
