<p>Understanding the composition of sylvatic mosquito communities is key to identifying vector diversity and pathogen maintenance in nature. We took an approach to isolate infectious virus particles to be more informative of circulating pathogens than studies that report only molecular evidence of viral RNA. In this paper, we assess the abundance and species richness of mosquitoes at forest sites, and we also sought to identify foci for enzootic transmission of arboviruses where spillover events could occur that lead to urban outbreaks.</p>
