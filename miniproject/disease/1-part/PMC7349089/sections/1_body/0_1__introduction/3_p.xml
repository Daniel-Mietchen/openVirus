<p>The rapid expansion of tropical urban populations and elimination of natural habitats place selective pressures on arboviruses to host-switch or adapt for human-to-human transmission [

In addition, deforestation, land-use changes, and encroachment on protected areas occur in East Africa, as they do elsewhere in the world. Anthropogenic activities, which can impact an ecosystem in multiple ways, including a crossover of humans, domestic animal and wildlife pathogens, can lead to the emergence of infectious disease in any of these groups [
