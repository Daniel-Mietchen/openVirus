<p>The occurrence of vector-borne diseases has been observed in East Africa for several centuries, associated with a variety of etiological agents, host reservoirs and severity of outcome in humans or animals. For example, Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever caused by a tick-borne nairovirus is frequently fatal [

 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., spread by mosquitoes, continue to cause malaria in certain regions [

 <italic>Theileria</italic> spp.), affects livestock, and has a huge economic impact in cattle-producing regions [
