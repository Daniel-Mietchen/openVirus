<p>We recently reported evidence of exposure to CHIKV in wild NHPs in Kenya [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], supporting the concept of sylvatic transmission cycles of this and other arboviruses in the region. However, characterization of the enzootic mosquito role within these cycles remains lacking, and was the initial motivation for this study of vector. CHIKV is a key example of an arbovirus emerging, spreading and modifying to adapt to new vectors, and possibly new hosts. It re-emerged in 2004 from an unknown, and potentially enzootic, source in Kenya, with a huge outbreak and high morbidity in the coastal region [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (a peri-domestic vector species), this 2004 strain of CHIKV underwent a series of mutations in its envelope glycoprotein genes that facilitated transmission by the invasive mosquito 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, and a chain of outbreaks across the Indian Ocean Islands and Asia [

 <xref rid="B30-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The preceding goal of this study was to detect an enzootic source of CHIKV in Kenya.
