<p>Kenya itself is a location of high virus discovery, for example Garissa and Ngari viruses [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and several major vector-borne disease epidemics, e.g., Yellow Fever outbreak in 1992–1993, kala-azar (spread by sandflies) in 1977–1979 and 2014 [

 <xref rid="B20-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and is therefore a prime area to investigate enzootic sources of pathogens—knowledge of which can aid understanding of the spillover potential to human populations. Previous studies in Kenya have detected several mammalian viruses in mosquitoes including WNV, RVFV, Sindbis and Ndumu virus [

 <xref rid="B23-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], as well as insect-specific viruses [

Kenya is a country in East Africa with a huge variety of habitat, spanning both coastal and lakeside (Lake Victoria), elevations from 0 to 5.197 m, and ranging from arid desert to wetlands, riverine ecosystems, tropical forest, grassland, urban communities, agriculture and rocky mountain. Although plenty of studies have looked at mosquito species in Kenya [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], these investigations have tended to focus on urban, peri-domestic or farm vectors in anthropogenic habitat, and a knowledge gap lies in addressing the vectors of forest habitat, and/or those involved in sylvatic maintenance of arboviruses.
