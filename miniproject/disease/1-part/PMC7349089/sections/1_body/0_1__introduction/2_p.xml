<p>For many arboviruses in East Africa, the emergent source of an epidemic is not known, but experience elsewhere shows that enzootic cycles outside the urban transmission exist. For example in Senegal, the alphavirus chikungunya [CHIKV] circulates between arboreal 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic>) spp. mosquitoes and wild non-human primates [NHPs], with occasional (typically every 7â€“8 years) spillover into local human populations [

 <xref rid="B11-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite human outbreaks caused by this flavivirus having occurred in parts of Kenya, Tanzania (Dar el Salaam), and Somalia (Mogadishu) [

 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], enzootic transmission of DENV has not been evidenced in East Africa; nevertheless, we recently detected antibodies against it in NHPs of coastal Kenya [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Uganda, YFV outbreaks in 2016 were attributed to the proximity of agricultural activities to forests and swamps with sylvatic monkeys and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes [
