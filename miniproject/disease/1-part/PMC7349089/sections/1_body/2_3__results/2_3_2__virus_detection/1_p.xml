<p>Collected mosquito specimens were screened as 1520 pools on both mammalian (Vero) and mosquito (C6/36) cell lines. One flavivirus (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) and five orthobunyaviruses (family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>) were isolated from pools representing four different species of mosquitoes, using Vero cells (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00342-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). One of the positive orthobunyavirus samples came from a single male 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. mosquito. A further orthobunyavirus was isolated from a 
 <italic>Cx. vansomereni</italic> pool using C6/36 cells. All positive mosquito pools were captured in the central region of Kenya located near Nairobi. The flavivirus was from the same pool of 
 <italic>Cx. vansomereni</italic> mosquitoes from which an orthobunyavirus was detected. The pool size was 25 individual mosquitoes and we are unable to state whether this co-infected status came from the same mosquito.
