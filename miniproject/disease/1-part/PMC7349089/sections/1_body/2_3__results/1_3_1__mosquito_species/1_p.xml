<p>A total of 14,082 mosquitoes (11 genera and 47 species) were collected across 12 sylvatic sites in Kenya. Genera included 
 <italic>Aedeomyia</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Coquillettidia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic>, and several of the mosquito species collected are known vectors for arboviruses or for malaria, for example 
 <italic>Aedes mcintoshi</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mansonia africana</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-11-00342">Table S1</xref> indicates the species and numbers of all mosquitoes captured during the study. 
 <italic>Culex vansomereni</italic> (58%) represented the majority of sylvatic mosquitoes captured in total during the study, detected at all sites. Other predominant mosquito species varied according to site (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00342-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The commonest species collected at the coastal sites were 
 <italic>Cx. annulioris</italic> (Arabuko-Sokoke forest) and 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> (Shimba Hill Reserve). 
 <italic>Aedes chaussieri</italic> was also a dominant coastal site species, and one which was absent from collections from Western Kenya. In contrast, 
 <italic>Coquillettidia fuscopennata</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. annulioris</italic> were the second most prevalent species after 
 <italic>Cx. vansomereni</italic> captured at sites in Western Kenya. 
 <italic>Aedes cumminsi</italic> accounted for the majority of mosquitoes collected near Kitale, followed by 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>. Large captures of 
 <italic>Cx. vansomereni</italic> were made at Rift Valley sites, with 
 <italic>Cx. univittatus</italic> as the next populous species. At the forest site near Nairobi (Ololua), 
 <italic>Cx. vansomereni</italic> accounted for 88% of catches, and 
 <italic>Aedes tricholabis</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes dentatus</italic> were next prevalent. The species richness and species diversity (as calculated using Shannon indices) for each site are displayed in 
 <xref rid="insects-11-00342-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, with evenness illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00342-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The highest catch abundance was seen at the Nandi Forest site, near the village of Mwein, with nearly 5000 individuals captured, followed by Kimondi, also part of Nandi forest.
