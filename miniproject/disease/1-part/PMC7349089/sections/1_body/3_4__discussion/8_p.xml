<p>We focus on forested habitat, but ecosystems still vary considerably. Unequal sampling was accounted for, however some sites noticeably yielded smaller sample sizes, e.g., few mosquitoes were obtained from Shimba Hills Reserve (Kwale County), reflecting the hot dry ecosystem, with fewer areas of forest (a more savannah ecosystem), plus samples were taken from there in the dry season (as an aside to a primate study). In the coastal Malindi region of Kenya, Mwangangi et al. (2012) found

 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, 
 <italic>An. funestus</italic> and 
 <italic>An. coustani</italic>—were found in the ‘rural’ stratum, which was defined, however, as agricultural land rather than intact forest [
