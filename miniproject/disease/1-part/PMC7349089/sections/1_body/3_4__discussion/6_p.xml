<p>Mosquito studies of sylvatic habitats with potential for spillover under habitat disturbance elsewhere show a similar incidence of both disease vectors and lesser known species. In Senegal, tree-hole breeding species such as 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> (all associated with 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne viruses) predominated at forest sites [
 <xref rid="B48-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Mosquito community studies elsewhere have been used to suggest whether outbreaks of prominent arboviruses could be supported [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Knowing more about vectorial capacity, including vector competence, of sylvatic species in Kenya would suggest whether the elements exist to support enzootic outbreaks. Other arboviruses, although with little known about behavior or potential risk, have been detected from mosquito species captured during our study—for example, Kamese virus (family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>) was first detected from 
 <italic>Ae. annulioris</italic> in forests in Uganda [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Mosquito diversity in forests of West Africa has been demonstrated to include many 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp., including several detected with medically important arboviruses including CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although no vector evidence of CHIKV was detected here, we previously showed the virus to be circulating in the region via vertebrate–host studies [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Further mosquito studies, incorporating improved methodology to detect 
 <italic>Aedes stegomyia</italic> spp., are recommended.
