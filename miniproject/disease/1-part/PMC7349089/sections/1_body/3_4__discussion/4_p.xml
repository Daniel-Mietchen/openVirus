<p>Species richness of the sylvatic mosquito community in the Kenya region sampled is high; 47 different species were collected, illustrating the high diversity of sylvatic mosquitoes. Sites in Rift Valley were less diverse, and showed unequal evenness, i.e., that key species dominated, rather than an equal spread of species.</p>
