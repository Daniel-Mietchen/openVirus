<p>Between-site habitat differences, weather, and longer seasonal fluctuations can influence results. Although efforts were made to sample throughout the year, rainfall is higher during March–June and October–November. Several mosquitoes, especially those whose morphological quality deteriorated in large and wet overnight catches, could only be identified to genus level here, and so, although

The highest nightly catch abundances were made at sites in Western Kenya, which were mainly sampled during the month of March 2014. However, other sites sampled in that same month (including Ololua) did not reflect such high abundance. Nevertheless, seasonality is an important factor that should be acknowledged in the design of future studies, where the main objective is comparative abundance of these mosquito species. In Senegal, mosquito diversity was higher during months when more water in larval habitat was likely [
