<p>Host-switching of pathogens, from one vector species to another, or one host species to another, is a common event during long-term arbovirus evolution [

Taxonomic identification of sylvatic mosquitoes can be a challenging process since many entomological specialists are not as familiar with such species; however, continued monitoring of mosquito vectors is recommended, and not just around towns and villages where surveillance and urban transmission most commonly takes place. For example, supplementation of activities conducted by KEMRI or Ministries of Health to include regions where rural workers or tourists may come into contact with sylvatic cycles of disease pathogens may be useful to avert emergent outbreaks occurring via spillover.
