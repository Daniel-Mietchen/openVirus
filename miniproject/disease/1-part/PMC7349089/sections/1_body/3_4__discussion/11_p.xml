<p>Most arboviruses are zoonotic, and understanding sylvatic transmission of vector-borne pathogens is not complete without determination of the host reservoir involved in their enzootic maintenance. Studies of sylvatic vector species should be complemented by understanding of enzootic vertebrate host interactionâ€”for example, by mosquito blood-meal analysis, viral or serological surveys.</p>
