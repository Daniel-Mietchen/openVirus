<p>In Kenya, it is now difficult to locate primary (unaltered) tropical forest; Kakamega forest being the only existent remnant of the Guinea–Congolion rainforest belt that spanned equatorial Africa [
 <xref rid="B52-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and even then Kakamega forest is frequented by local villagers and popular for ecotourism. Braack et al. (2018) highlight that increased land transformation in Africa and disruption of historical ecological processes promote contact between humans and infected wildlife or sylvatic vectors [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A framework presented by Faust et al. (2018) suggests that the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rare, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion [
 <xref rid="B53-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Tropical forest habitat is generally reported as threatened due to encroachment for new land for agriculture and settlement and overharvesting of forest resources. In other countries, although undisturbed primary forest has peak mosquito diversity, disturbance has led to mosquito communities with a greater abundance of ‘pathogen-transmitting’ vector species [
 <xref rid="B54-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This highlights that it is the specific mosquito species that is present that matters, not the quantity or richness in general. Elsewhere, clearing patches of tropical forest often appears to create ideal habitat along forest edges for malaria mosquito vectors to breed, and deforestation is associated with increases in disease through ecological mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B56-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Indeed, Afrane et al. (2012) highlight how deforestation in the western Kenyan highlands is associated with increased development and survival of some
