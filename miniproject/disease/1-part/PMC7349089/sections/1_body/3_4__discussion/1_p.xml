<p>Since mosquito community composition plays a major role in the transmission of zoonotic vector-borne pathogens, it is important to consider the sylvatic mosquito species that may be encountered within forests. Changes are rapidly taking place in East African ecosystems, which leads to increased human–wildlife interaction—for example, use of agriculture space, forest resources (wood, hunting) and/or leisure (tourism), and encounters for spillover or spillback between sylvatic and urban–rural cycles of arboviral transmission are possible.</p>
