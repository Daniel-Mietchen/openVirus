<p>The concept of arboviruses being maintained in sylvatic cycles outside of periodic epidemic transmission affecting humans (for example, YFV maintained by 
 <italic>Hemagogus</italic> spp. or 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> spp. mosquitoes in a cycle independent from urban transmission), together with an outbreak of CHIKV in Kenya from an unknown enzootic source, prompted our investigations of mosquito diversity and the prevalence of arboviruses in sylvatic habitats. The rapid modification of sylvatic habitats, or increased contact with man, reinforces the importance of such a study; Weaver (2006), for example, highlights that many zoonotic arboviruses circulate in tropical forest habitats that are being disturbed for logging and agricultural operations [
