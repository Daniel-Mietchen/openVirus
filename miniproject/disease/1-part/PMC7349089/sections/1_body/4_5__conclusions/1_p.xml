<p>In summary, a wide diversity of mosquito species exists outside of urban or peridomestic settlements in East Africaâ€”many of which are known as competent disease vectors elsewhere. As humans encroach on forests and previously undisturbed sylvatic habitats, awareness of arthropod vector species and their pathogen transmission role is vital to limit the potential for disease outbreak. We demonstrate the high species diversity of mosquitoes across sylvatic Kenyan ecosystems, and encourage that their role in pathogen maintenance networks is investigated further. Recognizing the existence of sylvatic mechanisms of arbovirus proliferation is an essential component to One Health, with forest degradation, spillover and spillbacks between domesticated and wild species (arbitrated by non-urban arthropod vectors) relevant for both public, animal and wildlife health.</p>
