<p>Traps were set in the early afternoon and overnight on a transect at each site (traps were spaced over 200 m apart, usually at a height of 1.5 m, with some canopy trapping also conducted using BG or Light traps elevated on a rope pulley to approximately 20 m). Geographic coordinates for each collection point were recorded using a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) unit (Garmin International, Olathe, KS, USA) in WGS84 datum, and imported into ArcView GIS software (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Trap contents were retrieved at dawn. Captured mosquitoes were separated from other insects, stored at −80 °C and transported to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in Nairobi, where they were identified to species using a chill table and taxonomic keys [
