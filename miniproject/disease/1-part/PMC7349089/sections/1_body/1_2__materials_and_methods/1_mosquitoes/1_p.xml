<p>During 2013 and 2014, mosquitoes were collected at 12 forested or thicket sites in Western, Coastal or Central Kenya away from current human residences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00342-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Sites were chosen, at elevations below 2000 m (to make detection of mosquitoes more likely, since they are sensitive to cold temperatures), based on the presence of wild animals, in particularly NHPs (the suspected enzootic reservoir of CHIKV and ONNV), and a distance of over 2 km from human activity. They were also chosen according to available permits from Kenya Forestry Service, Kenya Wildlife Service, or local permissible access. Sampling effort varied at each site due to the objectives of a larger study seeking CHIKV isolates; results are therefore weighted accordingly. Mosquitoes were collected at the sites using a combination of trap types: BG Sentinel (baited with BG Lure), CDC light trap (baited with CO
 <sub>2</sub> from a dry-ice source), and CDC gravid traps (using fermented grass or mango leaf-infused water as bait), as well as resting boxes, and hand-held aspirators.
