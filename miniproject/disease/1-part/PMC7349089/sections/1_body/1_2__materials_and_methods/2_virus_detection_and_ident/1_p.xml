<p>Mosquito pools were initially examined using cell culture, since this is more efficient than going straight to molecular analysis when processing a large volume of mosquitoes for which viral prevalence rates are low. Pools were homogenized in 1 mL of Dulbecco’s Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum, fungicide and antibiotics added, then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 4 min. The resulting supernatant was removed and 50 μL was used to inoculate sub-confluent cell monolayers in 12-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY, USA). Negative (media-only) controls were included. The two cell lines used were Vero E6 (African Green Monkey kidney) and C6/36 (

 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were monitored for the development of cytopathic effects [CPE] for up to 12 days. Samples showing CPE were passaged twice in the same cell line for virus confirmation and amplification, prior to harvest and storage at −80 °C. Viruses were identified via RT-PCR following RNA extraction using a QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using generic primers specific for alphaviruses, orthobunyaviruses and flaviviruses (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00342-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Viral RNA from each genus group and water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis with 5X first strand buffer, dNTP (10 mM), DTT (100 mM), random hexamer, RNase inhibitor (40 U/μL), and reverse transcriptase. The cycling conditions were as follows: 70 °C for 10 min, 4 °C for 5 min, 25 °C for 15 min, 42 °C for 50 min, 70 °C for 15 min, and then held at 4 °C. RT-PCR amplification was performed on 2 μL of the resulting cDNA, in a 25 μL volume of Amptaq mastermix, primers and water. Further virus identification, beyond family, was not available due to limited resources for this project.
