<p>Species richness (S), the total number of species detected, was calculated for each site. Species diversity and evenness of mosquito abundance was calculated using Shannon’s 
 <italic>H,</italic> as used previously in [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Due to uneven sampling effort between sites, collections at each site were standardized using species accumulation curves based on the number of individuals caught. Validity of this method has been verified as a better weighting of effort to compare species communities than number of nights, and also avoids problems from differences in trap efficacy [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-11-00342" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A modification of a randomized species accumulation curve was made using Estimate S, as per Wilcott (1999), to provide a comparative estimate of the rarefied species richness that was independent of sample size [

Arboviral infection rate (MIR) in positive mosquito species was computed for cytopathic viruses using maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of pooled samples (infection rate per 1000 mosquitoes) as described by Eastwood et al. (2016), via Excel© Add-In software available at
