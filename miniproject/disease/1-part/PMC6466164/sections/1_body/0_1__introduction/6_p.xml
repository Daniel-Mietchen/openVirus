<p>Three strains of immunodeficient IL2rγnull mice, namely NOD Cg-PrkdcidII2rgtm1WjI (NSG), NOD Cg- PrkdcsidII2rγtm1Sug (NOG), and C;129S4-Rag2tm1FvII2rγtm1F1v (popularly denoted as BALB/c-Rag2null, IL2rγnull, or BRGS mice with the NOD SIRPa variant) [

NOG mice possess a truncated cytoplasmic domain of the gamma chain, but lack the signalling domain, while NSG and BRG mice completely lack the gamma chain. The biological responses of humanized IL2rγnull mice, when engrafted with human tissues, cells, and immune structures, recapitulate those observed in humans better than any previously known models of humanized mice [
