<p>Humanized mouse models are an advanced approach for evaluating the human immune response to viral pathogens, as well as to unravelling the pathogenic mechanisms of viral diseases. Severely immunodeficient mouse strains are engrafted with human cells and/or tissue xenografts to produce humanized mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00252-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The major breakthrough has been the discovery of mice with mutations in the gene coding for the protein kinase DNA-activated catalytic polypeptide mutation (Prkdc). These mice, called severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, allow the poor engraftment of human fetal tissues, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and haematopoetic stem cells (HSCs). Further, mice with mutations in the RAG- 1 or 2 genes (Rag1null or Rag2null, respectively) also have T and B cell deficiency. Backcrossing of mice with the Prkdc
 <sup>SCID</sup> mutation (CB17-Prkdc
 <sup>SCID</sup>) to mice on the NOD (non-obese diabetic) background resulted in NOD.CB17-Prkdc
 <sup>SCID</sup>/J mice, which allowed for the improved engraftment of HSCs, but they developed thymic lymphomas and had a short life span. The production of immunodeficient mice with mutations in the interleukin (IL) 2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2rγnull) allows for higher rates of the engraftment of HSCs due to the absence of natural killer (NK) cells [

When IL2rγnull mice were merged with Prkdcsid or SCID mice or with recombination of activating genes (Rag) 1 or 2 null mice (Rag1null or Rag2null), the resulting hybrids lacked adaptive immunity and expressed acute deficiencies of innate immunity, besides lacking murine natural killer (NK) cells and allowing for the engraftment of human cells at high levels [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Adopting this same approach, mice harbouring human hematopoietic cells, myoblasts, neurons, hepatocytes, and different kinds of epidermal derivatives have been raised. Invariably, these humanized mice are susceptible to a spectrum of viruses, and humanized mice can be used to investigate the diseases caused by these viruses (e.g., dengue and HIV-I in mice with a human immune system).
