 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] showed that SAMHD1 in the KO mouse model blocks retroviral infection and that endogenous mouse SAMHD1 restricts not only HIV-1, but also MLV reporter virus infection at the level of reverse transcription in primary myeloid cells. Intracellular dNTP levels and SAMHD1 phosphorylation in different T-cell types are the two most important factors affecting the antiviral activity of murine SAMHD1. They also reported that the antiviral restriction in a mouse by SAMHD1 is mechanically similar to that in humans in terms of dNTP hydrolase activity and cell-dependent phosphorylation. This study provided evidence that the SAMHD1 KO mouse is a valuable tool for studying the replication of different viruses, including retroviruses, retro elements, and DNA viruses [
