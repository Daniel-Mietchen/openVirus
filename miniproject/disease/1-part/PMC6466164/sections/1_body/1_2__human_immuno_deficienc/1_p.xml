<p>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infections of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2). HIV-1 is a major contributor to the global AIDS pandemic. More than 70 million individuals are living with HIV and 940,000 affected individuals died due to AIDS in 2017 [

The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is one of the most significant inventions in modern medicine, providing effective virus suppression and radically enhancing the quality of life and life span of HIV patients; however, the treatment needs to be continued for life. The major barriers posing a stumbling block to developing an effective vaccine and treatment methods are: (i) HIVâ€™s inherent ability to mutate frequently, specifically its external envelope glycoproteins, resulting in the escape of immune variants; (ii) persistence of HIV in resting cells, which leads to incomplete suppression; and (iii) HIV infection in humans induces immune suppression, resulting from the massive and continuous depletion of CD4+ T-cells. Notwithstanding these barriers, encouraging developments in an HIV vaccine have been made, and various promising numbers of vaccines are being developed. So far, animal models are the best approach we have to deciphering the mechanisms of pathogenesis, disease progression, latency, and emergence of drug resistance mutations. Moreover, animal models are important for testing the efficacy of vaccines and anti retroviral drugs [
