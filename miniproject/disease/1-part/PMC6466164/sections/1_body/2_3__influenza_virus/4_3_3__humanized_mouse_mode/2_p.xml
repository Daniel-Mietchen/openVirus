<p>Among the available vaccines, those that induce memory antibody responses with virus-neutralizing activity are considered the best vaccines against influenza virus infection. Due to the sequence variations in the envelope antigens HA and neuraminidase (NA), multiple subtypes of influenza A virus have evolved and complicated the effective vaccine development. Antigenic drift in the envelope proteins enables H1N1 influneza A and H3N1 influneza A viruses to escape from HA-binding antibodies. As a result, for adults who usually have exposure to seasonal influenza viruses, an annual single dose of the vaccine, boosting the humoral immune response, is sufficient. For emerging influenza viruses, a single dose of a vaccine is sufficient to induce protective immune responses due to the presence of cross-reactive pre-existing CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [

NOD, (DRAGA), which lack a murine immune system and express a functional human immune system, were used to develop cross-reactive human anti-influenza monoclonal antibodies (hu-mAb) to study influenza infection and investigate the efficacy of anti-influenza antibody-based therapeutics for human use. The hu mAB that targeted the HA protein of H1N1 was able to clear influenza infection in DRAGA mice [
