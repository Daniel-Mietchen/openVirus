<p>Humanized mice models permit the testing of novel therapeutic approaches to control influenza, the identification of critical epitopes for vaccine development, the preclinical analysis of the human immune response against influenza vaccines, and the evaluation of vaccine cytotoxicity. Direct manipulation or boosting of the host immune system is being considered as an alternative therapeutic strategy, which will help the individuals to protect themselves against influenza virus [
