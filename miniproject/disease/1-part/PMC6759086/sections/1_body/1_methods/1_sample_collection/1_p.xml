 </sup> (hereinafter called NCBI database) as of August 2018. In selecting the ZIKV sequences, all sequences reported from China and only these selected from Zika-endemic areas that are popular Chinese tourist or business destinations were considered. The country list with the number of passengers imported was obtained from China National Bureau of Statistics (

 </sup> Countries that belonged to Categories 1 and 2 were defined as ZIKV-popular areas, and the ZIKV strains from these countries were retrieved from the NCBI database. In addition, ZIKV strains in Brazil, USA, French Polynesia, and Yap Island where ZIKV outbreak has been reported, and those in Venezuela, Samoa, Suriname, and Guatemala where ZIKV in China are imported from, were also collected. ZIKV strains in Uganda, Senegal, and Nigeria were collected as African lineage representatives. Only full-length sequences were included for more informative molecular epidemiological analyses.

 </sup> For convenience of calculations, the number of ZIKV strains was stratify sampled according to the total number of strains in database. If the total number was less than 5, all strains were included; if the total number was between 5 and 10, 5 strains were included; if the total number of strains was between 10 and 20, half of strains were included; if the total number of strains were more than 20, 10 strains were included. The set of virus sequences included were isolated at different time points. The detail of sampling process can be found in Supplementary Data 1.
