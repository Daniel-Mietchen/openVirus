<p>The suitability of substitution models for our ZIKV alignment was assessed using jModelTest 2.1.10 (GitHub, USA),
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]
 </sup> which performed a statistical model selection procedure based on the Akaike information criterion. This identified the best fitting substitution model General Time Reversible with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites (GTR + Γ) for ML phylogenetic analysis. A ML phylogeny was estimated from this alignment using PhyML 3.0 (ATGC bioinformatics platform, France)
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]
 </sup> under a general time-reversible nucleotide substitution model, with a gamma-distributed among site rate variation (GTR + Γ), as determined by jModelTest2. Statistical support for nodes of the ML phylogeny was assessed using a bootstrap approach with 100 replicates. Support values for all nodes were embedded in the phylogenetic tree files.
