<p>To prevent potential bias during phylogenetic inference due to recombination, sequences of all 88 ZIKV genomes were first analyzed with Recombination Detection Program version 4 (RDP4 program)

 </sup> (University of Cape Town, South Africa) that incorporates seven methods: RDP, Gene Conversion, Chimaera, Maximum Chi-squared, Bootscan, Sister-Scanning, and three Sequences, to uncover evidence for recombination events. Only events with
