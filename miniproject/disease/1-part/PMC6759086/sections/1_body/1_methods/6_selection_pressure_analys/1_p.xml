<p>The selection pressures acting on the transmission of ZIKV was inferred by using Datamonkey web server (

 </sup> To test if positive selection has occurred on a proportion of branches, adaptive branch-site random effects likelihood (aBSREL) method

  <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]
 </sup> was used. In the scenario where all branches were tested, 
 <italic>P</italic> values at each branch were corrected for multiple testing by using the Holm-Bonferroni correction. Significance was assessed using the likelihood ratio test at a threshold of 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05. In addition, we estimated the dN and dS substitution rates on a per-codon site basis for each genome. Sites evolving under positive selection under a proportion of branches were detected by using the mixed effects model of evolution (MEME).

 </sup> Sites under positive selection in the entire phylogeny were detected by using single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC)

 </sup> and Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR)
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]
 </sup> methods. The significant level was set at 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 and posterior probabilities &gt;0.9 in FUBAR.
