<p>Temporal evolutionary signal in ML tree was evaluated by using TempEst v1.5.1 (Institute of Evolutionary Biology, USA),
 <sup>[

 </sup> which plots sample collection dates against root-to-tip genetic distances obtained from the ML phylogeny tree. A linear regression between sample collection dates and root-to-tip genetic distances obtained from the ML phylogeny indicated that the feasibility of a molecular clock approach. The plot indicated that the data set contained sufficient temporal signal for molecular clock analysis. Molecular clock phylogenies were estimated using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach implemented in BEAST v1.10.1 (Institute of Evolutionary Biology).

 </sup> We computed five independent runs of 100 million MCMC steps, sampling parameters, and trees every 10,000 steps. An uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model

 </sup> In a previous study, different substitution models produced similar results and divergence date estimates are robust among different combinations of prior distributions, molecular clock models, and coalescent models.

 </sup> was used to evaluate MCMC chain convergence and to compute marginal posterior distributions of parameters, after removal of 10% of the chain as burn-in. The program Logcombiner (Institute of Evolutionary Biology) was used to combine and sub-sample posterior tree distributions after a 10% burn-in. TreeAnnotator (Institute of Evolutionary Biology) was used to generate a summary maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree from the posterior distribution of trees (after removal of MCMC burn-in of 10%). The MCC phylogeny tree was drawn using Figtree (Institute of Evolutionary Biology).
