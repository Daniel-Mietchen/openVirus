<p>A total of 88 ZIKV sequences were included for analyses [see Supplementary Data S1, S2], including 18 from China and 70 from selected countries/regions. It should be mentioned that there are 27 sequences from China in the NCBI database, but nine of them were excluded after checked their sources and sequences from one identical case were removed. The remained 18 sequences are imported from Samoa (9), Venezuela (5), Cambodia (2), Guatemala (1), and Bangladesh (1). The distribution map of the included ZIKV sequences and the introduction path of ZIKV into China are shown in Figure
