<p>Evidence of episodic diversifying selection is detected in three out of all 165 branches in the phylogeny of 88 sequences of ZIKV genome (KU744693_CHINA_2016_02, KF383116_SENEGAL_1968_01, and KF383118_SENEGAL_2001_01) by aBSREL; however, no episodic diversifying selection is identified on internal nodes. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, there is evidence of episodic positive/diversifying selection at 17 sites as detected by MEME. However, no sites are detected by SLAC. One positively selected site (amino acid site 2449, posterior probability = 0.932, belong to polyprotein NS4B) is detected by FUBAR. The positive selection sites are distributed throughout polyprotein of ZIKV, but most of them located on non-structural proteins, especially on NS3 (5 sites), NS5 (4 sites), and NS4B (3 sites).
