<p>Genetic variation can provide important insights into ZIKV phylogeny and pathogeny. Amino acid substitutions in ZIKV cluster A and cluster B in China, Singapore cluster, French Polynesia cluster and Malaysia cluster were explored in the analyses. As seen in Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, there are eight amino acid sites varied between cluster A and cluster B in China, and they are located throughout ZIKV genome. It is also noted that half (4/8) of the different sites are located in NS5 protein. After compared the two structure models of NS5 protein predicted by Swiss-Model according to two sequences different between these four sites, the structures are similar (RMSD of all atoms = 1.13) [Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>]. In comparison with Singapore cluster, French Polynesia cluster, and Malaysia cluster, Samoa-origin cluster (B) in China is more variable than Venezuela-origin cluster (A).
