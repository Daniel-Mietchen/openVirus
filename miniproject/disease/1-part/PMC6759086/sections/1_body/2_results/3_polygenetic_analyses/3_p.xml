<p>The time of most recent common ancestors (TMRCA) of Venezuela-origin cluster (cluster A) in China dated to approximately 2013/11 (95% HPD 2013/06, 2014/03) and Samoa-origin cluster (cluster B) dated to 2014/08 (95% HPD 2014/02, 2015/01). This indicates that there were two independent introductions of ZIKV into China. More specifically, the Venezuela-origin cluster in China was likely transmitted from Brazil in 2013/03, and this is supported by the evidence in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> suggesting that the isolates in Venezuela were all from Brazil branch. The Samoa-origin cluster in China was introduced from French Polynesia in 2012/05, which appears to be parallel with the introduction of ZIKV in Brazil from French Polynesia. The TMRCA of Singapore clade was estimated in 2015/01 (95% HPD 2014/07, 2015/05), which is before the first ZIKV infection case reported in Singapore (2016/05). The divergence time of Singapore cluster (2011/01, 95% HPD 2009/05, 2012/07) is earlier than French Polynesia cluster (2012/12, 95% HPD 2012/06, 2013/05). ZIKV genomes sampled in Malaysia form a robust monophyletic cluster (PP = 1.0) and share a common ancestor with other ZIKV Asian strains that circulated in recent decades. The Malaysia cluster diverged at a much earlier stage (1957/10, 95% HPD 1949/01, 1964/02) of the Asian lineage.
