<p>The ML analysis of complete coding regions of the 88 sequences indicates distinct Asian and African lineages. African lineage consists of three independent clusters: Senegal, Uganda, and Nigeria. Asian lineage has caused all the recorded outbreak or endemic circulation of ZIKV in recent decades. All strains imported into China belong to the Asian lineage [Figure S1]. TempEst plot shows a positive correlation between genetic divergence and sampling time in all sequences (
