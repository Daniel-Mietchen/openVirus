<p>The evolutionary rate of ZIKV genomes is estimated to be 8.61 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD] interval 6.34 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>–1.11 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site per year) by using Bayesian molecular clock phylogenies. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, most of the ZIKV Asian lineage isolates that cause recent outbreaks since 2015 are originated from the French Polynesia outbreak lineage in 2013, except Singapore and Thailand. ZIKV isolates imported into China were assigned into two clusters, cluster A and cluster B (posteriori probability [PP] = 1.0). Cluster A is denoted as Venezuela-origin cluster since it consisted of strains all imported from Venezuela into Guangdong, China. Cluster B is denoted as Samoa-origin cluster as most of strains were imported from Samoa into Zhejiang or Guangdong, China, except for two, KY967711 and MF03611 that were imported from Cambodia to Beijing, China. There are three discrete ZIKV isolates that cannot be aggregated into clade: KU744693 from Venezuela to Jiangxi, China; MF593625 from Guatemala to Henan, China, and KY328290 from Bangladesh to Yunnan, China. ZIKV genomes from an outbreak in Singapore 2016 cluster within a distinct, well-supported clade, and are independent from French Polynesia and American strains. The timing of ZIKV introduction into Singapore seems to be parallel with the introduction of ZIKV into French Polynesia. Interestingly, the ZIKV isolates in Brazil and USA are interspersed among isolates from elsewhere in the Americas and do not form distinct clusters, likely implying multiple introductions of ZIKV into the Americas. ZIKV isolates in Venezuela, Suriname, and Guatemala was likely introduce from Brazil. On the other hand, ZIKV isolates in Southeast Asia countries, such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Philippines are not linked to the recent outbreaks in Brazil and USA after 2015. Malaysia clade was perhaps the oldest ZIKV Asian lineages and may be the ancestor of most Asian strains that have recently caused outbreaks.
