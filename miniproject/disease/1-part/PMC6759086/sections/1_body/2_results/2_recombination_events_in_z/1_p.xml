<p>The RDP analysis suggests four recombination events in ZIKV genomes, showed in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The recombinant strains are all from Senegal and the major parent strains are from Uganda and Senegal. The results suggest that ZIKV African lineage may have experienced several recombination events in the early stage of transmission. However, after it has spread out from Africa and come to form the Asian lineage, the recombination events rarely happen.
