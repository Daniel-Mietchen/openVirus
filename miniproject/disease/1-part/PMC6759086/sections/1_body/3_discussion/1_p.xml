 </sup> ZIKV has been imported into China since 2016; however, no comprehensive phylogenetic and genetic analyses have been performed based on all ZIKV sequences in China. Since the accuracy of molecular evolution of the virus significantly depends on genome sequences included in the study, we performed a scientific sampling method and suitable sampling size on ZIKV sequences to help fill the gap in understanding ZIKV transmissions in China.
