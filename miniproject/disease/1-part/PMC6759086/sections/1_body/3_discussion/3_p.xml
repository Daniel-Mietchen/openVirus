<p>ZIKV was first reported in Asia in Malaysia in 1966

 </sup> and it may be the ancestor of all ZIKV Asian strains. While ZIKV is widespread throughout Thailand, very few strains were reported. This may reflect the limited capacity of ZIKV detection in Thailand.

 </sup> The outbreak lineage in Singapore probably originated within Asia.

 </sup> It is consistent with our polygenetic analyses that outbreak in Singapore in 2016 is not linked to the South American epidemics. There are two divergent ZIKV strains in Singapore. The MF988734 isolate is a strain imported into Singapore from Cuba, and it is distinctly different from autochthonous strains circulating in Singapore.

 </sup> The KY241788 isolate is from the first confirmed case of ZIKV infection in Singapore in May 2016, who had traveled from Brazil. ZIKV in French Polynesia was introduced from Southeast Asia and then transmitted into South America causing pandemic spread of Zika disease. The strain that responsible for the epidemic of ZIKV in Yap Island in 2007 and the Cambodian cases were also most likely originated in Southeast Asia.

 </sup> Therefore, it is likely that ZIKV may have established latent circulation in Southeast Asia without causing any noticeable outbreak, while still remains as a potential source of strains that can cause outbreaks, which should be considered seriously.
