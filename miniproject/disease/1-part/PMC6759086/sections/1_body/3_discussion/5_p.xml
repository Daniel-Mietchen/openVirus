<p>Based on the polygenetic results in our study, we can conclude that the selection of sequences via scientific sampling in this study is a well representative of all ZIKV sequences. The computational redundancy can be lessened dramatically by scientifically sampling of sequences and without reducing accuracy. It is reasonable to included only one of these sequences isolated from one same case, although these samples were sequenced by different institutes using different methods, few differences were observed in the genomes.

 </sup> But there are spaces for improvements to this study in the future. On one hand, the number of sequences in some countries/regions is too little to draw any conclusions. For example, only one sequence was reported in each of the countries/regions, such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Micronesia and none was reported in India and Samoa. This may reflect differences in surveillance intensity among different countries. On the other hand, the genomes isolated in China used in this study were all retrieved from NCBI database; however, it may be better that all samples are re-collected and re-sequenced to provide more information and avoid possible confounding factors that may affect the results.
