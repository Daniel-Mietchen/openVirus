<p>Selection pressure analyses in all included ZIKV sequences shows that three positive selections have occurred on all branches, but no positive selection has been identified on internal nodes. However, this may be not interpreted as ZIKV strains experienced positive selection in the three branches. Because tip branches are measured over a short sampling period, therefore may include a higher proportion of mutations that have not yet been removed through purifying selection. MEME aims to detect the individual sites under episodic positive/diversifying selection. But SLAC and FUBAR were used to detect sites under pervasive positive selection. The different result between MEME and SLAC/FUBAR indicates that ZIKV genomes were undergone generally episodic positive selection but rarely pervasive positive selection. The result shows that ZIKV genome is generally conserved, which is in line with other study.

 </sup> Although there are eight amino acid substitutions in China cluster A and B, none of them were reported of significant biological influence. The amino acid substitution S109N, K709R, and N3144S were tested and showed non-significant enhance of ZIKV infection.

 </sup> M2634V substitution was reported of negligible contribution to ZIKV pathogenesis.
