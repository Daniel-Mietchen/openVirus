<p>Previous genetic studies have revealed that ZIKV has evolved into three distinct genotypes: West African (Nigerian cluster and Senegal cluster), East African (Uganda cluster), and Asian.

 </sup> However, Asian lineage is the only genotype known to cause ZIKV outbreaks, whereas no outbreak of African lineage isolates has been reported.

 </sup> While research efforts have mainly focused on ZIKV in Americas, little is known about the genetic relationships among ZIKV strains in Asia, although China and many Southeast Asian countries are in ideal climate conditions of tropical and sub-tropical weather and abundant in competent mosquito vectors for ZIKV transmission. China has experienced a series of imported cases since 2016. From February 2016 to May 2017, 29 ZIKV infection cases were imported into China.
