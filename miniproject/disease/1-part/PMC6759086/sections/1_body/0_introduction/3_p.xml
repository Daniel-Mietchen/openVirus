<p>Up to now, much remains unknown about ZIKV epidemiology and evolution, in part owing to a lack of genomic data. However, due to the recent epidemics and enabling technologies such as rapid and full-length sequencing, substantial amount of ZIKV genomes can be obtained in a short period of time. China still under high risk of importation and potential localization of ZIKV. So, here we give a detailed description of all the ZIKV isolates and illustrate their introduction path in China. A comprehensive phylogenetic and genetic analysis on isolates in China and surrounding areas was performed. By exploring phylogenetic relationships, selective pressure, and recombination events of ZIKV genomes, much valuable information can be provided for exploring the genetic evolution of ZIKV in China and assessing the risk of ZIKV transmission in the future.</p>
