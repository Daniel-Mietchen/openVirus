<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus in the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. While it is transmitted among humans mainly through mosquito-bites (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>), it can also be spread through maternal-fetal transmissions, blood transfusions, and sexual activities. In humans, although ZIKV infections typically cause mild and self-limiting febrile illness, it is established that it can also cause severe neurological complications (eg, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome) and adverse fetal outcomes (eg, microcephaly).
