<p>The newly identified tymovirus-like viruses comprised five major well-supported groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>), among which four groups were affiliated with known plant/fungus virus groups in the order 
 <italic>Tymovirales</italic>. A total of 17 novel strains were recognized as plant viruses. These viruses demonstrated a close relationship with the well-known plant-infecting species, either with a high percentage of identity (70% nt identity with 90% coverage, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set S1</xref>) or resolved into a single monophyletic clade in the phylogenies. In addition, novel members within the 
 <italic>Maculavirus</italic> were largely hosted by phytophagous or omnivorous insects, representing potential plant viruses (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Fourteen novel viruses formed a deeply divergent branch distantly related to 
 <italic>Deltaflexiviridae</italic> and were most frequently identified in insect order 
 <italic>Psocodea</italic> (11/14, 78.57%). A BLASTX search revealed that the conserved RdRp domain shared low (26.58% to 34.36%) amino acid similarity with the most closely related viral sequences. The topologies of the phylogenetic trees demonstrated that these viruses belonged to a novel taxonomic group associated with insects, though the host range should be reconfirmed with more data. Within other plant/fungus-associated clades, such as Virga, Solemo, Narna, Tombus, and Hepe-Beny, extremely diverse RNA virus communities were also discovered (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). In addition to the putative plant/fungus-infecting strains, most newly identified viruses formed genetically distinct evolutionary lineages, many of which are as yet unclassified. For example, the virgavirus/negevirus-like viruses represented a diverse group of viruses that were associated with insects and other invertebrate animals.
