<p>Twenty-five novel flavi-like viruses were identified, including nine in the newly described segmented

 <italic>Toxocara canis</italic> larva agent (TCLA). Notably, a novel jingmenvirus species was present in 
 <italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic> (cat flea), which might be implicated as a biological vector of Jingmenvirus, as previously described for blood-sucking ticks and mosquitoes (

 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Jingmenvirus</italic>. More viruses fell outside the Flavi-Jingmenvirus, Hepa-Pegivirus, and Pestivirus lineages. These viruses represented a highly divergent subset of unclassified viruses within the Flavi clade.
