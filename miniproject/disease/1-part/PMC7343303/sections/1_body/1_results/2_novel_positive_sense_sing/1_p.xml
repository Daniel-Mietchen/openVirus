<p>The picorna-like viruses were significantly overrepresented in insects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>), accounting for up to 31.08% (377/1,213) of the novel viruses, and were present in 33.73% (224/664) of the insect species. Novel picorna-like viruses were found to diversify into multiple different evolutionary lineages (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>), in which the insect-associated 
 <italic>Iflaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> were the most abundant (73.7% of all picorna-like viruses). The family 
 <italic>Secoviridae</italic> was the major group of plant picorna-like viruses (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>); which six novel strains were identified with 48.3% to 99.0% aa identity to the most closely related plant virus species. Of those, two close relatives of nepoviruses (93.7% nucleotide [nt] pairwise identity) were identified in a pollinating bee (
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Halictus quadricinctus</named-content>) and a predatory wasp (
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Crabro peltarius</named-content>), respectively, and higher viral relative abundance was identified in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Halictus quadricinctus</named-content> (0.17% total reads). It might be expected that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Halictus quadricinctus</named-content> acted as a transmission vector for nepoviruses. Other plant virus-like sequences were scattered throughout the trees, such as the strains closely related to the plant-infecting Tomato matilda virus (TmaV) within 
 <italic>Iflaviridae</italic>. In addition, some viruses were found to be evolutionarily related to vertebrate-associated species. For example, we observed a new picornavirus in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Diplonychus rusticus</named-content> that best matched Rhimavirus A (39.5% aa identity), a member of the proposed reptile- and amphibian-specific genus 
 <italic>Rafivirus</italic> within the 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Another virus that was found in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Hydrochara caraboides</named-content> appeared to be closely related to Ampivirus A1 (83.0% aa identity), previously identified in a smooth newt (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In the unclassified posavirus-like cluster, four novel members were found to be related to the isolates from humans, pigs, rats, and bats, though the identities of the natural hosts have not yet been clarified.
