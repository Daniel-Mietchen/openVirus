<p>Insect-specific evolutionary lineages were also found in vertebrate-associated virus clades, such as the Nido, Astro, and Hepe clades (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). Novel nidoviruses fell into two distinct insect-specific lineages, in which two strains belonged to the previously described 
 <italic>Mesoniviridae</italic>. Another nido-like virus formed a well-supported monophyletic group with Wuhan insect virus 19 and Wuhan nido-like virus 1, representing an unclassified taxonomic group within 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. One distant relative of astrovirus was discovered in a terrestrial insect, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Unaspis euonymi</named-content> (

 <italic>Diaspididae</italic>). The 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Unaspis euonymi</named-content> astro-like virus clustered with two invertebrate-associated astroviruses (host: 
 <italic>Myriapoda</italic> and 
 <italic>Hirudinea</italic>) and fell in a position basal to the astroviruses of vertebrate on the phylogeny, possibly representing ancient divergence of astroviruses from invertebrates. To our knowledge, the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Unaspis euonymi</named-content> astro-like virus was the first astrovirus species identified in insect. One novel bastrovirus strain was also identified in a filter-feeding insect, 
 <italic>Ephemera</italic> sp. 
 <italic>HW-2014</italic>, and shared a moderate level of sequence similarity with two strains isolated from bat and sewage (60.14% and 61.53% aa identity, respectively). Other +ssRNA viruses included nine permutotetraviruses and one levi-like RNA phage (
