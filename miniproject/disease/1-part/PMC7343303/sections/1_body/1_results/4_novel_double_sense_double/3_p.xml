<p>Thirty-three reo-like viruses were identified, among which 11 strains were novel members of genus 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic> and 13 were related to the plant-associated 
 <italic>Fijivirus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.Â S5</xref>). Other strains were affiliated with different evolutionary lineages of the genera 
 <italic>Coltivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Phytoreovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Oryzavirus</italic> and four unclassified groups. However, none of the novel reo-like viruses was found in the insect-specific genus 
 <italic>Cypovirus</italic>. Among them, two reo-like viruses were found to be identical to the previously reported strains isolated from 
 <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> and 
 <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, respectively (&gt;96% nt identity for all segments), implying wide distribution in the wild. However, most reo-like viruses were highly divergent from all known species; in particular, the multisegmented genome organization made them somewhat more variable.
