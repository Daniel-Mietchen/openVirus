<p>Three main virus groups within the Toti clade were found in insects (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.Â S5</xref>). These viruses showed limited sequence similarity with the recognized totiviruses. For example, 20 newly identified toti-like viruses clustered together with Hubei toti-like virus 22 and formed an apparently separate lineage distinct from those of fungus/protozoa giardiaviruses. Another group contained one plant virus strain, Persimmon latent virus, and could be regarded as a sister group to those noninsect viruses. However, novel viruses were occasionally found in the genera 
 <italic>Victorivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichomonasvirus</italic> and one unclassified taxon associated with protozoa. Other toti-like viruses included botybirna- and chryso-like viruses. The botybirnavirus was found in a predatory insect, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Grylloblatta bifratrilecta</named-content>, with 30.7% aa identity with the most closely related viruses. The chryso-like viruses were identified in a phytophagous insect, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Psyllopsis fraxinicola</named-content>, and a parasitic wasp, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eurytoma brunniventris</named-content>, with a typically four-segmented genome corresponding to those of members of the 
 <italic>Chrysoviridae</italic> family.
