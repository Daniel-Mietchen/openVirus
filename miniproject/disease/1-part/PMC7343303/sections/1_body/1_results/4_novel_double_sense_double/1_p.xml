<p>A genetically diverse population was found in clade Partiti with a broad host range, including novel members within 
 <italic>Partitiviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Amalgaviridae</italic>. More than 125 partitiviruses formed seven major groups, in which 31 novel strains were assigned to the recognized plant/fungus-infecting 
 <italic>Alphapartitivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betapartitivirus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.Â S5</xref>). However, few were identified in genera 
 <italic>Gammapartitivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryspovirus</italic>. Although a novel clade was identified adjacent to the 
 <italic>Deltapartitivirus</italic>, these viruses were distantly related to the phytopathogenic virus species and might represent an invertebrate-specific lineage. Another four groups cannot be classified into any recognized taxa; one of the group was associated with the plant-infecting Maize-associated partiti-like virus. Members of the family 
 <italic>Partitiviridae</italic> were believed to have two genomic segments. However, the capsid-encoded segment was rarely identified within these novel virus groups. It seemed that a much more diverse parititivirus community existed in insects, which might act as major reservoirs and/or transmission vectors for the parititivirus hosted by plants or fungi. In addition, three nonsegmented parititi-like viruses were found in omnivorous insects 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Thanasimus formicarius</named-content>, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Tetrodontophora bielanensis</named-content>, and 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Haliplus fluviatilis</named-content>. These novel viruses were phylogenetically related to the plant-infecting species within the 
 <italic>Amalgaviridae</italic> and shared similar genome organizations, with two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs).
