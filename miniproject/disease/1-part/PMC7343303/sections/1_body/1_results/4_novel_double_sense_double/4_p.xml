<p>One birnavirus was identified in a filter-feeding insect, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Isonychia kiangsinensis</named-content>. The genome of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Isonychia kiangsinensis</named-content> birna-like virus comprised two segments, of which the polymerase-encoded segment best matched the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> X virus (42.8% aa identity). The birnavirus was divided into three evolutionary lineages (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.Â S5</xref>); one was associated with vertebrate animals, and the other two were associated with invertebrate animals (mostly insects). Hence, a genetically diverse population of birnaviruses might be present in insects and other invertebrate animals.
