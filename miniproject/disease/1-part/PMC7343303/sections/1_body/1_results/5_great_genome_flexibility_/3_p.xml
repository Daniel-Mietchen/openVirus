<p>The viral genomic heterogeneity was also enriched through genome rearrangement and segmentation. In picorna-like viruses, one of the most remarkable genetic differences was the gene modules’ inversion of the structural and nonstructural protein coding regions among different evolutionary groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Within the family 
 <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Ellipsidion</italic> picorna-like virus 2 and related strains were discovered to undergo an event of genome rearrangement, which likely resulted in the formation of a novel evolutionary lineage descended from 
 <italic>Aparavirus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Similarly, the unsegmented mononega-like viruses were characterized by the presence of three hallmark genes encoding the nucleoprotein (N), glycoprotein (G), and large polymerase (L) and were distinguished by a pool of hypothetical proteins with no known orthologues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Nevertheless, the hallmark genes were not conserved in location in the corresponding genomes, characterized by an N-G-L module for 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> and a G-N-L or L-N-G module for 
 <italic>Jingchuvirales</italic>. Although most mononegaviruses were believed to have a monopartite genome, some chuviruses were characterized by a bi- or trisegmented genome, including a putative circular form (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Genome segmentation was also found in flavi- and solemo-like viruses. In most cases, the segmented viruses were quite distinct from the nonsegmented counterparts. Apart from the conserved NS5 and NS3 segments, the gene repertoires possessed by the segmented jingmenviruses are quite different from those of the related nonsegmented flavi-like viruses and formed a well-supported monophyletic group. A major phylogenetic discrepancy was also observed between segmented and nonsegmented solemo-like viruses, although the encoded viral proteins were similar. Alternatively, the genomes of insect-associated beny-like viruses were not segmented as seen with the recognized 
 <italic>Benyvirus</italic>. It seems that the segmented viruses might have originated from the primitive nonsegmented ones. The tight evolutionary link between segmented and nonsegmented viruses might represent the potential mechanisms that make possible the genome shuffling in some RNA viruses, such as the mononega- and picorna-like viruses.
