<p>Though the overall levels of sequence similarity were very low even within each virus clade, some genes were conserved among RNA viruses. The most ubiquitous and conserved motifs were associated with the viral polymerase (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig. S7a</xref>). In general, the key conserved residues arrange themselves in an orderly manner and maintain structural integrity in the RNA polymerase domain, with the exception of few viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig. S7b</xref>). Highly conserved motif C (GDD) appeared to be lost in the polymerase active sites of birnaviruses or to be translocated upstream of motifs A and B in permutotetraviruses and negeviruses (A→B→C to C→A→B). Consensus motifs were also discovered in some essential viral proteins, including the RNA helicase, protease, methyltransferase, and coat proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). These viral proteins represent the most highly conserved genome components in the majority of RNA viruses, although some of them are alternatively encoded by different viruses.
