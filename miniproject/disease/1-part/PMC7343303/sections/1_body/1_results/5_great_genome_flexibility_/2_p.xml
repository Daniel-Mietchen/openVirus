<p>Despite the subtle constraints imposed on RNA virus evolution, the insect viruses retained a substantial level of variability in genome size and architectures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">S6</xref>). The narnaviruses had the simplest genome organization of any RNA viruses, yielding to a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Nevertheless, an additional ORF was found in the complementary strand of the genome for some insect-derived narnaviruses, which encoded a hypothetical protein with unknown function or with no significant homology to known proteins. More differences were identified in virus genomes containing multiple ORFs for nonsegmented viruses or multiple-genome segments for segmented viruses. For example, the virga-like viruses encoded similar panels of nonstructural proteins, while the structural regions were very flexible and characterized by a complex genomic landscape (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), which might be associated with a considerable capacity to accommodate different environments and hosts. Within the toti-like viruses, three different genome structures were observed across different evolutionary lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), including a single large open reading frame (ORF) or discontinuous ORFs characterized by overlapping or being separated. The difference in gene arrangements might reflect an alternative utilization of translation initiation by toti-like and other related viruses, including ribosomal frameshift by those viruses with overlapped ORFs and termination-reinitiation mechanism by those with separated ORFs.
