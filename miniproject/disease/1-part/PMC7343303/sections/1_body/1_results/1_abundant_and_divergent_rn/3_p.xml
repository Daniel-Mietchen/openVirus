<p>The detailed evolutionary landscape was reevaluated by phylogenetic analyses based on all available RNA viruses by clade. As indicated, viruses identified in insects were distributed throughout different phylogenies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">S6</xref>), implying a broader host range and much-more-diverse RNA virus communities in insects. The observed categories of RNA viruses could be comparable to those of the whole invertebrates, although some taxonomic groups appeared to be more highly represented in insects, including the recognized insect-specific iflaviruses, dicistroviruses, bunyaviruses, rhabdoviruses, flaviviruses, and negeviruses. A growing number of novel RNA viruses formed apparent insect-specific lineages within many other clades, such as Hepe-Beny, Orthomyxo, Tombus, Toti, Tymo, Solemo, Narna, Virga, Nido and Partiti (for definitions of the abbreviations of the virus designation that appear here and throughout, see the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> legend). It should be noted that closely related species of plant viruses were frequently discovered in insects. These putative plant viruses might be transmitted by insect vectors and were most commonly found in clade Tymo, as well as some new members of
