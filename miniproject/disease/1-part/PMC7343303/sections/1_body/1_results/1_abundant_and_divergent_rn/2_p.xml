<p>The current official taxonomy could not recapitulate the extremely diverse RNA virus populations in insects accurately. Indeed, more than 40% of the novel viruses could not be precisely assigned to the current taxa or exhibited low confidence levels. Instead, we reclassified the RNA viruses into 26 clades as described for previous studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). These viral clades were abbreviated based on the representative members of each clade (e.g., “Picorna” is an abbreviation representing 
 <italic>Picornavirales</italic>, 
 <italic>Solinviviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>). Although these viruses were highly divergent, their taxonomic status could be deduced based on the panoramic phylogenies. Newly discovered viruses were assigned into 22 viral clades, of which 13 were relatively ubiquitous as they were observed in more than 10 insect orders (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set S1</xref>). The others, including one putative RNA phage within the Levi clade, appeared to be infrequent. A clearly separated group which cannot be confidently assigned to any currently recognized taxon was found on the phylogenies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The novel clade comprised 36 viruses that were mostly identified in insect orders 
 <italic>Psocodea</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) and 
 <italic>Hemiptera</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9). The closest relative of these viruses was 
 <italic>Agaricus bisporus virus 16</italic> (ABV16), a putative four-segmented virus found in mushroom (25.62% to 44.65% amino acid similarity for RdRp segment, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set S1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These viruses might represent a novel viral family or order.
