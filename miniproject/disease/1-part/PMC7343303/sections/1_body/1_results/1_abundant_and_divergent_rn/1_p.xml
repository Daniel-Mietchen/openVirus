<p>We performed the virus discovery analyses on a curated collection of RNA-Seq data available publicly in databases. The data set contained 664 species spanning 32 orders of insects (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set S1</xref> in the supplemental material). The assembled contigs were subjected to BLAST analyses against the reference viral databases. This resulted in ∼16,990 virus-associated contigs from 648 insect species, of which 89.35% were associated with two or more virus species (

To elucidate the evolutionary aspect of the newly identified viruses, we extracted the putative viral contigs that had significant matches to the highly conserved viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain and reconstructed the phylogenetic trees together with the recognized taxa of RNA viruses proposed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV [

A total of 1,213 contigs representing complete or partial viral genomes were recovered from the RNA-Seq data for 484 insect species (484/664, 72.89%) (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1a</xref> in the supplemental material; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set S1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these putative RNA viruses fell within or in close proximity to a wide range of recognized viral taxa, including 40 viral families and 2 unclassified genera, as well as newly described RNA virus groups, such as

 <italic>Chuviridae</italic> (

Nevertheless, BLAST analysis and pairwise comparisons revealed that the sequences of most of the newly identified RNA viruses were highly divergent from the previous reported viral sequences: almost 1,194 (91.01%) shared less than 70% amino acid (aa) identity with the most closely related viruses, while 471 (35.93%) shared less than 40% (
