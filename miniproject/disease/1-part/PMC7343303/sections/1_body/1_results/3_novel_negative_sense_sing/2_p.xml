<p>Sixty-nine bunya-like viruses were identified, of which most could be classified into three insect-specific groups, namely, 
 <italic>Goukovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Orthophasmavirus</italic>, and an unclassified sister group to 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.Â S4</xref>). Within the 
 <italic>Feravirus</italic>, two nearly identical strains (&gt;99% nt identity) were identified in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</named-content> and its parasitic counterpart 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Encarsia formosa</named-content>, respectively, providing evidence of its importance with respect to feeding behavior in virus transmission. A novel tenuivirus strain was identified in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Archaeopsylla erinacei</named-content> and was found to be closely related to the Rice stripe tenuivirus (53.8% aa identity). Another strain obtained from a phytophagous insect, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Larinus minutus</named-content>, was distantly related to the plant-infecting Citrus concave gum-associated virus. These bunya-like viruses, including the arena-like virus identified in 
 <italic>Heteropsilopus ingenuus</italic>, were assumed to be trisegmented, though the data have shown that some viral genomes lack one or two segments due to inadequate sequencing reads or extremely divergent features.
