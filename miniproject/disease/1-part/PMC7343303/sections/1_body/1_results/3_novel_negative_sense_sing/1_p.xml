<p>The mononega-like viruses were the most common −ssRNA viruses identified, presenting in more than 15% insects in this study. Altogether, newly identified mononega-like viruses diversified into nine major evolutionary groups, including six in 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>). We observed two clearly separate groups within the 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, of which one was related to plant-associated 
 <italic>Nucleorhabdovirus</italic> and the other belonged to vertebrate-associated 
 <italic>Almendravirus</italic>. It may be hypothesized that insect-associated rhabdoviruses arose independently. Other mononegaviruses included members within the 
 <italic>Lispiviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Xinmoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Artoviridae</italic> lineages and a Borna-like lineage. Thirty-five viruses were assigned to the newly established 
 <italic>Chuviridae</italic> lineage. These chuviruses were divided into three groups with huge differences in their genome architectures, indicating a possible relationship between the genome arrangement and diversity.
