<p>A remarkable diversity of orthomyxo-like viruses was revealed in insects (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>). These viruses formed multiple insect-specific lineages in 
 <italic>Quaranjavirus</italic>. In addition, two thogotovirus variants were present in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plea minutissima</named-content> and shared 51.64% amino acid sequence identity. Consistently, these viruses possessed five to six segments, although some genomic segments were missed and some might be redundant. Other −ssRNA viruses included six strains within the newly described bisegmented 
 <italic>Qinvirus</italic> and one within the plant-infecting 
 <italic>Ophiovirus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>). The aspi-like virus was identified in a phytophagous insect, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Panurgus dentipes</named-content>, and was assigned to a new species in 
 <italic>Ophiovirus</italic> with an unknown natural plant host.
