<p>RNA-Seq data were retrieved from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The entire data set comprised 665 sets of RNA-seq data released by projects “1K Insect Transcriptome Evolution” (1KITE [

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), “The evolution of Endopterygota” (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>) and other sequencing data for individual species (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data Set S1</xref> in the supplemental material). Each RNA-Seq data set was assembled 
 <italic>de novo</italic> using the Trinity program with default parameters. The resulting contigs were first subjected to BLASTX searches against a curated database of the publicly available reference viral proteins with an E value cutoff of 1E−5; the database included all recognized RNA virus species approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV [

The putative viral contigs were then compared to the entire nonredundant protein database (nr) of NCBI using BLASTX to remove false positives, using the same cutoff E value. Viral contigs with unassembled overlaps were merged using the Seqman program implemented in the Lasergene software package (DNAStar). Among the putative viral contigs, those with predicted amino acid sequence lengths of &gt;100 aa were retained in the following analysis. To facilitate the viral taxonomic classification, the putative viral contigs were also queried against a special database, with a small subset restricted to the conserved viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. To remove the false positives conferred by instrument carryover or cross-contamination, the initial reads in the sequencing library were mapped onto the viral contigs using Bowtie2 software with default parameters (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>); highly homologous virus sequences (≥95% nt identity) with extremely low (&lt;1%) mapping rates were considered to have been excluded in the subsequent analysis. Putative RNA viruses assigned a designation based on the corresponding hosts from which the virus-like sequences were identified and the virus categories to which they were assigned, followed by a numeral if two or more variants were identified within the same host.
