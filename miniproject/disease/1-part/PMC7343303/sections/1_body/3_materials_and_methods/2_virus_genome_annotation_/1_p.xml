<p>Contigs were annotated by the use of the RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) server (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>) and the online tool ORF Finder (

Conserved domains within the predicted encoded proteins were identified using CD-search against the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) at NCBI. Sequence logos were drawn using the ggseqlogo package in R (
