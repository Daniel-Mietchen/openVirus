<p>Global phylogeny analyses were performed along with analyses of the reference viral genomes proposed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). To fully characterize the individual viral clades, the predicted amino acid sequences were also queried against the nonredundant protein database (nr) at NCBI. Viral protein sequences with significant E values were retrieved and used for phylogenetic reconstruction. In order to reduce computation time, we used the CD-HIT tool (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) to reduce sequence redundancy while maintaining sufficient virus diversity. Sequences were aligned by the use of MAFFT v7.273 and the L-INS-i algorithm (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>) and were manually edited in Mega7 (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed with the best-fit substitution model implemented in IQ-TREE v1.6.5 (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Statistical robustness and reliability were assessed using the ultrafast bootstrap (Ufboot) method with 1,000 replicates and the SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) with 1,000 replicates. Finally, trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4.3 (available at
