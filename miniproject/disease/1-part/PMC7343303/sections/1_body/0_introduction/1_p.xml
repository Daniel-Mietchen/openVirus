<p>Viruses are ubiquitous on earth and are deemed to infect all known cellular organisms across the global ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Historically, virus identification has focused on specific organismal communities, such as humans and clinically and commercially associated animals and plants. However, these represent only a small proportion of the range of viral biodiversity in nature and, to a great extent, the data have led to biased inference in characterizing the evolutionary landscape of viruses. An enormous amount of viruses remains undiscovered using classical viral detection methods due to the inability to cultivate the vast majority of viruses

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Because of their extreme abundance and adaptability in diverse environments and habitats, animals have been implicated frequently in the evolution and spread of viruses. Recent studies have described abundant and diverse RNA viruses in animals, providing important insights about the host adaptation and distribution of viruses (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Still, the hidden diversity of RNA viruses within the ecologically and geographically diverse animal species remains to be explored.
