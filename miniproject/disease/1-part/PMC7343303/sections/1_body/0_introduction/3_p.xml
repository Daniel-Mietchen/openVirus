<p>Over time, ecological species identification has revealed large and diverse populations of insects, as well as of their parasites (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As obligate cellular parasites, viruses share intimate relationships with their hosts, raising issues concerning the genetic landscape and macroevolutionary patterns of the fast-evolving RNA viruses in insects. Previous studies focused on those insects with public health and economic importance or on those restricted to specific habitats, such as mosquitoes, honey bees, and flies (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Few studies have been performed on the insects as a whole. As a result of the deluge of omics studies, an unprecedented explosion in biological data (i.e., genomics and transcriptomics) is providing a particularly abundant resource for virus discovery (

Here, we conducted a systematic study to explore RNA viruses of more than 600 insect species by querying publicly available transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Our findings revealed the underlying RNA virus communities in a wide range of insects, representing a comprehensive study investigating the unexplored RNA viruses in insects, as well as their evolutionary and ecological implications.
