<p>Insects are arguably the most widespread and diverse group of animals on the planet, occupying different ecological niches and playing a dominant role in the functioning of ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Viral infections have been invoked as a significant threat to many ecologically and commercially important insects, with dramatic declines seen in the species richness and diversity in the agricultural and forest ecosystems (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). For the plant sap- and blood-sucking insects, the food and feeding habits make them hot spots for interspecies transmission and emergence of novel viruses (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These viruses are transmitted between their hosts by the insect vectors, causing no overt pathology during circulation in insect populations (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Though many more viruses have been persistently identified in insects, little is known about their ecological distribution and evolutionary dynamic in the wild.
