<p>Analyses of these novel viruses have enabled a comprehensive and integrative reconstruction of the evolutionary history of insect viruses. There appear to be three major scenarios: (i) virus-host codivergence, which is typically characterized by a ladder-like topology in the phylogenies, representing viruses gradually coevolving with their hosts; (ii) virus speciation, in which the viral population undergoes evolutionary branching, resulting in distinct taxonomic groups (it is likely that both internal factors [e.g., genome rearrangement and segmentation] and external factors [e.g., physiological and ecological discrepancies in hosts] play important roles in virus speciation); and (iii) viral spillover, in which the original or ancestral form of the virus can be native or alien to host insects. The former may originate from the pervasive insect-specific viruses (ISV), and virus infection may become established in a new host following their introduction (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Most of the insect-borne animal viruses, including some vertebrate-specific viruses, would likely fall into this category (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The prototype of the latter may be the invasive alien viruses introduced by the mechanics of feeding, as often employed in models of predation, herbivory, parasitism, and pollination. This is the choice for the spread of the majority of plant/fungus viruses (
