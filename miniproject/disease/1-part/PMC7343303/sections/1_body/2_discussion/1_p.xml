<p>We conducted a systematic investigation of the RNA viruses in insects, in which abundant and highly diversified RNA virus communities were identified. These RNA viruses were dispersed throughout the phylogenetic trees, and many clades were greatly expanded by the presence of the newly identified viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), yielding a considerable fraction within the virus biodiversity. In light of the huge insect populations on the planet, it is conceivable that the level of viral diversity in insects is unprecedented and that a large number of viruses still remain unexplored (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In general, insect-associated viruses exhibit paraphyletic relationships across the phylogenies of the major virus categories and have diversified into distinct taxonomic groups that comprise more than just several well-studied groups such as

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), and 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The virus communities possessed by insects appear to be much more genetically diverse than those possessed by other taxonomic kingdoms, including plants and the higher vertebrate animals (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In the absence of adaptive immunity, insects mainly rely on innate responses for pathogen recognition and clearance (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The lack of adaptive immunity increases the level of tolerance of invasive viruses, ensuring viral survival and accelerated adaptation to the host with little or no fitness cost in insects. Higher viral capacity without an adverse pathological response also results in the insects functioning as important incubators and reservoirs for diverse RNA virus populations, facilitating the emergence of coinfection, recombination, cross-species transmission, and novel viruses.
