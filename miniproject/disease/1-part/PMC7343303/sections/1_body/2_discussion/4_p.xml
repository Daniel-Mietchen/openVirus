<p>In the present study, we have revealed complex viral communities and high levels of multiple infections in insects which may lead to community interactions with important biological consequences. A number of studies have examined the positive/negative effect of insect-specific viruses (ISV) on arbovirus replication in mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). These results highlight the importance of the identification and characterization of the hidden virus communities in trying to understand insect-associated viral diseases. However, great caution must be taken when characterizing a novel virus and its host range. As expected, the endogenous virus elements (EVEs) derived from RNA viruses are usually recognized in the gene pool of an insect genome (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). We could not rule out the presence of EVEs in the present study, especially when the viral genome assembly is incomplete. The host distribution data could also be strongly influenced by unequal sample sizes. In our data set, fewer than 10 examples of RNA-Seq data were available for 20 insect orders, such as the fleas (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Here, extensive studies would provide more-detailed information about the evolution and ecology of virus infections in insects.
