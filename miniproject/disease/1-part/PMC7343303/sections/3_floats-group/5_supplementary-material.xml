 <p>Phylogenetic trees of major viral clades of the positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses (nonpicorna). Viruses identified in this study are labeled by filled circles. Host groups are indicated by different colors (see legend). Branch support values are shown at nodes (SH-aLRT support, &gt;70%; ultrafast bootstrap, &gt;90%). Genome organizations of the represented viruses are plotted and marked with star symbols in the phylogenies. The embedded colored boxes represent conserved protein domains identified by CD-search at NCBI and are denoted by the corresponding labels. Download
