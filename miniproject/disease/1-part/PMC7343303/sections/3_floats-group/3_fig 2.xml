  <p>Genetic diversity of RNA viruses in insects. The illustrated phylogenetic trees, which 19 major groups of RNA viruses, were inferred based on RdRp data using the maximum likelihood method and rerooted at midpoint. As indicated, a branch background in red shading represents viruses identified in this study, and a branch background in shading represents those described previously. Host groups are indicated by differently colored bars (see legend). Scale bars represent 0.5 amino acid substitutions per site. Detailed phylogenies are available in
