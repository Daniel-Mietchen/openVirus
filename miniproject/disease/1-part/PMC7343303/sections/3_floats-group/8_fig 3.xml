 <caption>
  <p>Genome architectures and comparison of representative viruses within major viral clades. The genomes are drawn as boxes and lines approximately to scale, representing open reading frames (ORFs) and noncoding regions, respectively. The predicted homologous genes are shown in colored boxes (see legend). The question marks (?) represent the missing genomic segments, and each asterisk (*) represents a novel hypothetical ORF on the minus strand of the virus genome.</p>
