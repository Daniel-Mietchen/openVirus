<p>In NC, the percentage of the population protected against arboviruses is unknown. Population immunity shapes the epidemiological profile of arbovirus circulation. Introduction of an arbovirus in an immunologically naïve population favours outbreak occurrence. Unlike that of ZIKV, however, the introduction of CHIKV did not lead to major outbreaks. DENV-1 has been circulating continuously since 2008; as the low net migration (22,500 new inhabitants between 2009 and 2014,
