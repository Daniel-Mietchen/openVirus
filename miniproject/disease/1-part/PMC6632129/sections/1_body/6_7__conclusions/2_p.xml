<p>Conclusions drawn from these observations may inform epidemiological risk assessments elsewhere—especially in non-endemic areas where the vector is present—and may be vital to guide surveillance and responses, both in New Caledonia and beyond. The World Mosquito Program will be implemented in Noumea in July 2019. The release of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-treated 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> will reshape the epidemiology of arbovirus circulation in NC. Understanding arbovirus epidemiology and its determinants before this implementation will provide a highly valuable baseline to document the effects of the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strategy.
