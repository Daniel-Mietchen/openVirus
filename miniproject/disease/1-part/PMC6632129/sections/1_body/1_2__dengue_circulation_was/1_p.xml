<p>Epidemiological data indicate that dengue virus (DENV) is the major arbovirus circulating in the Pacific region [
 <xref rid="B1-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over earlier decades, DENV circulation in NC displayed a 3–4 year cyclical pattern of occurrence, with two epidemic peaks occurring during two consecutive hot and rainy seasons. Few cases were detected, whether between outbreaks or during the cool season between epidemic peaks during epidemic years [
 <xref rid="B2-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since 2008 however, DENV circulation has increased in NC, causing recurrent outbreaks with cases detected every year. DENV caused three major outbreaks in NC in 2008–2009, 2012–2013 and 2016–2018, leading to 9589, 11,240, and 7266 reported cases, respectively (

DENV-1 circulated uninterruptedly during those periods, co-circulating with DENV-4 in 2009, DENV-3 in 2014, DENV-2 and -3 in 2017 and DENV-2 in 2018 (

 <xref rid="B2-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; this genotype replacement was followed by a large outbreak in 2012–2013. Further, the 2016–2018 dengue outbreak caused more clinically severe cases compared to previous years. Since 2012, we have observed major changes in the epidemiology of dengue, with uninterrupted DENV circulation causing cases detected every year and even during the cool season. Along with DENV circulation, Zika virus (ZIKV) was detected in NC in 2014, causing a significant outbreak of 1392 confirmed cases [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-04-00095-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Despite repeated introductions, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has not caused major outbreaks in NC, with less than 50 cases detected in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-04-00095-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). No signs of circulation of CHIKV or ZIKV were detected prior to these outbreaks.
