<p>The climate of NC can be described as tropical (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-04-00095-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) with a hot and rainy season (November to April) with mean monthly temperatures varying between 25–28 °C and mean monthly precipitation varying spatially between 3 to 6 mm/day, followed by a cooler and drier season (May to October) with monthly temperature between 22 and 25 °C and precipitation between 1 to 3 mm/day. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-04-00095-f001">Figure 1</xref>A shows precipitations and air temperatures. Precipitation data were generated from the CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) data available at

The monthly data initially covering 1979–2018 were used to calculate a monthly seasonal cycle of surface precipitation and temperature and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-04-00095-f001">Figure 1</xref> A represents the two seasons, summer (November to April, left) and winter (May to October, right) calculated from those climatology data. At the local scale, NC is a mountainous island also presenting specially contrasted temperature and precipitation between the central mountainous (coolest) areas and its coasts. The west coast is dryer and warmer than the east coast [
