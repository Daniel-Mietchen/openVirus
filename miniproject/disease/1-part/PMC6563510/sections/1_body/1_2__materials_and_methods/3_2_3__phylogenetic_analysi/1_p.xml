<p>A maximum likelihood tree including 83 HIV-1 reference sequences from the REGA tool and the 7000 NSW sequences was estimated using FastTreeMP v2.1.10 [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] via the CIPRES Science Gateway [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], implementing a GTR+Γ model of nucleotide substitution, and accounting for invariable sites, and NNI branch-swapping was implemented for topology search. Sequences forming a monophyletic CRF01_AE group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 758) were used for subsequent analyses. All HIV-1 sequences were retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV database (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/</uri>) and used for comparison. NSW protease and reverse transcriptase nucleotide sequences were blasted against the global database, and the best 50 hits for each NSW sequence were retrieved from the global database [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Accordingly, a total of 2807 global sequences were used as background sequence data; three HIV-1 subtype G sequences (accession numbers DQ168576 and EU786670) were added as an outgroup to root the phylogeny (

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The sequences from the Los Alamos HIV database, as well as the sequences obtained from the three reference laboratories in NSW differ slightly in their length and genome position. As a consequence, the alignment was reduced to the nucleotide positions 2253–3384, based on the reference sequence HXB2 (accession number K03455.1). The alignment was visually inspected in Geneious 11.1.3 (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.geneious.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.geneious.com</uri>), and sequences that were too short were removed as well as codons associated with drug resistance mutations (according to reference sequence HXB2; accession number K03455.1) [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The final alignment comprised 3510 sequences of 1132 nucleotides in length, of which 702 were from NSW. Next, the NSW CRF01_AE sequences were split into four groups according to sampling year, with two new years of sampling added successively: (i) 2004–2009 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 149), (ii) 2004–2011 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 262), (iii) 2004–2013 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 387), (iv) 2004–2015 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 542), and (v) 2004–2017 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 702), the latter representing the complete data set. A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was estimated, employing FastTreeMP for each sub-data set, and using the same background data as described above. An approximate Shimodaira-Hasegawa test was implemented in PhyML v3.1. to test for node support [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.3. The high sampling density in this study and in potential subsequent studies enables the identification of complete transmission networks which would compromise patient privacy. Thus, a random subset of 10% of sequence data (
 <italic>n</italic> = 70) from the 702 CRF01_AE samples used in this study are available via NCBI under the accession numbers MK941065-MK941134 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00482">Table S1</xref>).
