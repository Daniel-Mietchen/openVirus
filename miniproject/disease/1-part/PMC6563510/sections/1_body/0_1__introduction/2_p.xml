<p>HIV-1 circulates globally as different genetically defined subtypes, although the subtype prevalence varies across different countries; subtype C is most prevalent in Africa (and globally), the circulating recombinant form 01_AE (CRF01_AE) is most prevalent in Southeast Asia, and subtype B is most prevalent in the USA, Europe, and Australia [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is of current importance because the HIV-1 epidemic in Australia is experiencing a shift in subtype incidence with a major increase in non-B infections, as an estimated 20% of all new infections in Australia were of non-B origin in 2006, and that increased to 38% in 2016 [
