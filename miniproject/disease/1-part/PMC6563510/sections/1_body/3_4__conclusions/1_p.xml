<p>Our study has revealed the depth of active HIV-1 transmission for the CRF01_AE subtype in NSW, Australia. Importantly, the marked increase in CRF01_AE infections might be associated with an increase of small local transmission networks forming local sub-epidemics within the state. The slow growth in clade size and increase in clade number over time identified here highlights the likely effectiveness of interventions facilitating early diagnosis and contact-tracing.</p>
