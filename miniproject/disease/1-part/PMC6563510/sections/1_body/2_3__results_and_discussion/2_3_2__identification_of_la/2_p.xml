<p>We next mapped clade duration—that is, the time between the earliest and oldest sequences present in a clade—onto a time scale (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00482-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, while some small clades with two to four sequences were sampled within a short time frame, other small clades contain sequences sampled up to ten years apart. In fact, of the 100 clades identified, 51 spanned a time frame of three to 12 years, and 44 clades were sampled within one year. Thus, clade number and size appear to be growing over time.
