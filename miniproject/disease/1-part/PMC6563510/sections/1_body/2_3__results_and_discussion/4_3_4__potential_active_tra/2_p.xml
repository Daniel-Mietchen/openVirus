<p>Forty NSW-specific sequence pairs had a low genetic distance and high node support, indicative of a transmission network. Similarly, 13 networks with three sequences, four networks with five sequences, and one network with four, six, and eight sequences, respectively, were also identified. One of these has been active for at least six years, which is indicative of active clade growth, and which could be prevented by focused public health interventions. Notably, in one of the networks all three sequences share the drug resistance mutations K101E, Y181C and G190S, which can lead to reduced susceptibility to the non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug class [
