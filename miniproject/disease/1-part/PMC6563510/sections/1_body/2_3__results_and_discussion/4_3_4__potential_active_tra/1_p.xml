<p>Finally, potential direct transmission events were investigated by implementing a distance threshold of 1.5% and a node support of 99%. Sequences fulfilling these parameters form a transmission network, representing either direct virus transmission between individuals (i.e., a transmitter-recipient pair), or virus transmission to two recipients from the same transmitter. Sixteen singleton sequences had a high similarity to one or more of the global sequences, representing a potential transmitter-recipient pair between a sequence from overseas and a sequence sampled in NSW, although the directionality of transmission could not be established. In addition, four NSW-specific clades had a low genetic distance with one or more sequences from the global data set, indicating that transmission between sequences from different countries is not uncommon (
