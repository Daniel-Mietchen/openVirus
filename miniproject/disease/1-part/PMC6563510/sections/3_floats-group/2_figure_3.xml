  <p>Discontinued and active ongoing NSW-specific clades. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Clade size for different clades is shown across the five sub-data sets. Discontinued clades are shown in orange with time period for the most recent sequence sampled shown with a red circle, sustained ongoing clades in blue, all other clades in black. Clade size for the analyzed time frame is indicated in the legend. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The number of singleton sequences is shown for the five different sub-data sets (dark blue). For each sub-data set new sequences belonging to an existing clade (blue) from the previous sub-data set, and new sequences forming a new clade (grey), are also shown. The x-axis defines the sequence sampling date grouped into the two-year time periods investigated.
