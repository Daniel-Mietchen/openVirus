  <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmissible between AG6 mice and mosquitoes breeding in ZIKV urine. 
   <bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of the ZIKV transmission between AG6 mice and mosquitoes breeding in the ZIKV urine. The 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> pupae were breeding in the ZIKV urine (final ZIKV titer was 20 pfu/ml). The urine from human Donor 3 (Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) was used in these experiments. After rearing for 8 days after adults emerged, 20 emerged female mosquitoes were allowed to feed together on an AG6 mouse. The mouse viremia was determined over a time course. 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> ZIKV viremia in the mosquito-bitten AG6 mice. The 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Rockefeller strain was used in this experiment. 
   <bold>d</bold> Acquisition of ZIKV infection by a field 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Brazil Paraiba strain breeding in infectious human urine. With the same experimental procedure as Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, both ZIKV prevalence and infectivity were determined in the 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Brazil Paraiba strain breeding in human urine with a serial ZIKV titration. The emerging adults were reared for 8 days for subsequent ZIKV detection by TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR). The number of infected mosquitoes relative to the total number of mosquitoes is shown at the top of each column. One dot represents one mosquito. The percentages are represented as the ratios of mosquito infection.

   <bold>f</bold> ZIKV viremia in the AG6 mice bitten by the 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Brazil Paraiba mosquitoes breeding in human urine. 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold> The presence of ZIKV RNA copies in whole blood was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) detection. 
   <italic>n</italic> represents the mouse number used in the experiment. The results were pooled from three detection replicates. 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>f</bold> The numbers of infectious particles at the viremic peak were detected by a plaque assay. 
   <bold>c</bold>
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 detection replicates. 
   <bold>f</bold>
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 detection replicates. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
