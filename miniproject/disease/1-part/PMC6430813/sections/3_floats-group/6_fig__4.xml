  <p>Correlation between Zika virus (ZIKV) survivability and the pH value of human urine. 
   <bold>a</bold> Adjustment of pH value regulated ZIKV survivability in human urine. The pH values of human urine samples were adjusted by either NaOH or HCl. The pH value is showed at the top of each column. 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 biologically independent samples. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. 
   <bold>b</bold> ZIKV survivability in human urine correlates with the pH value of urine. One dot represents one human urine sample. Data were analyzed by linear regression with correlation coefficients (
   <italic>r</italic>) and significance (
   <italic>p</italic>). 
   <italic>n</italic> represents the number of human urine samples. The information for the urine samples is summarized in Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>. 
   <bold>c</bold> Determination of the correlation between ZIKV survivability and the pH value in human urine. The urine samples from Donor 3 with gradient pH values were incubated with ZIKV supernatant. The percentage of ZIKV survivability was defined as the ratio of the pfu value at 4 h incubation to the value at 0 h incubation. 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 biologically independent samples. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. 
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold> The urine samples were incubated with ZIKV supernatant from infected Vero cells (the initial titer was 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the ZIKV titer was measured by a plaque assay. Source data are provided as a Source Data file
