<p id="Par15">The stability of ZIKV varied dramatically in different human urine specimens (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). We next assessed key factor(s) that determine ZIKV stability in human urine. We noted that the pH values of human urine were correlated with ZIKV survivability; a neutral or slightly alkaline condition favored ZIKV survival (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Consistently, these ZIKV-hostile urine samples became favorable for ZIKV survival after their pH was adjusted to modest alkalinity with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In contrast, decreasing the urine pH destroyed ZIKV viability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Using a larger number of urine samples, we confirmed the correlation of ZIKV stability with pH values (

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Indeed, it is known that the flavivirus envelope (E) protein undergoes irreversible conformational changes at acidic pH values below 6.5, which occurs naturally during viral entry when the viral membrane fuses with the endolysosomal membrane

 </sup>. This structural change in the E protein may lead to complete loss of viral infectivity by disabling viral entry. Overall, the pH value of human urine determines ZIKV infectivity and likely subsequent transmissibility to mosquitoes.
