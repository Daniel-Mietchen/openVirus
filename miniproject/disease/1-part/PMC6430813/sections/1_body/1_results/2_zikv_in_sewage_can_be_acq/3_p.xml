<p id="Par14">We next assessed whether the mosquitoes breeding in infectious sewage could maintain the ZIKV transmission cycle between hosts and mosquitoes. The pupae of an 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Brazil Paraiba strain were reared in the sewage maintained with 1–2 pfu/ml ZIKV. Eight days after adults emerged, 30 female 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were allowed to feed on an AG6 mouse. Additionally, the infected mouse was fed on by naive 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes throughout the viremic stage. After 8 days, the fed mosquitoes were analyzed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Notably, 1 out of the 18 mice exposed to infected mosquitoes was ZIKV-positive by either RT-qPCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) or plaque assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>) after mosquito feeding. The infected mouse (
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>-BP-AG6-#26) died 11 days after mosquito feeding. Intriguingly, of the mosquitoes that fed on the mouse with viremia from days 3 to 5, 10–100% successfully acquired ZIKV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). Thus, we demonstrate that the field-derived 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from the ZIKV epidemic areas can acquire ZIKV infection during breeding in infectious sewage in natural settings and subsequently transmit the infection to hosts by biting.
