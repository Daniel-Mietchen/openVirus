<p id="Par13">In the scenario of urination by an infected individual, the infectious urine might be discharged into a septic tank approximately every 2–3 h because a person normally urinates 6–8 times per day. To closely simulate the natural urination scenario, we continuously added either 1/10 or 1/100 dilution of 20 pfu/ml ZIKV urine to the sewage sample (Sample #5) at 3 h intervals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). For continuous supplementation with a 1/10 dilution of 20 pfu/ml ZIKV urine, the viral titer was maintained at ~1–2 pfu/ml (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). However, the viral titer was not measurable by a plaque assay at a 1/100 dilution (the pfu was &lt;1). We then reared the pupae of a field-derived 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Brazil Paraiba strain in these aquatic conditions. The pupae emerged in the sewage successfully (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). The emerging adult mosquitoes were reared for 8 days before being subjected to ZIKV detection by RT-qPCR. Intriguingly, 1.9% (4/206) of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> adults, breeding in sewage with continuous supplementation of a 1/10 dilution of 20 pfu/ml ZIKV urine (maintenance of 1–2 pfu/ml ZIKV), showed ZIKV RNA positivity. Nonetheless, none of the mosquitoes were ZIKV-positive by quantitative PCR (qPCR) when breeding in a 1/100 ZIKV urine dilution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Consistently, 1 out of 78 mosquito pools (10 mosquitoes per pool) from the sewage with a 1/10 dilution of 20 pfu/ml ZIKV urine was positive for the isolation of infectious ZIKV in Vero cells (Table
