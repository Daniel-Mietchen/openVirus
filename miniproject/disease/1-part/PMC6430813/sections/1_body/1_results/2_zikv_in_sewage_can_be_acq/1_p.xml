 </sup>. Therefore, we propose that it is impractical to collect sewage samples from epidemic areas for the detection of infectious ZIKV. As an alternative, we collected 10 sewage samples from different cesspit locations. The characteristics of these sewage samples are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The pH values of these sewages ranged from 7.45 to 8.35; the chemical oxygen demand (COD) largely varied from 80 to 2300 mg/l; and the amount of ammonia nitrogen (NH
 <sub>3</sub>-N) ranged from 25 to 430 mg/l (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Subsequently, we tested the viral survivability in these sewage samples. The viral survivability in the samples was measured by a time-course plaque assay. With 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml of initial viral titer at 28 °C, one sample, with the highest amount of COD and NH
 <sub>3</sub>-N (Sample #10), had completely inactivated ZIKV at the first time point of detection (1 h), while the virus in the other samples partially survived until 1 h (Sample #9) or 8 h (Samples #7 and #8) post incubation. The virus survived up to 192 h in the rest of the samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Nonetheless, the previous literature indicates that the number of infectious ZIKV particles discharged in patient urine might be 10–20 pfu/ml

 </sup>. We therefore utilized 20 pfu/ml as the initial viral titer to further assess the ZIKV stability in these sewage samples. Consistently, the samples with high concentrations of COD and NH
 <sub>3</sub>-N (Samples #7, #8, #9, and #10) completely inactivated the viruses within 30 min post incubation, while ZIKV maintained its survivability for more than 3 h in Samples #1 to #5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). We propose that the COD and NH
 <sub>3</sub>-N concentrations in cesspit liquids may act as a key determinant for ZIKV survivability. These data indicate that ZIKV can survive in sewage under certain conditions. In the ZIKV epidemic area of America, the COD concentration of sewage varies from ~ 88 to 1323 mg/l, the pH ranges from 6.61 to 8.5, and the NH
 <sub>3</sub>-N ranges from 5 to 192 mg/l, according to the field surveillance literature (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We therefore used sewage Sample #5 (COD: 462 mg/l; NH
 <sub>3</sub>-N: 85 mg/l; pH: 7.62) to mimic the sewage of the epidemic regions for mosquito breeding.
