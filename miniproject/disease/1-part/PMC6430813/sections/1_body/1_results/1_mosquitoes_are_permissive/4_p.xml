<p id="Par9">We next assessed whether mosquitoes breeding in ZIKV urine could transmit ZIKV to a naive host. A mosquito-mouse-mosquito transmission model has previously been used for a ZIKV transmission study

 </sup>. We first reared the pupae of the 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Rockefeller strain in urine with 20 pfu/ml ZIKV. Eight days after the adults emerged, twenty female 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were allowed to feed on a type I/II interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient (
 <italic>ifnagr−/−</italic>) C57BL/6 (AG6) mouse, which is an established animal model for ZIKV infection

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Notably, 3 out of the 17 mice exposed to infected mosquitoes were ZIKV-positive by RT-qPCR detection at least one day post infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The infectious ZIKV particles were also detected at the viremic peak by a plaque assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). We next validated this phenomenon with a field-derived 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> strain, which was collected from the ZIKV epidemic area of Paraiba, Brazil. RT-qPCR revealed that 2.3% (6/258) and 1.6% (3/191) of emerged adult mosquitoes (Brazil Paraiba strain), which bred in either 20 or 2 pfu/ml ZIKV urine, respectively, were positive for ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Subsequently, the emerged female 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were fed on the AG6 mice with the same experimental procedure as used for the Rockefeller strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). One out of 14 mice exposed to infected mosquitoes developed robust viremia from 1 to 7 days post feeding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). This infected mouse died at 10 days post feeding, indicating efficient ZIKV transmission by the mosquitoes breeding in the ZIKV urine.
