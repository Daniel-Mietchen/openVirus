 </sup>, compared to that of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV). Therefore, we assessed the vector competence of different 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> strains after oral feeding on a serial titration of ZIKV (PRVABC59 strain). The mosquitoes were fed with human blood (50% v/v) and supernatants from ZIKV-infected Vero cells (50% v/v). The ZIKV load was determined from the midgut, the head, and the salivary glands over a time course. The infection, dissemination, and transmission ratios of these mosquitoes were subsequently calculated accordingly. Intriguingly, acquisition of human blood with 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml, but not 1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>–1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu/ml ZIKV, resulted in a robust infection and transmission by the 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Rockefeller stain, the 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> Jiangsu strain, and the 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Brazil strain (Supplementary Fig.
