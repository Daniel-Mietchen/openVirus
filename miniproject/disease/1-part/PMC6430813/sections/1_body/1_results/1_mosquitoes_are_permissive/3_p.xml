 </sup>. We next investigated whether the different mosquito species breeding in human urine with ZIKV might acquire an infection. In the first experiment, we incubated the pupae of either 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (Rockefeller strain) or 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> (Jiangsu strain) with the ZIKV-positive urine, in which the final ZIKV titers were 20, 2, and 0.2 pfu/ml (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The pupae of the two mosquito species emerged in human urine (Donor 3) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). The adult mosquitoes were reared for 8 days and subjected to ZIKV detection by RT-qPCR. For the 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Rockefeller strain, 3.7% (8/215) and 2.7% (4/147) of mosquitoes in the adult stage, breeding in 20 and 2 pfu/ml ZIKV urine, respectively, were positive for ZIKV by RT-qPCR detection. However, none of the mosquitoes (0/129) acquired the infection from human urine with 0.2 pfu/ml ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Additionally, 2.7% (6/223) and 0.7% (1/149) of adult 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes breeding in 20 and 2 pfu/ml ZIKV urine, respectively, showed positive detection of ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). We next tested the infectivity of ZIKV virions in mosquitoes breeding in ZIKV urine. In human urine with 20 pfu/ml ZIKV, 2 of 50 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> pools (10 mosquitoes per pool) and 1 of 93 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> pools were positive for infectious ZIKV, as determined by ZIKV culture in Vero cells. However, under similar experimental conditions with 2 pfu/ml ZIKV, 1 of 65 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> pools was positive for the infectious virions, while no infection was detected from a total of 100 pools of 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The infectious supernatant was further subjected to viral sequencing to confirm that the cytopathic effects were caused by ZIKV infection. Thus, we demonstrate that different 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species are susceptible to ZIKV infection when breeding in infectious aquatic systems.
