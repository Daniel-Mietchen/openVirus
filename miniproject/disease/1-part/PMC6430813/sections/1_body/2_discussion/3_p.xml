<p id="Par19">A common concept is that 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes mainly breed in clean water. However, accumulating evidence indicates that both 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> have evolved to oviposit and breed in wastewater with low oxygen and high turbidity. Notably, the population of adult 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes emerging from sewage may be equal to or even larger than those emerging from traditional breeding sites (clean water) in Brazil

 </sup>. Nonetheless, the epidemiological importance of cesspit breeding for ZIKV transmission remains unclear. Further field surveillance is therefore needed to investigate the breeding behavior of these 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. in cesspit conditions. In this study, we selected 28 °C as a temperature parameter in our laboratory setting to mimic the natural conditions. Indeed, the mosquitoes maintained in the laboratory were routinely reared at 28 °C as a standard condition

 </sup>. We noted that the temperature setting at 28 °C might represent a realistic daytime condition in the ZIKV epidemic area. Nonetheless, nighttime temperatures are also essential for mosquito breeding and are likely to be substantially lower. Therefore, both mosquito breeding and ZIKV stability under various temperature conditions remain to be further investigated.
