<p id="Par32">For viremia detection, blood samples from the tail veins of infected mice were collected in 0.4% sodium citrate and centrifuged for 5 min at 6000 ×

 </sup>. Briefly, the titrated plasma samples were added to 95–100% confluent Vero cells in 6-well plates, and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4 h. The wells were washed with PBS, and subsequently overlaid with 2.5 ml of DMEM-agarose. After 5–6 days, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet. The plaques were counted for viral particle calculation.
