 <sub>3</sub>-N were measured in the sewage samples. The COD value was detected by COD digestion vials (2125915-CN, HACH) and a portable spectrophotometer (DR1900, HACH). The NH
 <sub>3</sub>-N was measured with a Nitrogen-Ammonia reagent set (2606945-CN, HACH) and a portable spectrophotometer (DR1900, HACH). The pH value of sewage samples was measured using a basic pH meter (PB-10, Sartorius). The sewage characteristics are summarized in Supplementary TableÂ
