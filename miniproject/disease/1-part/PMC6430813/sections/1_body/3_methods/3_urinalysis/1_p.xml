<p id="Par23">The characterization of human urine samples, such as the specific gravity, clarity, and color, was measured by a Fully Automated Urinalysis System (AX-4030, ARKRAY). The pH value of human urine was measured using a basic pH meter (PB-10, Sartorius). The urinalysis results are summarized in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>. The mouse urine was discharged by abdominal pressing, collected by micropipette, and transferred to a 1.5 ml tube for further investigation. The pH value of mouse urine was measured by pH testing strips (90304, Macherey Nagel).
