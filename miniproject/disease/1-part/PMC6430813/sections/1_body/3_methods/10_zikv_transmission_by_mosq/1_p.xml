<p id="Par30">Pupae of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (Brazil Paraiba strain) bred in the sewage with continuous supplementation of ZIKV urine. Eight days after adult mosquitoes emerged, 30 emerged female mosquitoes were separated into a netting-covered container for blood feeding. The mosquitoes were starved for 24 h before blood engorgement. The 6–8-week-old AG6 mice were anesthetized and placed on the top of the containers. The mosquitoes were allowed to feed on the mice for 30 min in darkness. Blood samples were collected daily from the tail veins of AG6 mice, and the viral genome was quantified via TaqMan qPCR amplification of the ZIKV 
 <italic>E</italic> gene. The infectious ZIKV particles in plasma during the viremic period were determined by a plaque assay. Subsequently, the infected mice were fed on by naive 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> on the viremic day. The fed mosquitoes were reared for an additional 8 days for RT-qPCR viral detection.
