<p id="Par5">In this study, we demonstrate that both 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> are permissive to ZIKV infection when breeding in urine or sewage containing low concentrations of ZIKV. ZIKV viruria from infected AG6 mice leads to mosquito infection during breeding. Furthermore, female field 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> breeding in infectious sewage can transmit infectious Zika virions to naive AG6 mice, suggesting that ZIKV in contaminated aquatic environments is transmissible by mosquitoes during breeding.
