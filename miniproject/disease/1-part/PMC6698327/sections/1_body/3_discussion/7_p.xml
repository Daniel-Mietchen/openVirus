<p id="Par67">Our finding of lower risk of ARI among pig workers suggest that monitoring ARI in the general population would likely miss potential zoonotic events. Zoonotic influenza events are likely to first appear among those working or exposed to pigs or poultry, mostly young adults. With the reported levels of exposure to swine influenza among pigs in our study, including the pig workers in the influenza surveillance could enhance efforts to detect early zoonotic influenza events.</p>
