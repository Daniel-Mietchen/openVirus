<p>To identify the EV serotypes associated with aseptic meningitis, viral RNA was extracted from 140 μL of the cell culture EV-positive using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used as a template for cDNA construction using random primers (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Calrsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the primer pairs 224-011 and 008-011 (for entire VP1) in order to amplify the VP1 gene [

After 32 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 42 °C for 30 s, and 60 °C for 2 min) in a model 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), the PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose to identify samples with positive amplicons. Specific products were gel-purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and quantified with the Low DNA Mass Ladder (Invitrogen) in a 1% agarose gel. Cycle sequencing reactions were performed by using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) with 25 cycles of 96 °C for 25 s, 42 °C for 30 s, and 60 °C for 3 min. Products were precipitated and analyzed as previously described [
