<p>In Brazil, a limited number of investigations on EV that are associated with aseptic meningitis outbreaks have been reported, such as those related to E-30 and E-13 [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These studies were based on a description of outbreaks, which have occurred in specific places within the country. In a specific geographical area, some EV serotypes may be endemic, causing recurrent epidemics. However, the study of the different geographical areas of a country with a large territory, as is the case for Brazil, may be necessary to understand the distribution of EV serotypes causing aseptic meningitis besides their clinical features. The present work aimed to identify and characterize the EV associated with aseptic meningitis outbreaks or sporadic cases in different geographic areas of Brazil between 2013 and 2017 with an emphasis on their epidemiological and genetic characteristics. The analyses were performed in the context of nationwide surveillance of EV.
