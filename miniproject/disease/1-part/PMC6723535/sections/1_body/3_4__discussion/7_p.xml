<p>The typing of non-polio enteroviruses is conventionally dependent on virus isolation in cell culture. However, the major drawback is that enteroviruses are frequently not identified due to the fact that some of them replicate poorly in culture [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nowadays, cell culture isolation has been supplanted by qRT-PCR for routine detection of enterovirus infection. As related previously, we also observed that many clinical samples were negative in cell culture revealing a very low efficiency of isolation [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, other factors could explain the lower efficiency in the enterovirus isolation rate, such as prolonged storage of clinical specimens and delays in their transportation to the laboratory. In this study, we had 71 samples that generated CPE in the cell culture but had EV-negative results in the PCR assay. Other viruses, such as human herpes viruses (HHV 1-5) and arboviruses might be associated with these cases. Other studies are currently in progress in our laboratory to identify the causative agents.
