<p>According to previous studies, E-30 and E-6 were considered the major enteroviruses causing epidemics/sporadic cases of aseptic meningitis around of the world as well as a high prevalence of CV-B5 [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the present work, we found that E-30 was the main pathogen associated with aseptic meningitis (102/295; 34.6% of the EV-positive patients) followed by E-6 (95/295; 32.2% of the EV-positive patients) suggesting a high occurrence of these serotypes during 2014 to 2017. As shown, these two enteroviruses were commonly observed in co-circulation in aseptic meningitis cases, enabling the occurrence of the co-infection, which may have favored recombination events between both of the strains. In fact, a prior study demonstrated recombination events between E-30 to E-6 lineages in a co-circulation scenario [
