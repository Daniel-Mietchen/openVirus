<p>Regarding the seasonal distribution of the aseptic meningitis cases, some studies in temperate climates have shown that enterovirus infections are observed during the summer and autumn seasons, whereas in tropical areas, the infections occur throughout the year [

In this study, we observed that 45% (135/301) of the EV-positive cases occurred from September to November (spring season), although cases also occurred in other seasons. Conversely, other studies reported that aseptic meningitis cases in the southern hemisphere countries occurred more frequently during the summer season, such as Australia [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The discrepancy in this seasonal distribution could be due to whether the source of specimen is from a sporadic case or from an outbreak.
