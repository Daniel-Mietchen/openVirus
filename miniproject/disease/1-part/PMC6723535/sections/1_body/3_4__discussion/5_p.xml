<p>In this work, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that E-30 strains were grouped mainly into four clusters, where clusters 1 and 2 showed a close relationship with each other and with previously reported Brazilian sequences [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas the other clusters segregated with E-30 strains from Argentina and USA.
