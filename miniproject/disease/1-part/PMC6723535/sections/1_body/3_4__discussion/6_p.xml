<p>Information about E-6-causing aseptic meningitis in Brazil is scarce. Dos Santos et al. reported a low incidence of E-6 in aseptic meningitis outbreaks/sporadic cases in Brazil between 1998 and 2003 [

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In fact, we identified the increasing occurrence of E-6 in aseptic meningitis cases in Brazil. In the last years, the number of E-6 cases detected raised from 7 (2013) to 30 (2016), representing an almost 5-fold increase in the detection rate. Furthermore, E-6 was the main EV involved in aseptic meningitis cases identified across 2015 and 2016. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that E-6 converged in two highly related clusters with a close genetic relationship to each other and with E-6 strains identified from European patients. Our results have suggested that the Brazilian E-6 viruses were derivatives from the ones previously circulating in Europe.
