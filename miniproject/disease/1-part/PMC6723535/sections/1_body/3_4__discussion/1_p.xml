<p>Numerous studies about aseptic meningitis have been conducted over the last few years and non-polio enteroviruses have mostly been reported as an important pathogen causing many outbreaks [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the epidemiological and virological features of aseptic meningitis outbreaks/sporadic cases caused by EV from 2013 to 2017 in Brazil. Enteroviruses were isolated from 12% (303/2532) of the patients and the EV-B species were the most common EV among the pathogens identified (99.3%; 293/295), while no EV-C species were detected. More than 90% (283/303) of the EV-positive patients in this study were under fifteen years of age. Our results were very similar to studies performed in other countries [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00690" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Regarding the distribution of aseptic meningitis cases reported in different geographic areas of Brazil, we observed that the South region was responsible for more than 80% (2174/2659) of these cases. However, although aseptic meningitis is a notifiable disease in Brazil many regions do not refer CSF specimens to EV investigation, potentially underestimating the number of cases per region.
