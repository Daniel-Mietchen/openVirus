<p>The gender ratio (male/female) was 1.4:1, indicating a higher prevalence of aseptic meningitis in male children (

In general, the age distribution of aseptic meningitis cases ranged from 1 month to 92 years old (all patients) and 1 month to 38 years old (EV-positive patients). Most patients (69.2%, 1841/2659 for all patients and 94.7%, 287/303 for EV-positive patients) were children ≤15 years old (

Although the number of cases was distributed throughout the year, we verified an increase in the reported cases during the spring months, which corresponded to 35% (900/2580) of all cases with the onset and specimen collection reported.
