<p>Additionally, we evaluated the identities of E-30 and E-6 isolates with their prototype strains. As suggested, the cutoff value for unambiguous typing was 75% and 88% for nucleotide and amino acids identities, respectively. In this work, E-30 isolates revealed 80.4% to 83.2% and 91% to 93 % VP1 nucleotide (876nt) and amino acids (292 aa) identities and similarity, respectively. E6 isolates revealed 76.3% to 78.3% and 91% to 94.1% nucleotide and amino acids identities and similarity, respectively.</p>
