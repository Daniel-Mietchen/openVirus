  <p>Phylogenetic analysis based on E-30 and E-6 VP1 sequences (876 bp and 867 bp in length, respectively) of Brazilian isolates causing meningitis and other sequences available at the GenBank database. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood method of VP1 complete sequences. The B species is represented by the blue (E-30) and red (E-6) color. A species (outgroup) and prototypes are represented by black color. (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>) Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree based on the Bayesian analysis of the VP1 nucleotide sequences and their closely related sequences. The isolates of the same year are represented by a similar color. Branches are in time scale (year). Posterior probabilities are shown as a color scale.
