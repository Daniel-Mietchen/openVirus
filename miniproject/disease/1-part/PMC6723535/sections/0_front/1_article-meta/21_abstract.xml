 <p>Aseptic meningitis is a common viral infection associated with human enteroviruses. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize the enteroviruses associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases of aseptic meningitis that occurred in different regions of Brazil between 2013 and 2017. Cerebrospinal fluids obtained from patients admitted to public health facilities were analyzed. A total of 303 patients were positive for Human Enteroviruses (EV) by cell culture isolation with a median isolation rate throughout the year of 12%. We were able to identify enterovirus serotypes in 295 clinical specimens. Nineteen different serotypes were identified; the large majority corresponded to HEV-B species. Echovirus 30 (E-30) and Echovirus 6 (E-6) were the most prevalent genotypes (66.8%). Sequence analysis suggested that circulating E-30 was closely related to E-30 from other American countries; while E-6 was derived from Europe. Most of the patients consisted of children â‰¤ 15 years old. The temporal distribution of all aseptic meningitis and EV-positive cases showed an obvious seasonal pattern during autumn. Our results have provided valuable information about the enteroviral etiology of the aseptic meningitis cases in Brazil pointing to the importance of enterovirus surveillance in neurological diseases.</p>
