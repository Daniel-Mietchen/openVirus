<p>ELISpot is highly sensitive and allows for the enumeration of rare cells of interest—frequency, specificity, and antibody isotype can be determined. The major limitation is that it does not allow for isolation and downstream analysis—Functional properties of antibodies, such as neutralization cannot be assessed, and cells' BCRs of interest cannot be sequenced or cloned for mAb production.</p>
