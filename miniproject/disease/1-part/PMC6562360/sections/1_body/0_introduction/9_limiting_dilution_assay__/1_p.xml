<p>The LDA was first used to detect virus-specific MBCs in mice over 20 years ago (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This approach allows the frequency and specificity of rare antigen-specific MBCs in circulation to be enumerated. PBMCs or enriched B-cells are stimulated 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> with a mitogen cocktail along with non-proliferating feeder cells. With this approach MBCs become antigen-secreting cells. The cells can be enumerated by ELISpot (described later) or secreted antibodies assayed by antigen-specific ELISA. This approach has been used to determine the frequency of viral-specific MBCs in humans following vaccination or natural infection (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).
