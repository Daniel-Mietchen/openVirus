<p>MBCs can be identified by their B-cell receptor (BCR), a membrane bound immunoglobulin (Ig) identical to the antibody they secrete upon activation. Upon reinfection, the recall response is rapid, dominated by high affinity isotype switched antibodies, IgG, IgA, or IgE, depending on pathogen. This recall response leads to the generation of new antigen-specific LLPCs and MBCs (
