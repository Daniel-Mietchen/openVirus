<p>The second major limitation has been the challenge of making human, rather than mouse, derived hybridomas. Work by Wahala et al. (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) found that humans and mice recognize distinct and different epitopes on the DENV virion following immunization in mice or natural infection in humans. Nearly all neutralizing antibodies found in humans after natural infection recognize complex quaternary epitopes on the surface of whole virions (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), in contrast to the DENV neutralizing antibody response in mice, where the majority of neutralizing antibodies recognize a single domain region, domain III, on the envelope glycoprotein (
