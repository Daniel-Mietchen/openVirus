<p>Naïve B-cells, MBC precursors, originate in the bone marrow before migrating to the spleen where they undergo further differentiation, redistribute to lymph nodes, and await antigen encounter. Recent work in mice suggests that MBCs originate in low affinity germinal center compartments within peripheral lymph nodes (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), which might contribute to more broadly reactive Ig receptors and increase the breadth of recall responses (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). MBCs form a heterogeneous population, and it is thought that they preferentially differentiate upon reinfection. Specifically, IgG MBCs favor differentiating into plasmablasts whereas IgM MBCs preferentially re-enter germinal centers to undergo further rounds of affinity maturation (
