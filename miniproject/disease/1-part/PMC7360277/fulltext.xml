sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#x02013;infected patients are common, either at the time of HIV diagnosis or thereafter.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Individuals with active STIs are more susceptible to HIV infection, and in HIV-infected patients concurrent STIs increase viral concentrations of HIV in genital tracts, leading to an increased transmission potential.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Therefore, early diagnosis, effective treatment of STIs, and the reduction of risky behaviors are important strategies for preventing HIV transmission.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>Syphilis is a common STIs in HIV-infected patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The interaction between HIV and syphilis is important in both sentinel surveillance and clinical treatment of both infections.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Among men who have sex with men (MSM) population, HIV infection has been shown to be strongly associated with syphilis infections with a prevalence rate of as high as 20%.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the occurrence of syphilis in HIV-infected patients is an indication of behaviors increasing the likelihood of HIV transmission.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> A substantial number of HIV-infected individuals remain sexually active and acquire STIs.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Syphilis might be particularly important in the early stages of a localized HIV epidemic, when people with risky sexual behaviors are most likely to become infected.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In the real world, there were few men diagnosed with primary syphilis, suggestive of possible missed opportunities for early diagnosis and longer periods of infectiousness.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>HIV-infected patients with repeat syphilis might bear a disproportionate burden of both syphilis and HIV infection.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Because repeat syphilis can be an indicator of continued engagement in behaviors associated with acquisition and transmission of HIV and other STIs.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> HIV-infected patients with repeat syphilis should be prioritized for comprehensive interventions to prevent future syphilis and HIV infections and to mitigate the spread of both diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Targeted syphilis detection and treatment should have a central role in HIV prevention in these emerging epidemics.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>In parallel with treatment, the use of antiretroviral drugs as a prevention tool has been a focus from the beginning of the antiretroviral-therapy (ART) era.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> In theory, the widespread use of ART could lead to a reduction in the rate of HIV transmission in the entire population and contribute to the control of the HIV pandemic.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> It is controversial whether receiving ART influences syphilis incidence or whether immunologic improvement through ART is related to the incidence of syphilis in HIV-infected patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>As ART uptake among HIV-infected populations increases, monitoring population changes in syphilis epidemiology and identifying individuals most at risk will become increasingly important for informing effective and focused syphilis prevention. Our objectives are to investigate the dynamic of the syphilis epidemic among HIV-infected patients at the national level and to identify the risk factors associated with repeat syphilis.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Data source</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which has been established and collected data on all ambulatory care (including outpatient services) and inpatient medical claims from the enrollees since 1995. It covers 99% of medical utilization of 2.3 million people in Taiwan.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH No. B-BR-104&#x02013;117). The encrypted database in this analysis was obtained from the Taiwan NHIRD, which contained all HIV outpatient care claims in the patients with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code of 042 or V08, from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2010. A maximum of 3 leading diagnoses and procedures, details on a participant's date of medical visit, pharmacy refill record, antiretroviral drug code numbers and prescription dates, laboratory items, and basic socio-demographic information, including sex, date of birth, insurance area, and insurance monthly salary, can be obtained. However, the NHIRD database was limited by the nature of its retrospective design and data sources, and important clinical or laboratory parameters were not available, such as CD4 counts, HIV viral loads, or information on sexual behaviors.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Cohort of HIV-infected patients</title><p>From the NHIRD database, a total of 16,402 HIV-infected patients with a principal diagnosis of HIV infection (ICD-CM-9 code 042 or V08) visiting ambulatory care facilities were confirmed using code 91, which referred to HIV cases that were reported for reimbursement by the Taiwan Centre of Diseases Control (CDC). Tests of goodness-of-fit between our study HIV population and the annual syphilis incidence, we limited the analysis to 4907 patients with annual syphilis screen tests (ICD-CM-9 code, 12001C for rapid plasma regain, RPR; 12018C for Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay, TPHA) after HIV diagnosis. Subgroup analyses were performed for 1243 patients with a single syphilis test every year to evaluate the association between ART and repeat syphilis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The flow chart of the study cohort in the present study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-99-e21132-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Definition of study endpoints</title><p>Syphilis is a reportable illness in Taiwan health care system. A syphilis episode refers to a syphilis test in conjunction with ICD-CM-9 codes related to primary, secondary or latent syphilis (091&#x02013;097) treated by currently recommended antibiotics for syphilis, such as benzathine penicillin G, doxycycline, tetracycline, or ceftriaxone. The primary dependent variable is repeat syphilis, which is defined as the second episode of treated syphilis with at least 12 months apart from the first episode.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Only the episodes of syphilis after the diagnosis of HIV are counted.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Covariates</title><p>The information regarding the potential confounding factors was retrieved from the claim data, including age at HIV diagnosis, year of HIV diagnosis, sex, geographic area, monthly income, occupation, opioid dependence (ICD-CM-9: 3040, 3055, 3047), and history of sexual transmitted infections (STIs) (including syphilis, genital warts, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, or chlamydia infection) that was identified before HIV diagnosis, and frequency of syphilis screening test after HIV diagnosis. Their occupation was categorized as the group I (civil servants, teachers, employees of governmental or private business, professionals, or technicians), II (people without particular employers, self-employed, or seamen), III (farmers or fishermen), and IV (low-income families supported by social welfare or veterans).<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> The retention in HIV care was defined as having 2 or more outpatient visits separated by &#x02265; 90 days during a calendar year.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> According to each individual's pharmacy refill records, the receipt of ART was defined as exposure to ART before the first episode of syphilis after HIV diagnosis. The patterns of ART use were classified into 2 groups: adherence (&#x02265; 85%) and non-adherence.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Data analysis</title><p>In the study cohort, we categorized HIV-infected patients as 3 groups: no syphilis, single syphilis, and repeat syphilis. The ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was used for categorical variables and the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test for continuous variables. The annual syphilis incidence was calculated by the annual number of HIV-infected patients with syphilis as the numerator (inclusion of the episodes occurring at least 12 months apart) and the annual number of those with HIV infection as the denominator, over the 11-year study period. The annual incidence of repeat syphilis was derived from the annual number of the HIV-infected patients with repeat syphilis as the numerator. The Poisson regression model was used to test for the differences between the predicted and observed number of repeat syphilis, after adjusting for the variables significantly related to repeat syphilis after HIV diagnosis in the prior univariate analyses. In order to prevent the index event bias on the association between risk factors and recurrence of an event,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> we further limit our analyses to 1480 patients with syphilis to verify the association of ART and the risk of repeat syphilis.

A longitudinal research approach to the analysis of repeat syphilis would facilitate cross-study comparisons.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup></p><p>In contrast with increasing reported syphilis incidence from 1998 to 2008 in Arizona among HIV-infection by Skinner and colleagues (2014),<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> our study found the syphilis incidence decreased significantly in HIV-infected persons with time since HIV diagnosis, particular after the first year it has a sharp decline. We suppose it might be related to recommendations given by the Taiwan Center of Disease Control, which suggests that all patients with STIs should undergo HIV screening. This could result in syphilis patients being identified with co-occurring diagnoses of HIV.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> After 1 year of HIV diagnosis, the incidence of syphilis remained low and decreased slightly. This may be attributable to the implementation of case management program,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> the case management approach to retain patients in HIV care, and counsel provided to patients on safe sex practices.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> However, we found that the trends of repeat syphilis increased with the length of HIV diagnosis. In addition to the increased trend, recurrent syphilis infections occurred to 10.7% of HIV-infected persons. That is, there is a certain proportion of HIV patients who repeatedly acquired syphilis infections, particularly in those with characteristics of being a younger male adult, residing in an urban city, being less likely to have a particular job, and having past STIs. This finding was consistent with a large epidemiology study, which showed that a total of 13.6% of adolescents and adults in Campinas presented more than 1 syphilis infection.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Our study suggests that health care providers could play important roles in consultation and education to keep patients with specific demographics in the health care system to decrease the risk of syphilis occurrence.</p><p>Treatment as prevention has been a focus of HIV prevention.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> The clinical role of ART on prevention of STIs other than HIV infection is pondered. Although ART has been associated with a lower incidence of STIs, including syphilis,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> the association between ART and repeat syphilis in HIV-infected patients remained controversial.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Our national data demonstrated that retention in HIV care with ART adherence rate of &#x02265; 85% were associated with a lower risk of repeat syphilis. The immunorestoration resulting from ART could lead to a decreased biological susceptibility to syphilis acquisition or transmission.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> An alternate behavioral hypothesis for the impact of ART on syphilis incidence is that individuals with ART are a population that is more likely to adhere to medical and behavior modification advices, and less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Moreover, ART could reduce the serological failure rate<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and the time to achieve serological responses to syphilis treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> In Taiwan, HIV-infected patients could easily access to free ART since 1997, and since 2007 a national integrated case management program was launched to reduce risky behaviors in AIDS referral hospitals.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Other than antiviral agents, integration of program of assessment of ART adherence, health education and counseling of STIs prevention were provided by clinician and HIV case manager is important strategy for control of syphilis.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Previous studies have demonstrated that risky behaviors among HIV-infected patients will decrease when linked to and retained in primary care<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> and with clinician-delivered intervention.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p><p>It is not surprising that the history of STIs and frequent syphilis screen tests are associated with repeat syphilis. The CDC guidelines advise at least annual routine syphilis testing for sexually active HIV-infected persons<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> because the incidence of asymptomatic syphilis, which can be detected only through routine serology testing, is high.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> A repeated history of STIs after the diagnosis of HIV infection was an independent predictor for active STIs.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> These findings demonstrate that STIs frequently occurred even in patients aware of their HIV-infected status<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> and highlight the need to continue behavioral interventions and periodic screenings for new STIs among HIV-infected individuals with STIs.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> Because HIV-infected patients are more likely to be retained in medical care than HIV-negative persons, the former might be more likely to be screened for syphilis, which increases the chance of identifying repeat syphilis.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Our results also underscore the importance of current recommendations for routine and frequent syphilis screen tests in sexually active HIV-infected patients, particularly if they ever had syphilis.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup></p><p>With the structural nature of the NHIRD, the present work had some study limitations. First, the diagnosis of syphilis was based on the case registry. However, to avoid the inaccuracies of administrative coding of clinical diagnosis, only the episodes with corresponding antimicrobial therapy were included. Second, the syphilis episodes were based on clinical diagnosis. HIV-infected patients may have more episodes of asymptomatic syphilis, if the frequency of syphilis tests increased, and it is likely that our data represent an underestimation of the syphilis incidence in the risky cohort. Finally, the study was limited by the administrative nature of the database and the absence of numeric data of laboratory tests (such as CD4 counts and viral load) and the details of sexual behaviors. The interaction of immunosuppression or viral suppression and the incidence of repeat syphilis cannot be evaluated.</p><p>In conclusion, in this population-based study using national data, the incidence of repeat syphilis among HIV-infected individuals increased during 11 years of follow-up. Routine screening for syphilis for early diagnosis and retention in HIV care with adherence to ART should be encouraged to minimize the risk of repeat syphilis in the targeted population.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank all of the authors that participated in the conception of the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Y.C.C., N.Y.L., W.C.K., and N.Y.K. participated in the study design.
