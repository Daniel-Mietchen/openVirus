<p>Among 4907 HIV-infected patients with annual syphilis tests, 956 (19.5%) had a single episode of syphilis, and 524 (10.7%) repeat syphilis. The lapse between the time of HIV diagnosis and the first episode of syphilis was 5.3 months (range: 0–125.5 months) and 24.8 months (range: 12.0–116.2 months) between the first and second episode of syphilis. Those with repeat syphilis were more likely to be younger (&lt;35 years: 76.5% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 53.9%), male (99.6% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 91.0%), diagnosed with HIV infection in the 2000–2003 year period (35.3% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 5.5%), residence in urbanized cities (Taipei area: 48.7% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 27.8%), and paid by a high monthly salary (17.0% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 8.9%) than those without syphilis. Moreover, they were less likely to be opioid-dependent (0.2% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 16.5%), receiving ART (40.1% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 60.0%), or adherence to ART (24.2% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 42.7%), but were more likely to have a history of STIs (25.0% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 15.9%), to be retained in HIV care (57.1% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 45.9%), or to receive syphilis screening tests (mean: 12.8 
 <italic>vs</italic> 5.2 times), as shown in Table
