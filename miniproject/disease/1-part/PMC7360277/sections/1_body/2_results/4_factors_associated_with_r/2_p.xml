<p>In the multiple Poisson regression analysis, model 1 showed that the following characteristics were associated with repeat syphilis: younger age at time of HIV diagnosis (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.43; 95% CI 1.11–1.86), male gender (aIRR 11.14, 95% CI 4.16–29.79), HIV infection diagnosed between 2004 and 2006 (aIRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11–1.53), residence in Taipei area (aIRR 2.30, 95% CI 1.87–2.83), a history of STIs (aIRR 1.39, 95% CI 1.21–1.59), more syphilis screen tests (aIRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07–1.10), individuals without particular employers, self-employed, or seamen (occupation II) (aIRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47–0.80), non-opioid dependence (aIRR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00–0.04), and receipt of ART (aIRR 0.30, 95% CI 0.27–0.34) (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We further examined the effects of adherence to ART on the risk of repeat syphilis. Of the patients with ART, model 2 showed that an adherence rate ≥85% was associated with a lower risk of repeat syphilis after adjusting for confounding variables (aIRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61–0.98;

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Model 3 limited the analysis for 1480 patients ever having syphilis to avoid the index event bias. Patients with receipt of ART were associated with reduce the risk of repeat syphilis after controlling for confounding variables (aIRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79–0.95; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .002) (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We further adjusted the frequencies of syphilis testing on the diagnosis of repeat syphilis. In the subgroup analysis of 1243 HIV-infected patients with annual single syphilis testing, the Kaplan–Meier method showed that those with ART had a lower risk of repeat syphilis (hazard ratio, 0.14; 95% CI 0.03–0.62, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .01) (Fig.
