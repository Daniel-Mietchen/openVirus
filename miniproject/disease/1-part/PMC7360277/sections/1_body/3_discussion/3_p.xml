<p>In contrast with increasing reported syphilis incidence from 1998 to 2008 in Arizona among HIV-infection by Skinner and colleagues (2014),

 </sup> our study found the syphilis incidence decreased significantly in HIV-infected persons with time since HIV diagnosis, particular after the first year it has a sharp decline. We suppose it might be related to recommendations given by the Taiwan Center of Disease Control, which suggests that all patients with STIs should undergo HIV screening. This could result in syphilis patients being identified with co-occurring diagnoses of HIV.

 </sup> After 1 year of HIV diagnosis, the incidence of syphilis remained low and decreased slightly. This may be attributable to the implementation of case management program,

 </sup> the case management approach to retain patients in HIV care, and counsel provided to patients on safe sex practices.

 </sup> However, we found that the trends of repeat syphilis increased with the length of HIV diagnosis. In addition to the increased trend, recurrent syphilis infections occurred to 10.7% of HIV-infected persons. That is, there is a certain proportion of HIV patients who repeatedly acquired syphilis infections, particularly in those with characteristics of being a younger male adult, residing in an urban city, being less likely to have a particular job, and having past STIs. This finding was consistent with a large epidemiology study, which showed that a total of 13.6% of adolescents and adults in Campinas presented more than 1 syphilis infection.

 </sup> Our study suggests that health care providers could play important roles in consultation and education to keep patients with specific demographics in the health care system to decrease the risk of syphilis occurrence.
