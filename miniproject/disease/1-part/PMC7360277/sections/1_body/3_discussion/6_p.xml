<p>With the structural nature of the NHIRD, the present work had some study limitations. First, the diagnosis of syphilis was based on the case registry. However, to avoid the inaccuracies of administrative coding of clinical diagnosis, only the episodes with corresponding antimicrobial therapy were included. Second, the syphilis episodes were based on clinical diagnosis. HIV-infected patients may have more episodes of asymptomatic syphilis, if the frequency of syphilis tests increased, and it is likely that our data represent an underestimation of the syphilis incidence in the risky cohort. Finally, the study was limited by the administrative nature of the database and the absence of numeric data of laboratory tests (such as CD4 counts and viral load) and the details of sexual behaviors. The interaction of immunosuppression or viral suppression and the incidence of repeat syphilis cannot be evaluated.</p>
