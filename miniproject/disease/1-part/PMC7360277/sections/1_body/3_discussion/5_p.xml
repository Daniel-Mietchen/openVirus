<p>It is not surprising that the history of STIs and frequent syphilis screen tests are associated with repeat syphilis. The CDC guidelines advise at least annual routine syphilis testing for sexually active HIV-infected persons

 </sup> A repeated history of STIs after the diagnosis of HIV infection was an independent predictor for active STIs.

 </sup> These findings demonstrate that STIs frequently occurred even in patients aware of their HIV-infected status

 </sup> Because HIV-infected patients are more likely to be retained in medical care than HIV-negative persons, the former might be more likely to be screened for syphilis, which increases the chance of identifying repeat syphilis.

 </sup> Our results also underscore the importance of current recommendations for routine and frequent syphilis screen tests in sexually active HIV-infected patients, particularly if they ever had syphilis.
