 </sup> The clinical role of ART on prevention of STIs other than HIV infection is pondered. Although ART has been associated with a lower incidence of STIs, including syphilis,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]
 </sup> the association between ART and repeat syphilis in HIV-infected patients remained controversial.

 </sup> Our national data demonstrated that retention in HIV care with ART adherence rate of ≥ 85% were associated with a lower risk of repeat syphilis. The immunorestoration resulting from ART could lead to a decreased biological susceptibility to syphilis acquisition or transmission.

 </sup> An alternate behavioral hypothesis for the impact of ART on syphilis incidence is that individuals with ART are a population that is more likely to adhere to medical and behavior modification advices, and less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior.

 </sup> Moreover, ART could reduce the serological failure rate
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]
 </sup> and the time to achieve serological responses to syphilis treatment.

 </sup> In Taiwan, HIV-infected patients could easily access to free ART since 1997, and since 2007 a national integrated case management program was launched to reduce risky behaviors in AIDS referral hospitals.

 </sup> Other than antiviral agents, integration of program of assessment of ART adherence, health education and counseling of STIs prevention were provided by clinician and HIV case manager is important strategy for control of syphilis.

 </sup> Previous studies have demonstrated that risky behaviors among HIV-infected patients will decrease when linked to and retained in primary care
