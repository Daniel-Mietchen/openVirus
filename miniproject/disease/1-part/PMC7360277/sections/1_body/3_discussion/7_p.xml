<p>In conclusion, in this population-based study using national data, the incidence of repeat syphilis among HIV-infected individuals increased during 11 years of follow-up. Routine screening for syphilis for early diagnosis and retention in HIV care with adherence to ART should be encouraged to minimize the risk of repeat syphilis in the targeted population.</p>
