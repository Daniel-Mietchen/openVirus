<p>Our study showed that the syphilis incidence after diagnosis with HIV remained high, 30.2%, when compared with a previous report.

 </sup> Rather, the overall trend in repeat syphilis showed a significant increase across 11 years of observation, which is consistent with other reports of repeat syphilis.

 </sup> The major STI studied is syphilis, with a median prevalence of 9.5%.

 </sup> One long-term study reported a syphilis prevalence at the timing of HIV diagnosis of approximately 6% and a subsequent incidence of 1.3 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up.

 </sup> However, comparisons of repeat syphilis incidences across studies are problematic due to the heterogeneity in study population (all individuals or only MSM), case definition (early syphilis or only primary syphilis), and time frame for repeat infection (within 1 year, within 2 years, or ever). A longitudinal research approach to the analysis of repeat syphilis would facilitate cross-study comparisons.
