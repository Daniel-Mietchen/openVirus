<p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH No. B-BR-104â€“117). The encrypted database in this analysis was obtained from the Taiwan NHIRD, which contained all HIV outpatient care claims in the patients with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code of 042 or V08, from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2010. A maximum of 3 leading diagnoses and procedures, details on a participant's date of medical visit, pharmacy refill record, antiretroviral drug code numbers and prescription dates, laboratory items, and basic socio-demographic information, including sex, date of birth, insurance area, and insurance monthly salary, can be obtained. However, the NHIRD database was limited by the nature of its retrospective design and data sources, and important clinical or laboratory parameters were not available, such as CD4 counts, HIV viral loads, or information on sexual behaviors.</p>
