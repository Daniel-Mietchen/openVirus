<p>In the study cohort, we categorized HIV-infected patients as 3 groups: no syphilis, single syphilis, and repeat syphilis. The ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was used for categorical variables and the Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables. The annual syphilis incidence was calculated by the annual number of HIV-infected patients with syphilis as the numerator (inclusion of the episodes occurring at least 12 months apart) and the annual number of those with HIV infection as the denominator, over the 11-year study period. The annual incidence of repeat syphilis was derived from the annual number of the HIV-infected patients with repeat syphilis as the numerator. The Poisson regression model was used to test for the differences between the predicted and observed number of repeat syphilis, after adjusting for the variables significantly related to repeat syphilis after HIV diagnosis in the prior univariate analyses. In order to prevent the index event bias on the association between risk factors and recurrence of an event,
