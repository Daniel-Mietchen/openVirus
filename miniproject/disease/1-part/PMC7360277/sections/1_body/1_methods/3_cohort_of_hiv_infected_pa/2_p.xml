<p>From the NHIRD database, a total of 16,402 HIV-infected patients with a principal diagnosis of HIV infection (ICD-CM-9 code 042 or V08) visiting ambulatory care facilities were confirmed using code 91, which referred to HIV cases that were reported for reimbursement by the Taiwan Centre of Diseases Control (CDC). Tests of goodness-of-fit between our study HIV population and the annual syphilis incidence, we limited the analysis to 4907 patients with annual syphilis screen tests (ICD-CM-9 code, 12001C for rapid plasma regain, RPR; 12018C for Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay, TPHA) after HIV diagnosis. Subgroup analyses were performed for 1243 patients with a single syphilis test every year to evaluate the association between ART and repeat syphilis (Fig.
