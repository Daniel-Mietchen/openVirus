<p>Despite HIV-1 and HCV being highly mutable with a complex and evolving quasispecies, several studies have revealed that only one or few variants, referred to as transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses, establish infection following transmission reflecting a strong genetic bottleneck (Bull et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Joseph et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). T/F viruses will be exposed in the genito-rectal mucosa (i.e., the vagina and the rectum) during the vast majority (&gt;80%) of HIV transmission and in the liver during HCV transmission. Thus, eliciting HIV- and HCV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the genito-rectal mucosa and the liver, respectively, following vaccination is also an attractive strategy to circumvent issues associated with viral diversity and eliminate these viruses shortly after transmission/exposure. Several vaccine vectors such as radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS), protein loaded nanoparticles (NP), adenovirus (Ad) vectors, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and HPV pseudovirus (HPV PsV) have been developed to elicit localized protection and in some instances elicit CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the liver or the vagina (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Fernandez-Ruiz et al.,

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gola et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This provides hope that a vaccine to elicit intravaginal or intrahepatic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells can be developed to potentially provide protection against HIV-1 or HCV, respectively.
