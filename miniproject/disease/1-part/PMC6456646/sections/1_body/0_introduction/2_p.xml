<p>HIV-1 and HCV are rapidly mutating RNA viruses that exhibit considerable genetic diversity (nine subtypes in the major group of HIV-1 (German Advisory Committee Blood SAoPTbB., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and 8 genotypes (gt1-8) of HCV which include at least 67 subtypes (Borgia et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) making immunity that develops during natural infection mostly ineffective. The lack of immune correlates of protection and convenient animal models permissive to infection make vaccine design and testing extremely challenging, and have also contributed to the fact that there is still no licensed vaccine for either HIV-1 or HCV (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bailey et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). HIV-1 and HCV co-infections represent an additional obstacle (Platt et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) although a recent clinical study suggests that co-administration of HIV-1 and HCV vaccines in humans can elicit robust HIV-1- and HCV-specific T cell responses without perturbing the immunodominance hierarchies of T cells responding against the vaccine encoded HIV-1 or HCV antigens (Hartnell et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
