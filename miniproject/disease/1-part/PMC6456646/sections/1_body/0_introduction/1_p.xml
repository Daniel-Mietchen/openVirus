<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are significant contributors to the global disease burden with ~36.9 million people living with HIV-1 and at least 71 million people persistently infected with HCV (WHO, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; UNAIDS, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and direct acting anti-virals (DAAs) have contributed significantly to prolonging the lifespan and curing of HIV-1- and HCV-infected individuals, respectively (Cihlar and Fordyce, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but the annual HIV-1 and HCV incidences are still rising by millions. Furthermore, only 17 million (&lt;50%) people have access to ART (Cihlar and Fordyce, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and only 20% of patients are diagnosed for HCV (WHO, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Additional issues involving drug resistance, reactogenicity associated with life-long ART and the lack of universal access to testing and cost-subsidized therapies minimize the ability of effective anti-viral drugs to end the HIV-1 and HCV epidemics. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective prophylactic vaccines to control the number of new infections and reduce the burden of supplying ART and DAA therapies to patients (Shin,
