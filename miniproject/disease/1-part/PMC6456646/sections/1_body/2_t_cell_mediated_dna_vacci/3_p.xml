<p>DNA vaccines against HIV-1 have been tested in different pre-clinical models and some have been tested in phase I/II clinical trials (Okuda et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Cafaro et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Tomusange et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The first human clinical trial of a DNA vaccine, encoding 
 <italic>env</italic> and 
 <italic>rev</italic> genes, against HIV-1 was conducted in 1998 (MacGregor et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Following vaccination of HIV-1 positive, treatment na√Øve individuals, no significant changes were observed in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses as well as in plasma HIV RNA. In another phase I clinical trial a DNA vaccine that encoded 
 <italic>env</italic> and 
 <italic>rev</italic> was shown to induce CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell and poor CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells responses in HIV-1 seronegative individuals (MacGregor et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Similarly, low CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses were observed in another phase I clinical trial following prime/boost vaccination with a DNA vaccine that encoded 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>pol</italic> genes (Tavel et al., 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). More robust HIV-specific T cell responses have been elicited when DNA vaccines are used to prime and recombinant viral vectors are used to boost immune responses (Kibuuka et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Bakari et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Churchyard et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Hayton et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Moyo et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, prime/boost vaccinations with DNA vaccines alone can be optimized to elicit robust immune responses in humans against HIV-1. For instance, a retrospective study evaluating the immunogenicity of 10 HIV-1 DNA vaccine trials that used DNA vaccines in the absence of viral vectors or adjuvants suggest that the use of DNA delivery devices (e.g., electroporators and biojectors), and increasing the number of vaccine doses and dosage could more reproducibly elicit CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
