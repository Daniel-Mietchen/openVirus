<p>DNA can be used as a vector to prime high numbers of circulating antigen-specific T cells (Gummow et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wijesundara et al., 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) which can then be recruited to the liver using vectors that efficiently enter cells in the hepatic tissues or the vagina using chemokine ligands or vectors that transduce vaginal epithelial cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, given the poor transfection efficiency and immunogenicity of DNA when delivered into the vagina or the liver, it is more feasible to exploit DNA as an immune priming agent in a vaccination regimen to elicit HIV-1- or HCV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the vagina or the liver, respectively. Furthermore, analogous strategies using protein-based T cell priming agents in prime/pull (Shin and Iwasaki, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), prime/trap (Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), or prime/target (Gola et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) regimens have been used to elicit protective cervicovaginal or intrahepatic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells. A caveat in this case is to determine whether the primed T cells express adequate levels of chemokine receptors (e.g., CXCR3 and CXCR6) necessary to home to the liver (Sato et al., 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Tse et al., 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gola et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Olsen et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) or the vagina (Shin and Iwasaki, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) following DNA immunization. Even if not obligatory, the expression of the relevant homing receptors could be required to ensure that high densities of primed CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are recruited to the cervicovaginal mucosa or the liver following introduction of a vaccine vector or an agent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) to facilitate the formation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells. Several studies have shown that the number of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells is a crucial parameter that dictates the collective ability of these cells to confer protection against pathogens exposed in the skin, liver, or the vagina with greater numbers favoring protective outcomes (Cuburu et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Shin and Iwasaki, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
