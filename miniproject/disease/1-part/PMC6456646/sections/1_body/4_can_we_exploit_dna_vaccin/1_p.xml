<p>There has been much research and progress made to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines with respect to the choice of adjuvants, route of vaccine delivery, codon optimization of genes, method of delivery (e.g., electroporation and gene gun), etc. These aspects have been reviewed extensively elsewhere (Nagata et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Garmory et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Jechlinger, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Vanniasinkam et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Jorritsma et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and the resulting refinements have led to DNA vaccines being more effectively exploited for use in Phase I and II clinical trials especially in the context of cancer (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Trimble et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, vast majority of the studies including those progressing to the clinic have delivered DNA vaccines using intradermal or intramuscular routes. These routes may not be as effective compared to intravenous route to elicit intrahepatic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T

 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells (
