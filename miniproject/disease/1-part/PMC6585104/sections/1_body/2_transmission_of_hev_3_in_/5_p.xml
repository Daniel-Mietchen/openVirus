<p id="Par22">Most infections of immunocompetent humans with HEV-3 are asymptomatic, in rare cases a mild anicteric illness and a moderate hepatitis were reported. In some cases an acute hepatitis by red blood cell transfusion was described in immunocompetent subjects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), an acute HEV infection by cryosupernatant plasma triggered exacerbation of the TTP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. HEV infection becomes chronic in patients who are immunosuppressed (HIV-infection, transplantation, chemotherapy, rheumatic diseases), however chronic HEV infection was also observed in an immunocompetent patient with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Neurological manifestations caused by HEV infections have been reported, but they are still not well analysed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In patients with underlying liver disease, a severe hepatitis occurs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. HEV may be an immunosuppressive virus. There is evidence in a pig model of chronic HEV infection that HEV actively suppressed cellular immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and increased levels of the immunosuppressive IL-10 have been found in HEV-infected individuals [
