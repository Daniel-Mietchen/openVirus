<p id="Par20">The HEV seroprevalence and viremia in blood donors was also shown to differ in Western countries (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the Southwest of France even 52% positive donors were found, here mainly due to the consumption of undercooked 
 <italic>figatellu</italic> liver sausages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Studies in Germany showed an anti-HEV IgG prevalence of 6.8% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], the rate of HEV-positive donations was 1:4525 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and hepatitis E viraemia was found at a relatively high rate of 0.12% among blood donors in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In comparison with Europe and the United States, the seroprevalence was lower in Latin America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In Switzerland on average 29.4% of blood samples were positive, the seroprevalence increased with age (30.7% of males and 34.2% of women over 60 years old) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An increase of seropositive donors with age was also observed in France [
