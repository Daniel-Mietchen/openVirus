<p id="Par21">Due to the high prevalence in blood donors, transmission of HEV by blood transfusion has been observed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], but not all patients receiving HEV-positive blood got infected [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The infectivity of HEV-contaminated components for transfusion was in one study 50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and seems to depend upon the virus load [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. HEV transmission depends not only on the virus load, but also on the blood component given and on the presence of antibodies in the preparation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Overall, donations containing antibody were less likely to transmit. HEV transmission was also associated with organ transplantation, but only in single cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The prevalence of persistent HEV infection in patients with solid organ transplantation in Western Europe varies between 0.7 and 3.2% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The different observed incidences strongly depend on the respective antibody test applied in the respective study.
