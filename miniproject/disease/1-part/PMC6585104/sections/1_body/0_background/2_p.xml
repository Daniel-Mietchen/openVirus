<p id="Par14">In order to avoid transmission of microorganisms from the donor to the recipient, strong regulations are in force. All donations in Germany must be tested for antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2, against human hepatitis C virus (HCV), against human hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), as well as for human hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and for the genomes of HCV and HIV using nucleic acid testing (NAT) [
