  <p>Bayesian reconstruction of the spatiotemporal spread pattern of ZIKV. The transmission networks during ZIKV outbreaks as well as its origin and spread are exhibited by the minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis. Countries and nodes were colored following the continent legend (a). DensiTree analysis shows the frequency of clades and nodes from the Bayesian approach. Well-supported branches are indicated by solid colors. The sequences in bold indicate ZIKV-associated microcephaly and those in italics indicate that ZIKV was imported from Venezuela to China (b). Time-scaled Bayesian MCC phylogenetic tree of ZIKV full-length genome sequences enforcing a relaxed molecular clock. The blue and yellow rectangles show two well-supported monophyletic clades that help to elucidate the dynamics and dissemination of ZIKV to different countries. Roman numerals in front of the yellow rectangles represent our hypothesis for different ZIKV variants that are currently circulating in South America. The horizontal blue bars in the tree indicate the phylogenetic uncertainty and the asterisks the posterior probability values greater than or equal to 98% (c).</p>
