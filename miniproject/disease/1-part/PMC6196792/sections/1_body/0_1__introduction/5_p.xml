<p>With respect to the geographic expansion of other arboviruses, previous phylogenetic studies have suggested a common entry route into South America for the CHIKV Asian genotype and for some lineages of DENV-1, 2, and 4 outbreaks: from Asia to Oceania, then emerging in Central America and the Caribbean Islands [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. DENV-3 lineages (BR-I, BR-II, and BR-III) were probably imported from the Lesser Antilles (Caribbean) [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Here, we applied in-depth phylogenomic analyses to trace and retrace the potential dissemination routes of the most important emerging and reemerging arboviruses until they reached South America. We also studied the spatial arrangements of these viruses. Our data suggests that ZIKV followed a similar route as CHIKV and DENV until its first emergence on mainland South America, placing Central America and the Caribbean as the main entry pathway of human pathogenic arboviruses into this continent.
