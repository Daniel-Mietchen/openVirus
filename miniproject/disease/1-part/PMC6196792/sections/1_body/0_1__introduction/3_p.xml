<p>Initially discovered in 1947, ZIKV was a relatively unknown pathogen until 2007, when a large outbreak occurred in Yap Island, a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. ZIKV reemerged in 2013 in French Polynesia and rapidly disseminated throughout the Pacific [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In March 2015, Brazil reported autochthonous transmission of ZIKV for the first time in mainland South America and the virus has since spread throughout the Americas. ZIKV infection has already been reported in approximately 60 countries or territories in different continents [
