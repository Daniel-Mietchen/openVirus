<p>Previous evolutionary analyses have demonstrated that the ZIKV strains circulating in Brazil belong to the Asian lineage [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the entry routes of this pathogen into the Americas remain unclear and very disputed. One of the hypotheses is that ZIKV entered in Brazil during the 2014 World Cup (June 12th to July 13th), brought in by African travelers, though this hypothesis is not compatible with the circulating virus in Brazil [

Molecular clock and phylogenetic analysis of seven ZIKV sequences from patients in Brazil suggest a single introduction into Brazil between May and December 2013, coinciding with increased air travel from ZIKV endemic areas and outbreaks in the Pacific Ocean [
