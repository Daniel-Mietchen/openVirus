<p>Comprehensive phylogenomic, phylogeographic, and spatiotemporal analyses to study the geographic spread pattern of different arboviruses (and genotypes) were performed using a Bayesian evolutionary framework analysis through the Metropolis-Hasting Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm implemented in the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) software package, v2.4.340. The datasets used for Bayesian analyses were based on large ML trees using the following criteria: only sequences that clustered with flaviviruses isolated in South America and sequences of viruses isolated from humans (GenBank information: “/host = 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>”) were selected. For depicting the changes related to the effective population size (Ne) over time, the coalescent parameter Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP) was applied imposing a strict or relaxed molecular clock (with log-normal distribution rates). The Markov models of nucleotide substitution (ZIKV = GTR + I; CHIKV = GTR + I; and DENV-1 = GTR +
