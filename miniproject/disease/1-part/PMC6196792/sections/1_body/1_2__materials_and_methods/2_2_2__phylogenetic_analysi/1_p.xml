<p>To analyze the global phylogenies for each DENV-1–4 (DENV-1 (1560), DENV-2 (1132), DENV-3 (857), DENV-4 (161)), CHIKV (262), and ZIKV (63), phylogenetic reconstructions were performed with all complete genomes available until October 2016 using the maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented in FastTree v.2.1.7 software [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with the standard implementation of GTR + CAT with 20 gamma distribution parameters and a mix of nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNI) and subtree-prune-regraft (SPR).
