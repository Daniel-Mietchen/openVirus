<p>In conclusion, Central America and the Caribbean are important entry routes of human pathogenic arboviruses into South America. Our results underscore the need of the observance of strict biosecurity procedures at the main countries' entry sites and warrant systematic arbovirus surveillance to monitor its circulation and evolution as the viruses spread to other areas of the world. Monitoring arbovirus presence from mosquito samples collected regularly from key areas is a suggestion in addition to human clinical diagnostics.</p>
