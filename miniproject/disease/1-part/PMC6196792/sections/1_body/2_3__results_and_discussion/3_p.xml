<p>In Latin America, DENV resurged during the 1960s in the Caribbean and Venezuela and in the 1970s in Colombia. Before 1975, only DENV-2 and DENV-3 were circulating in the Americas, causing epidemic waves in the Caribbean (1969) and in Jamaica and Puerto Rico (1963). In 1977, DENV-1 caused epidemics in Jamaica and Cuba, and in 1978, in Venezuela and Puerto Rico. In subsequent years, it spread to the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America. This path was also followed by DENV-4 in 1981 [
