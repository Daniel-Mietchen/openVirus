<p>This introduction boosted the generation of modern South American ZIKV variants, exhibited by the multiple and statistically well-defined clades present in the time-scaled Bayesian MCC tree. This has led us to propose a subclassification of the ZIKV Asian lineage into at least six variants (ZIKV-I to VI) that are currently circulating in Latin America. Further studies investigating the possible phenotypic differences among these variants are warranted.</p>
