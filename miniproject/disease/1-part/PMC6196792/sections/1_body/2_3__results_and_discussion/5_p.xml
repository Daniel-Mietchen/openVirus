<p>Introduction of DENV-2 (Asian/American (AS/AM) lineage) into South America occurred through the Caribbean, originating from the Dominican Republic between 1997 and 2002 (highlighted in red) and Puerto Rico (highlighted in green and blue). The first introduction from Puerto Rico occurred probably in the 1980s, with further ones in 1987 and 1995 (

In the case of DENV-2, the origin and evolutionary dynamics of lineage II (AS/AM) into South America originated with three key introductions, all of them involving countries of the Caribbean: Puerto Rico (responsible for two introductory events) and the Dominican Republic. Considering that lineages I and II were predominant in epidemics in the Caribbean during the 1980s and 1990s [
