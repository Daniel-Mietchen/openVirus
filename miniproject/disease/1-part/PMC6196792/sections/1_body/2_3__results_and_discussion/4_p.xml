<p>The time-scaled Bayesian MCC tree shows the origin and spread of DENV-1 genotype V. We observed two well-supported and independent introductions of DENV from the Asian region (Indian sequences are the most likely ancestral ones) to Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, and Argentina (Clade I, highlighted in red), one from India to Brazil (Clade II, highlighted in green), and the last one from India to Brazil and Argentina passing through the British Virgin Islands (Tortola, Caribbean region) belonging to Clade III (highlighted in blue) (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], in that all DENV-1 genotype V sequences from South America investigated in this study have an ancient Asian origin. However, we suggest three independent introductions into South America with at least one in Tortola, one of the largest and most populated Islands in the Caribbean (
