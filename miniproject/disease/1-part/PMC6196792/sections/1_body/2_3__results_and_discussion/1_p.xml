<p>The ongoing rapid spread and severe disease outcomes associated with the CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV epidemics in several countries of South America and the Pacific region have caused significant global public health concerns. Knowledge of the geographic expansion of these viruses and their pathway into mainland South America remains incomplete and controversial. In this study, we traced the entry and dispersal routes for these arboviruses to the New World, especially to Brazil, which is at the epicenter of these triple arbovirus epidemics.</p>
