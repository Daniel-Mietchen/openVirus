<p>Our phylogenetic analyses show the presence of East Central/South African (ECS) and Asian/Caribbean (AC) genotypes circulating in Brazil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Considering only the Asian genotype, CHIKV caused an outbreak in the Caribbean (Martinique) in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and in September 2014 autochthonous and nonautochthonous CHIKV Asian-genotype infections were reported in Oiapoque (northern Brazil) and Recife (northeastern Brazil) [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The analyses suggest that CHIKV from Martinique reached the north and northeast of Brazil in 2014 (
