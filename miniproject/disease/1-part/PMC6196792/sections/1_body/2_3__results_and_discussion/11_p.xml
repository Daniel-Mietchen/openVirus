<p>The subsequent dynamics in South America possibly triggered successive events responsible for the generation of different ZIKV variants, as exhibited by the multiple clades in the MCC tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref>). Thus, the presence of multiple modern ZIKV variants circulating in South America could be considered as a potential division into ZIKV-I to ZIKV-VI variants. Few base substitutions per site were found between and within ZIKV variants, but they were sufficient to allow the division of ZIKV isolates into different clades (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S2</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that ZIKV followed the same route of the Asian genotype of CHIKV and DENV-1â€“4: from Asia to Oceania, then emerging in Central America and the Caribbean Islands, and finally ending up in South America (

Before this event, imported cases of CHIKV were confirmed with most being travelers arriving from Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Among the imported CHIKV cases, there were Brazilian military officers who were on a peacekeeping mission in Haiti [
