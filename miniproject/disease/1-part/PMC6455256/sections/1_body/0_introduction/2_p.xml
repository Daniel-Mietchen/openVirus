<p>The initial steps during the virus life cycle are attachment to sialic acid on the surface of host cells, followed by exploitation of cellular uptake mechanisms [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many enveloped viruses, including IAV and VSV, are entering the cells by trafficking through early to late endosomes, where the pH-dependent fusion of viral and endosomal membrane occurs, thus allowing the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the case of IAV, the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) are then translocated to the nucleus, where viral replication and transcription takes place [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the virus entry process is a crucial limiting step in the virus infection cycle and may thus be a promising target for antiviral intervention.
