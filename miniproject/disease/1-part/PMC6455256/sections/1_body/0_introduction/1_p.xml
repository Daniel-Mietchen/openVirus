<p>IAV causes seasonal epidemics affecting millions of people each year and poses an enormous threat to public health. Thus, efficient protection and therapy for IAV infection is an important challenge for global healthcare. Vaccination is the main preventive measure, but it is limited to the known circulating strains, as the vaccines do not protect against outbreaks caused by antigenically divergent strains [

For this reason, new strategies and approaches are needed that provide broad protection against IAV. One such approach is the development of drugs that target host cell factors required for viral replication [
