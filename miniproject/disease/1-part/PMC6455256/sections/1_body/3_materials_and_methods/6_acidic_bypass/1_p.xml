<p>The applied assay was established by Stauffer et al. (2014). Prior to infection, cells were pre-incubated with Bafilomycin A1 (Cayman, Cay-11038, 250 nM). PR8M virus was primed for 1 h at 37°C with low pH-DMEM (without supplements) adjusted to pH 5.8 with MES (30 mM). Cells were infected with 20 MOI of the primed virus for 1 h on ice while shaking moderately, and subsequently washed twice with cold infection-DMEM (DMEM containing 0.2% BSA, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin). Acidic bypass was achieved by incubation with prewarmed low pH-DMEM (50 mM citrate, pH 5.0) for 2 min at 37°C, followed by two washing steps with cold infection-DMEM. Infection-DMEM containing Bafilomycin A1 (250 nM) and the tested substances was added and cells were incubated for 8 h at 37°C. For FACS analysis, the cells were harvested by Accutase treatment (Millipore, SCR005) and transferred to 96-well plates with V-bottom (Sigma, CLS3896). After centrifugation at 300 rcf for 4 min at 4°C, cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at RT and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4°C. Blocking was performed with 2% BSA overnight at 4°C. Cells were stained with anti-NP-FITC (clone Sigma Aldrich, 1:50 in 2% BSA in PBS
 <sup>+/+</sup>) for 2.5 h. Cells were washed with PBS
 <sup>+/+</sup> three times. For fluorescence cytometry analysis, 5000 cells per sample were inspected. Uninfected cells or cells without acidic bypass served as control.
