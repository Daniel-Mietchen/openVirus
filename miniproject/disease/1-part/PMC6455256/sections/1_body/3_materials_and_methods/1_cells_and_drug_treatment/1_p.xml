<p>The human type II alveolar epithelial cell line A549, the human epithelial carcinoma cell line A431, the interferon-deficient Vero cells and the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells type II were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% standardized fetal bovine serum (FBS Superior; Merck Cat. No. S0615), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Itraconazole (Sigma) and posaconazole (Sigma) were solubilized in DMSO at 2 mg/ml. Prior to infection, cells were treated with 2 µg/ml itraconazole or posaconazole for 16 h, or with 250 nM Bafilomycin A1 (Cayman-Cay-11038) for 2 h. For postinfection treatment, 2 µg/ml itraconazole or posaconazole were added 2 h postinfection.
