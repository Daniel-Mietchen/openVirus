<p>A549 cells were infected with PR8M, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature at the indicated times post infection. To visualize the viral nucleoprotein (NP), cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS for 30 min, blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for &gt;1 h, and stained with FITC-coupled anti-NP antibody (clone Sigma Aldrich, 1:50 in 2% BSA in PBS) for 2 h. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Thermo Scientific, 1:1000 in 2% BSA in PBS) for 10 min. Cells were analysed by confocal microscopy using an LSM 800 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 oil immersion objective. Quantitative analysis was performed on the images utilizing CellProfiler, an open-source cell analysis tool for quantitative measurement of cell phenotypes [
