<p>Because viruses often encode only very few proteins of their own, they need to efficiently hijack the host cell machinery. The notion that the drug elicits antiviral activity by targeting more than one host cell mechanism may be advantageous, because this will also target more than one step in the viral life cycle. Moreover, such an approach will most likely cover a broader spectrum of strains which differ in their extent to which they depend on the cellular drug targets, and also circumvent viral adaptations to the IFN-induced antiviral state. Our study, which not only reports an inhibitory effect of both itraconazole and posaconazole in cell culture but shows an efficient itraconazole-mediated reduction in IAV infection
