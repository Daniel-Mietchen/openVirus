<p>To examine if itraconazole and posaconazole affect an early step in IAV infection, we performed single-cycle infection assays. Therefore, A549 and Vero cells were treated for 16 h with the compounds and subsequently infected with PR8M for 4 h. The nuclear appearance of viral nucleoprotein (vNP) was quantified as an output of a successfully infected cell (

Treatment of the host cells with Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase required for endosomal acidification, which efficiently blocks successful IAV/endosome fusion and release of the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm, served as a control for efficient IAV inhibition, and a robust inhibition (less than 1% cells with NP-positive nuclei) was observed, as expected. Remarkably, a significantly lower percentage (14%) of cells were NP-positive when pretreated with either itraconazole or posaconazole (
