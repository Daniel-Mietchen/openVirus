<p>To evaluate a potential antiviral activity of the antifungals itraconazole and posaconazole, we measured the relationship between drug dose and infection outcome after IAV infection in the human lung epithelial cell line A549, a cell line commonly used for IAV propagation. Both antifungals are NPC1 inhibitors [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and since we identified in our previous work a 16 h period of NPC1 blockade as a robust antiviral barrier to IAV infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], this time period was also chosen for drug pretreatment. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(A), both drugs efficiently inhibited the replication of the H1N1 strain PR8M. The 50% effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub> values) were seen at low micromolar concentrations, and higher doses reduced IAV propagation up to 98%. To verify that the reduction in viral replication was due to an inhibition of the IAV replication cycle and not to an indirect effect on the host cell, we next evaluated the potential cytotoxic effects of both antifungals. We performed an MTT-assay which measures the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], that is only active in proliferating viable cells. Cell viability was examined in cells which had been exposed for 24 h to solvent DMSO, or increasing concentrations of itraconazole and posaconazole. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(B), staurosporine, a potent and non-selective protein kinase inhibitor used as a positive control, caused massive cell death, while neither DMSO nor any of the itraconazole and posaconazole concentrations tested reduced the cellular viability in a significant manner, suggesting that the two antifungals actually inhibited IAV propagation. In order to explore the antiviral potential of itraconazole and posaconazole further, we infected A549 cells and the human skin epithelial cell line A431, which is also permissive for IAV [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], with various IAV subtypes (PR8M (H1N1), SC35M (H7N7), and PAN (H3N2)). Furthermore, the prototype rhabdovirus VSV was used as an additional enveloped virus. As expected, all viral infections yielded high virus titres 24 h p.i. in DMSO-treated control cells. Importantly, itraconazole pretreatment for 16 h significantly reduced viral titers for both IAV and VSV (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(A), B; Suppl. Fig. S1). In A549 and A431 cells pretreated with itraconazole, PR8M load 24 h p.i. was reduced up to 98% when cells were infected at 0.05 MOI. Reduced titers were also observed when cells were infected with higher viral doses (0.1 MOI), although the effect was less pronounced. Pretreatment with posaconazole was not as effective as itraconazole pretreatment, and both IAV and VSV infections were inhibited in A431 cells only (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(A,B); Suppl. Fig. S1). Because both the A549 as well as the A431 cell line are derived from cancer cells (human lung adenocarcinoma and epidermoid carcinoma, respectively), we investigated whether the antiviral capacity could be also observed in non-malignant primary human cells. We, therefore, used primary cells isolated from the umbilical cord vein (HUVEC), which can be efficiently infected with IAV [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(A), propagation of the exemplary IAV strains PR8M was also successfully inhibited upon itraconazole treatment, whereas both drugs could block infection with the PAN strain (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(B)). Postinfection treatment (2 h p.i.) of PR8M-infected A549 cells resulted in reduced IAV titers compared to control-treated cells (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(C)), however, the antiviral activity was less prominent. Because in some seasons IBV can be the predominant type [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we additionally explored the potential use of both antifungals for IBV infections. Interestingly, both substances also had a protective effect against IBV strain B/Lee/1940 (Suppl. Fig. S1).
