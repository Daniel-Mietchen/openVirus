<p>Because itraconazole showed a more pronounced antiviral effect in the cell culture model, we focused on this drug for the transfer into the animal model. For extrapolating therapeutic doses among species, we used allometric scaling and the dose by factor method based on species conversion factors[
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], resulting in a human equivalent dose (HED) of 5.7 mg/kg body weight, equivalent to 340 mg for a 60 kg human. Thus, mice that had received an intragastrical application of itraconazole (70 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle the day before were infected intranasally with LD
 <sub>50</sub> of PR8M (500 pfu). Drug treatment continued for another 7 days p.i., and the course of infection was followed for a total of 20 days. In line with the inhibitory effects observed in the cell culture models, we observed a clearly reduced mortality in itraconazole-treated mice (70% survival) compared to the vehicle group (40% survival). The improved survival correlated with diminished body-weight loss during the course of IAV infection (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(A). To further examine the protective role of itraconazole in the host defense against IAV, we surveyed the viral burden in the respiratory tract. Accordingly, itraconazole-treated mice showed lower viral titers in lungs (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(B)) and tracheae (Suppl. Figure S5) at d3, d5, and d7 p.i., confirming that itraconazole could effectively control the spread of IAV infection. To explore the itraconazole-mediated effect on the IFN system in the lung, we performed qPCR analysis for 
 <italic>IFNβ</italic> and the ISGs 
 <italic>MX1 and OASL1</italic> on lung homogenates of drug-treated mice (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(C)). In line with our observations on a weak induction seen in the cell culture samples, we detected a moderate induction of the IFN response. These observations are a clear indication that the antiviral effects observed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> actually occur 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and indicate a therapeutic potential of at least the antifungal drug itraconazole in the treatment of IAV infections.
