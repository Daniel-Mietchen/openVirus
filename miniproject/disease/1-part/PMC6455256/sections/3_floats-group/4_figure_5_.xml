  <p>Itraconazole and posaconazole induce endolysosomal cholesterol storage without affecting endolysosomal acidification. (A) A549 cells treated for 16 h with either the solvent DMSO, posaconazole (Posa), or itraconazole (Itra) were stained for the LE/L marker protein CD63. Unesterified cellular cholesterol was visualized using filipin. DRAQ5 was used to label nuclei. Note that the digital images were pseudocolored. Scale bar, 20 µm. Colocalization coefficients of CD63 signals with filipin were quantitated from z-stacks. Bar graphs represent means ± SEM calculated from 20 individual cells per condition from two independent experiments. (B) A549 cells were treated as indicated for 16 h. Endosomal/lysosomal pH was measured by ratio imaging. pH values are means ± SEM of 30 cells for each condition from five independent experiments. (C) Cholesterol levels in cells treated with the solvent DMSO, posaconazole (Posa), or itraconazole (Itra). Data are expressed as mean cholesterol concentrations (in micrograms per millilitre) ± SEM from four independent experiments. ****
