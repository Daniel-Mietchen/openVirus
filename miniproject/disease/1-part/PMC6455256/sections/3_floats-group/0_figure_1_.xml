  <p>The antifungals itraconazole and posaconazole block IAV infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations. (A) Dose–response curve of itraconazole and posaconazole in A549 cells. Cells were treated with either DMSO, posaconazole (Posa) or itraconazole (Itra) for 16 h, and subsequently infected with IAV strain PR8M (MOI = 0.1). Virus titers were converted to percentages, posaconazole and itraconazole concentrations were log-transformed, and EC
   <sub>50</sub> and EC
   <sub>90</sub> values were calculated from the semi-logarithmic fitted curves. Data represent mean viral titers ± SEM of three independent experiments. (B) MTT assay of A549 cells treated with either the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (St), the solvent DMSO, itraconazole (Itra) or posaconazole (Posa) at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Data represent means ± SEM, of eight independent experiments; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests, ****
