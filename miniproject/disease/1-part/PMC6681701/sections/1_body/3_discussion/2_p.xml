<p>The first scenario considered an introduction into herds at the top of the pyramidal structure of the French swine production system: nucleus, multiplier and farrowing herds. Although these kinds of herds are expected to have the highest biosecurity measures, hence the lowest probability of virus introduction, the structural analysis of the pig trade network highlighted these herds as having the highest outdegrees and outgoing contact chains (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), so they may be considered the most vulnerable links in the production chain. In other words, these herds are likely to have epidemiological links with many commercial partners, which may lead to the transfer of pathogens whenever they become infected. Four density zones were designed to represent the quartiles of swine herd densities in France (6–396 pigs per square kilometer). Index herds were randomly selected within each zone to analyze the impact of their location on the epidemiological process and surveillance/control requirements. The zone of viral introduction was not found to have an impact on the number of cases, time to detection or the infection routes linked to the transmission process. The infection was transmitted relatively little, with a median of two infected herds [1; 5]. The transmission contact chains were limited to one main effector herd: seeder herds were the main transmission effectors, with secondary infected sources being only very sporadically involved (0.2–0.4% of simulations). This may be explained both by the pyramidal structure of the French pig production sector and by the reactiveness of the surveillance and control policies, with a median hot period evaluated at 15 days [11; 21]. However, further analysis revealed a huge difference in the geographic dispersion of the virus when index cases were simulated in low- or high-density areas, with distances between the sources and related cases potentially reaching 800 km when the index case was in a low-density area. This kind of transmission may allow the virus to emerge in more densely populated areas, in turn inducing a higher risk of local spread and potentially exposing a higher number of susceptible herds to infection, thus increasing the duration of epidemics nationally. Owing to the emergency surveillance and control policies set up in France following the emergence of ASF in Belgium, all large herds with twice the average mortality rates, and all smaller herds (fewer than 1,000 animals) with a 2-fold increase in morbidity (total number of clinically suspect and dead pigs) within a 14-day period have to be clinically inspected. This passive surveillance protocol was found to be relatively efficient in detecting ASF cases, with detection rates reaching 94%, while keeping the number of clinical visits to a minimum. Indeed, for outbreaks lasting between 15 and 41 days, the median number of clinical visits required was evaluated at 102 when the index case was in a low-density area, and up to 235 when in a high-density area, representing, respectively, 0.5 and 1% of the total number of production sites. A similar trend was obtained for serological and virological visits, which are mainly carried out to confirm clinical suspicions and which did not exceed 108 and 36, respectively, for high-density areas. However, it should be noted that the detection rate in the lowest-density area was lower than that obtained in the other areas (88 vs. 93–94%). This was mainly due to the failure to detect ASF in small herds, where the infection may fade out before any clinical visits could be planned.
