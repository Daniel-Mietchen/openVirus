<p>Based on these results, we decided to evaluate the impact of additional screening focusing on small herds with &lt;300 animals. We therefore assumed a systematic clinical inspection of these small herds when either the number of clinically infected or dead animals exceeded the threshold value of 15 pigs over a 14-day period (on average more than one affected or dead pig per day), or the whole population was affected during the same period. With this additional surveillance measure, the detection rate exceeded 95% for all scenarios with the same number of visits. Although the hot periods were similar when the index case involved a free-range herd, the higher detection rate allowed a faster reaction time, thus avoiding further secondary cases (only 4% of simulations in this case were affected by secondary infections). Furthermore, in this specific case, shortening the infection process through enhanced screening of small herds also enabled the number of herd visits to be made during the epidemic to be reduced. These results clearly show the beneficial impact of targeted surveillance on small herds in addition to the emergency surveillance protocol already in place.</p>
