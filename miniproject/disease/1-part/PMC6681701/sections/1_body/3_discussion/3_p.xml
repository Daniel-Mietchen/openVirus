<p>The second scenario considered free-range pig herds as index cases, assuming this type of production site to be more susceptible to viral exposure through potential contact with wild boars. Keeping the same model structure and assumptions, the results obtained here were quite different from those obtained with the previous scenario. Indeed, the infection was contained within seeder herds in 87.5% of simulations. When transmission did occur, however, up to 15 herds could be infected, clearly identifying a real risk of transmission even from herds with little network connectivity. Furthermore, local transmission was clearly the main transmission route in this case, corresponding to transmission via material shared between neighboring herds, whereas pig movements played a major role in the previous scenario. Although the tracing of pig movements is well-documented (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and may be used to identify epidemiological links between the different production sites, the local transmission pathway may be more difficult to assess due to the lack of traceability. This fact, along with the relatively small herd size of free-range sites, may contribute to the poor detection results achieved, with a detection rate of only 15.3% despite the global number of clinical, serological, and virological visits, which was similar to that obtained in low-density areas for the first scenario.
