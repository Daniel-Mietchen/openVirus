<p>The herd is considered as a homogenous, randomly-mixed population, independent of its physiological status. The pigs evolve through five health statuses: susceptible (

 <italic>L</italic>), not clinically affected but infectious (subclinical; 
 <italic>Sc</italic>), clinically affected (clinical; 
 <italic>C</italic>), and not playing a role in transmission (removed, 
 <italic>R</italic>). Transmission is assumed to be either through direct contact between susceptible and infectious animals, or through environmental contamination due to infected leftovers. The environmental reservoir (
 <italic>E</italic>) is proportional to the number of ASF-related dead animals, and balanced by an exponential decay representing the virus's capacity for survival in the environment. Using the transmission rate (Î²) estimate of Guinat et al. (
