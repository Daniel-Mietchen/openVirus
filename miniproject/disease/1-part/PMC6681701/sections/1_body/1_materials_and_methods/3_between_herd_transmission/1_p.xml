<p>Although direct contact through animal movements is deemed to be essential for ASF transmission, the model framework accounts for four additional indirect transmission routes. The transit trucks used to move animals to the slaughterhouse may call in at several pig farms during the same round, and therefore represent a risk of ASF introduction. Indirect contact by external human interventions has been represented through two levels of risk linked to the frequency of contact with animals. Medium-risk contact represents the chance of ASF being introduced by veterinarians or rearing technicians who are frequently in contact with live animals, while a low-risk contact is related to sporadic visitors or feed trucks, which are potential vectors through environmental contamination. Finally, local spread was considered within a 2-km radius of an infected farm to represent potential transmission through shared material and fomites. For each transmission route, the probabilities of transmission between production sites are computed daily using a sequential approach.</p>
