<p>All animal movements from and to these zones are prohibited for 45 (SZ) or 50 days (PZ), and all the herds in these two zones have to be monitored during that period. Clinical surveillance as described above is applied to both zones except for the second point: mortality notification is compulsory and systematically induces clinical inspection leading to further laboratory analyses (virology and serology). All herds in PZ are subject to mandatory serological surveillance visits, for which the sample size depends on the herd size and type (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Breeding animals on boar stud farms, in nucleus and in farrowing herds located in the surveillance zone are also systematically subjected to serological tests. All contacts are traced to identify the possible contact chains from and to infected herds over the 30 days prior to detection. Herds with epidemiological links to a suspected production site are subjected to clinical, serological and virological investigations.
