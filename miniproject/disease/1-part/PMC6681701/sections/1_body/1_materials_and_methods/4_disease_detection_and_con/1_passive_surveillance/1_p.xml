<p>In the context of the imminent threat of AFS being introduced into France, the surveillance measures described by Halasa et al. have been reinforced (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Mortality scores are systematically recorded and analyzed over 14-day periods to monitor abnormal events. Two distinct strategies are considered depending on the herd size. A herd with over 1,000 pigs and twice the average mortality rate during the 14-day period—a rate set at 6% over the period of production (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)—is systematically subjected to a clinical inspection. In smaller herds (below 1,000 animals), clinical inspections are performed as soon as the morbidity (computed as the total number of both sick and dead animals) over two successive weeks reaches twice that of theoretical mortality. In the event of suspicion during a clinical visit, serological, and virological investigations are performed according to the sampling scheme described in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Blood and tissue samples are taken, prioritizing clinically-affected and dead animals. Whenever a suspicion is confirmed, stamping-out measures are immediately implemented and Surveillance and Protection Zones (SZ and PZ) are set up within a 10- and 3-km radius, respectively. The delay between confirmation and total stamping-out of the herd depends on the on-site culling capacity, set at 500 head per day nationwide based on expert opinions.
