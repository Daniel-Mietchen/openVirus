<p>Based on pig trade network analysis, different scenarios regarding the type of herd in which ASF could be introduced were evaluated. We first considered introduction into breeding herds (nucleus, multiplier, and farrowing herds) having large outdegrees and movements mainly toward production herds (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Seeder herds were randomly selected among the herds having at least three outgoing movements per month and herd sizes exceeding 360 animals (third and fourth quartiles). To analyze the impact of the geographic location of the seed herd and following the analysis by Halasa et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), 2,000 repetitions were performed for the breeding herds in each density area. The second scenario considered the introduction of ASF into free-range production herds, which are potentially exposed to infectious pressure exerted by wild boar populations. Here the seeder herds were randomly selected regardless of their geographic locations. The latter scenario was run for 2,000 iterations to ensure full geographic coverage of mainland France and Corsica. The results are displayed in
