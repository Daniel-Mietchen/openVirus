<p>The modeling work consisted in tailoring the DTU-DADS-ASF model fully described in the literature by Halasa et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Only a brief overview of the hypotheses and modeling framework are therefore provided here; a schematic representation being illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. An illustrative example of data formatting is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material 1</xref>. The model— developed to analyze the consequences of ASF introduction in organized swine production systems—represents the course of global infection by coupling the dynamics of infection both within and between herds and representing official control measures.
