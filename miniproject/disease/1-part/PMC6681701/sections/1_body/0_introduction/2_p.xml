<p>To date, sub-Saharan Africa is seriously affected by ASF, the virus being endemic in several countries (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Despite a few sporadic outbreaks successfully and rapidly contained and local endemicity on the island of Sardinia, Europe was considered free from ASF for about two decades until 2007, when the virus was introduced into Georgia via infected waste fed to domestic pigs. The waste originated from Africa and was brought to Georgia by boat (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It continued to spread in Eastern Europe between 2012 and 2014, affecting both wild boars and domestic pigs. It spread very quickly through the Baltic countries (Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania) before emerging in Poland (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) then finally reaching the Czech Republic in June 2017. Owing to strong control measures based on fencing in the infected area, intensive hunting of wild boars and the active search for carcasses, the Czech Republic was declared ASF-free by the European Commission in late February 2019, after 6 months without any ASF-positive cases. The opposite case is illustrated by Romania, where the first notification was reported in July 2017. This initial incursion had limited consequences in terms of local spread (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, the ongoing epidemic was initiated 1 year later, with more than 1,000 cases declared in October 2018 among both domestic and wild fauna. Apart from the Czech Republic, ASF is now considered endemic in affected Eastern European countries and a very real threat to Western Europe (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In September 2018, the first notification of ASF cases in wild boars was reported in Belgium (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although the origin of the initial case has not yet been fully elucidated, a human role in this long-distance transmission seems the most likely (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Since then and to date, ASF has continued to spread in wild boars in Belgium, despite the setting up of strict control measures with physical barriers, active searches for dead wild boars, the removal of carcasses from the environment, analysis of every culled or dead wild boar, and intensive hunting of wild boars within the reinforced observation area, similar to those implemented in the Czech Republic. To date (2019/03/26), 2059 wild boars have been tested in the surveillance zone, 708 of which have been found positive. The virus's incursion into France is imminent due to the shared boundaries between France and Belgium, the evidenced transmissibility of the virus, and the movements of wild boars. Although the introduction of ASF is more likely from this neighboring area via infected wild boars due to a continuum of the wild boar population across the border, a sporadic introduction into other areas should not be excluded because of the disease's increasing prevalence among both wild and domestic reservoirs in various Eastern European countries.
