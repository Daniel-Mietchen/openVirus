<p>The previous results clearly evidence the failure to detect infections occurring in small herds. We therefore assessed the impact of additional screening measures focusing specifically on these herds. We assumed that these herds were systematically subjected to clinical inspection as soon as they declared more than 15 dead or clinically-infected animals within two successive weeks (corresponding to an average morbidity of one animal per day), or when the whole population was affected during the same period. This latter assumption factored in the inspection of very small herds, which could have been easily omitted when considering only the previous surveillance measures.</p>
