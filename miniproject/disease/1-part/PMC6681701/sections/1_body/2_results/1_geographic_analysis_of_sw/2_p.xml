<p>To evaluate the daily probability of occurrence of between-herd contact while traveling to the slaughterhouse—considered an epidemiological endpoint—movements were analyzed separately and taking into consideration their frequency for each herd type. Two production sites on average were visited on route to slaughterhouses. This value was used to evaluate the number of contacts drawn from an exponential distribution and balanced with the distance distribution between source herds and their associated slaughterhouses (
