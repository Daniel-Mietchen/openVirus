<p>From the point of view of health care, Moreira and collaborators (2018) [
 <xref rid="pone.0235010.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] point out that children with Zika Congenital Syndrome (ZCS), who bear in their bodies the marks of multiple disabilities and chronic and complex health conditions, require a multidisciplinary team for their care, including physiotherapists, nurses and nursing technicians, speech therapists, nutritionists, educators, social workers, occupational therapists and psychologists. It is an irrefutable need for these children who require proper organization of these teams for their care. It should be noted that pediatricians are not the only doctors involved in treating children living with chronic and complex health conditions. For example, children with ZCS need ophthalmologists due to eyesight problems, as well as neurologists due to the convulsions and neurological morbidities that commonly accompany the disease.
