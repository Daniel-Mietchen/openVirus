<p>There are some limitations to this study as the missing data of Zika cases. Despite advances and rapid response from the scientific community and the Brazilian National Health Systemâ€“the Unified Health System (UHS) to the epidemic, there are still gaps in coverage and completeness of Zika and ZCS case records. The very first case definitions of microcephaly, which at the beginning of the epidemic were based solely on head circumference measurement, had to be reviewed. Research findings showed that other signs and symptoms could be indicative of central nervous system malformations caused by the ZIKV.</p>
