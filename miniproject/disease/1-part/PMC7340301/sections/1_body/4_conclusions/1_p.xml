<p>The Zika and microcephaly epidemics in Brazil pose important challenges for health services and require the optimization of the relationship between primary care and specialized services. The nationâ€™s large expanse, and its high vulnerability to the epidemics, which are largely due to institutional weakness, has resulted in leaving large portions of the country with low service coverage (specialized equipment and human resources). This constitutes a highly heterogeneous picture regarding access to the services required for diagnosis, follow-up, treatment, and rehabilitation of affected mothers and children.</p>
