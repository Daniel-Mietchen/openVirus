Like other Brazilian states, the highest concentration of microcephaly cases occurred in the respective capitals. The capital Salvador—BA had the largest number of confirmed cases (216 cases), followed by João Pessoa—PB (45 cases) and Natal—RN (26 cases). However, it should also be mentioned the significant diffusion of cases in other cities in the interior of these states.
