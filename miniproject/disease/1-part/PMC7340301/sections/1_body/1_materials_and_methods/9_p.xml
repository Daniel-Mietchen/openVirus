<p>To model geographic accessibility, we proposed in this paper to simulate a radius of influence of 100 km (buffers) around the specialized health units in each state. This radius was chosen as a proxy of the longest possible round-trip distance for displacements of parents and children in the same day (each journey taking about 2 hoursâ€™ time by paved road). By these procedures we can estimate the municipalities that are too far from the needed health services for the children affected by ZCS.</p>
