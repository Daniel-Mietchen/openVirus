<p>The first advantage of using an optical sensor opposed to traditional electrical based sensors is that electrical sources are not required. In addition, optical sensors can operate at environmental temperatures, which means that an optical sensor can be used in critical environments and with dangerous products (explosives, chemical products, etc.), where the use of sensors based on conductivity changes is not allowed. Furthermore, optical sensors present better performance in terms of interference problems, and allow a detection level beyond the state of the art. Moreover, optical sensors can be used for multiple analytes detection, giving more complete and useful information to final users.</p>
