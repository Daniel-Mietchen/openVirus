 <xref rid="B17-sensors-19-03985" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have been tackled, considering the abovementioned advanced bio-photonic sensor requirements. In this sense, the SWINOSTICS approach is based on the combination of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology and bio-sensing technology to detect different swine viruses (each virus presence will be detected by one of the functionalized resonant rings forming the PIC). The aim of the present paper is to describe the design and fabrication of the biosensor photonic integrated circuit (PIC) which is, as mentioned, based on resonant rings fabricated in silicon nitride technology as will be described in
