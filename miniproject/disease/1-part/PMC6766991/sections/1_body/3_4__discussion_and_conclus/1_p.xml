<p>In this paper, the design and fabrication of photonic biosensors based on microrings has been presented. The biosensors were fabricated in silicon nitride by using CMOS compatible techniques as electron beam lithography and RIE-ICP etching. The biosensor proposed is comprised of eight resonant rings, which will be functionalized with different antibodies to detect specific virus affecting swine livestock in the frame of the H2020 SWINOSTICS project. The fabricated microrings have been statically characterized after the fiber attachment, obtaining a good performance in terms of optical losses (30 dB per ring, taking into account propagation, splitting, and coupling losses), as well as extinction ratio for the ring resonances (10â€“15 dB). One of the fabricated PICs was used in a preliminary experiment for detection of PCV2 virus. After the rings functionalization with specific antibodies and attaching a microfluidic layer on the PIC, positive detection of several virus concentrations was achieved, demonstrating the good performance and feasibility of the proposed detection technique.</p>
