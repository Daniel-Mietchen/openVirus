<p>Once the photonic chips were functionalized, it was necessary to attach a microfluidic adhesive layer that allowed the flown of the sample. For this experiment, an available simpler microfluidic layer (not the final microfluidics design to be used in SWINOSTICS project) was bonded on the chip surfaces. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f006">Figure 6</xref> depicts the attached microfluidics layer where it can be observed as the microfluidic channel was aligned on top the sensor resonant microrings.
