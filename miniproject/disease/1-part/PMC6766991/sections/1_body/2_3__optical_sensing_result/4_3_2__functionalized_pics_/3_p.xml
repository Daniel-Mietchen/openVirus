<p>The prepared photonic chips were used for virus sensing by using an optimized laboratory set-up which makes use of a peristaltic pump. To perform the PCV2 sensing experiment, a flowing protocol was designed. First, a phosphate buffered saline with Tween-20 (PBST) solution was flowed for 1–2 min to get a reference signal. After that, the virus sample diluted in the same buffer was flown for 10 min, and finally a cleaning buffer (PBST as in the first step) was flown for 1–2 min. In the experiment, the initial virus sample was a real sample with unknown concentration, and all the dilutions were prepared from this starting virus sample. So, to perform the experiment, several PCV2 virus samples were flowed on functionalized ring resonators at several dilution factors, from a 1/100 to 1/5000 dilution in PBS buffer.</p>
