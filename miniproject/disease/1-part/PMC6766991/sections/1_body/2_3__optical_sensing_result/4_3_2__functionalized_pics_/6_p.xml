<p>As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f007">Figure 7</xref>, during the first flowing of PBST solution, the resonance is practically not shifted. After that, the virus sample diluted in the same buffer flowing produces a shift which is dependent on the dilution. Finally, the cleaning buffer flowing helps to eliminate unspecific bindings (which seem to be higher for higher dilutions). The sensing principle consists in comparing the resonance shift of the functionalized ring with the reference (non-functionalized) ring.
