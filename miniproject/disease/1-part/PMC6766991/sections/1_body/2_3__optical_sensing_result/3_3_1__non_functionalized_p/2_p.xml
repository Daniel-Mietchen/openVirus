<p>This preliminary characterization was performed after gluing the fiber array (following the process showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f004">Figure 4</xref>) and dropping deionized water (DI water) on the rings to emulate the real liquid sample flowing. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the optical response for four resonant rings of one of the fabricated sensor PICs (rings #3 to #6 corresponding to the 4 rings in the middle area in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f002">Figure 2</xref>).
