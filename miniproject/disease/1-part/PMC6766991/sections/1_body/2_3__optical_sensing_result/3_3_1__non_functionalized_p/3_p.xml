<p>As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the fabricated biosensor PICs show a typical microring resonator response where the corresponding resonant notches can be observed. The sensing principle is based on following the position of a selected notch, whilst flowing the sample collected from the animals. In case of a positive detection of a targeted virus, a shift in the notch placement will be observed during the measurement. As mentioned, each ring will be functionalized with a specific antibody capable of detecting the corresponding virus. As expected in simulation and design stages, and after building blocks fabrication and optimization, the microring resonators show optical power losses around 30 dB, and extinction ratios around 15 dB, which can also be observed in
