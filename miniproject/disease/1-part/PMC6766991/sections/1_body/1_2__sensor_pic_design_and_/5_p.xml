<p>Once the basic structures were optimized, the complete design of the PIC was transferred to the silicon nitride samples and wafers, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f002">Figure 2</xref>, by using a CMOS compatible fabrication process carried out in a class 10â€“100 cleanroom environment. Our fabrication process is based on a direct writing electron beam process on a poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) positive resist layer with a thickness of 100 nm. After developing the resist, a metal mask is created by chromium evaporation prior to a lift-off process. This metal mask was used to perform the inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) of the silicon nitride layer using fluoride gases. With the mentioned process, we were capable of obtaining a good performance in terms of roughness and side wall verticality in the final fabricated samples (propagation losses ~2.5 dB/cm). Finally, after depositing a silicon dioxide layer (one micron thick) by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), a window was opened on the resonant rings by removing the silicon dioxide with a second e-beam lithography and a new ICP-RIE etching.
