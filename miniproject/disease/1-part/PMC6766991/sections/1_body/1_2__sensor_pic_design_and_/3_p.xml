<p>Our biosensor PIC comprises three main building blocks: sensing ring resonators, light coupling block (grating couplers), and optical power distribution block. The ring resonators are used as sensor elements (using one resonant ring for each targeted virus), the light coupling section allows to introduce and extract the optical signals into/out of the PIC whilst the power distribution block is necessary to feed all the resonator rings of the PIC with a common laser source input. After preliminary simulations, and in order to optimize each building block and validate the fabrication process, a first run of each functional block was fabricated sweeping different physical parameters to determine and fine-tune the most suitable physical structures. This optimization was performed searching for the best PIC overall performance in terms of sensitivity, which is related directly with sensing parameters as limit of detection (LoD), limit of quantification, etc.
