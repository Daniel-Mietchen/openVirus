<p>The proposed biosensors are based on a photonic transducer, which uses resonant cavities; concretely ring resonators fabricated in silicon nitride technology. The use of photonic high-quality factor ring resonators has been widely proposed for many applications, the development of sensitive refractive index sensors being one such application. Biological sensor arrays based on high quality factor evanescent microring waveguide resonators have been demonstrated and fabricated with technical processes which are fully compatible with CMOS fabrication [

In addition, the use of silicon nitride technology offers several advantages compared to technologies, such as silicon on insulator (SOI), as there are more robust structures against fabrication tolerances and enhanced interaction for sensing applications [
