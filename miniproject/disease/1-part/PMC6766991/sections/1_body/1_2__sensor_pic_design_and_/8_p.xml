<p>As mentioned, using an alignment bench (concretely a MICOS system alignment bench with 16 alignment axes), the attachment of the fibers was successfully reached following the process depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f004">Figure 4</xref>. A dynamic process consisting of measuring the optical signal through a PIC reference waveguide was used to optimize the FA placement, just on the gratings. Once the maximum power was reached after several iterations, the FA was glued to the PIC with a resist (concretely Dymax OP52 optical adhesive) cured by UV light.
