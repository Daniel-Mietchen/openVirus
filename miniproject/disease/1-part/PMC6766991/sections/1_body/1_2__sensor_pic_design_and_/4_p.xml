<p>After characterizing optically the fabricated building blocks at lab, the more convenient functional elements were selected and included in the complete biosensor photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design. In this sense, the selected resonator rings showed sensitivities around 265 nm/RIU with quality factors around 25,000, which are high enough for our sensing applications. In addition, and based on our system noise (1.89 pm) and temperature drift, we calculated a detection limit of 7.13 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> RIU, which is in the range of the best values obtained for planar ring resonators [

 <xref rid="B28-sensors-19-03985" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, the gratings couplers showed coupling losses of ~7.5 dB and the distribution elements based on 1 × 2 MMI’s showed splitting losses of ~4.2 dB.
