<p>As can be seen in the above image, the fabricated biosensor PIC has eight resonant photonic rings. Six of them will be functionalized with specific antibodies to detect the targeted viruses, whilst the other two rings will be used to perform positive and negative control during the sensing process. The opened channels on the rings can be also observed in
