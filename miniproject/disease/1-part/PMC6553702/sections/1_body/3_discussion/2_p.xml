<p>The PRVABC59 and ChibaS36 strains clearly exhibited higher growth ability than NIID123 strain in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The passage numbers of the three strains in Vero cells were â‰¤ 7; however, NIID123 was first passaged in C6/36 cells (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, we cannot exclude the effect of NIID123 passage history on its growth in Vero cells and mice. However, the growth rate of NIID123 in C6/36 cells was also clearly lower than PRVABC59, indicating that NIID123 has not adapted to C6/36 cells (
