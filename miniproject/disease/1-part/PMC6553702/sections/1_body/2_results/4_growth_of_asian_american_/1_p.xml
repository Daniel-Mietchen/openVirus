<p>All inoculated mice had survived at 2 weeks post-inoculation. No infectious virus was detected in the serum in any of the mice infected with each Asian/American-lineage ZIKV strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Infectious virus was detected at similar levels in the epididymal fluid and epididymal cells including sperm (sperm/epididymal cells) samples from all mice infected with PRVABC59 or ChibaS36, whereas infectious ZIKV was not detected in the samples from NIID123-infected mice. Infectious virus was detected in the testes of all PRVABC59-infected mice, but not in the testes of ChibaS36- or NIID123-infected mice. Lastly, infectious virus was detected in the epididymis of some of the mice infected with each strain, but no significant difference was observed between the three groups.
