ZIKV infection in humans was first identified in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania in 1952, and human ZIKV infections (ZIKV disease, ZVD) have been sporadically detected in Africa and Asia for &gt; 50 years since the initial isolation [

The first large outbreak of ZIKV infection in humans was identified in Yap Island in the Federal State of Micronesia in 2007 and a ZIKV-infection outbreak was also confirmed in French Polynesia in the South Pacific in 2013, with an estimated number of 30,000 ZVD cases [

In 2016, patients with ZVD were reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. ZIKV is transmitted to humans mainly through the bite of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and non-vector transmission of ZIKV has also been reported to occur through blood transfusion, transplantation, and sexual intercourse [
