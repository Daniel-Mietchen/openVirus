<p>We determined the 50% tissue-culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) for each organ sample as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Briefly, to pre-amplify infectious ZIKV in the organ samples using C6/36 cells, the organ samples were serially diluted (1:10–1:10
 <sup>8</sup>) with MEM-2FBS and the C6/36 cells cultured in 96-well plates were then inoculated with each sample and incubated for 5 days at 28 °C. The pre-amplification step was added to improve the detection of low-level infectious viruses. Subsequently, 25-μL aliquots of the culture supernatants were transferred to Vero cells cultured in 96-well plates and incubated for 5 days at 37 °C. Lastly, the cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and stained with Methylene Blue solution to visualize the cytopathic effect induced by the ZIKV infection. Viral titers were statistically compared using either BellCurve for Excel employing the Mann-Whitney U test or SPSS (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) employing the repeated-measures ANOVA test.
