 <sub>CAR</sub> dataset of Haitian (
 <italic>n</italic> = 103) and Dominican (
 <italic>n</italic> = 123) sequences. Our Bayesian phylogeographic analysis traced the root location of the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> epidemic into Haiti and the Dominican Republic with the same posterior probability. This result revealed the complexity to uncover the geographic origin of the subtype B epidemic within Hispaniola by using only genetic data, probably due to the continuous cross-border viral movements between countries since the very early epidemic times. Thus, integration of non-genetic information (such as HIV incidence and prevalence data and human flows) into phylogeographic inference (
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Graf et al., 2015</xref>) would be probably indispensable to resolve the precise location of the HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> ancestor within Hispaniola.
