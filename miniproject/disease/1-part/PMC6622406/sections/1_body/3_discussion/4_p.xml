<p>Some epidemiological studies suggested that HIV-1 transmission between populations in Haiti and the Dominican Republic was uncommon during the early years and that tourists were the most likely source of first virus transmissions to Dominicans (

 <sub>CAR</sub> strains have been disseminated between Haiti and the Dominican Republic since the early 1970s and that several B
 <sub>CAR</sub> transmission networks were already established in the Dominican Republic by mid-1970s, nearly a decade before the first AIDS cases were officially recognized in the country. The overall time scale here obtained for the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> epidemic is fully consistent with that recovered in previous studies (

 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Worobey et al., 2016</xref>), supporting the reliability of our T
 <sub>MRCA</sub> estimates. These results clearly indicate that HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains have been disseminated between Haitian and Dominican populations quite frequently since the early 1970s onwards.
