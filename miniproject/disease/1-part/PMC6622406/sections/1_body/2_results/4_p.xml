<p>HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences from Haiti (
 <italic>n</italic> = 103) and the Dominican Republic (
 <italic>n</italic> = 123) were finally used to reconstruct the demographic history of this viral epidemic in Hispaniola. Reconstruction of population dynamics with the BSKL coalescent-based model suggested that the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> epidemic in Hispaniola experienced an initial phase of fast exponential growth until the beginning of the 1990s, followed by a stabilization of the

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The UNAIDS epidemiological data, in agreement with the BSKG model, indicate a growth in the number of new HIV infections in Hispaniola until the early 2000s and a subsequent phase of decline extending until the most recent date (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To estimate the growth rate of the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> epidemic at the initial phase, three parametric coalescent models (logistic, exponential, and expansion) were compared. According to the best-fit logistic growth coalescent model (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>), the mean growth rate of the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> epidemic during the first decades of expansion in Hispaniola was 0.50 (95% HPD: 0.37â€“0.65).
