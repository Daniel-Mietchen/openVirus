<p>A total of 127 new HIV-1 subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences covering the complete protease (PR) and the first part of the reverse transcriptase (RT) regions (nucleotides 2253 to 3275 of reference strain HXB2) were obtained from adult patients at Port-au-Prince, Haiti, who underwent HIV genotyping tests at the Virology Laboratory of the University Hospital of Martinique (Fort-de-France, Martinique) between 2009 and 2014. All patients provided written informed consent and samples were anonymized as recommended in the study protocol approved by the Comité National d’Ethique du Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population de Haiti (13/07/2009). Only one sequence per subject was selected and all sites associated with major antiretroviral drug resistance were removed.
