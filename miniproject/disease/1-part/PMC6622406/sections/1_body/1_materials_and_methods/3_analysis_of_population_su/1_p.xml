<p>The HIV-1 B

 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Haiti identified here were aligned with B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences from Haiti (

 <italic>n</italic> = 123) previously characterized (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Cabello et al., 2014</xref>). A Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> dataset from Hispaniola was reconstructed under the best-fit nucleotide substitution model (GTR + I + G) using the MrBayes program (
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>). Two chains were run for 25 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> generations, and stationarity (constant mean and variance of trace plots) and good mixing (effective sample size &gt; 200) for all parameter estimates were assessed using TRACER v1.7 (
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2018</xref>). The degree of phylogenetic mixing of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences obtained from both countries was then quantified using the BaTS program (

 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2001</xref>), and the maximum clade (MC) statistics. Results were considered significant for
