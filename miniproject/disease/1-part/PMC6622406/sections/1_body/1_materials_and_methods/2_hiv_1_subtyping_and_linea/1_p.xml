<p>The subtype initially assigned to new Haitian sequences by the REGA HIV subtyping tool v.2 (
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">de Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>) was confirmed by performing a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis with HIV-1 group M subtype reference sequences (

 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2005</xref>) with the default settings. Only statistically significant (
