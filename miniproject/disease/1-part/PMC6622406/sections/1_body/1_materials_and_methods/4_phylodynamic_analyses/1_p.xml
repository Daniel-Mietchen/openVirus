<p>The evolutionary rate, the age of the most recent common ancestor (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>MRCA</sub>), the spatial diffusion pattern, and the rate of population growth (
 <italic>r</italic>, year
 <sup>−1</sup>) of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> lineages in Hispaniola were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach implemented in BEAST v1.8 (

 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>). Regression analyses using the TempEst program (
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2016</xref>) revealed that the B
 <sub>CAR</sub>
 <italic>pol</italic> dataset compiled here did not contain a sufficient temporal signal for reliable time-scale estimations [
 <italic>X</italic>-intercept (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>MRCA</sub>) &lt; 1910]. Thus, Bayesian MCMC analyses were performed using a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model (
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>) with a uniform prior distribution on the substitution rate (1.7–3.0 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> subst./site/year), based on previous estimates (

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Mendoza et al., 2014</xref>). Migration events were reconstructed using a reversible discrete phylogeographic model (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Lemey et al., 2009</xref>) with a CTMC rate reference prior (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira and Suchard, 2008</xref>). The number of location transitions (viral migrations between countries) throughout the evolutionary history was estimated using Markov jump counts (
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">O’Brien et al., 2009</xref>). Changes in effective population size through time (
 <italic>Ne</italic>) were estimated using the non-parametric Bayesian skyline (BSKL) (
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2005</xref>) and Bayesian Skygrid (BSKG) (
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Gill et al., 2013</xref>) models. Estimates of the

 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Baele et al., 2016</xref>). Six MCMC chains were run for 200 million generations and then combined to ensure stationarity and good mixing as described above. The MC credibility (MCC) tree was summarized with TreeAnnotator v1.8 and visualized using the FigTree v1.4 program.
