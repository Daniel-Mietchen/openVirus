<p>The glycoprotein (GP) is responsible for cell attachment, fusion and cell entry. The broad cellular tropism of the GP resulted in multisystem involvement that led to high mortality [

 <xref rid="B86-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Alignment of the Glycoprotein (GP) sequences of 66 Ebola virus isolates from the previous outbreaks (old Ebola outbreak of 1976 to 2005) with the new Ebola outbreak isolates (2014) showed some differences in the positions and frequency of the amino acid replacements. Comparative analysis between the isolates from the old epidemic with the new epidemic isolates showed that 19 out of the 22 amino acid mutations were consistently present in the latter [
