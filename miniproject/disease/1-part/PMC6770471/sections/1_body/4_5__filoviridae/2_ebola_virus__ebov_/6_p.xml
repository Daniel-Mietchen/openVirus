<p>Furthermore, Fedewa et al. showed that genomic adaptation was not crucial for efficient infection of the Ebola virus. The genomes were characterized after serial-passages of EBOV in Boa constrictor kidney JK cells. Deep sequencing coverage (&gt;Ã—10,000) confirmed the presence of only one single nonsynonymous variant (T544I) of unknown significance within the viral population that demonstrated a shift in frequency of at least 10% over six serial passages. However, passaging the EBOV in other cell lines, such as HeLa and DpHt cheek cells, showed different mutations in the genomes of the viral population [
