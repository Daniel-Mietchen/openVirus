<p>Fusion and cell attachment proteins are large glycoprotein spikes that are present on the surface of the virion. Both of these proteins play important roles in the pathogenesis of viruses from 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family and are responsible for attachment to the cellular receptor(s), whereas the F protein mediates cell entry by inducing fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane. The matrix protein organizes and sustains the virion structure. The nucleocapsid associates with genomic RNA and protects the RNA from nucleases. Extracistronic (noncoding) regions include a 3′ leader sequence with 50 nucleotides in length, which works as a transcriptional promoter and a 5′ trailer with 50–161 nucleotides [
