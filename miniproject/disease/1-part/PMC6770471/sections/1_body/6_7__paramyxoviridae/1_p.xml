 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> is a family of viruses in the order Mononegavirales that uses vertebrates as their natural hosts. Currently, 72 species are placed in this family and they are divided amongst 14 genera [
 <xref rid="B109-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Diseases associated with 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> included measles (MeV), mumps and Newcastle disease (NDV). 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> virions are enveloped and pleomorphic which are presented as spherical or filamentous particles with diameters of around 150 to 350 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). The genome is linear, negative-sense single-stranded RNA, about 15–19 kb in length and encode 9–12 proteins through the production of multiple proteins from the 
 <italic>P</italic> gene (

 <xref rid="B110-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. On the external surface of the virion, glycoproteins possessing hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and cell fusion activities are present. The middle component of the envelope is a lipid bilayer acquired from the host cell as the virus buds off the cytoplasmic membrane. The innermost surface of the envelope is a non-glycosylated membrane protein layer that maintains the outer structure of the virus. The paramyxoviruses can be characterized by the gene order of the viral proteins and by the biochemical characteristics of the proteins associated with viral attachment.
