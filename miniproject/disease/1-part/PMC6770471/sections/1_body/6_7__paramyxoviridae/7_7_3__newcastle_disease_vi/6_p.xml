<p>On the other hand, in vitro studies showed that the quasispecies distribution of the avirulent isolate harbored 10% of variants bearing the virulent F0 region (RRQRRF). Gene sequence analysis of Australian NDV isolates showed the existence of a novel clade of NDV viruses with the F0 cleavage site sequence of 
 <sup>112</sup>-RKQGRL-
 <sup>117</sup> and the HN region bearing seven additional amino acids. Four field isolates (NG2, NG4, Q2–88 and Q4–88) belonging to the novel clade were propagated for a longer time period in CEF cells prior to sequencing. Analysis revealed the existence of 1–2% of virulent strains with the F0 cleavage site of
