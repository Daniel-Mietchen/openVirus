<p>Quasispecies analysis of all the NDV field isolates in this study showed variable ratios (1:4â€“1:4000) of virulent to avirulent viral F0 sequences. However, these sequences remained constant in the quasispecies population during replication. It was concluded that the virulent strains present in the quasispecies population did not emerge from an avirulent viral population unless the quasispecies population was placed under direct selective pressure, either by previous infection of the host by other avian viruses or by transient immunosuppression [
