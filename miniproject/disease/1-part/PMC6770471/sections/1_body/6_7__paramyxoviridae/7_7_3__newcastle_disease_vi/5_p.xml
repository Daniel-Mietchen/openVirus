<p>Gould et al. reported the presence of the F0 cleavage sequences of 
 <sup>112</sup>-RRQRRF-
 <sup>117</sup> and HN extensions of 45 amino acids in virulent Australian NDV strains [
 <xref rid="B129-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Furthermore, the genome analysis of the avirulent field isolates of NDV puts forth the existence of viruses with virulent F0 sequences without causing obvious clinical signs of the disease [
 <xref rid="B130-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Subsequently, Kattenbelt et al. studied the underlying causes that could affect the balance of virulent (pp-PR32 Vir) and avirulent (pp-PR32 Avir) variants throughout viral infections. The variability of the quasispecies population and the rate of accumulation of mutations in vivo and in vitro were analyzed. The in vivo analysis showed that both virulent and avirulent plaque-purified variants displayed a rise in the variability of quasispecies from 26% and 39%, respectively. The error rate in the viral sequences was observed to increase as well, such that one bird out of three displayed virulent viral characteristics (
 <sup>112</sup>-RRQRRF-
 <sup>117</sup>) after passaging of the PR-32 Avir variant. Genome analysis following the in vivo study revealed that a single base mutation occurring in the F0 region led to the switch from RRQGRF to RRQRRF.
