<p>With their diverse differences in size, structure, genome organization and replication strategies, RNA viruses are recognized as being highly mutatable [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Their high mutation rates make it very difficult for therapeutic interventions to work effectively and very often they develop resistance to antiviral drugs and antibodies elicited by vaccines [

 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This poses a real threat to how emerging infectious agents could be prevented or treated [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The success of the evolution of RNA viruses arises from their capacity to utilize varying replication approaches and to adapt to a wide range of biological niches faced during viral spread in the host. One of the factors affecting the emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases is the genetics of the infectious agents [
