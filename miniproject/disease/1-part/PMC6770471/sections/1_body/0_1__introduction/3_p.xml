<p>Such heterogeneity within the virus population could be explained by the existence of not a single genotype within the species but rather an ensemble of related sequences known as the quasispecies [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Developed by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster, the concept of quasispecies was defined as a mutant distribution dominated by a primary sequence with the highest rates of replication between the components of the mutant distribution. The phenomenon of quasispecies was further supported by the “hypercycle” theory as a self-organization principle to include different quasispecies in a higher-order organization that eases evolution into more complicated forms such that the coding capacity and catalytic activities of proteins are taken into account [
