<p>Mutants with varying levels of infectivity generated from a mutated gene occurred regularly in a virus population due to the high mutation rates [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The error-prone replication ability of RNA viruses and the shorter generation times can be used to explain the variations in evolution rates between DNA and RNA viruses. While mutation rates for DNA genomes have been estimated to be between 10
 <sup>−7</sup> and 10
 <sup>−11</sup> per base pair per replication [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed typically low fidelity whereby the mutation rate is of roughly 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mutations per nucleotide copied, which is greater than that of almost all DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This characteristic of the RNA polymerase in RNA viruses led to the generation of diverse offspring with different genotypes in shorter generation times.
