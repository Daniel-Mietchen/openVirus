<p>The phenomenon of quasispecies has been well reported for many viruses belonging to different families and genera [

 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There is no clear idea whether emerging viruses such as Zika virus, Ebola virus, West Nile virus, Dengue virus and many others owe part of their evolution to higher virulence conferred by the presence of specific quasispecies within the viral population. Exploring the underlying mechanism of virulence stemming from a quasispecies population remains of interest. In this review, we examine reported cases of quasispecies and their implications on virulence.
