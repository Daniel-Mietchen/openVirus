<p>The poliovirus population diversity was evaluated in the brain of the murine model during viral spread. It was observed that only a fraction of the original injected viral pool was able to move from the initial site of inoculation to the brain via the ‘bottleneck effect.’ To determine the maintenance of the quasispecies during infection in vivo, 6–10 weeks old mice were inoculated in the leg with individual viruses. Total RNA recovered from the brain tissues revealed that four viruses were shown to be capable of spreading to the brain with their introduced mutations unchanged. Therefore, it was postulated that the innate immune response reduced the viral pathogenicity by limiting the diversity of viruses during spread to vulnerable tissues [

The “tough-transit” model suggests that virus trafficking within the murine model has a low probability of success passing the blood-brain barrier. However, once in the CNS, it acts as a founder virus and re-establishes a population with initial limited diversity. On the other hand, the “burned bridge” model stipulates that it is not tough for the virus to physically reach the blood-brain barrier. Thus, when the first few viruses reach the gateway to the brain, the host innate immune response triggers an antiviral state [
