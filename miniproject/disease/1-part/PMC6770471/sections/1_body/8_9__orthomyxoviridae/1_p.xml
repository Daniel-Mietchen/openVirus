<p>The family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> belongs to the order of 
 <italic>Articulavirales</italic> and contains seven genera—
 <italic>Influenza A-D</italic>, 
 <italic>Isavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Thogotovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Quaranjovirus</italic>. The virions within the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family are usually spherical but can be filamentous, 80–120 nm in diameter (
