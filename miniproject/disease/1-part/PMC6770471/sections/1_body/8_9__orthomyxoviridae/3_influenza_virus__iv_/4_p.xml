<p>A study aimed to identify the key mechanisms contributing towards co-pathogenesis of BALB/c mice infected with the A(H1N1) quasispecies. It was revealed that the co-evolution of the quasispecies brought about a complex response due to different expressions of the biphasic gene. A significant upregulation of the Ifng was associated with an increased majority of mutants expressing a differentially expressed gene (DEG) named 
 <italic>HA-G222</italic> gene. This correlated with the increased levels of pro-inflammatory response observed in the lungs of the mice infected with the quasispecies A(H1N1) [

Serial passages of the H1N1 virus was also carried out prior to the analysis of its sequential replication, virulence and rate of transmission. Sequence analysis of the quasispecies in the viral population revealed that from the ninth passage onwards, the presence of five amino acid mutations (A469T, 1129T, N329D, N205K and T48N) in the various gene segments (
 <italic>PB1</italic>, 
 <italic>PA</italic>, 
 <italic>NA</italic>, 
 <italic>NS1</italic> and 
 <italic>NEP</italic>) was detected. Furthermore, mutations located within the HA region indicated that the genetic makeup of the viral quasispecies was distinctly different in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the infected pigs [
