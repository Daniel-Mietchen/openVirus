<p>Orthomyxoviruses employ many different splicing techniques to synthesize their viral proteins while making full use of the coding capacity of the genome. The virion envelope originates from the cell membrane with the addition of one to three virus glycoproteins and one to two non-glycosylated proteins. The viral RNA polymerase (PB1, PB2 and PB3) is involved in the transcription of a single mRNA from every fragment of the genome. The transcription is triggered by cap snatching and the poly(A) tail is added by the viral polymerase stuttering on the poly U sequence. Alternative splicing of the MP and NS mRNA led to the mRNA coding for M2 and NEP proteins. PB1-F2 is translated by leaky scanning from the PB1 mRNA. The structural proteins common to all genera include three polypeptides, the hemagglutinin which is an integral type I membrane glycoprotein involved in virus attachment, the envelope fusion and the non-glycosylated matrix protein (M1 or M) [
