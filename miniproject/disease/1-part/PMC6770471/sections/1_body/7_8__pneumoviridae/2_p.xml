<p>The virions of the pneumoviruses are enveloped with a spherical shape and a diameter of about 150 nm. They have a negative-sense RNA genome of 13 to 15 kb (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f008">Figure 8</xref>A). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) binds to the genome at the leader region and sequentially transcribes each gene. The cellular translation machinery translates the capped and poly-adenylated messenger RNA of the virus in the cytoplasm. Members of the genus 
 <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> possess 10 genes including NS1 and NS2 which are promoter proximal to the 
 <italic>N</italic> gene. The gene order is 
 <italic>NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). Alignment of the L proteins showed moderate conservation of the sequences between the human and bovine viruses. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) differs from HRSV in host range and the two viruses bear substantially similar sequences as well as antigenic relatedness [
