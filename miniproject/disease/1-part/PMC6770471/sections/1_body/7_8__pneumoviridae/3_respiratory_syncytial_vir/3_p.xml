<p>Deplanche et al. studied the BRSV and evaluated the genetic stability of BRSV in cell cultures by analyzing the consensus nucleotide sequences of the highly variable glycoprotein G. The BRSV strain W2–00131 was isolated from a calf with respiratory distress syndrome (BAL-T) and was further propagated in bovine turbinate (BT) cells. The genomic region of the BRSV that encodes for the highly variable glycoprotein G showed constant genetic stability for the three variants (3Cp3, 3Cp9 and 3Cp10) after ten continuous passages in BT cells and after in vivo studies [

 <sup>−4</sup> to 10.1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per nucleotide in vitro and in vivo.
