<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> under the family 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> of the order Mononegavirales. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the primary cause of infection of the upper and lower respiratory tracts with mild, cold-like symptoms in infants and young children. The virus spreads through tiny air droplets. Globally, there are 4â€“5 million children younger than 4 years with HRSV infections and more than 125,000 are hospitalized every year in the United States. Although the risk of hospital admission is higher in known risk groups such as prematurely born infants. RSV is also responsible for 14,000 deaths in the elderly &gt; 65 years of age annually in the United State [

Clinical infections stem from yearly outbreaks of the disease during winter and primarily affect calves less than 6 months of age. The target infection site of the viruses are the epithelial layer of the upper and lower respiratory tracts that can damage the bronchioles, leading to severe onset of bronchiolitis in caws [
