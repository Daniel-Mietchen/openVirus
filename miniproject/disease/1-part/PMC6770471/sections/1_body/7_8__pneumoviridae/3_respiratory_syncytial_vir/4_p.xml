<p>The majority of the mutations reported previously were present in the W2â€“00131 RNA populations. A large dominance of non-synonymous over synonymous mutations was observed in all BRSV mutants. The non-synonymous mutations mapped preferentially within the two variable antigenic regions of the ectodomain or close to the highly conserved domain in the G protein [
 <xref rid="B137-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. These results suggested that BRSV populations might have evolved as complex and dynamic mutant swarms, despite apparent genetic stability.
