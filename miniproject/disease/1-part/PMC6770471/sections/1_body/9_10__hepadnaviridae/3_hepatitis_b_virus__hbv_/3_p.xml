<p>In an attempt to elucidate the link between HBV quasispecies and the role of nucleotide analogues present in the quasispecies population, the heterogeneity and distribution of HBV quasispecies using the RT and S regions as a baseline to document the mutation sites were investigated. The quasispecies for the selected regions was analyzed using 608 sequences. In the RT region, no major differences in the composition and diversity of the quasispecies was identified at the nucleotide or amino acid level in patients who responded well to antiviral therapy and those who did not. Similar findings were observed when the S region was examined. However, sequence analysis within RT and S regions showed that the rtM204V/I resistant mutation was observed across the majority of samples prior to the rescue therapy. Interestingly, the frequency of this mutation was noted to drop six months post treatment. Moreover, 3 out of 5 stop codons consistently observed within the RT and S regions were reported to be associated with nucleotide analogue (NA) resistance and affected the HBsAg reading frame. However, the complexity and diversity of the quasispecies of HBV were similar between the CHB patients responsive to the treatment and those who did not. It can be inferred that the characteristics of the quasispecies in CHB patients at the start of the study was not associated to the various viral responses observed in the cohort. Hence, the RT and S regions might not be adequate sites to monitor the response of CHB patients to the rescue treatment [
