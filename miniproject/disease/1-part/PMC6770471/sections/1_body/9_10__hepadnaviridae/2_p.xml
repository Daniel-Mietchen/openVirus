<p>Complementary to the viral mRNA is a full length negative strand whereas the positive strand is of varied length. The 5′-NTR of the negative strand DNA is covalently attached to the terminal protein (TP) domain of the viral DNA polymerase whereas the 5′-NTR end of the positive sense DNA has a 5′-capped oligonucleotide primer covalently attached. The 3′-NTR of the positive strand ends at a variable position in different molecules and creating a single stranded gap [
