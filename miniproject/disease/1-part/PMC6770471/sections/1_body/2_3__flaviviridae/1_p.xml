 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>,

 <xref rid="B31-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The virions are 40–60 nm in diameter, spherical in shape and contain a lipid envelope (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The majority of these viruses are arthropod-borne and transmitted via infected mosquitoes and ticks. They are considered as emerging and re-emerging pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Zika Virus (ZIKV) and these viruses pose a global threat to public health by causing significant mortality [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The flaviviral genome is approximately 11 kb and has a single open reading frame (ORF), which is flanked by untranslated regions (5′ and 3′ NTR). The ORF encodes three structural proteins (C, M and E) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS). The non-structural proteins include large, highly conserved proteins NS1, NS3 and NS5 and four small hydrophobic proteins NS2A, NS2B and NS4A and NS4B (
