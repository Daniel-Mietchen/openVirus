<p>The nsp1 was reported to suppress protein synthesis by degrading the host mRNA but viral RNA could circumvent the nsp-1 mediated translational shutoff. Terada et al. showed that the double mutations (A9G/R13A) in the non-structural protein 1a (nsp1) affected viral propagation and the plaque morphology. The size of the plaque in the mutated MERS-CoV was smaller and the infectious titers and intracellular viral RNA were decreased in infected Huh7 or Vero cells when compared to the wild-type virus. The formation of the small plaque variant was due to impairment of viral replication via the disruption of the stem-loop (SL) structure of the RNA. In addition, analysis of the biological properties of the nsp1-A9G/R13A mutant showed that the mutant virus possessed low binding activity at the 5′-UTR and promoted translational shutoff against reporter plasmids with or without 5′-UTR [
