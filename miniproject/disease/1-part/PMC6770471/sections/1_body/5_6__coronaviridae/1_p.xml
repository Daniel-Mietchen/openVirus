<p>Viruses within the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family are positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses capable of infecting three vertebrate classes comprising mammals (
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Torovirus</italic>), birds (
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic>) and fish (
 <italic>Bafinivirus</italic>). Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses identified so far with the enveloped spherical virions of about 120–160 nm and the viral genome is about 31 kb in length (

 <xref rid="B97-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The genome consists of many ORFs. Two thirds of the 5′ end is occupied by a replicase gene comprising two overlapping ORFs namely—ORF1a and ORF1b. The four structural proteins are spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid (N). Accessory regions that are group specific ORFs are designated as ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b and ORF5 [
