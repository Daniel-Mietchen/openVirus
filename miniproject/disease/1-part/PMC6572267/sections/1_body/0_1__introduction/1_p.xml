<p>Yellow fever (YF) is a severe acute disease with high lethality (20–50% among symptomatic cases) [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is caused by yellow fever virus (YFV), an arbovirus of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. The virus is exclusively transmitted to its hosts through bites of female mosquitos of some species of the family Culicidae [
 <xref rid="B2-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disease presents two distinct transmission cycles: the sylvatic cycle and the urban cycle. Although these cycles share similarities regarding their etiology and disease evolution, they have different vectors and hosts. The main vector for the sylvatic cycle in the Americas is

 <italic>janthinomys</italic> Dyar, 1921, which is widely distributed in Brazil from the state of Santa Catarina in the south to the North Region of the country [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The main hosts of the virus are non-human primates (NHP’s), such as howler monkeys (
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> sp), while humans become infected accidentally. The main vector of the urban cycle is 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic>) 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (Linnaeus, 1972), however there have been no reports of urban yellow fever in Brazil since 1942 [
