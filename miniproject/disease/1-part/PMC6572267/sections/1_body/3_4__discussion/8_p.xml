<p>In Brazil, other arthropod-borne diseases with symptoms similar to YF and their transmission through the same vectors can generate confusion in the diagnosis of human cases. In this sense, Costa [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] detected the circulation of MAYV in 34 patients in 2015–2016 in the metropolitan region of Cuiabá in the state of Mato Grosso, while in 2013, Serra [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found mosquitoes infected with MAYV in Cuiabá, suggesting the circulation of this virus outside the Northern Region of Brazil where it is endemic. 
 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> is considered the main vector of Mayaro virus disease [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and despite the high number of 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> collected (n = 158), MAYV was not detected in the present study. Further studies to monitor the circulation of this virus to reduce the risk of possible outbreaks in the Southeast Region, where it may already be circulating, are recommended.
