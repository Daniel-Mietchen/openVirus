<p>The municipalities where infected mosquitoes were found in the present study—Nova Lima and Brumadinho—had, altogether, 50 YF confirmed cases with 14 deaths during the outbreak period (2017–2018). In addition, NHP epizootics were recorded in January 2018 in Brumadinho and in November 2017 and January 2018 in Nova Lima. Although the three areas where YFV were isolated (Areas 2, 3 and 4) are not as close to the urban perimeter as Area 1, six large residential condominiums are connected to them through ecological corridors, which can easily permit passage of mosquitoes and NHPs. Most of these residential condominiums are located within large areas of Atlantic Forest, which is ideal habitat for species of the genus
