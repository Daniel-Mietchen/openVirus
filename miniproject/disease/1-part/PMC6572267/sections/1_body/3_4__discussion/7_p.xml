 <xref rid="B33-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], no copies of ZIKV viral RNA were detected in any mosquito collected in the present study and, therefore, further studies are needed to identify if there is a Zika sylvatic cycle occurring. However, since it was not the main objective, no NHP survey in the PESRM in the EEF was performed in this study.
