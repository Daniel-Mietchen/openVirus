 <xref rid="B25-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for the same species in Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Dégallier’s and the present study collected mosquitoes during, or shortly after, human YF cases were reported in the studied areas. Confirmation of the YFV infection through the virus isolation technique confirmed that the viruses detected in primary screening by RT-qPCR were infective particles.
