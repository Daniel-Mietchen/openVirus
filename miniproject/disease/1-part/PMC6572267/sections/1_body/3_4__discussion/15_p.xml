<p>One of the factors that could explain the increase in cases of YF is the exacerbated degradation of some natural environments. By losing their natural habitats, some species of NHPs have been forced to change and inhabit modified environments and suffer from overpopulation of small forest patches. In addition, the high density of non-immune NHPs in the Southeast coast, such as marmosets, in forests infested by 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> favored the propagation of wild epizootic waves of the YFV to this region and, consequently, human infection. However, further research is needed to understand the dynamic of YFV spread through vast geographic extensions. It has been suggested that the YFV had an average dispersion of about 3 km per day in the Southeast since the beginning of 2017 [
