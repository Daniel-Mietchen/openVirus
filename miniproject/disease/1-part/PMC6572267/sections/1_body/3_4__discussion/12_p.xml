 <xref rid="B7-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Brazil, the recommended areas for vaccination covered the north, mid-west and part of the southeast regions and in 2017, more than 4469 municipalities were included in the list. It has been observed that the displacement of the virus appears to be occurring rapidly, spreading to the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and progressing in more areas in these states until 2018.
