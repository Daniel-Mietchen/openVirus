<p>The lack of detection of either DENV or CHIKV in the collected mosquitoes, despite recurrent epidemics in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], indicates that these two viruses do not seem to be circulating in the wild environments or in other possible vectors in the evaluated period (September 2017 to May 2018). This data suggests that the transmission of these viruses most likely occurs through the bite of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, which is the main vector of these two diseases [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and circulates mostly in urban areas [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The fact that no urban area was selected for this study may have contributed to the non-collection of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> specimens.
