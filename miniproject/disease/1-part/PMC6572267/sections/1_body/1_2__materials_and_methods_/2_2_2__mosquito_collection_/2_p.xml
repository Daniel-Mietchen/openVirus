<p>The objective of the first field collection (September) was to perform a detailed survey of the mosquito fauna. Thus, all collected mosquitoes were mounted on entomological pins and identified to species or genus according to the classification proposed by Harbach &amp; Kitching [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and specific identification keys of the Coleção de Mosquitos Neotropicais (CMN; Neotropical Mosquito Collection) of the Instituto René Rachou (IRR; René Rachou Institute). These specimens served as a reference to accelerate the identification of mosquitoes collected in subsequent field trips in order to conserve any viral RNA present in mosquitoes. Species that were not sampled during the first field trip were thawed and mounted. All mounted mosquitoes were ultimately deposited in CMN.
