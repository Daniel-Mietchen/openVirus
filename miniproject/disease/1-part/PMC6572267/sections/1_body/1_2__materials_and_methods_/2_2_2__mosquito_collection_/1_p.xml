<p>Mosquitoes were collected in September and December of 2017 and in February, March and May of 2018. Due to low yield and operational problems, the February collection was repeated in March. Daytime collections were carried out in the afternoon with a manual aspirator, an entomological net and automatic traps (HP model) [

 <sub>2</sub> lures (dry ice). Night collections were carried out only with automatic traps baited with light and CO
 <sub>2</sub>, which were withdrawn the following morning. Two automatic traps were placed approximately 1.5 m off the ground with 20 m distance between them in all four points. All mosquitos were collected at ground level. Climatic conditions were recorded for all collections using thermohygrometer (Icoterm, Porto Alegre, Brazil). Collected mosquitoes were placed in individual tubes and stored in a styrofoam box with dry ice (to preserve viral RNA) before storage in a −80 °C freezer.
