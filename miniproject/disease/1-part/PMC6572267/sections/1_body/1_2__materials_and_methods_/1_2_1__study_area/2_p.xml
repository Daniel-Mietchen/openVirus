<p>Three sampling areas were selected in PESRM and one in EEF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00136-f001">Figure 1</xref>). All four sampling areas were located in dense forest with little wind incidence, close to watercourses and 150 m to 1.5 km from inhabited areas. Area 1 (44°00′12″ W, 20°00′12″ S) was located 150 m from the district of Barreiro in the city of Belo Horizonte; Area 2 (43°58′12″ W, 20°00′47″ S) was located 1 km from a residential condominium in the municipality of Nova Lima; and Area 3 (44°00′02″ W, 20°04′05″ S) was located 1.5 km from a district of the municipality of Nova Lima and 3 km from a district of the municipality of Brumadinho. Area 4 (43°57′53″ W, 20°04′21″ S) was the only sampling area located in EEF and was selected because it is located near residential condominiums of the municipality of Nova Lima, however it differs from Area 2 as it has a larger area of forest. The location of each point was obtained through the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) (GPSMAP
 <sup>®</sup> 62s, GARMIN, Olathe, KS, USA).
