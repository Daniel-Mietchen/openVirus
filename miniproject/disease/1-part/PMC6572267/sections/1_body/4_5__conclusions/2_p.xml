<p>Although there have been recent advances in understanding the eco-social determinants involved in the rapid spread of the YFV, several gaps in knowledge still exist. Systematic epidemiological surveillance programs of mosquitoes and NHPs are necessary and would be very effective for monitoring the circulation of the virus. In addition, continued vaccination campaigns would help to keep vaccination coverage at a high level. New NHPâ€™s immunization strategies are also crucial in parks, conservation areas and zoos, protecting endangered species and preserving biodiversity. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of monitoring the circulation of viruses near large urban centers and the search for an effective control and management of these arboviruses to minimize outbreaks such as those that occurred in the last two years. </p>
