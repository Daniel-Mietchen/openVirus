<p>Absolute quantification of virus presence in mosquitoes was performed through a standard curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00136-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). Positive mosquitoes possessed, on average, 7.54 Ã— 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies of YFV viral RNA. None of the collected mosquitoes were found to possess viral RNA of the other viruses tested (dengue, chikungunya, mayaro and Zika virus).
