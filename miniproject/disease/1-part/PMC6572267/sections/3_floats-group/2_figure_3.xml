   <bold>a</bold>) Quantification by RT-qPCR of YFV RNA copies per mosquito (
   <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic>) by area. Area 1 (PESRM—Belo Horizonte city), Area 2 (PESRM—municipality of Nova Lima), Area 3 (PESRM—Brumadinho municipality) and Area 4 (EEF—Nova Lima municipality). The bar in area 4 represents the mean obtained from the 11 positive specimens (8.42 × 10
   <sup>7</sup>). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Quantification of viral copies after seven and 10 days post viral isolation in C6/36 cells. From this, 13 positive samples from the primary screening were isolated. As the negative control, the mock (red triangle) was used. Twelve samples increased the viral amount (full black triangle). A single sample decreased the amount of viral RNA from seven to 10 days (empty black triangle).
