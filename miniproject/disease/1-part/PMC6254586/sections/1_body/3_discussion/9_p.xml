<p>After the first human infection with the A(H7N9) virus in Shanghai, all 464 LPMs were temporarily closed on 6 April 2013. The LPMs were cleaned and disinfected, and relevant authorities in the neighboring provinces were informed that vehicles should not transport live poultry to Shanghai municipality. He et al suggested that the poultry in LPMs may have infected humans, with or without direct contact.
 <xref rid="b39-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In January 2014, the Shanghai municipal government issued a ban stating that the LPMs would be regularly closed from every Chinese New Year to April. After the LPMs were closed on the 2014 Chinese New Year, no cases were reported in the second epidemic. However, the closure of LPMs may not be the deciding factor in preventing the occurrence of A(H7N9) in Shanghai because a few of the remaining A(H7N9) cases occurred during the ban period from 2015 to 2017. The start dates of the LPM closures in Shanghai were 29 February 2015, 8 February 2016, and 28 January 2017.
