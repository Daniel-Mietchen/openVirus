<p>NA offers an excellent target for antiviral drug development. R292K substitution in NA has been reported to be resistant to NA inhibitor antiviral drugs.
 <xref rid="b31-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In the current study, only 4% of the Shanghai strains (3 of 73 isolates, only including the isolates in 2013) contained the antiviral resistance R292K mutations, and no substitutions were observed in the environmental strains. These findings show that NA inhibitor antiviral drugs may provide a valid remedy for A(H7N9)-infected patients in Shanghai.
