<p>Geographically, A(H7N9) virus infection extended from eastern to western China across the epidemics. In addition, an increasing number of cases of human infections was observed in the fifth epidemic compared to any of the previous epidemics in mainland China.

 <xref rid="b36-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> discovered that during the first epidemic in Shanghai, late antiviral treatment and a long duration of viral shedding resulting from deficient knowledge among the general public of the A(H7N9) virus were more likely to be associated with a fatal outcome. Cases of A(H7N9) infection gradually decreased from the first epidemic to the fourth epidemic, and only four fatal cases and 28 total cases were observed in Shanghai in the last four epidemics. This decrease in the number of A(H7N9) infection cases and the low fatality rate may be associated with enhanced public awareness, which resulted in a reduced risk of A(H7N9) virus infection,
