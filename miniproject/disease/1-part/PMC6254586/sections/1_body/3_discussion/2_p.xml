<p>The NJ method is a well-known distance method, and the ML method is the most commonly used analysis in phylogenetic tree construction.
 <xref rid="b25-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We applied the two methods and compared the results of the constructed trees in this study. We observed that these two trees were broadly congruent with the topology and shared some internal nodes and branches near the ancestral node in the analysis of HA and NA proteins. The ancestral HA and NA genes of the A(H7N9) virus were observed in SH05, SD015, and SD016, as these viruses were phylogenetically close to the common ancestor. While a five-amino-acid deletion (positions 69â€“73) in the HA stalk region is considered a characteristic feature of wild aquatic bird viruses adapted to terrestrial birds, these three viruses contain a long stalk in NA, 186G, and 226Q in HA, indicating that these viruses are associated with aquatic bird viruses. Wang et al
 <xref rid="b24-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> concluded that early viruses such as these strains could spread to terrestrial birds and acquire a five-amino-acid deletion (QISNT) in the NA stalk region, producing terrestrial poultry-adapted SH1-like viruses. However, how the SH05 without both G186V and Q226L and the strains with either G186V or Q226L could still infect humans requires further investigation.
