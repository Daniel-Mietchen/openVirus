<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-idr-11-2411">Figure 1</xref>, five epidemics of A(H7N9) outbreak have swept through the Shanghai municipality. There were seasonal changes in the number of infected cases, and most humans were infected with A(H7N9) virus during November to March. From January 2013 to December 2017, a total of 59 human cases of A(H7N9) infection was reported in Shanghai (
 <xref rid="t1-idr-11-2411" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); at least 20 (34%) of these infections resulted in death (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-idr-11-2411">Figure 2B</xref>). The first epidemic of human infections with the A(H7N9) virus began in early 2013 in mainland China, followed by four consecutive epidemics with 33, eight, eight, four, and six laboratory-confirmed cases. Regarding the occurrence of bird and environmental cases, 20 cases were reported in the first epidemic, one case in the second epidemic, two cases in the third epidemic, one case in the fourth epidemic, and two cases in the fifth epidemic. In both human and bird and environmental cases, more infections were reported during the first epidemic than during the last four epidemics put together (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-idr-11-2411">Figure 2C</xref>). Given that each epidemic combined into a single period to minimize the risk of the small sample size, 80% of infections occurred in males (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-idr-11-2411">Figure 2A</xref>), and the median age was 61.5 years (range, 2â€“89 years). The median age in the first epidemic was 68 years, much older than that observed during the entire period; in the fifth epidemic, the median age was 51.5 years, which was much lower than that observed in other epidemics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-idr-11-2411">Figure 2D</xref>). We were unable to analyze correlation among epidemics, and the estimates as presented above should be regarded as indicative because of the small number of cases of human infection in the second to fifth epidemics.
