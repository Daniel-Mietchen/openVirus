<p>All Shanghai viruses as well as WHO-recommended vaccine candidates had P42S and N205S substitutions, indicating their enhanced virulence in mice and altered antiviral response (
 <xref rid="t5-idr-11-2411" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). However, the D92E mutation in the NS protein related to increased virulence and/or cytokine resistance was found only in SH05. In the genes of the SH05 strain, we observed some mammalian adaptation signatures such as the I368V mutation in PB1, K356R in PA, and avian-like signatures including G186 and Q226, which retained the 69â€“73 amino acids in the stalk region in HA and V100 in PA. Ren et al
 <xref rid="b21-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> conjectured that SH05 had more avian influenza-like characteristics and was genetically distinct from other human influenza-like strains, representing a precursor of A(H7N9) subtypes co-circulating among humans. It was observed that SD015 and SD016 had more avian influenza-like characteristics than SH05.
