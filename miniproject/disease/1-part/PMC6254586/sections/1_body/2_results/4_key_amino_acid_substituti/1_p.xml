<p>The genetic characteristics of Shanghai strains that were associated with host range, receptor binding specificity, and antiviral tolerance were analyzed. We found that 91% (50/55) and 92.7% (51/55) of strains contained G186V (H3 numbering) and Q226L/I mutations, respectively, in the HA protein, which may enhance the human receptor binding affinity of the virus.
 <xref rid="b17-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> SH05, SD015, and SD016 had no mutations with 186G and 226Q, while A/chicken/Shanghai/S1410/2013 had G186V mutations with 226Q, and SH1 and A/Minhang/S01/2013 had Q226L/I mutations with 186G (
