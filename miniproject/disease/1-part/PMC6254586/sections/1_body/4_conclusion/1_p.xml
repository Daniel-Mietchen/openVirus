<p>In summary, we found that genetically new A(H7N9) strains emerged in every epidemic in Shanghai, and most of the emergent strains had affinity for human-type receptors. The A(H7N9) viruses circulating within Shanghai belong to high-virulence and low-pathogenic influenza viruses, considering their NA deletion (positions 69â€“73) and the insertion of single basic amino acids within the HA cleavage site. In addition, it is likely that NA inhibitor antiviral drugs may be a valid remedy for A(H7N9)-infected patients in Shanghai, based on the fact that only three Shanghai viruses during the first epidemic contained the R292K mutations and no environmental or bird samples including the mutations had yet been reported. This study also indicates that the HPAI A(H7N9) virus that emerged in the fifth epidemic is of avian origin because it is phylogenetically closely related to a Shanghai chicken strain. The improved public awareness of A(H7N9) pandemic risk,

However, LPAI A(H7N9) viruses found in poultry and environmental samples were continually detected in Shanghai across the epidemics, increasing the risk of new emerging A(H7N9) outbreaks. Also, LPAI or HPAI A(H7N9) viruses could spread through poultry transportation and bird migration pathways.
