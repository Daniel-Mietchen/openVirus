<p>Here, we conducted an epidemiological investigation of A(H7N9) outbreaks in Shanghai and analyzed the A(H7N9) virus strains originating in Shanghai from 2013 to 2017. The phylogenetic and genetic characteristics of A(H7N9) viruses separated from Shanghai were investigated to reveal the evolutionary history of A(H7N9) viruses in Shanghai, along with a detailed discussion on the molecular evolutionary dynamics of the virus. Our findings provide insight into the outbreaks of A(H7N9) virus in Shanghai.</p>
