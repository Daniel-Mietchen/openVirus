<p>One of the viral diseases of zoonotic concern, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) has recently been declared as a notifiable disease in India due to its expanding geographical distribution, on which, the article by Kulkarni 
 <italic>et al</italic>. has given a comprehensive Indian perspectives over highlighting the recent progress, focusing challenges with diagnosis and prophylactic interventions
 <bold>. </bold>Lately, Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) or Multidrug Resistance (MDR) has become a serious health issue, globally. Even resitance in virus has been noted. The review article on “The Quest for Materials-based Hydrogels with Antimicrobial and Antiviral Potentialities” by Iqbal highlights the current concepts in this area. The review has pin-pointed various methodological approaches including biomaterials-based therapeutic hydrogels aiming to resolve these issues. The information is also given on the potential research activities, and possible mechanisms of actions of hydrogels are discussed with a closeup look at the future recommendations. In recent years, the two porcine viral diseases have gained the attraction of researchers due to the losses associated with them and influence of concurrent infections. In this area, the research group of Mukherjee 
 <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the expression of various cytokines including IL2, INF_G, IL-10, TNF_Beta, IL12 and TNF Alpha by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in growing piglets based on the viral load of two main porcine viruses namely porcine circovirus 2 and classical swine fever virus to define the influence of co-infection on host immunity. Another article on “Zoonotic viral diseases of equines” by Kumar 
 <italic>et al</italic>. provided an overview of the infectious zoonotic diseases and their impact on human and animal health. Among the emerging viral infections, a new addition is the Picobirnavirus, which has been documented in enteric and respiratory infections in several mammalian and avian host species. It is an opportunistic infection seen more commonly with immune-compromised individual with concurrent infection. The review article by Malik 
 <italic>et al</italic>. emphasized on its relevance to Indian human and animal population. This viral infection of wide host range needs the attention of researchers globally to find out its control measures.
