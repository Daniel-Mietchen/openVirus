<p>The influenza A virus is a negative-sense single-strand RNA virus with a lipid envelope. The viral genome is divided into eight segments that encode nine structural proteins and a variable number of nonstructural proteins depending on the virus strain and host species. Each segment is packaged in a complex together with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, composed of polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2) and polymerase acidic (PA) proteins, involved in viral RNA transcription and replication [
