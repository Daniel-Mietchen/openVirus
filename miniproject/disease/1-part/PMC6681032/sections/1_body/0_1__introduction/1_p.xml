<p>Influenza caused by influenza A virus is an infectious respiratory disease, which is responsible for seasonal epidemics and periodic global pandemics. This infection causes mild to severe illness, including death, in persons with an increased risk for severe diseases, including the elderly, infants, and the ill, resulting in three to five million severe cases and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide [

However, for the elderly, vaccination may be less efficient and may increase complications and death. Four classes of antiviral medicines are currently available. These include (i) the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (Roche), zanamivir (GlaxoSmithKline), peramivir (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals), and laninamivir octanoate (Daiichi Sankyo); (ii) the M2 ion channel blockers rimantadine (Sun Pharma) and amantadine (Endo); (iii) favipiravir (Toyama Chemical), which inhibits the ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase; and (iv) a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, baloxariv marboxil (Shionogi) [
