<p>We intended to analyze the anti-influenza activity of 4′-ethynyl adenosine derivatives, namely EFdA (
 <bold>1</bold>), 4′-ethynyl-2′-deoxyadenosine (EdA, 
 <bold>2</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-02603" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoroadenosine (EA, 
 <bold>3</bold>), based on our hypothesis that EFdA analogs may work against the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-02603" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The adenosine derivatives of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>3</bold> were evaluated for their in vitro anti-influenza activities against the H1N1 virus using MDCK-SIAT1 according to a procedure that has been previously described [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-02603" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The deoxynucleoside-type derivatives 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> displayed modest and weak activities, respectively, whereas the nucleoside-type derivative 
 <bold>3</bold> did not show any activity (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02603-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The cytotoxicity of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>3</bold> was also determined using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, and the following table presents the results. No cytotoxicity was observed at the highest concentration tested by the CCK8 assay (1 mM).
