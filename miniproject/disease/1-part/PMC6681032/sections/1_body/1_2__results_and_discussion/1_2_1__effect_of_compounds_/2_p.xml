<p>Here, 5′-OH should have been triphosphorylated when derivatives 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> worked as a chain terminator in cells. This phosphorylation process was stepwise. First, 5′-OH was transformed by cellular phosphatase into generating 5′-
 <italic>O</italic>-monophosphate. Next, 5′-monophosthate was transformed into 5′-diphosphate and then into 5′-triphosphate. We assumed that the cellular phosphatase involved in the first step could slowly phosphorylate the 5′-OH of the derivatives because 5′-OH was sterically hindered by the 4′-ethynyl group. However, a 5′-
 <italic>O</italic>-monophosphate analog could be much more efficiently phosphorylated by cellular phosphatase to generate a 5′-diphosphate analog. We designed compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> based on these assumptions (

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-02603" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> equipped the cyclosaligenyl (cycloSal) group on phosphate ester, which increased the compound permeability [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02603" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This phosphate ester should have been cleaved by esterase in cells as a prodrug. We synthesized a 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-monophosphate analog called EFdAP (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02603-f002">Figure 2</xref>) (data not shown) and evaluated its anti-influenza activity. However, the activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 57 μM) was not improved when compared to EFdA. Therefore, we decided to synthesize and evaluate the activity of EdAP (
 <bold>5</bold>).
