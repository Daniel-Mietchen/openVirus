<p>The in vitro anti-influenza activity of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02603-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Consequently, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> significantly inhibited the growth of the influenza virus, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.8 Î¼M, whereas no cytotoxicity was observed at the highest concentration tested by the CCK8 assay (1 mM). The maximum inhibition level of 
 <bold>5</bold> was around a 79% decrease of influenza virus-produced NPs. This level is comparable to that of oseltamivir. Considering the result that the anti-influenza activity of the parent compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was weak, phosphate ester 
 <bold>5</bold> presumably worked as a prodrug. The introduced phosphate ester could be cleaved in cells to generate phosphate monoester. EdA (
 <bold>2</bold>) was easily hydrolyzed by adenosine deaminase to generate the corresponding inactive inosine derivative [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-02603" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, EdAP, which has the same scaffold as EdA, except in the case of cyclosaligenyl phosphate ester, exhibited anti-influenza activity. Thus, the cycloSal phosphate group could prevent the conversion of EdAP by adenosine deaminase, or other unknown mechanisms may exist.
