  <p>Inhibition of the influenza virus growth in the MDCKâ€“SIAT1 cells by EdAP (
   <bold>5</bold>). Upper panel: The number of influenza virus-produced nucleoproteins (NPs) in cells decreased with an increase in EdAP concentration, as indicated. Lower panel: The reduction in the relative numbers of influenza virus-produced NPs in cells was a function of EdAP (filled circle and solid line) or oseltamivir carboxylate (open square and dashed line) concentrations, as indicated.
