<p id="Par17">Dependent on the phylogenetic analysis, our isolates clustered into three clades (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For instance, the isolates from JX and SH grouped into G1 (E122, E222 and E225, E229, E230 and E820), and the isolates from DQ (E158, E307, E312, E316, E318, E325 and E329) and HRB (E110, E112 and E119) clustered into G6. The isolates derived from DQ had slight differences from the known G6 subgenotypes A, B, C, and D. Thus, we clustered these isolates into a new subgenotype, G6E. However, two isolates (E101 and E102) from HRB were distinguished from the currently known BLV isolates and clustered into an independent branch. Here, we defined these two isolates as a new genotype, G11, adding to the members of the BLV genotype family. Thus, both G6 and G11 existed in the HRB region. In fact, we obtained isolates E101, E102, and E110 from the same herds, which indicated that multiple genotypes of BLV existed within one farm. Unlike in HRB, the isolates from JX, DQ, and SH were derived from a single “parental” strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which indicated a stable spread of BLV transmission.
