<p id="Par15">Based on the nested PCR results, we performed a sequencing analysis. Here, we used the 423-bp gene of gp51 (derived from nested PCR-acquired 600 bp fragments) for the downstream phylogenetic analysis. To construct a phylogenetic tree, we acquired 60,423-bp gp51 sequences that were deposited in GenBank, including the currently known 10 genotypes of BLV. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the alignment is shown between our isolates and G6 CAM69 (GenBank accession# KJ66816.1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In this alignment, we identified 36 substitutions in our obtained nucleotide sequences. Among these substitutions, twelve were nonsynonymous, and the others were silent. The twelve nonsynonymous substitution sites included residues 131 (nt 391), 133 (nt 398), 134 (nt 400), 135 (nt 404), 140 (nt 419), 143 (nt 427), 144 (nt 431), 146 (nt 437), 177 (nt 529), 181 (nt 542), 189 (nt 566), and 232 (nt 694).
