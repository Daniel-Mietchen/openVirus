<p id="Par19">In this study, we initially investigated the general status of BLV epidemics in partial regions of HLJ, China. The nested PCR was stable and reliable in our investigation (matched well with our preliminary serological test of BLV gp51). However, the CoCoMo-qPCR-2 was verified to be more sensitive in monitoring BLV-infected individuals (12.5% versus 10% in the nested PCR assay). Therefore, the CoCoMo-qPCR-2 should be considered a priority for subsequent BLV proviral DNA detection.</p>
