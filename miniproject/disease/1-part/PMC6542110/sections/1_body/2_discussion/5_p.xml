 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Recently, de Brogniez Alix et al. confirmed that N-linked glycosylation of the BLV SU protein could affect its pathogenicity and found that N129 was a probable glycosylation site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which was beneficial for viral escape from neutralization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In the variation analysis of our isolates, the N129 glycosylation site in the ND2 region was not affected by the NAS to NAT substitution. In addition, a nonsynonymous substitution of the N-linked glycosylation site (NKT to NKS) has also been detected in the B-epitope region (N230, a critical glycosylation site indicated by de Brogniez Alix et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). Overall, these conserved N-linked glycosylation sites were unaffected, probably due to their importance in biological functions in vivo. In the ZB, the cysteine (residue 152) in the motif FLHLKQCHGI was critical for zinc-ion binding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. We also observed this conserved site in our isolates, although other variation sites also existed within the ZB. In addition to the ND2/ZB, we also detected variations in the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell epitope/E-epitope region and the B-epitope region, which were similar to previous observations of substitutions in these epitope regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Unlike the gp51 region, the BLV p24 region showed a relatively conserved feature, which could facilitate the development of BLV assay kits and vaccine candidates.
