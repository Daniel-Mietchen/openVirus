<p id="Par21">Phylogenetic analysis for subtype 3a sequences in the Core-E1 region revealed that most HCV sequences from incarcerated individuals (5 out of 7, 71%) clustered with sequences from the general population and PWID from Cyprus (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Specifically, 4 of them (57%) grouped together with PWID sequences and 1 showed close phylogenetic relationship with single isolates from both the general population and PWID. While the exact origin of the latter sequence cannot be identified, a plausible hypothesis is that it originated from an PWID. A single case fell within a monophyletic group of five sequences from PWID in Cyprus (group I). The branch lengths of the whole group were very short suggesting a recent origin of HCV transmissions within the group.
