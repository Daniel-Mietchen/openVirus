<p id="Par23">Similar analyses for subtype 1b (Core-E1), revealed that three out of four sequences from the target group (75%) clustered directly with PWID strains from Cyprus, although the putative origin of the last infection could not be identified. One sequence from incarcerated individuals fell within a cluster of three sequences from PWID connected with short branches. Phylogenetic analysis in NS5B confirmed only the clustering for the one sequence from among incarcerated individuals. This may be due to the larger number of references included in the NS5B region. Based on findings in Core-E1, the putative origin of most HCV transmissions among the incarcerated population is likely from PWID although from less evidence than for subtype 3a. While HCV sequences from incarcerated individuals sometimes group with the general population, the results in both the Core-E1 and NS5B regions suggest close phylogenetic relationships with PWID in subtypes 1b and 3a on an increasingly global scale.</p>
