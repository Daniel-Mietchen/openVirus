<p id="Par14">The patterns of cross-border HCV dispersal for the most prevalent subtypes (1a, 1b, and 3a) in Cyprus were estimated by means of statistical phylogeographic analysis using globally sampled HCV sequences as references. The analysis was performed in two partial genomic regions (Core-E1 and NS5B) for which reference sequences from diverse geographical areas comprising Cyprus and globally distributed countries were available. The availability of global reference sequences allows phylogeographic analysis in partial Core-E1 and NS5B regions to reveal HCV epidemiological relationships between Cyprus and the respectively sampled regions from each area. Inferences about the origin of HCV transmission events were based on estimations of the number of viral mobility events (migration events) between sampled locations.</p>
