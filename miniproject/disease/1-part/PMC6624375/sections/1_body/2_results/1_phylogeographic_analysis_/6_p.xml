<p id="Par19">The inferred viral mobility for the HCV epidemic in Cyprus suggests a diverse trans-continental pattern for each subtype, with infections originating from nearby and distant countries. 1a transmissions originated from limited locations in Western Europe, Southeastern Asia, and Oceania, 1b transmissions from Western and Eastern European areas, from Central and Eastern Asia, and Oceania, and 3a transmissions from Eastern and Western Europe, Central Asia, and Oceania. The USA provided a significant source for only one of the three subtypes (1b) analysed. Cyprus was a source for transmissions to several areas for subtypes 1b and 3a, but not for subtype 1a for which outgoing viral mobility was limited.</p>
