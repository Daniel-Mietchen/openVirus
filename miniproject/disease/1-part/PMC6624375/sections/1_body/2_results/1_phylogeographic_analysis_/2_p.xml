<p id="Par15">Phylogeographic analysis of Core-E1 revealed that subtype 1a infection in Cyprus originated from Switzerland and Thailand (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>) while analysis of NS5B revealed infections originating from Switzerland and Thailand, but also Great Britain, Italy, Australia and New Zealand (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>). Subsequent statistical phylogeographic analysis revealed the locations of significant sources of HCV viral mobility to Cyprus. The viral mobility events estimated between the different locations are described in Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>. Interestingly, for both genomic regions, the United States of America (USA) was not revealed as a significant source for the 1a subtype in Cyprus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The estimated viral migrations shown in Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref> correspond to population size equal to those used as the source (exporting) and sink populations in this analysis.
