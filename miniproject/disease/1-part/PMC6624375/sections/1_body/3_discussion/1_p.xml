<p id="Par24">This study used phylogeographic analysis to investigate the origins of HCV transmission to and from Cyprus and trace the global origin and dynamics of infections among incarcerated individuals in Cyprus. Among the observed HCV subtypes, phylogeographic analysis revealed a diverse pattern of viral mobility between Cyprus and other countries. In subtype 1b, which is the dominant clade among the general population, HCV transmissions to Cyprus originated from globally distributed countries in the Americas, Oceania, Southeastern Asia, and Europe. Cyprus was also a source for outgoing international 1b subtype transmissions across a broad geographical range. These observations suggest the bidirectional nature of the viral mobility of HCV subtype 1b in analyses of both the Core-E1 and NS5B region. Similar bidirectional viral mobility was indicated by analyses of the 3a subtype. However, analyses indicated that Cyprus was rarely a source of subtype 1a transmissions to other countries as it was a sink for viral transmission of this subtype. This finding is likely a result of the low prevalence of this subtype
