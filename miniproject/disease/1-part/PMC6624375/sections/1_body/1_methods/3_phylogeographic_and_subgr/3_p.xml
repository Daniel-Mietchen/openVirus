<p id="Par11">For all migration events, the ratio of the mean of observed versus mean of expected migration events was estimated, ignoring those with expected migration events with a mean of zero. This ratio provides a measure of the amount of viral flow between different countries or subgroups that is not attributed to chance. For example, a ratio of 0.70 suggests that the observed viral flow across the pathway is 30% lower than what is expected from chance while a ratio of 1.30 suggests a 30% higher viral flow than the expected. Such ratios are sensitive to the mean, as expected events with a mean close to “0” may produce high ratio values.</p>
