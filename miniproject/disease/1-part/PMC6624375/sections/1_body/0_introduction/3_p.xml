<p id="Par4">Our previous molecular epidemiology studies suggested that among Cypriot subjects, 1b and 3a were the most predominant subtypes, followed by 1a. Specifically, 3a was the most prevalent (57%) among people who inject drugs (PWID) and 1b among the general population. For people who inject drugs, the 2k/1b recombinant type that has been previously described in Russia was also detected
