<p id="Par5">Our objective was to investigate the dissemination and transmission patterns of the common Hepatitis C virus subtypes in Cyprus using phylogeographic analysis. This study is an examination of how subtype and geographic distribution affect the transmission patterns of HCV into, out of, and within Cyprus and are informed by certain risk factors. Phylogeographic analysis, which has been underutilized to studies of trends of HCV distribution and dissemination patterns, is an applicable tool to assess these topics.</p>
