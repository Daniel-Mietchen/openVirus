 <p id="Par1">Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and subtype distribution differs according to geographic origin and transmission risk category. Previous molecular epidemiology studies suggest the presence of multiple subtypes among Cypriot subjects. To investigate HCV genotype- and subtype-specific dissemination patterns, origins, and transmission in Cyprus, we analyzed HCV sequences encoding partial Core-E1 and NS5B regions. Analyzed populations comprised the general population and high-risk cohorts in Cyprus and a globally sampled dataset. Maximum-likelihood phylogeny reconstruction with bootstrap evaluation, character reconstruction using parsimony, and bootstrap trees estimated by ML were performed to identify the geographic origin of HCV subtypes and statistically significant dispersal pathways among geographic regions. Phylogeographic analyses traced the origin of subtypes in the general population and among PWID in Cyprus to unique and overlapping globally distributed regions. Phylogenetic analysis in Core-E1 revealed that most sequences from incarcerated populations in Cyprus clustered with the general population and PWID. We estimate that HCV infections in Cyprus originate from multiple global sources while most HCV transmissions among incarcerated individuals occur locally. This analysis is one of a few studies tracing HCV dispersal patterns using global datasets, and these practices and findings should inform how HCV epidemics are targeted by future prevention policies.</p>
