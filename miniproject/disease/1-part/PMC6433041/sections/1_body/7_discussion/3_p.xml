<p>NPV in Kenya may occupy a niche that is taken by GFV and KARV in northern Africa or eastern and central Asia. Several characteristics of NPV suggest parallels between the host ranges of NPV and GFV. GFV has been detected in rodents (

 </xref>) but has been detected in arthropods in only a single study in sand flies (

 <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> species under laboratory conditions (Tesh R. Studies of the biology of phleboviruses in sand flies. Paper presented at Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA, 1983), suggesting that GFV is maintained in a transmission cycle that involves rodents and sand flies and that it occasionally infects humans (

  <italic>35</italic>
 </xref>). NPV was isolated from sand flies and replicates in vitro in sand fly–derived cell lines but not in mosquito cells, similar to sandfly Sicilian and Naples viruses (
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>41</italic>
 </xref>). Infection studies with cell lines derived from livestock and peridomestic wildlife species showed that NPV replicates ≈10–100 times better in rodent and swine cell lines than in cells derived from other animals, suggesting the involvement of rodents or swine as potential amplificatory hosts for NPV.
