<p>To obtain initial data on permissiveness, we performed in vitro growth analyses in a broad range of cell lines derived from different insect species (sand fly and mosquito), peridomestic wildlife (rodent, nonhuman primate, and bat), and livestock (swine, goat, chicken, and cattle) species, as well as from humans. Results revealed a broad susceptibility to NPV, with peak genome copy numbers in cells derived from swine and rodents (
