<p>Classical criteria for species demarcation in phleboviruses are based on serology, with established species showing at least 4-fold differences in 2-way neutralization tests (

 </xref>). We confirmed that NPV did not react with antiserum against its next closest relatives, GFV and KARV, in neutralization tests (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). NPV Gn protein was 13% different and Gc 4% different from GFV. The Gn protein of phleboviruses is the key component for neutralization and is recognized by specific neutralizing antibodies (
