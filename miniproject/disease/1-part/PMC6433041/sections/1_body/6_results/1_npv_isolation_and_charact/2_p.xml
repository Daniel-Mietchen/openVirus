<p>Analysis of the complete genome by next-generation sequencing confirmed isolation of a novel phlebovirus. The virus was tentatively termed Ntepes virus, after the location where the sand flies were collected. The virus exhibits the characteristic tripartite-segmented genome organization of phleboviruses, comprising the large (L) segment, which encodes the RdRp protein; the medium (M) segment, encoding a glycoprotein precursor protein (GPC) that is posttranslationally cleaved into 2 viral surface glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and a nonstructural protein (NSm); and the small (S) segment, encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein and a nonstructural protein (NS) in an ambisense manner (
