<p>We intracerebrally inoculated 100 μL of the viral stock of the first passage, as well as 3 consecutive 2-fold dilutions, into 3–4-day-old Swiss Albino suckling mice. The doses used in the experimental infection were quantified by plaque assays in Vero cells as described previously (

 <sup>6</sup>, 1 × 10

 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL. We included noninfectious MEM as a negative control. We observed all mice 2 times/day for up to 14 days for signs of disease. We homogenized brains from recently dead mice in 1 mL of cell culture media and plaque-titrated them on Vero cells.
