  <p>Evolution analysis of LNV isolated worldwide from 1990 to 2014. Maximum clade credibility tree for the 10th segment of LNVs isolated from 1990 to 2014 worldwide. The tree identified 3 distinct lineages, genotype 1, genotype 2 and genotype 3.Genotype 1 contained the initial LNV isolate (LNSV-NE97–31) and seven Australian isolates (Blue). Genotype 2 consisted of isolates all from Xingjiang province in western China (Green). Genotype 3 comprised LNV isolates from Qinghai province, Shanxi province and Liaoning province (another initial LNV isolate LNSV-NE97–12) (Red). Estimated tMRCAs of these lineages (with their 95% HPD values in parentheses) are presented. The posterior probability values of main branch nodes were indicated. The letters G1, G2 and G3 represent genotypes 1,2 and 3, respectively</p>
