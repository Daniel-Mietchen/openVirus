<p id="Par37">According to the 95% HPD intervals and bayes factor, the Bayesian skyline model with a relaxed molecular clock was selected to be the best fit model. The MCC tree was established using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The posterior probability values of each branch node were all greater than 0.7, showing the robustness of the result. The mean nucleotide substitution rate for the entire LNV population was estimated to be 1.6 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> s/s/y (95%HPD:2.8 × 10
 <sup>− 4</sup>,3.3 × 10
 <sup>− 3</sup>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At this evolution rate, the tMRCA of the LNV was calculated to be 272.6 years ago (95%HPD:58.9,790.3). The LNV evolved chronologically into three major evolutionary populations, genotype 1, genotype 2 and genotype 3.Genotype1, which included the initial isolate (LNV-NE97–31) from Liaoning province of China and seven strains from Australian, emerged 73.0 years ago (95%HPD:28.9,193.0) and demonstrated to be the oldest lineage. Genotype 2 emerged about 46.5 years ago (95%HPD:18.8,113.5) and was composed of LNV strains isolated from Xinjiang province in western China. Genotype 3, which appeared approximately 25.3 years ago (95%HPD:17.4,46.6), included isolates from Qinghai province, Shanxi province and Liaoning province (another initial isolate LNV-NE97–12), and was the youngest LNV lineage.
