<p id="Par43">In order to further explore whether these mutations affected the three shape and the surface charge density of the cell attachment protein of LNV, the three dimensional structures and electrostatic potential analysis have been conducted between different genotypes of LNV. Seven of the twenty common amino acid differences were located in the β-sheet (residues 82, 122, 131, 132, 181, 223, and 238), while the remaining thirteen were located in the loop region (residues 44, 60, 64, 65, 68, 99, 160, 167, 171, 207, 209, 217 and 219). These differences have some effect on the structure and electrostatic properties of VP10 between the different genotypes. In particular, the residue at position 64, 65, 131, 132, 167, 171, 207, 209 and 219.There were great differences existed the R group of the amino acid and the electrical polarity of the mentioned 9 mutations, resulting in significant differences in structure and charge at these sites between the LNVs (Fig.
