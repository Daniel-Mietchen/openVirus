<p id="Par42">To characterize the mutations in the cell attachment protein (VP10) between the three genotypes of LNV, we analyzed the amino acids encoded by the VP10 genes derived from the previously mentioned LNV isolates. The results revealed that the ORF of VP10 was 753 nucleotides in length and encoded 250 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of genotype 1 were significantly different from those of the rest two genotypes while the genotype 2 and 3 shared a great similarity in amino acid sequences. The detailed results were that a total of 20 common amino acid differences identified between genotype 1 to genotype 2 and 3 (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The amino acid sequences were highly similar between genotype2 and 3 and there were only 3 amino acid differences were identified (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). When compared the amino acid sequences of genotype 1 to those of genotype 2 and 3, twenty common amino acid differences were identified as follows: S44A, A60G, D64G, S65N, H68V, N82A, P99A, V122T, M131S, A132G, S160N, I167S, Q171S, A181L, E207D, S209V, T217N, S219N, N223H, N238S.The amino acid sequences of genotype 2 and 3 were highly similar, there were only three amino acid mutations: S58A, A130N, L210H.
