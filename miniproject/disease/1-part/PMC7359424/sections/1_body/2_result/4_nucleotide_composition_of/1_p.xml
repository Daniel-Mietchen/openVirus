<p id="Par40">The values of nucleotide contents in the entire LNV population and each genotype were analyzed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The results showed that VP10 genome of LNV was rich in A and U (A + U &gt; C + G) and the percentage of AU was reaching 59.5%. The A%, U%, G%, C% are 26.0% ±0.6 (mean ± SD), 32.3% ± 1.3, 18.7% ± 0.4, 23.1% ± 0.4, respectively. There was a common trend in the usage of A,U,G,C between the three genotypes that was U &gt; A &gt; 0.25 &gt; C &gt; G (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As for each genotype, the average contents of A,U,G,C for genotype 1 were 27.6% ± 0.5, 29.0% ± 0.5, 19.8% ± 0.2, 23.5% ± 0.3,for genotypes 2 were 25.8% ± 0.3, 32.8% ± 0.5,18.5% ± 0.2, 23.0% ± 0.4 and these values for genotypes 3 were 26.3% ± 0.2, 30.7% ± 0.3, 19.4% ± 0.1, 23.7% ± 0.2. The value of the A content in genotype 1 was the highest while that in genotype 2 was the lowest.
