<p id="Par39">The Sequence analyses of 80 strains of LNV isolated from different vectors and locations during 1990–2014 revealed that the level of nucleotide similarity varied from 70.4 to 100% with an average value of μ = 92.6% while the amino acid similarity ranged from 75.0 to 100% with an average value μ = 94.6% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Genotype 1 exhibited nucleotide similarity between 87.5–100% (μ = 94.3%) and amino acid similarity range from 91.2 to 100% (μ = 96.4%).Genotype 2 exhibited nucleotide similarity from 92.5 to 100% (μ = 97.8%) and amino acid similarity from 92.5 to 100% (μ = 98.9%). Genotype3 exhibited nucleotide similarity from 97.5 to 100% (μ = 99.2%) and amino acid similarity from 98.1 to 100% (μ = 99.4%). The results demonstrated that the genotype 1 population possessed the highest degree of nucleotide and amino acid variation among all the three LNV genotypes.
