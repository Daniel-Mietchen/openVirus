 <italic>Seadornaviruses</italic> could be carried by a variety of blood-sucking insects including mosquitoes, ticks, and midges and even have been isolated from pigs, cattle and patients with fever and encephalitis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies have also shown that BAV, which is the prototype of genus 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic>, is an emerging pathogen that causes human viral encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>Seadornaviruses</italic> may well be a group of newly discovered viruses close related to human and animal diseases [
