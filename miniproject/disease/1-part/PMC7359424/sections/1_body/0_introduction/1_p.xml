 <italic>Liao ning virus</italic> (LNV) belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic> comprises 3 species, 
 <italic>Banna virus</italic> (BAV), 
 <italic>Kadipiro virus</italic> (KDV) and LNV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Seadornaviruses</italic> have a genome composed of 12 segments of double-stranded RNA, which decreases with the relative molecular weight during gel electrophoresis, and is named 1–12 segments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The full length of the LNV genome is about 21,000 bp, with segment lengths that range from 3747 bp (segment 1) to 759 bp (segment 12). Each segment contains a open reading frame encodes a viral protein (Viral protein, VP), of which 5 are non-structural proteins (VP5, VP6, VP7, VP11, VP12), 7 are structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP8, VP9, VP10).VP10 protein is an outer capsid structural protein which directly interacts with the receptor of host cells and is the main region that determines the antigenicity of the virus [
