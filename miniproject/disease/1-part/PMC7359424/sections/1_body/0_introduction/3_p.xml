<p id="Par29">LNV was initially isolated from mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes dorsalis</italic>) in Liaoning province, northeast China in 1997 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], since then additional isolates have been isolated from mosquitoes (genus 
 <italic>culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>) in Shanxi province and Qinghai province in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].Interestingly,it is observed that all of the LNVs have only been isolated from the northern part of China and no LNV has been reported in other provinces in China and abroad [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].Once, the LNV has been considered to be a virus specie only restricted in northern part of China. Until a recent research reported that number of LNV strains have been isolated from mosquitoes of four genera (
 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>) in Australia in 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This result demonstrated that LNV was not only limited in mainland China but also widely distributed in Australia in the South Pacific region. All of these research suggested that LNV was a widely distributed virus that could be transmitted by kinds of blood-sucking vectors and its geographical distribution even exceeds that of the other two 
 <italic>Seadornaviruses</italic> (BAV, KDV) [
