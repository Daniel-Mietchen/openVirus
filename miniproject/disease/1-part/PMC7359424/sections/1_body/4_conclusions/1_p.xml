<p id="Par50">In this study, the evolution analysis of LNVs revealed that the virus belongs to the emerging virus group. In particular, it was suggested that the genotype 1 LNVs were a group of segmented double-strand RNA virus with extremely adaptability, which have a large group of vectors, a high rate of genetic variation and apparent active transmissibility that can adapt to different geographical environments over a quite long distance. Recently, the genome information of LNV was reported to be detected in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> of African origin, reminding us that LNVs was not only limited to China in Asia and Australia in the South Pacific region but may well be extended to Africa and even posing a high risk of spreading to new areas such as Central Asia and Europe. It is well known that genetic mutation such as recombination or reassortment can easily occur in segmented RNA virus. For example, BAV which also belongs to the 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic>, was originally discovered in southern China. However, several novel variants of BAV have been found, such as the BALV isolate from Hungary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and the 
 <italic>Mangshi virus</italic> from southern China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Considering LNV was the only specie in 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic> that can replicate in mammalian cell lines and cause fatal haemorrhagic symptoms in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it might be a pathogen that has great potential to cause disease in human and (or) animals. Therefore, to strengthen the research on genetic variation of LNV and to clarify the relationship between LNV and zoonosis is not only a research topic for virologists, but also a scientific issues for public health communities.
