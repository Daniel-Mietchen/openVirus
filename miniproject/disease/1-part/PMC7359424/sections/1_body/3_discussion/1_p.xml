<p id="Par44">During the arboviruses survey in China in 1997, two virus strains (LNSV-NE9731 and LNV-NE9712) were obtained from 
 <italic>Aedes dorsalis</italic> mosquitoes in Liaoning province in North-East of China which were found to cause cytopathic effect in C6/36 cells. The virus was designated 
 <italic>Liao ning virus</italic> (LNV) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since then, additional strains of LNV were isolated from Shanxi province, Qinhai province and Xinjiang province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A more than 30 years national arbovirus surveillance in mainland China revealed the LNV strains had only been isolated in a long and narrow region covering 73–125 ° E and 31–48 ° N in the northwest to northeast part of the country. No strains of LNV have been reported isolated in other regions of China or abroad [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, a recent research reported a total of 35 strains of LNV were isolated from mosquitoes belonging to four genera (
 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles, Mansonia and Aedes</italic>) collected from 1988 to 2014 in Australia in the southern hemisphere. The isolation sites included New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia, almost across the entire Australian continent. Thus, it is obvious that the geographical distribution and the vectors of LNV are wide and variable in Australia. What is more, the initial LNV isolate in Australian was obtained from mosquitoes collected in 1988, predating the first Chinese LNV isolate which was obtained in 1997 [
