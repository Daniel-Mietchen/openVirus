<p id="Par45">Several phylogenetic analysis have been conducted on the LNVâ€™s nucleotide sequences, previously. The LNVs isolated in China could be divided into 3 evolutionary branches. The LNSV-NE9731 strain isolated in Liaoning province in 1997 formed an independent evolutionary branch while another Liaoning isolates named LNSV-NE9712 clustered together with the isolates from Qinghai province and Shanxi province that formed a branch. All of the Xinjiang isolates grouped together formed the largest evolutionary branch [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. All of the Australian LNV isolates were divided into two disparate lineage, one composed the isolates from eastern and northern Australia and the other included the isolates from western and southern Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this study, a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of all the LNVs isolated from China and Austrila demonstrated that the LNVs could be divide into three genotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Genotype 1 included LNSV-NE9731 (isolated in Liaoning provinve of China in 1997) and 7 strains from Austrila (the mosquito collection time was 1990,2005,2007,2013 and 2014, respectively). A total of 68 strains of LNV isolated from Xinjiang province of western China clustered together that formed an independent branch. And the strain LNV-NE9712 isolated in 1997 together with the Qinghai and Shanxi isolates formed the genotype 3 evolutionary branch. This result suggested that the Australia LNV isolates were not only restricted and circulated in Australia and even this virus population transmitted a long way to northern China in Asia then evolved into new LNV populations with local circulation characteristics.
