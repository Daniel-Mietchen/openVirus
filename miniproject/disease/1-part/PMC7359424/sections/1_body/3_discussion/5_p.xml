<p id="Par48">Additionally, there was a very interesting finding that the AU content was relative high in VP10 of LNV, whereas the AU content was also high within the LNV’s whole viral genome (data not shown). These results were consistent with the prior studies wherein A and U frequencies were higher than C and G frequencies for avian 
 <italic>rotaviruses</italic> and some 
 <italic>flaviviruses</italic> including 
 <italic>dengue virus</italic> (DENV), 
 <italic>West Nile virus</italic> (WNV), y
 <italic>ellow fever virus</italic> (YFV) and JEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Besides, the nucleotide composition of the BAV, which is the prototype species of genus 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic>, was also observed a higher AU content [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It has been reported that the AU-rich genome structure facilitate the 
 <italic>Human Immunodeficiency virus</italic> (HIV) to avoid recognition by the innate immune system of host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, the biological causes and the consequence for increased A and U within the LNV and other mentioned arboviruses genome are still unknown, so enhanced experimental studies are required to explore the AU rich molecular function in LNV.
