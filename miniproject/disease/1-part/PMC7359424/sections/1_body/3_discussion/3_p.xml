<p id="Par46">The time-scaled evolutionary analysis of LNV revealed the branching of the lineages occurred in the following order:genotype 1 emerged 73 years ago (95%HPD:28.9, 193.0), the genotype 2 at 46.5 years ago (95%HPD:18.8, 113.5) and genotype 3 at 25.3 years ago (95%HPD:17.4, 46.6.) Thus, genotype 1 is the oldest lineage and the genotype 3 is the youngest one (Table
