<p id="Par47">Although the LNVs were initially isolated from several inland provinces in China, the phylogeopgraphic analysis of our study showed that the LNV likely originated from Australia in the South Pacific region and the genotype 1 viruses spread northward from Australia to Liaoning province in northeast China. The reasons that LNV originated in Australia and spread to the Asian continent may be related to the following factors: First, Australia is located in the South Pacific region and contains a variety of geographic climate types, including the subtropical humid climate in the east, the savanna climate in the northwest, the tropical rain forest climate in the northeast, and Mediterranean climate in the southwest [

Second, the nucleotide similarity of genotype 1 was the most divergent between all of the three genotypes, indicating greater population variability exists in Australian LNVs.
