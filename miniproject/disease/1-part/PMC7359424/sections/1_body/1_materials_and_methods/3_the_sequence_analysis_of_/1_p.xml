<p id="Par35">Sequence similarity and nucleotide base composition analysis were performed using the CLUSTALX software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], BioEdit software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] MEGA-X [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and MegAlign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). Hemi (version1.0) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] software visualized the similarity comparison results of LNV and Rstudio made the nucleotide base composition analysis map of LNV.
