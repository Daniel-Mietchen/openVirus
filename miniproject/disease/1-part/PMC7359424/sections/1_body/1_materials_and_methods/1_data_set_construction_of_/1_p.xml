<p id="Par32">LNV is a 12-segment double-stranded RNA virus. The 10th segment gene encodes the viral cell attachment protein, which directly interacts with the receptor on host cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, the phylogenetic analysis based on this segment can best demonstrated the evolutionary and dispersal trends of viral strains from different isolation sites and vectors. Thus,we downloaded all the 10th segment gene sequences of LNV from GenBank as of June 2019 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The data set contained 80 sequences, representing the samples isolated from kinds of mosquitoes:genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 64), genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), genus 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3),unidentified mosquitoes (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). The LNV isolation sites included the Liaoning province, Shanxi province, Qinghai province and Xinjiang province in China as well as New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia in Australia. The geographical distribution extends from Australia (113°E-153°E, 10°S-42°S) to mainland China (73°E-135°E, 3°N-53°N) (Fig.
