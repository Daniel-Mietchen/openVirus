<p id="Par33">The 10th segment sequence database of LNV was analyzed using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The GTR + I + G substitution model was selected to be the optimal model by MrModelTest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Bayesian time scaled phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide substitution rate and most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of LNVs were coestimated using the BEAST software package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The relaxed clock model with different demographic models was tested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and the best models were selected by means of a Bayes factor (BF) test using marginal likelihoods values (2lnBF &gt; 2) and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals. The chain length was 1,000,000,000 generations. Convergence of parameters was checked using TRACER (
