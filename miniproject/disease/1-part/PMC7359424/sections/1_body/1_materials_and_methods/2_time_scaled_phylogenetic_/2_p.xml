<p id="Par34">In order to clarify the geographical dispersal history of LNVs, the bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) was used to provide evidence for statistically supported diffusion between state variables under BEAST software package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This method estimates the most probable state at each node in the MCC trees, allowing us to reconstruct ancestral positions for ancestral viral lineages along the tree. For phylogeographic reconstructions, each region was coded as a discrete trait. BSSVS output and surfaces representing uncertainty for continuous diffusion processes were formatted as KML using the SPREAD software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Determination of each locality was coordinated and performed using Google Earth. ArcGis was finally used to display the dispersal pattern of LNV based on the phylogeographic analysis.
