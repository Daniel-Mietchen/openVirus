<p id="Par36">The crystal structure of the cell attachment protein VP9 of BAV (PDB 1w9z) was selected as the best template for the homology modeling. The YASARA software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], PyMol software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and VMD (version 1.9.2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] were used to analyze the structures and surface charge density of VP10 among LNV isolates.
