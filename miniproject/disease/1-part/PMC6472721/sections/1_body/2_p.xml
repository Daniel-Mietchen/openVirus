<p>Without implementation of a nationwide functional surveillance system, thorough investigations of disease determinants cannot be achieved to preempt disease trends and initiate control measures before they affect large populations. A sustainable surveillance program with potential epidemic indicators is also required to reduce the risk of virus transmission by generating early warnings, which is among the best-known interventions considering the fact that impeccable vector control is not feasible. Although Pakistan is known to be at high risk for arboviral infections, with unswerving epidemics of dengue and CCHF each year, the disease prevention and control measures are still below par. The very recent CHIKV outbreak, initially perceived as a “mysterious” pathogen [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007118.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is a testament to debilitated preparedness plans existing at the local and regional scale. Considering the fact that humans are the only amplifying host for such anthroponotic pathogens, the most effective interventions, such as vector control and isolation and restriction of patients to terminate further transmission, may not be readily achievable in resource-poor countries like Pakistan; thus, it is imperative to identify areas with the greatest risk of infection to inform and implement control prioritization measures. Our findings further highlight the strengthening of laboratory services at provincial and at-risk districts to generate accurate information for patient management and sensible allocation of health resources.
