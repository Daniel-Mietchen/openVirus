<p>Chikungunya infection is not new to Pakistan, as the presence of anti-CHIKV antibodies has been reported in rodent and human sera since the 1980s [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007118.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. After a lapse of three decades, the first cases were reported from Sindh Province and the Federal Capital, with cases expanding to three provinces by mid-2017 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007118.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A sharp decline in cases was observed by the end of 2017, after the onset of winter, leading to restricted vector activity. We hereby present an update on CHIKV testing at National Institute of Health in Islamabad, the only public-sector laboratory at the federal level providing free diagnostic services for pathogenic arboviruses. Interestingly, utilization of the Trioplex real-time PCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007118.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] assay helped us to screen samples for two additional flaviviruses (dengue and Zika virus), making this the first ever study on Zika virus screening from Pakistan. Out of a total 1,549 samples tested through July 31, 2018, we found chikungunya and dengue infection in 776 (50%) and 109 (7%) patients, respectively, without a single patient positive for Zika virus. Our data further reflect the importance of population mobility and the abundance of potential mosquito vectors (

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) as key factors favoring efficient virus transmission in Pakistan. Likewise, even though this is the first CHIKV outbreak reported at a vast geographical scale in Pakistan, identification of concomitant cases across all four provinces indicates an increased gravity of the burden of mosquito-borne diseases in the coming years.
