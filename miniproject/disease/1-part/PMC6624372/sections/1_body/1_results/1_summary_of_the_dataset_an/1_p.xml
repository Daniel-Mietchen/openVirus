<p id="Par7">The final dataset used in this study contains 59 geo-referenced outbreaks of waterborne HEV (caused by HEV-1 and HEV-2). To date HEV outbreaks have occurred in Africa, Asia and central America (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, most of the HEV outbreaks have been reported in Asia (59%) and in Africa (39%). More specifically, 27% of all reports of water-related outbreaks caused by HEV-1 and HEV-2 have occurred in the north of India (Ganges Valley). Notably, the main source of freshwater in the region, one of the most populated in the world is the Ganges river, which is the third largest river on the planet by discharge and highly polluted

Another geographical region with recurrent occurrence of HEV outbreaks is equatorial Africa including Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Uganda, among others. In these countries, the current number of recorded outbreaks also account for 27% of the total. Frequently, outbreaks in Africa occur in refugee camps

The rest of the outbreaks occurred in other Asian or African countries. Only one HEV outbreak (caused by HEV-2) has been reported outside these regions, namely in Mexico in 1986
