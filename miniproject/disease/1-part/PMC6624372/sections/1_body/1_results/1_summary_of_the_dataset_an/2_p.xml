<p id="Par8">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the average number of cases per outbreak was higher in Asia than Africa (7,677 and 1,436 cases/outbreak, respectively). Similarly, the estimated cumulative incidence rate of HEV in Asia for the studied period (1980–2017) was 7.38 cases/100,000 population, whereas in Africa it was 3.90 cases/100,000 population. The incidence proportion was also higher in Asia than Africa (0.006 and 0.015%, respectively). The comparative risk (ratio of the incidence proportion) between Asia and Africa is thus 2.5, indicating that the risk of being infected by HEV in a waterborne outbreak is 2.5 times higher in Asia than in Africa.
