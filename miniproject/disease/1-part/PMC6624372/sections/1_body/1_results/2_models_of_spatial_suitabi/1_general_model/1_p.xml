<p id="Par9">The combination of variables used in the general model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) resulted in an AUC value of 0.96 for the training data and 0.91 for the test data, while a value of 0.5 corresponds to a random prediction (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Plots showing how the model’s omission on test and training samples compare to the predicted omission, and its ROC curve and AUC values are shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1(A)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2(A)</xref> (supplementary information), respectively. The specific variables contributing the most to the general model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) were: the population density (by far the most important variable with a percent contribution and permutation importance of 80.9 and 76.3, respectively), the annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 11.4 and 12.2, respectively) and the precipitation seasonality (percent contribution and permutation importance of 3.8 and 1.4, respectively). Specifically, under this model the suitability for the occurrence of HEV increases with the population density, the annual potential evapotranspiration and the precipitation seasonality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, supplementary information). As seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, when population density is included in the model, the geographical regions with highest ecological suitability for the occurrence of HEV outbreaks are India, Pakistan, Java Island and northeast China in Asia, the Pacific coast of Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela in central and South America, Morocco and other African countries above the Equator, and the region around Makkah (Saudi Arabia) and the Red Sea coast of Yemen in the Middle East.
