<p id="Par11">In order to identify differences between the variables that best predict the occurrence for HEV in Africa and Asia, additional models were obtained using only outbreak data of Africa or Asia (African and Asian model, respectively). In turn, for each subset of the data we obtained a general model (including population density data) and an environmental model (which only includes environmental information and not population density). The general model obtained with outbreak data from Africa have AUC values of 0.91 for the test data and 0.96 for the training data, and the environmental model showed AUC values of 0.94 for the test data and 0.94 for the training data (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, supplementary data). Under the African model based on environmental and population density data, the most important variables are annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 46.6 and 37, respectively), population density (percent contribution and permutation importance of 34.4 and 26.2, respectively), and precipitation during the warmest quarter of the year (percent contribution and permutation importance of 10.9 and 8.6, respectively). If we only use environmental data and outbreak data from Africa, the most important variables are annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 64.7 and 15.3, respectively), and precipitation during the warmest quarter (percent contribution and permutation importance of 12 and 15.9, respectively) and precipitation during the driest quarter of the year (percent contribution and permutation importance of 8.7 and 0, respectively). Both models predict similar distribution of ecological suitability for HEV as compared to the general model obtained using the complete outbreak dataset. Nevertheless, under the African models, the HEV suitability in the Ganges Valley is remarkably lower than expected under the full-dataset general model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, supplementary data). This is surprising considering that this region is the one with more reported outbreaks to date globally. Conversely, the general and the environmental model obtained with outbreak data in Asia have AUC values of 0.98 for the test data and 0.99 for the training data (general model), and 0.95 for the test data and 0.96 for the training data (environmental model), respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). While these AUC values are much higher than those obtained by the African models or the full-dataset models, the HEV ecological suitability predicted by the models obtained with outbreak data from Asia are not consistent with the full model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, supplementary data). Particularly, the Asian models, only predict a high ecological suitability for HEV in the south-east Asia. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, under the Asian models the most important variables are population density for the general model (percent contribution and permutation importance of 96.5 and 98.3, respectively); and for the environmental model mean temperature of the wettest quarter (percent contribution and permutation importance of 40.9 and 25.1, respectively), annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 20.5 and 7.5, respectively) and precipitation seasonality (percent contribution and permutation importance of 16.3 and 50.3, respectively).
