<p id="Par10">In order to highlight the role of environmental factors on the distribution of waterborne HEV outbreaks, we developed another model (named environmental model hereafter) using the same parameters used in the general model excepting the population density data. The AUC value of this model (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) was 0.89 for the training data and 0.90 for the test data. Plots showing how omission on test and training samples compare to the predicted omission, and the ROC curve and AUC values are shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1(B)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2(B)</xref> (supplementary information), respectively. The variables contributing the most to the model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) were the annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 56.9 and 7.1, respectively), the precipitation seasonality (percent contribution and permutation importance of 21.5 and 14.1, respectively) and, at a lesser extent, the precipitation of the driest quarter of the year (percent contribution and permutation importance of 8.4 and 2.6, respectively). In particular, under this model the predicted suitability for the occurrence of HEV outbreaks clearly increases with the annual potential evapotranspiration and the precipitation seasonality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, supplementary information). Generally, the model based on environmental information predicts a broader ecological suitability for the virus than the general model, which includes data of population density (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For example, the environmental model expects a high ecological suitability for the virus in the north of Australia and in Central and South America (especially, Brazil) while both locations are not particularly suitable if we take into account population density data. Notably, no HEV outbreaks have ever been recorded in these areas. Other areas of high suitability under the environmental model are the state of Arizona in the United States, the south of Spain and the south-east of Asia.
