<p id="Par16">Comparison between the general and the environmental model shows that if population density is not taken into account, the ecological suitability for HEV predicted by the resulting model is much broader. In fact, under the environmental model the suitability for HEV is remarkably high in countries where no waterborne outbreak of HEV has even been recorded (Australia and Brazil, for instance). This observation suggests that in absence of proper sanitation, if human population density increases in these areas, the geographical distribution of HEV epidemics could expand. Overall, considering the environmental model obtained in this work the variables that best predict the distribution of HEV are: (i) the annual potential evapotranspiration, (ii) the precipitation seasonality, and (iii) the precipitation of the driest quarter of the year. Once again, our results suggest that hydrological factors influencing river discharge may contribute to trigger the occurrence of an HEV outbreak caused by the waterborne genotypes of HEV (HEV-1 and HEV-2).</p>
