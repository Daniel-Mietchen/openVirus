<p id="Par13">In the present study we have combined outbreak and environmental data to model the ecological suitability for waterborne genotypes of HEV (HEV-1 and HEV-2) at global-scale, and determine the most important factors which favor the onset of HEV waterborne epidemics over time and space. Our dataset has highlighted geographical differences in the morbidity of the virus. Specifically, the cumulative incidence rate and the incidence proportion for HEV are much higher in Asia as compared to Africa. As a result, according to our dataset, the risk of being infected by HEV is 2.5 times higher in Asia than in Africa. Morbidity indices such as the cumulative incidence rate and the incidence proportion are a ratio of the cases of an infection or disease, and the population at risk at a certain time and region. Thus, differences in the comparative risk may be thus explained by a higher number of cases or a lower number of population at risk. Given that some of the most populated countries are found in Asia (e.g. China, India, Pakistan or Bangladesh), we can possibly rule out lower numbers of susceptible individuals in Asia as compared to Africa. It is thus possible that the conditions found in highly suitable areas of Asia are more favorable for the waterborne transmission of HEV than those typically found in highly suitable areas of Africa. This hypothesis deserves further attention in the future.</p>
