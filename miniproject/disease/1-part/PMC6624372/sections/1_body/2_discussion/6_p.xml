<p id="Par18">The correlation analysis developed using monthly data of HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks, environmental and hydrological variables in the Ganges watershed suggests that the higher is the river discharge, the fewer outbreaks occur. Noteworthy, our dataset suggests that the safer months in the region in terms of occurrence of HEV outbreaks are the monsoon months; June, July, August and September. Consistent with previous observations described above, our results highlight that ultimately water balance, and thus pathogen concentration in a watershed may influence the temporal occurrence of waterborne outbreaks caused by HEV. Some previous studies have shown that streamflow is correlated with biological contamination and that pathogen load is influenced by river discharge

 </sup>. Our results are in agreement with a previous study investigating the presence of HEV RNA in sewage of northern India from 2004 to 2006

 </sup>. In this study, the authors observed the presence of HEV in 46% of the tested samples in winter months (November to February), 55% in summer months (March to June) and 23% during the monsoon months (July to October). This study suggests that HEV load in the Ganges river may be indeed lower during the monsoon months. Conversely, one recent study has shown bimodal peaks for HEV cases in India, with a peak occurring during the cold months of the year and a second peak in August, during the monsoon period

 </sup>. It is possible that HEV cases occur during the monsoon months but that the environmental conditions during this period have a negative influence on the occurrence of large outbreaks. Another possible explanation for this disagreement is that the methods used in both studies have different accuracy to determine the occurrence of HEV cases or outbreaks. In addition, we cannot exclude the potential influence of sociological factors, such as pilgrimage events and religious celebrations which may sporadically increase the dissemination of the virus at a certain location and time of the year. Further studies are needed to fully understand the specific interplay of water balance, the concentration of enteric pathogens in surface water and the occurrence of infections among the population.
