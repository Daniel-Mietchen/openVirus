<p id="Par17">Models obtained using HEV outbreak data from Africa and Asia have showed interesting differences between the most important variables predicting HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks. Human population density and annual potential evapotranspiration are important predictors of the occurrence of HEV-1 and HEV-2 epidemics in Africa and Asia. However, precipitation seasonality is a good predictor under Asian but not in the African models. This suggests that while at global scale HEV outbreaks seem to be explained by the combination of population density, potential evapotranspiration and precipitation seasonality, at local scale other variables may also influence the spatiotemporal occurrence of HEV waterborne cases. This finding may indicate that the environmental conditions favoring the occurrence of HEV epidemics caused by genotypes 1 and 2 in Asia may differ from those in Africa. Notably, these results could explain the difference in HEV risk between Asia and Africa observed from our outbreak dataset.</p>
