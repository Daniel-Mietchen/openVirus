<p id="Par24">Cumulative incidence rate, and incidence proportion (also known as risk) were calculated for each continent in the studied period (1980–2017) with data of total cases included in our dataset, and total population data taken from the World Bank population data (

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The cumulative incidence rate corresponds to the number of cases registered between 1980 and 2017 divided by the average population in the same period and multiplied by 100,000. Incidence proportion was calculated as the number of cases divided by the total population at the start of the studied period (1980).
