<p id="Par29">To further investigate the environmental factors influencing the seasonal occurrence of HEV outbreaks at a regional scale, we used the Ganges watershed as a case study. The Ganges watershed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) is located within the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin, draining 1,086,000 km
 <sup>2</sup> in Tibet, Nepal, India and Bangladesh and borders the Indus basin. The Himalayas are located to the north of the watershed. The Ganges catchment comprises the fertile Ganges plain and lies in the states of Uttar Pradesh (294,364 km²), Madhya Pradesh (198,962 km²), Bihar (143,961 km²), Rajasthan (112,490 km²), West Bengal (71,485 km²), Haryana (34,341 km²), Himachal Pradesh (317 km²) and Delhi (1,484 km²), as well as Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. Notably, the Ganges basin has a population of more than 500 million people, thus being the most populated river basin in the world. The climate in the region is mostly subtropical. The Ganges basin receives nearly 1,000 mm of precipitation annually, mostly during the monsoon season (July, August and September). The average maximum temperature across the basin is around 30 °C in summer and 20 °C in winter.
