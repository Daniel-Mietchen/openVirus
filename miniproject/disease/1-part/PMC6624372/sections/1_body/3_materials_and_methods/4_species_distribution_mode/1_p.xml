 </sup>. Prior to developing the model, 25% of the dataset was randomly set aside as “test samples” in order to obtain the distribution model, which was simultaneously validated using the rest of the dataset records, “training samples” (representing the remaining 75% of the total number of outbreaks). To obtain more information on the factors influencing the spatial occurrence of HEV outbreaks we processed four different models: (i) a model using population density data, environmental data and our complete dataset of hepatitis E outbreaks (general model), (ii) a model using environmental data and our complete dataset of hepatitis E outbreaks (environmental model), (iii) models using population density data, environmental data and outbreaks included in our dataset registered in Africa or Asia (African or Asian general model, respectively), and (iv) models using environmental data and outbreaks of our dataset registered in Africa or Asia (African or Asian environmental model, respectively). The models for Africa and Asia were developed to identify differences on the conditions favoring the occurrence of outbreaks in each continent. For our MaxEnt runs we used version 3.3.3 k of the software with its parameters set as follows: the convergence threshold was 0.00001, a maximum of 10,000 background points and 1000 iterations, a regularization multiplier of 1, and a logistic output format

 </sup>. We conducted cross-validation runs in order to validate our model using 10 independent runs with different training (considering a random test percentage of 25%) and testing datasets. This allows the program to generate some statistical analyses which are detailed below.
