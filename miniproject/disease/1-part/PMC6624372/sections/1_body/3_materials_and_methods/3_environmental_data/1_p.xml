<p id="Par25">Nineteen layers of environmental data were downloaded from the WorldClim dataset (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://worldclim.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://worldclim.org</ext-link>) with a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc-min. The bioclimatic variables in this dataset are derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values. Specifically, the variables represent annual trends (such as mean annual temperature or the annual precipitation), seasonality (as the annual range in temperature and precipitation) and extreme environmental factors (such as the temperature of the warmest month of the year or the precipitation of the driest quarter of the year). The Worldclim bioclimatic values are generated by interpolation of average monthly data registered in many global meteorological stations from the year 1950 until the year 2000. In addition to the bioclimatic variables, we also included global data of soil wetness

Human population density data were obtained from the Gridded Population of the World dataset for the year 2015 (
