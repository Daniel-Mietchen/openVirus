 </sup>. In this work we use the term “waterborne HEV” to refer to outbreaks of hepatitis E caused by either genotype 1 and 2. The criteria to include literature entries reporting HEV outbreaks were that (i) the literature records provide the geographical coordinates of the location where the outbreak was detected, and (ii) the literature records provide clear evidence that the reported outbreak was related to the consumption or use of contaminated water, or alternatively that the causative agent was proven to be HEV genotype 1 or 2. All outbreaks included in the final dataset (n = 59) were geo-referenced using Google Earth (
