<p id="Par4">To date, HEV outbreaks due to HEV-1 and HEV-2, are thought to occur after events of heavy rainfall and floods, or in hot and dry months

 </sup>. Rainfall and flooding may magnify the fecal contamination of water used for multiple purposes (drinking, cooking, personal hygiene, religious rituals, etc.). On the other hand, hot and dry months may possibly decrease the level of surface water leading to an increased concentration of enteric pathogens

 </sup>. These observations suggest that climatic factors may be of major importance for the efficient transmission of HEV-1 and HEV-2 and the occurrence of outbreaks. However, the specific environmental conditions influencing HEV spatiotemporal dynamics remain largely unknown. It is therefore currently not possible to anticipate the spatiotemporal occurrence of HEV epidemics. In the context of climatic change, it is urgently needed to better understand the ecology of waterborne pathogens in order to increase our preparedness toward future outbreaks.
