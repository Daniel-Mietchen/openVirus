<p id="Par6">In order to anticipate the spatiotemporal occurrence of HEV waterborne outbreaks at a global scale, we aim to: (i) identify spatial patterns in the occurrence of HEV epidemics, and (ii) determine the most important factors influencing such patterns. For this purpose, a database of publicly available data of HEV outbreaks was compiled, and this database was used in conjunction with environmental data to generate a global distribution model for the waterborne genotypes of HEV (HEV-1 and HEV-2). The results of this work expand our understanding of the factors promoting the spatiotemporal occurrence of HEV-1 and HEV-2, may contribute to anticipate the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks, and may ultimately be useful to optimize the control of waterborne pathogens in the next decades.</p>
