<p id="p0150">Flaviviruses have a large public health impact across the world, including in Brazil. Although congenital cases, primarily caused by ZIKV, have been the focus of much attention in recent years, cases of flaviviruses acquired in childhood should not be neglected, particularly during outbreaks in endemic areas. These viruses cause CNS infections and should be considered in differential diagnosis of children presenting with aseptic meningoencephalitis. Studies of the incidence of these viruses in the CNS of children are of paramount importance, to provide an accurate idea of their impact on public health in Brazil, as well as to facilitate monitoring of the emergence of other flaviviruses that are circulating in the country and could cause outbreaks. To ensure proper understanding of the contribution of flaviviruses to childhood CNS disease in Brazil, these viruses must be considered in all relevant clinical contexts.</p>
