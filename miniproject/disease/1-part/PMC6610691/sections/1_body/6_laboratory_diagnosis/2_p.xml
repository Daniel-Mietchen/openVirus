<p id="p0130">Diagnosis of neuroinvasive disease caused by flaviviruses can be made by detection of RNA in the CSF as described for WNV, for example; however, this technique can be of low sensitivity unless it is performed early in the course of infection. Serology for the detection of virus-specific IgM in CSF is used as an adjunct method 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Serology is commonly used to diagnose viruses in the CNS, including flaviviruses, because virus-specific IgM in CSF shows intrathecal synthesis and is considered to reflect viral target antigens within the CNS, as IgM does not cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier
