<p id="p0045">In 2017, the Brazilian Ministry of Health 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> reported 7237 notified cases of meningitis probably caused by viruses. Our group investigated 299 cases of children with suspected meningoencephalitis from 2014 to 2018 in Minas Gerais State, Brazil and analysed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); DENV RNA was detected in approximately 6% (unpublished data). Viruses commonly detected in childhood CNS infections, such as enteroviruses and herpesviruses, were found at frequencies of 4% and 3%, respectively, similar to those of flaviviruses (unpublished data). Therefore, our data demonstrate the importance of these viruses as causes of childhood CNS infections in Brazil.
