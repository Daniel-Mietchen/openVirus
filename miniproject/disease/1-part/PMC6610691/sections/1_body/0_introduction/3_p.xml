<p id="p0020">In Brazil, flaviviruses considered neurotropic agents, such as as WNV and Rocio virus, have been described as circulating but without case reports in children 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Some other potential neurotropic flaviviruses, including DENV and ZIKV, circulate in epidemics; however, there are few reports of these viruses as aetiological agents of CNS infections in children. Therefore, the incidence of flaviviruses causing this type of infection in children is unknown. Our goal was to review information about childhood CNS infections caused by the main flaviviruses circulating in Brazil.
