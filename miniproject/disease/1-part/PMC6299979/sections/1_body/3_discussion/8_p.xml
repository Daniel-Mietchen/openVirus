<p id="Par40">An important strength of our study is that the coverage increased over time to include almost all adult ICUs in the country, thus providing a clear estimate of the total number and incidence of ICU SARI in the Netherlands. Comparing these with other Western European countries is difficult. Most countries do not have SARI surveillance and in those that do or those that have analyzed retrospective data, the SARI case definition varies due to different coding systems and the type of hospitalizations included (ICU, other wards) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, criteria for ICU admission vary between countries, with Dutch ICUs being relatively restrictive. In Germany, retrospectively, ICU SARI admissions during influenza epidemics peaked at 17% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], in the range of the weekly peak of 15–25% that we observed in the different epidemics. Of hospitalized SARI in Belgium, influenza was laboratory-diagnosed in 46%, and approximately 10% of SARI were in ICUs (sentinel surveillance of 2016/2017 epidemic) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], similar to the 8–11% in ICUs in a Dutch pilot study in two hospitals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (Marbus S, et al: Acute respiratory infections in secondary care versus influenza-like illness in primary care in the Netherlands: hospital incidence peaks first, submitted). Although such estimates are not available from the national registry data (NICE) they give a rough indication that total SARI hospitalizations (when including non-ICU SARI) in the Netherlands could be around 10-fold higher than SARI in ICUs and that influenza can potentially play a large role in overall SARI admissions. Some other countries record laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in ICUs, but without tracking a denominator or testing practices, thus not providing estimates on total SARI burden [
