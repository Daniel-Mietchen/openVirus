<p id="Par36">For influenza severity assessment, monitoring a SARI syndrome instead of specific diagnoses would be of use as distinguishing between bacterial and viral causes of pneumonia is difficult and bacterial pneumonia is often secondary to viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Only 4.7% of the diagnoses are registered as viral pneumonia, which may be an underestimation: laboratory data are not yet available in the NICE registry, and the specific etiology of SARI cases could not be determined. Furthermore, laboratory testing for influenza virus or other respiratory viruses is not standard practice in hospitalized patients with SARI; less than half of patients admitted to the ICU with suspected pneumonia are tested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Notably in our data, in the 2015/2016 season a large proportion of ICU SARI was registered as viral. Whether this is a true finding, a registration artifact, or whether more laboratory testing occurred in that year is not clear. Further, inherent to a syndromic surveillance approach based on rapidly available provisional data, a SARI syndrome may contain some patients with an incorrect initial diagnosis at admission. Another limitation is that no data were available on influenza vaccination status or use of oseltamivir.
