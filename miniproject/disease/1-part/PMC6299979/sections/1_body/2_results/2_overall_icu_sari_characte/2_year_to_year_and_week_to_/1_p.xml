<p id="Par25">The overall proportion of ICU SARI admissions were relatively stable from one season-year to the next (11–14% of all ICU medical admissions were a SARI, Table

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The incidence was highest in the oldest age group (65+ years) and the proportion of ICU SARI admissions increased with increasing age (from an average 7% in 15–44-year-olds to 15% in the 65+ group). However, weekly, the highest proportion was in the 60–64 years age group reaching 36% in season 2015/2016.
