<p id="Par29">The three long epidemics of 2012/2013, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016 (12–20 weeks) showed high incidence of both ILI and of ICU SARI (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The ratio between the ICU SARI incidence and ILI incidence varies by influenza epidemic and lies between 1.3 and 2.7. This means that with every actual observed adult case of ILI in the sentinel surveillance (covering only 0.7% of the Dutch population) there were on average 1.3–2.7 observed ICU SARI admissions (covering the total adult ICU population). This ratio was lowest in 2009/2010 (the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic season) and highest in the 2007/2008 epidemic (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Using rates to calculate the SARI/ILI ratio, this translated to 0.008–0.017 ICU SARI admissions per estimated GP-attended ILI in the Dutch population (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In other words, per influenza epidemic, the estimated ILI rate in the total Dutch population was 59-fold to 125-fold higher than the ICU SARI rate. For example, in the 2015/2016 influenza epidemic there were 1693 adult ICU SARI admissions and an estimated total of 162,418 adult medically attended ILI cases in the total Dutch population (or 0.01 ICU SARI per estimated ILI).
