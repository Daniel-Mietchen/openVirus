<p id="Par28">The standardized ICU SARI incidence during the eight influenza epidemics varied between 558 (in 2013/2014) and 2400 (in 2014/2015; the latter being the longest registered influenza epidemic in the Netherlands, lasting 20 weeks). Peak weekly incidence of ICU SARI varied by epidemic, with between 101 and 188 SARI admissions (in the 2013/2014 and 2012/2013 epidemic, respectively, standardized) or expressed as rates, 0.07–0.13/10,000 inhabitants in the peak week.
