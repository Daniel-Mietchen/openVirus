<p id="Par14">Though advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) that require hospital admission is implemented in only few Western European countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Such primary care surveillance covers the community dwelling population and is thus focused on patients with milder illness. The number of patients developing serious complications and who require hospitalization is not available through this system and therefore, our understanding of the burden of respiratory infections is incomplete. The WHO recommends development and application of additional SARI measures that can be used to assess the severity of every influenza epidemic, whether seasonal or pandemic, and creating a historical SARI baseline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The proposed measures include: SARI incidence, SARI peak levels, SARI mortality, and the SARI/ILI ratio. A SARI is a so-called syndrome group, i.e. based on rapidly available (initial) diagnoses that can be monitored as an indicator of infectious disease trends, outbreaks, and burden [
