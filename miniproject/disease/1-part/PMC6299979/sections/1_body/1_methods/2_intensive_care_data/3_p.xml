<p id="Par19">We defined a syndrome group for ICU SARI admissions by including any respiratory diagnosis that could potentially have been of an infectious origin, i.e. caused by a respiratory pathogen such as influenza. A patient was considered an ICU SARI admission when all three of the following criteria were met: (1) the patient was admitted to the hospital less than 2 days before ICU admission (to differentiate between community acquired versus nosocomial infection), (2) the ICU admission was not a readmission to the ICU within the hospitalized period, and (3) the APACHE IV reason for admission included any of the six respiratory codes for pulmonary sepsis or pneumonia (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Patients can have up to two APACHE IV codes registered upon admission. The NICE registry does not contain results of microbiological laboratory results.
