<p id="Par20">Influenza surveillance in the Netherlands is based on sentinel general practitioners (GPs) participating in the Nivel Primary Care database, actively reporting the weekly number of patients consulting them for ILI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. ILI is defined as (1) sudden onset of symptoms, (2) fever, and (3) at least one of the following symptoms: cough, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, frontal headache, retrosternal pain, or myalgia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. GPs also take swabs from a random subset of patients with ILI for virological examination to determine whether influenza virus is circulating in the general population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Epidemic weeks were those weeks in which the overall ILI incidence exceeded the threshold of 5.1/10,000 persons for a minimum of 2 consecutive weeks, which is based on the moving epidemic method used by countries participating in EISN [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (the prospective data having small differences with fully completed retrospective datasets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). During the nine seasons in the study period there were eight influenza epidemics of varying duration (based on all age groups combined). While influenza was circulating and ILI incidence crossed the threshold twice but not in consecutive weeks, retrospectively there was no influenza epidemic in 2011/2012. We further selected ILI in patients age 15 years and older, as only adult ICU admissions were available (15 years being the child/adult cutoff available in the ILI registry). We used season-years (which we defined as running from week 27 to week 26 in the next year) instead of calendar years, as respiratory pathogens circulate mostly in winter.
