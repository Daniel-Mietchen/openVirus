  <p>Assessment of protective efficacy induced by the ChadOx1-EDIII vaccine. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the ZIKV
   <sup>AS</sup> genome in gray, designed from an Asian lineage (ZIKA
   <sup>AS</sup>). Bottom row represents a magnified schematic of the envelope of ZIKV, with domains I, II, and III, shown in different colors. DIII is shown in green. The EDIII coding region was used to produce the recombinant adenoviral vector, containing the ZIKV EDIII (
   <bold>b</bold>). (
   <bold>c</bold>) Vaccination strategy and timeline for a challenge with a ZIKV of a homologous Asian lineage [
   <xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Na√Øve (
   <bold>d</bold>) and vaccinated (
   <bold>e</bold>) BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) were intravenously challenged with 100 PFU of ZIKV-BR strain. Upon ZIKV challenge, viral loads were monitored for up to seven days. Graphs show days post-challenge on the x-axis versus viral loads on the y-axis. Continuous blue and red lines represent one mouse each, for each of the control (d) and vaccinated groups (e). (
   <bold>f</bold>) ELISAS from the control and vaccinated groups, OD450 were recorded from 3-fold dilutions. (
   <bold>g</bold>) Log of endpoint titers from ELISA are shown.
