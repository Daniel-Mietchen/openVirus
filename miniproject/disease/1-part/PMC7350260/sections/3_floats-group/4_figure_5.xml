 <caption>
  <p>Efficacy parameters after a ZIKV challenge in vaccinated A129. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Variation in temperatures from 5 days before challenge (dbc) and 10 days post-ZIKV challenge (dac). Lines represent the mean of control (unrelated or mock-control, blue line) and vaccinated groups (red line), (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Differences in weight compared to the day of challenge in the control and vaccinated groups. Mouse weight was monitored from day-5 before challenge and up to the date animals were culled, and up to 8 days after challenge. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Pie charts in percentage that represents the clinical manifestation of the disease (ruffled fur, lethargy, pinched, hunched, wasp-waisted, labored breathing, decrease of mobility and body weight loss), in control and vaccinated groups. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Kaplan-Meier survival curves with lines representing each vaccinated or control group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). (
   <bold>e</bold>) ZIKV RNA in mice upon completion of the experiment, day of culling end of the study (21 days after challenge, dac), by RT-PCR. Each dot indicates a mouse from vaccinated or control groups and for each of the brain, ovaries, blood, and spleen tissue. Boxes indicate the mean value and the lines the standard deviation. (
   <bold>f</bold>) Anti-ZIKV Envelope responses induced by vaccination and measured before challenge.
