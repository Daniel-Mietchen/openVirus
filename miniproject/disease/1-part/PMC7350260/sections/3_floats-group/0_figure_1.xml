  <p>Functional immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine expressing ZIKV EDIII. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of constructs encoding ZIKV EDIII fused to the dimerizing Î³CH3 domain, based on an African strain of the Zika virus (ZIKA
   <sup>AF</sup>) (left) and Western blot (anti-SV5) of cellular extracts (E) and supernatants (S) from HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated constructs. Soluble ZIKV E protein from the supernatant of cells transfected with a plasmid construct expressing the SV5-tagged protein is shown for size comparison. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Pooled sera from DNA immunized mice were tested for ELISA reactivity on ZDIII-coated plates; the dashed line marks the detection limit of the assay. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Antibody titers from the curves shown in (b). (
   <bold>d</bold>) Foci reduction neutralization test (FRNT) of ZIKV on Vero cells with pooled sera from mice immunized with ZDIII-CH3.
