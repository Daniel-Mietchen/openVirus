  <p>Assessment of protective efficacy induced by protein-based EDIII vaccine. Na√Øve (
   <bold>a</bold>) and vaccinated (
   <bold>b</bold>) mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8) were intravenously challenged at four weeks after vaccination with 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of ZIKV- PRVABC59 strain. Upon ZIKV challenge, the viral load was monitored for up to seven days. Graphs show days post-challenge on the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis versus viral load on the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis. Continuous blue and red lines represent one mouse each for each of the control and vaccinated groups. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Peaks of viral titers for each individual mouse and for each group. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Sera from immunized mice were tested for ELISA reactivity on ZDIII-coated plates; the dashed line marks the limit of the assay. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Antibody titers from the curves shown in (b). ***
