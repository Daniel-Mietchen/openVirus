  <p>Functional immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine expressing ZIKV EDIII (
   <bold>a</bold>) SDS-PAGE of the purified protein. Cell supernatant (Input) and post-purification (Output) samples were analyzed in SDS-PAGE, following heat treatment (or not). Black arrows show the position of the monomeric (+heat) and dimeric (âˆ’heat) EDIII-CH3. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Sera from immunized mice were tested for ELISA reactivity on ZEDIII-coated plates; the dashed line marks the limit of the assay. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Antibody titers from the curves shown in (b). (
   <bold>d</bold>) Foci reduction neutralization test (FRNT) of ZIKV on Vero cells with sera from mice immunized with ZEDIII-CH3.
