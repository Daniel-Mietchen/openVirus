<p>In this study, we tested ZIKV EDIII-based vaccines candidates using different immunization platforms, including DNA-, viral-vectored (adenovirus), and recombinant protein-based approaches in mice. Our data suggest that, contrary to other flaviviruses, the polyclonal anti-EDIII response is not sufficient to confer protection in the context of ZIKV infection. These results open up an exciting new avenue for the further exploration of ZIKV EDIII antigenic features in ZIKV biology and vaccinology.</p>
