<p>Similar to other flavivirus infections, the E protein is the main target of the antibody response against ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although neutralizing epitopes have been identified in all three E domains for several flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the immune response following infection is heavily dominated by anti-EDIDII antibodies, most of which target the FLE and tend to be poorly neutralizing and highly cross-reactive [

 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Conversely, due to the high variability and function of the domain, anti-EDIII antibodies are usually highly specific and strongly neutralizing [

 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Based on these features, EDIII has been used in several vaccine platforms [

 <xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and adenovirus-based vaccines [
 <xref rid="B30-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Due to the close structural and biological similarity among flaviviruses, ZIKV EDIII is a highly attractive target for pre-clinical vaccine developments.
