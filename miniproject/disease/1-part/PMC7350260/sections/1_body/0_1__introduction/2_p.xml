<p>Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a host-derived double-layered lipid envelope. Its genome encodes a single viral polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally processed into 10 mature viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins are structurally required to form a viral particle; while NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5, perform non-structural functions, such as polypeptide post-translational processing and RNA replication. The viral surface is covered by 180 copies of E, which are arranged in 90 antiparallel dimers and distributed in a herringbone configuration [

 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Each copy of the E protein folds into a rod-like structure and is composed of three structural domainsâ€”domains I and II (EDIDII) form an elongated finger-like structure that expands distally into a glycine-rich, highly-hydrophobic fusion loop (FLE), which is conserved in all flaviviruses and serves a fundamental role in initiating infection [
 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Contrary to EDIDII, the Ig-like domain III (EDIII) is highly variable and has been described as the putative site for host cell-receptor binding [
