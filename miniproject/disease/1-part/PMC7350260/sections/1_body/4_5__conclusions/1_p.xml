<p>The Domain III (DIII) of the Zika envelope protein is an attractive antigen currently explored as an approach for vaccine development. DIII has given promising results when used as a vaccine for dengue virus and this has prompted its use as a strategy to immunize against the related Zika virus. We investigated the potential of this protein to elicit protective immunity in various mouse models, through the use of three different platforms suitable for vaccine development: plasmid DNA, protein and the chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1. Our results indicate that vaccine-induced immunity to DIII from Zika virus offers limited protection against a challenge with different Zika virus strains comprising the Asian and African lineages. Results were obtained in independent laboratories under different conditions, all yielding similar results of low protective efficacy. We conclude that DIII
