<p>Our results consistently showed that all three vaccines readily induced anti-EDIII antibodies, but none was able to completely neutralize ZIKV in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicated that, contrary to DENV, a polyclonal anti-EDIII antibody response at the concentration, specificity, and avidity induced by these three vaccines, only had a limited capacity to neutralize ZIKV. Studies have shown that some anti-ZIKV EDIII mAbs isolated from the ZIKV-exposed patients possess strong neutralizing activities [

 <sup>(−/−)</sup> mice. However, there is evidence that the frequency of human neutralizing antibodies within the overall polyclonal response is lower against DIII than against the fusion loop epitope (FLE) within DII. The latter provides a higher and broader anti-ZIKV neutralization capacity that protect mice against both, African and Asian–American lineages in non-pregnant and pregnant mouse models, preventing maternal–fetal transmission, dam infections, and disease [
 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, this still remains unknown and might not be sufficient to provide complete protection. Moreover, just as the anti-EDIII response is significantly stronger and more potent in mice than in humans, the nature of the ZIKV antibody response in mice and humans might be significantly different, making it difficult to infer or extrapolate data across species. It should also be considered whether the patients involved in human studies might have had previous DENV infections that shaped the immune response to ZIKV, leading to anti-EDIII antibodies with increased neutralizing strength. Zhao et al. isolated mAbs from mice primed with ZIKV and then boosted with soluble EDIII or ZIKV, with differential binding and neutralization capacities [

Of particular interest, mAbs raised in ZIKV-exposed mice and boosted with ZIKV EDIII, could bind monomeric E but they did not bind to ZIKV particles. The more potently neutralizing anti-EDIII mAbs (ZV-67 and ZV-54) recognized the lateral ridge (LR) epitope of EDIII and they were able to bind about 66% of the DIII domains in a mature ZIKV. Passive transfer of both ZV-67 and ZV-54, yielded complete protection upon a ZIKV challenge model in IFN-deficient mice [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As the above experiments were performed in a pre-clinical setting, our results in vaccinated mice showing high titers of anti-DIII antibodies but low or poor anti-ZIKV efficacy might be due to an enrichment of antibodies recognizing the EDIII epitopes that are not displayed in infective ZIKV particles. Therefore, it is imperative to design improved antigens that favor a response against relevant neutralizing epitopes in both the therapeutic and the prophylactic settings [
 <xref rid="B47-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Further structurally guided studies are needed to inform the design of relevant immunodominant epitopes to favor the induction of potent neutralizing antibodies. It is important to mention that, in our work, protein conformation and potentially neutralizing epitopes exposure could be different between the DNA-encoded protein, the protein sub-unit or the ChAdOx1 platform with the EDIII presentation on native virions, thus raising the need to perform structural studies using conformation sensitive anti-EDIII antibodies in all expressed proteins. In addition, while correlates or estimates of protection based on the measurement of neutralizing antibodies are established for YFV, WNV, JEV, and TBEV, similar standards of protection are still lacking for DENV and ZIKV and significantly compromise the analysis and extrapolation of data, blurring the lines of what is needed for a vaccine to be considered protective and efficient. Here, we reasoned that in the absence of such standards, the only reliable way to measure the viability of a vaccine candidate was through its ability to either fully neutralize the virus in vitro or provide sterile protection in ZIKV challenge models. Despite neutralizing activities being detected in all cases, none of the three candidates described here comply with this requirement.
