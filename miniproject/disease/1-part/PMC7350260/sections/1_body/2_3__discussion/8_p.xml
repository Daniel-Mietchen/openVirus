<p>To our knowledge, this is the first report that highlight a disparity between the highly immunogenic nature of ZIKV EDIII and the poor neutralizing capacity of the polyclonal antibody response induced against ZIKV EDIII, using different vaccine platforms. More in-depth studies of these responses would significantly increase our knowledge of the effective neutralizing determinants against ZIKV, which could directly inform the development of improved vaccine candidates to achieve protective anti-ZIKV responses, while still avoiding the ADE of DENV.</p>
