<p>To exclude the possibility that the design of the ZIKV EDIII antigen as a CH3-fused dimer could compromise the response to key neutralizing epitopes, we decided to redesign the vaccine as a monomeric EDIII protein using an adenovirus-vectored platform that was previously shown to confer full protection in mice and non-human primates, when using the complete ZIKV E protein as an antigen [
 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this context, the ChAdOx1 viral-vectored platform was designed to express ZIKV EDIII (ChAdOx1-EDIII) and the vaccine was then tested in two different ZIKV challenge models [

 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Besides using an Asian strain instead of an African strain of ZIKV, this antigen differs from the EDIII-CH3 used in the DNA and protein-based vaccines, in the lack of the Î³CH3 dimerizing domain, which leads to its secretion as a monomeric single-domain peptide, as opposed to a fusion-protein non-covalent dimer. Our results demonstrated that a single and non-adjuvanted immunization using ChAdOx1-EDIII, elicited high anti-ZIKV E antibodies in both BALB/c and A129 mice. Upon ZIKV challenge, a reduction in ZIKV RNAemia was detected in BALB/c mice, but the vaccine was not able to elicit complete protection. Likewise, ChAdOx1-EDIII-vaccinated A129 mice experienced weight loss, temperature-change, and clinical symptoms similar to the mock-vaccinated mice, with detection of virus in the brain and spleen. Of interest, the only two organs where we found a vaccine-induced lower ZIKV load was in ovaries and blood.
