<p>To test a different strategy for antigen delivery and circumvent any potential limitation poised by the in vivo production of the immunogen, we used the same construct to purify the antigen from mammalian HEK293F cells. In agreement with our DNA-based vaccine, the EDIII-CH3 protein vaccine elicited high anti-EDIII antibody titers and none of the serum reached 100% ZIKV neutralization at the lowest dilution tested. To determine if the neutralizing activities induced by the EDIII-CH3 protein vaccine were sufficient to confer in vivo protection, we challenged vaccinated A129 mice and followed the course of viral infection. Our data showed that even in the presence of high anti-ZIKV E, none of the vaccinated mice were able to successfully control viremia.</p>
