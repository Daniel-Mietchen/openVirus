<p>Despite the abundance of EDIII-based vaccine candidates that have were developed for other flaviviruses, to our knowledge the number of similar candidates for ZIKV is scarce and no clinical trials using ZIKV E-DIII were published. Yang et al. produced a vaccine based on ZIKV E-DIII fused with the hepatitis B core antigen (HbcAg-zDIII) to form VLPs in 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Immunization with the HbcAg-zDIII VLP vaccine in mice using protocols involving different priming/boost schemes, induced anti-EDIII antibodies and showed evidence of in vitro neutralization, with no induction of ADE against DENV2 [
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In a similar report, Cabral-Miranda et al. developed a VLP-based approach to display ZIKV E-DIII, using a modified cucumber mosaic virus (CuMVtt-EDIII) [
 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; three doses of an adjuvanted CuMVtt-EDIII vaccine induced high titers of anti-EDIII antibodies but low ZIKV neutralizing activities (FRNT50 titer of &lt;1:100). Interestingly, a single-dose and non-adjuvanted administration of CuMVtt-EDIII or EDII alone did not show neutralizing efficacy at 21 days after immunization of the BALB/c mice, but did elicit a high titer of anti-EDIII antibodies, as measured by ELISA. More importantly, given the discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo data, especially regarding protection from viral infection, none of the studies described above included a ZIKV challenge model to test the efficacy of the proposed antigens vaccines.
