<p>Although most efforts to develop an effective DENV vaccine used the full E protein (either as a soluble protein or as part of higher structures like VLPs and attenuated/inactivated viruses), there is also a large body of evidence showing that a vaccine based on the EDIII structure could be used as a firm candidate to target flaviviruses. Besides the fact that most anti-EDIII monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) show high viral neutralizing activities, the rationale for investigating EDIII-based vaccines relies mostly on its potential to direct the immune response to a virus-specific, biologically relevant and simple target that is capable of preventing the induction of cross-reacting but poorly-neutralizing anti-FLE antibodies and, thus, reducing the risk of inducing antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [
