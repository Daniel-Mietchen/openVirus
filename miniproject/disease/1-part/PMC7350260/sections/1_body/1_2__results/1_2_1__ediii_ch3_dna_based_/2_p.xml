<p>For the DNA immunizations, three groups of six female BALB/c mice were immunized by intradermal gene gun delivery of the plasmid DNA encoding the EDIII-CH3 protein. Each mouse received three doses of DNA (1 µg dose/animal) at 15 days intervals; sera were collected two weeks after completion of the protocol and pooled for analysis. Sera dilutions showed that all mice developed anti-ZIKV E antibody responses that were able to bind ZIKV E in ELISA (

 <sup>4</sup> to 2.25 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> (

Surprisingly, although all groups showed some degree of neutralizing activity, none reached 100% neutralization of ZIKV, and the FRNT50 titers were detected only in one group (
