<p>We previously showed that an antigenic design comprised of the EDIII domain from all four DENV serotypes, C-terminally fused to the dimerizing constant domain 3 of the human IgG heavy chain (γCH3), not only promotes efficient secretion of properly-folded EDIII from transfected mammalian cells, but also induces robust long-term virus-specific neutralizing antibody responses in mice, when administered as a gene gun-mediated DNA vaccine [

The EDIII sequence from the reference ZIKV African strain MR-766 (amino acids 300–421 of the full E protein) was initially selected due to the availability of the homologous ZIKV strain, to perform functional assays. This strain has gone through multiple passages in mice, and maintains virulence in this animal model [
