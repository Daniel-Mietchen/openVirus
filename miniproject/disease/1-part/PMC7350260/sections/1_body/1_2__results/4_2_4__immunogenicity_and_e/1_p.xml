<p>The ChAdOx1-EDIII vaccine efficacy was additionally assessed in A129 mice undergoing a ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> heterologous-lineage challenge [
 <xref rid="B35-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Control, mock-vaccinated mice displayed a typical onset of infection after the ZIKV challenge, characterized by an initial increase in body temperature, followed by a drastic decrease (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, red line), but displayed the rapid temperature decrease shown in the mock control group. Consistent with the ZIKV challenge model, animals vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 mock control, presented a decrease of body weight (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f005">Figure 5</xref>c, blue line), reaching the humane endpoint criteria (80% body weight) between day 7 and 8. In agreement with the previous experimental observations, mice receiving the ChAdOx1-EDIII failed to control the infection and met humane endpoints between day 7 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1/6) and day 8 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5/6) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f005">Figure 5</xref>d, red line). Taken together, we observed coherent results indicating that the ChAdOx1-EDIII vaccine failed to elicit protective immunity in a Type I interferon deficient mouse challenge model.
