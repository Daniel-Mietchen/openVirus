<p>Six BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 Âµg of the EDIII-CH3 protein using 1% ALUM MPLA (monophosphoryl lipid A) as adjuvant. Each mouse received, subcutaneously, three doses of the protein at 15 days intervals, and sera were collected two weeks after the third dose. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, all mice developed strong anti-EDIII responses, which were higher in titer when compared to the gene-gun immunized mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). As a result of the higher antibody titer and in contrast to results obtained for the DNA vaccine, FRNT50 titers were detected in all six mice; although, as before, none reached 100% neutralization of the virus (
