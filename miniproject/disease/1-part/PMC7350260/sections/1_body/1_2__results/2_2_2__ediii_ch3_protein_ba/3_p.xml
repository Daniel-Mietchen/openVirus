<p>The protective efficacy of the EDIII-CH3 protein-based vaccines was further assessed in Interferon Type-I Receptor knockout mice, A129, which are highly susceptible to the ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B35-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this case, 8 mice were immunized with the EDIII-CH3 protein, following the same protocol and were challenged with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU ZIKV PRVABC59 strain. Availability of an Asian-origin virus permitted the efficacy assessment of a heterologous challenge in mice vaccinated with an African lineage antigen. Similar to the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f003">Figure 3</xref>a), protein-immunized mice were not able to contain ZIKV infection, as demonstrated by the increasing viral load titers detected in all mice after the challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f003">Figure 3</xref>b), even though the peak of the viral titers was detected at a later time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). An analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) did not show significant differences (218,197 with 95% CI 23,273 to 413,121 for EDIII-CH3 vs. 421,938 with 95% CI 164,150 to 679,727 for the control, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.2344) Failure to prevent viral infection was not related to a diminished response to the EDIII-CH3 antigen, as all pre-challenge sera showed consistent anti-EDIII antibody responses (
