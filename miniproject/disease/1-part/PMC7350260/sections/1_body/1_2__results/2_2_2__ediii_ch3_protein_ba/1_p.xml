<p>To rule out that the low neutralizing activities of the anti-EDIII responses were due to a factor inherent to the DNA immunization technique (i.e., altered in vivo production of the antigen, low levels of protein availability, etc.), we produced and purified the EDIII-CH3 antigen and administered it as a protein-based vaccine. EDIII-CH3 was purified from the supernatant of transfected Expi293F cells with anti-SV5 agarose affinity gel; as expected from its design, the protein was obtained as a non-covalent dimer that is disassociated upon heat treatment (
