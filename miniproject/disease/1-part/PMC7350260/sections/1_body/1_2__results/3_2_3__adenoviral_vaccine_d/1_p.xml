<p>To determine if the poorly neutralizing responses obtained with the DNA and protein-base EDIII-CH3 vaccines were due to a problem of antigenic design or rather due to an incapacity of the anti-EDIII polyclonal response to neutralize ZIKV effectively, we next evaluated a replication deficient chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1) as an immunization platform. Based on a previously described prME ΔTM-encoding adenoviral vectored- ZIKV vaccine [
 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we constructed a ChAdOX1 encoding a codon-optimized ZIKV EDIII sequence (

 <sup>AS</sup>) to maintain consistency with a previous publication, whilst expanding our observations beyond the African strain-based designs that are dimeric, to a monomeric antigen based on Asian lineages. We then tested the ability of the ChAdOx1-EDIII vaccine to protect BALB/c mice upon an intravenous ZIKV challenge of 100 PFU, four weeks after a single immunization (1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> IU/mouse), using an Asian-lineage of ZIKV
 <sup>AS</sup>, ZKV2015 (

 <italic>n</italic> = 5) displayed a typical onset of viremia after challenge, with a peak by day 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f004">Figure 4</xref>d) and the clearance of viral load in blood by day 7. Similar results to that of the EDIII protein vaccine were observed, as ZIKV replication was detected in both vaccinated and control mice, albeit all mice immunized with ChAdOx1-EDIII showed signs of protection as viral loads were significantly lower than those obtained in the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f004">Figure 4</xref>e). An analysis of area under the curve (AUC) indicated that the vaccinated group displayed significantly better protection than the mock vaccinated group (105,567 with 95% CI 1,425-209,709 for EDIII vs 363,416 with 95% CI 244,574 to 482,257 for the control, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0126). Interestingly, a delay of viral peak at day 4 was observed in 2 out of 5 mice and complete protection with absence of viremia was observed in one mouse. Assessment of anti-EDIII antibodies in the pre-challenge sera, revealed high titers of anti-ZIKV E antibodies in all the animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1-EDIII (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f004">Figure 4</xref>f,g). Overall, the data obtained from the EDIII-CH3 DNA, subunit and viral vectored vaccines suggest that ZIKV EDIII confers suboptimal protection upon a ZIKV challenge.
