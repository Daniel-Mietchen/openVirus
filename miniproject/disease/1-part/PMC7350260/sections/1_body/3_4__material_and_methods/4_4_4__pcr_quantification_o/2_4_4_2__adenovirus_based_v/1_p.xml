<p>Samples were homogenized in PBS using ceramic beads in a Precellys (Lutterworth, UK) automated homogenizer, using a setting of 6 × 5 s cycles of 4500 rpm with a 30 s pause between each cycle. A total of 100 μL of homogenate was transferred to 300 μL RLT buffer (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) for RNA extraction; 25 mL blood were processed using RNAprotect tubes, adding 75 µL of PBS to 300 µL of RLT buffer. After incubation for 10 min, 400 µL of ethanol (70%) were added to the homogenate. The sample was passed through a Qiashredder (Qiagen, Manchester, UK). RNA from ovary and brain was obtained using a Biosprint extraction kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and Kingfisher flex system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Abingdon UK). RNA from spleen and blood was processed using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK).</p>
