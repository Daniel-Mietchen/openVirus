<p>ARS and AHP are the grant holders. ARS directed the project and commissioned the work. CLC designed, constructed, and characterized the adenoviral vaccines. JLSC, MP, and GDL constructed DNA vaccines and subunit EDIII vaccines, respectively. CLC, PA, RAL, JLSC, GDL, and MP, designed and performed the animal experiments. PA and RAL, performed the ZIKV challenge model in the BALB/c mice and the RT-PCR viral loads. CLC, PA, and RAL performed the ELISA assays and analyzed the ZIKV challenge data. SD, VG, and RH conceived and designed the animal experiments in A129 mice. SD, VG, ER, and SFW performed the animal experiments, such as the ZIKV challenge model in A129 mice, the RT-PCR and the histology. MP, GDL, and JLSC performed FRNTs. CLC, JLSC, RAL, and GDL performed in vitro assays and analyzed the ZIKV challenge data. YCK produced ZIKV envelope protein and performed ELISA assays. WD and JM designed, performed, and analyzed in vitro experiments. CLC and MP performed the cell culture, transfections, and the Western blots. AHP, GRS, DHB, ORB, and ASH provided the vital characterized reagents and conceptual support. CLC, GDL, and JLSC analyzed all data. CLC and JLSC wrote the initial draft. All authors read and commented on the manuscript.</p>
