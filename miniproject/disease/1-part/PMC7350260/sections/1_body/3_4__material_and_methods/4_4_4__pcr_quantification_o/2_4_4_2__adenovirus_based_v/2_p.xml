<p>A real-time RT-PCR assay for ZIKV was used to quantify viral RNA. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-step qRT-PCR kit (Life Technologies, Warrington UK). The mastermix (15 μL) consisted of 10 μL of 2x Reaction Mix, 1.2 μL of PCR-grade water, 0.2 μL of 50 mM MgSO4, 1 μL of each primer, ZIKV 1086 (5′-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-3′) and ZIKV 1162c (5′-CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3′) (REF PMID 18680646), both at 18 μM working concentration, 0.8 μL of probe ZIKV 1107-FAM (5′-AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAGTCAGACACTCAA-3′) at 25 μM working concentration, and 0.8 μL of SSIII enzyme mix. A total of 5 μL of template RNA was added to the mastermix to give a final reaction volume of 20 μL. Cycling conditions used were 50 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 2 min, 45 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s with 60 °C for 40 s, and a final cooling step of 40 °C for 30 s. Fluorescence was quantified at the end of each 60 °C step. Analysis was performed using the QuantStudio platform (Applied Biosystems, Warrington UK).</p>
