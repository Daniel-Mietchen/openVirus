<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 10 µL of serum sample, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen: Manchester, UK). Real time RT-PCR assay was performed using the One-Step TB Green PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit II (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa) (Saint-German-en-Laya, France), with the following amplification conditions—42 °C for 5 min and 95 °C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s. The primers used were ZIKV-F: 5′-GTTGTCGCTGCTGAAATGGA-3′ and ZIKV −R: 5′-CGGGACTCTGATTGGCTGTA-3′. A standard curve was generated from ZIKV RNA extracted from 10-fold diluted virus stock with known viral titers in triplicates. The developed real-time RT-PCR assay showed a linear curve with high amplification efficiency and strong correlation (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.999, Slope—3.31).
