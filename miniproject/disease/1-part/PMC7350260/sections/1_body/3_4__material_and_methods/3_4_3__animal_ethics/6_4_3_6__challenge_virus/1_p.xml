<p>Mice vaccinated with ChAdOx1-based vaccines were challenged using two different lineages. Wild-type mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f004">Figure 4</xref>) were challenged with an intravenous injection of 10
 <sup>5</sup> vp (equivalent to 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU) of ZIKV
 <sup>AS</sup>, consisting of the ZKV2015 (ZIKV BR), as described earlier [

 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To extend our observations, the experiment depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00307-f005">Figure 5</xref> used A129 mice undergoing a heterologous challenge with a ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> strain, made with 100 PFU ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> (MP1751) via the subcutaneous (s.c.) route, to mimic mosquito bite [
 <xref rid="B35-vaccines-08-00307" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; 40 μL into the right leg and 40 μL into left leg toward the ankle. Mice of the protein vaccine experiment were challenged with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU Puerto Rican strain ZIKV (PRVABC59) always by the s.c. route, which was performed at a different lab from the ChAdOx1 vaccines.
