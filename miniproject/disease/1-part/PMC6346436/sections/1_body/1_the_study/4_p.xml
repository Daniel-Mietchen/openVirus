<p>In phylogenetic analyses of the L and M segments, isolate SA344-18 grouped with lineage E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>;
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1"> Appendix</xref> Figure 1), according to the lineage nomenclature of Bird et al. (
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>4</italic>
 </xref>). In analyses of all segments, this RVFV isolate had the closest relationship to Beijing-01, an isolate from a 2016 case exported to China from Angola (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>10</italic>
 </xref>), and to a 2009 sheep isolate from Kakamas, Northern Cape Province, South Africa (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figures 1, 2). The E lineage also included 25010-24, an isolate from a camel sampled during an outbreak in Mauritania in 2010 (

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). Nodes of the partial S segment tree were poorly supported, probably because the fragments were small (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure 2). The overall pairwise nucleotide differences were 3.1% for L, 3.6% for M, and 3.1% for S (nonstructural protein gene), similar to values reported previously (
