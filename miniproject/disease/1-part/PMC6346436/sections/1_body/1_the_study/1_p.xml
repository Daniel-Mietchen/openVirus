 </xref>). A recent history of influenza-like illness was reported for only 2 of these 4 patients. All 4 lived and worked on the farm and were involved in high-risk activities, such as slaughtering, autopsying, disposal and burial of carcasses, or handling of raw meat. We obtained follow-up samples from all 10 patients for paired serologic testing (
