<p>Intensified surveillance during interepidemic periods would enhance our knowledge of the genetic evolution of RVFV. Isolated outbreaks, similar to the one reported here, probably have occurred more frequently than recorded. Establishment of sentinel herds of susceptible animals and increased vector surveillance could yield isolates more frequently and lead to a better characterization of the strains maintained at low levels between epidemics. Our results indicate an ongoing activity and evolution of RVFV during interepizootic periods and highlight the importance of a cryptic transmission cycle that enables establishment of endemicity, which at times inevitably emerges in the form of an explosive outbreak.</p>
