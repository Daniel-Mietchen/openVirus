 <p>Phylogenetic analysis of Rift Valley fever virus partial genomic sequences from a patient infected in South Africa in May 2018 suggests reemergence of an endemic lineage different from that of the epidemic in South Africa during 2010â€“2011. Surveillance during interepidemic periods should be intensified to better predict future epidemics.</p>
