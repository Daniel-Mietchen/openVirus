<p>Sexual transmission poses a concerning threat to people who are outside of the ZIKV epidemic-prone regions. Previous knowledge of flaviviruses as exclusively vector-borne diseases was contested when a case of ZIKV infection resulted in a human-to-human transmission in 2008, between a husband and his wife [

Furthermore, the prolonged presence of ZIKV RNA differentiates ZIKV from other flaviviruses because the immune response usually clears the viral nucleic acid within a short timeframe after symptom onset. Mansuy et al. describes cases of ZIKV infection in which viral RNA was detected up to 141 days after the onset of symptoms, far surpassing the 37 day limit for positive detection in urine and blood samples [

 <xref rid="B55-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Such discrepancies in the incubation period may result from differences in the timing and/or site of ZIKV infection, both factors that can affect the tropism and propagation mode exhibited by the virus.
