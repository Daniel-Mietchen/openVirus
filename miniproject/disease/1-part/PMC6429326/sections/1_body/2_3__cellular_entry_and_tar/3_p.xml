<p>Prenatal infection of ZIKV has adverse pregnancy effects that range from congenital abnormalities to pregnancy loss and miscarriage [

Although the placenta possesses innate immunity to defend against infiltrating pathogens, ZIKV infection is able to overcome this defense and cross the maternalâ€“fetal barrier. The placenta provides a passage for viruses to carry out vertical transmission, during which placental macrophages called Hofbauer cells may take part in spreading ZIKV in the placenta and promoting vertical transmission of ZIKV [

In accordance, El Costa et al. identified the first trimester placenta as a permissive target of ZIKV, as evident from confocal microscopy analyses of first trimester trophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and extravillous trophoblasts, and Hofbauer cells, suggesting that these cells provide a pathway for ZIKV to reach fetal cells, resulting in a congenital infection [

Although studies have established the vital roles of these immune cells during pregnancy, especially in context of congenital ZIKV infection, further research is needed to determine the exact mechanism that ZIKV employs to infect the placental immune cells and its contribution to miscarriage and fetal dysfunctions.
