<p>Since 2016, scientific communities have dedicated rapid and extensive research efforts on ZIKV in terms of its molecular pathogenesis and associated cellular signaling pathways and factors. 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-01101-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows a comprehensive list of currently identified susceptible human cells to ZIKV infection. ZIKV exhibits broad tropism, and the localization of its cellular targets that have been identified so far range from the brain, placenta, and skin, to testis, kidney, and retina. The entry of ZIKV is facilitated by the following phosphotidylserine receptors, such as TIM (TIM1, TIM4) and TAM (Axl, Tyro3) in human primary trophoblasts [
