<p>Furthermore, NS1 and NS4B of ZIKV inhibit production of type I IFN by targeting TBK1, preventing its oligomerization, and in turn stabilize NS2B-NS3 [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Consequently, NS2B3 inhibits the downstream signaling of type I IFN, JAK-STAT, by promoting JAK1 degradation, in addition to inhibiting ZIKV-induced apoptosis, as previously mentioned, in a manner independent of NS2B3-mediated Jak1 degradation. The focus on WNV NS5 has been centered on its ability to inhibit JAK/STAT pathways and this context allows for a better understanding of the mechanism for immune evasion [

 <xref rid="B102-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Similarly, NS5 of ZIKV directly interacts with and induces degradation of STAT2, which is a transcriptional activator acting downstream of type I and type III IFNs that has been targeted by various viruses closely related to DENV [

 <xref rid="B103-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In Kumar et al., immunoblot and confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that unlike the levels of STAT1 that remained unchanged, the levels of STAT2 were nearly abrogated following ZIKV infection [
