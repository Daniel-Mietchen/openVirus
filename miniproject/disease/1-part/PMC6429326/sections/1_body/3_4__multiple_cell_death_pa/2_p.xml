<p>Various studies have confirmed the occurrence of neuronal apoptosis following a ZIKV infection in vivo and in vitro [

 <xref rid="B69-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. NSCs and NPCs, which display high susceptibility to ZIKV, undergo apoptosis pathways. Presence of fragmented nuclei and formation of autophagocytic vacuoles were visible beginning at 24hpi. In efforts to determine the reasons for the cell deaths, ZIKV structural envelope (E) protein, and its truncated forms, were suggested as a possibility of inducers [

Among the several mechanisms of cell death, upregulation of p53, p21, along with cleavage of caspase 9 and caspase 3, demonstrated that apoptosis was the most likely mechanism of cell death in NSCs and NPCs. Wu et al. also describes the potential inhibitory role of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 (NS2B3) on apoptosis [
