<p>Although most cases of ZIKV infection result in asymptomatic or mild flu-like symptoms, such as fever, rash, and conjunctivitis, the series of outbreaks that started in Yap islands in 2007 has emphasized just how wide of a phenotypic spectrum of disease can be caused in humans by the virus. Recent incidences of infection have resulted in severe phenotypes including Guillain–Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and fetal abnormalities such as microcephaly and spontaneous abortion [

However, these methods of diagnosis are only useful for virus detection within a short frame from the symptom onset as levels of viral RNA and IgM antibodies decline over time. Laboratory testing of infants suspected of congenital ZIKV infection includes detection of viral RNA in serum and urine, and IgM antibodies in serum and CSF of infants [
