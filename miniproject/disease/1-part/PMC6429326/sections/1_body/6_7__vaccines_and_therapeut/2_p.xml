<p>In addition to the lack of preventable methods against ZIKV infection, the increased pathogenicity of the virus has triggered an extensive investigation of candidates for anti-ZIKV drugs and therapies. Currently, design and development of drugs targeting either the virus or factors of the host immune response are in progress, and these inhibitors range in target from viral capsid, nonstructural proteins, including NS5, specifically RdRp and methyltransferase domain inhibition, NS3 helicase, and NS2B-NS3 protease, to nucleotide analog inhibitors, nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors, in addition to the previously mentioned IFITMs [

Drug repurposing, a process during which a library of drugs that have already been FDA-approved is screened for potential ZIKV inhibitors, has also risen as a viable alternative that saves time that would have been spent in design, development, and clinical testing of novel drugs. Chloroquine, quinacrine, mefloquine, and GSK369796 are some of the drugs that have shown promising potential through various screening methods [

 <xref rid="B112-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Furthermore, the ability of ZIKV to cross barriers into sites previously considered as immune privileged is another concern that addresses the urgency for pregnancy-safe drugs to become available.
