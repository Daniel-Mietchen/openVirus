Aquatic birds are viewed as the reservoir host, but it infects a wide variety of vertebrate hosts, including birds, bats, and terrestrial and aquatic mammals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The virus is antigenically diverse and across all hosts has at least 18 subtypes of the major surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), and 11 of the lower-abundance neuraminidases (NA) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A common feature of all HA subtypes is that the molecule is synthesized as a precursor (HA<sub>0</sub>) that, after assembly into a trimer, must be proteolytically cleaved into HA<sub>1</sub> and HA<sub>2</sub> subunits to produce infectious virus particles (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This cleavage step is achieved in cell culture by the addition of trypsin to the media, while secreted trypsin-like proteases of respiratory or mucosal epithelia perform this role in human seasonal IAV infections or low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus infections (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Virus replication is entirely dependent on this step, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In humans, IAV causes annual epidemics of respiratory illness with an estimated annual mortality rate of 290,000 to 600,000 worldwide (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Sporadic pandemics, associated with antigenically novel IAV strains, can lead to increased morbidity and mortality compared to seasonal epidemics (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Secondary bacterial coinfection is the most common complication of primary IAV, and a high incidence is reported during both epidemics and pandemics. The two bacterial species most commonly isolated from IAV coinfection patients are the Gram-positive species <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus pneumoniae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). During the most devastating human IAV pandemic, the 1918 H1N1 subtype &#x0201c;Spanish flu,&#x0201d; bacterial coinfection was identified in 70% to 90% of autopsies (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In the most recent pandemic of 2009, 25% to 40% of mortalities were attributed to bacterial coinfection, despite the widespread use of antibiotics (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> is found as a commensal organism in around 25% to 40% of the healthy human population but is responsible for an array of diseases, ranging from uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening conditions, such as endocarditis and necrotizing pneumonia (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Of note, the emergence of highly virulent clones of community-associated methicillin-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> (CA-MRSA) in recent years has resulted in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> becoming the leading cause of nosocomial pneumonia in the United States (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The role of immune dysregulation during coinfection has been extensively studied, and it is believed to be one of the main underlying causes for the increased susceptibility to bacterial coinfection following primary influenza (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The contribution of individual <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> factors is less known. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the SaeR/S system has been shown to contribute to coinfection in a murine model (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, phenol-soluble modulins have been demonstrated to be more cytotoxic in lung epithelial cells (ECs) previously infected with IAV (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and incubation with IAV resulted in virus bound to bacterial cells and increased adherence of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> to epithelial cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Additionally, Tashiro and colleagues (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) reported that <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain Wood 46 secretes a protease which can substitute for (or augment) the host proteases required to activate IAV HA, thereby enhancing the production of infectious viral particles. However, the identity of this protein remained unknown (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), hindering further investigation into possible intervention mechanisms.</p><p>In the current study, we investigated the ability of secreted proteins of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> to enhance IAV replication <italic>in vitro</italic>. Unexpectedly, we discovered that a single polypeptide, lipase 1, potentiates IAV replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, independently of all known <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> proteases. Lipase 1 acts during the late stages of IAV replication, separately from HA cleavage, leading to an increase in the number of infectious particles produced. These findings expand on our understanding of the molecular events that occur during IAV-<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> coinfection and identify a novel role for one of the most abundant <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>-secreted proteins (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> proviral activity is mediated by the lipolytic activity of lipase 1.</title><p>A previous study by Tashiro et al. reported that activity of an <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>-secreted protease enhanced IAV replication via HA cleavage (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> produces a wide array of proteins involved in pathogenesis, including 10 secreted proteases (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To investigate further the role of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> proteases during influenza coinfection, we repeated the protocol employed by Tashiro et al. and fractionated culture supernatants of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strains Wood 46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>), USA300 LAC and a deletion mutant of USA300 LAC deficient in the production of all known secreted proteases (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">B</xref> in the supplemental material) by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Aliquots of the resulting SEC fractions were added to primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells infected with the H1N1 IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) to test for their ability to support virus replication in the absence of exogenous trypsin. As expected, the addition of trypsin increased virus titer several-hundred-fold compared to samples with no exogenous protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>). Fractions 2 to 4 from both Wood 46 and USA300 LAC culture supernatants also showed significantly increased virus replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>), consistent with the original report of Tashiro et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, unexpectedly, supernatant fractions from the protease-deficient USA300 LAC strain retained proviral activity equivalent to that of the wild-type (WT) fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>), indicating that the pro-IAV activity was independent of the presence of known secreted proteases.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> lipase 1 is proviral for IAV <italic>in vitro</italic>.

To investigate this, rlipase 1 was added at different stages of a single-cycle infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>). The presence of rlipase 1 before infection or during virus absorption did not lead to an increase in titer. However, addition of rlipase 1 after the absorption period at any time up to the first 6 h postinfection (hpi) resulted in significant increases in titer, whereas addition at 7 h onward had no significant influence. These data suggested that rlipase 1 was not affecting the attachment and/or internalization of the virus but was acting later in the replication cycle. It is also possible that rlipase 1 affects virus replication in both early and late events, a scenario that this experimental setup could not exclude. To determine if rlipase 1 induced increased production of viral components, we analyzed the accumulation of viral proteins at different time points. No differences were observed between virus-infected cells and infected cells treated with rlipase 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of intracellular viral RNA also showed no significant differences between treated and untreated cells in the levels of accumulation of viral segment 2 or viral segment 7 RNAs produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>). Therefore, rlipase 1 did not seem to be affecting viral macromolecular synthesis, thus suggesting an effect on assembly and/or release. To investigate the final steps of viral replication, we quantified the amounts of viral genome (a measure of overall virus particle formation) and infectious particles released into the culture supernatant. The addition of either active rlipase 1 or the catalytically inactive S408A mutant had no significant effect on the amounts of viral genomic RNA released at 8 hpi, but as before, the presence of active rlipase 1 but not inactive rlipase 1 significantly increased the titer of infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4D</xref>). Consequently, this caused a significant decrease in the genome copy number/PFU ratio of the virus population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4E</xref>). Similar effects were seen when earlier (6 hpi) or later (10 hpi) time points were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#x000a0;S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">B</xref>), indicating that rlipase 1 increased the infectivity of released virus.

Consistent with this, analysis of the cell surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that, at 8 h after infection with PR8, there were notably more virus particles budding from cells treated with active rlipase 1 than with from those treated with the catalytically inert version of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5A</xref>). The PR8 strain of IAV produces only spherical virus particles, but most human clinical strains of IAV also produce micrometer-length filamentous particles (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). To examine the cells for effects on this form of virus budding, we utilized a filamentous derivative of PR8 (PR8 MUd) containing segment 7 from the filamentous virus A/Udorn/307/1972 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Treatment of PR8 MUd-infected CEF cells with active rlipase 1 but not inactive rlipase 1 resulted in a significant increase in the number of infected cells producing viral filaments, as well as in the length of the filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">C</xref>).

Addition of &#x0223c;100 nM rlipase 1 to 10-day-old embryonated eggs did not result in toxicity to the embryos (data not shown). Addition of rlipase 1 to eggs infected with the reassortant virus resulted in increased average HA titers compared to virus-only samples, although the results did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6A</xref>).

A previous report indicated that an unidentified protease from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain Wood 46 was responsible for enhanced IAV replication in primary avian cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> lipase 1 enhances IAV replication during infection of primary human and avian cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in ovo</italic> and that this activity is independent of known secreted proteases. Instead, our data indicate that <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> lipase 1 is responsible for this proviral effect and that this applies to a broad array of IAV subtypes of mammalian and avian origin (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Lipase 1 is one of the most abundantly expressed proteins secreted by the USA300 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), but an understanding of its biological role is lacking. <italic>In vivo</italic> expression has been implied due to detection of circulating anti-lipase antibodies (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and lipolytic activity on short-chain triglycerides has been reported, although the kinetics data suggest that it has lower activity than lipase 2 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The specific lipolytic activity of lipase 2 has also been shown to prevent innate immune cell activation by inactivating bacterial lipoproteins and thus blocking recognition by macrophages (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, to date, no role for lipase 1 in the pathogenesis of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> has been identified. Here, we provide the first report of a role for lipase 1 activity during coinfection with IAV.</p><p>Our data indicate that the effect of lipase 1 on IAV occurs during the late stages of virus replication. We propose that lipase 1 acts by modifying host cell lipids in the cell plasma membrane, leading to more efficient budding and to production of an increased number of infectious IAV particles per replication cycle. Although understanding of IAV assembly and particle budding is incomplete (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), membrane modulation is required for the formation and release of new particles, and specific lipid structures, in and out of lipid rafts (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), have been implicated as preferred budding sites. Conversely, previous work has indicated that budding of the virus can be altered both positively and negatively by perturbation of membrane composition (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The lipase 1-mediated phenotype was observed only in primary fibroblast cells, and it is possible that the lipids modified by lipase 1 are not present or are differentially regulated in immortalized cells. Indeed, immortalized cells have been reported to have numerous attenuations affecting innate intracellular immunity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and the lipid composition of membranes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This is consistent with the differences in proviral activity between lipase 1 and lipase 2, which have been shown to have different substrate preferences (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The apparent specificity of lipase 1 for fibroblast cells is noteworthy, as these cells are present in most lung spaces and account for about 10 to 20% of all lung cells (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and have been demonstrated to be recruited during IAV infection (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of lipase 1 on fibroblasts could partially reflect the specific timing of bacterial coinfection. Coinfection by <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> normally occurs around day 7 of IAV infection, after the viral peak (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), at a time when the lung environment begins tissue repair. Lung repair is spearheaded by fibroblasts, and these cells are recruited heavily to sites of virus-induced damage (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). As such, the increase in levels of available target cells may exacerbate the effect of lipase 1 during coinfection, resulting in the resurgence of viral titer observed during coinfection (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>The proviral activity of rlipase 1 for NHLF cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> further suggests a potential role during human clinical infection, and the enhanced virus replication <italic>in ovo</italic> indicates the relevance of the lipase 1 activity for IAV in a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> environment. Animal models have demonstrated disease exacerbation upon coinfection (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and expression of lipase 1, which is widespread in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4</xref> in the supplemental material), has been suggested to occur during human infection, based on the detection of antibodies (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Accordingly, we suggest that <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> superinfection of humans with influenza may lead to a lipase 1-mediated enhancement of virus replication, resulting in a more prolonged and severe infection. Furthermore, the damage caused by the increased IAV replication in fibroblasts in the lung may lead to increased occurrence of fibrosis, which has been demonstrated during bacterial coinfection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Additionally, IAV-<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pneumoniae</named-content> coinfection models have demonstrated the viral neuraminidase can cleave sialic acid (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), which bacteria can utilize as an energy source (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and IAV infection also results in an increase in levels of host adhesion molecules, such as fibronectin (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), that both <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pneumoniae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> can bind. Therefore, enhanced virus replication could facilitate the spread and replication of bacteria, suggesting an indirect beneficial role for lipase 1 in the pathogenesis of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> during coinfection. Although it is well established that secondary bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of mortality during IAV epidemics, animal models of IAV-<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> infection have offered differing pictures of the outcome of coinfection. While some murine models have demonstrated increased severity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> respiratory disease when preceded by IAV infection (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), in a cynomolgus macaque model, prior infection with IAV did not predispose the animals to more-severe infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> USA300 (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The authors concluded that the distinct observations made compared to human clinical and rodent model data may have been due to variation in the strain of virus employed or to a host species-specific effect on susceptibility to IAV or <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> infection. Alternatively, it was suggested that the findings may indicate that unknown comorbidities are required to promote the synergistic effect of IAV-<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> coinfection (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>Although we did not see an effect of lipase 1 in the murine coinfection model employed in the current study, this may have been due to the timing of bacterial challenge relative to IAV infection, prior to the maximal recruitment of fibroblasts, or to general limitations of the murine model for replicating human respiratory infection as previously established (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Furthermore, the bacteria were rapidly cleared from the lungs and levels of lipase 1 expression may not have been sufficient to mediate a proviral effect. However, using an established embryonated egg model, a clear proviral effect for rlipase 1 was identified <italic>in vivo</italic>. This observation suggests that a potential application of the current finding is the utilization of rlipase 1 as a growth enhancer for IAV vaccine production. Vaccine production can be inefficient, particularly with recent H1N1 and H3N2 isolates, which grow poorly in eggs due to receptor incompatibilities (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The use of rlipase 1 could significantly enhance the yield of poorly growing viruses, as demonstrated here with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 reassortant virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>). Of note, <italic>in vitro</italic> data obtained from studies performed with CEF cells indicated that rlipase 1 was active on avian strains of IAV (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>), which could be a considerable advantage in the event of an influenza pandemic caused by a strain bearing an avian strain-derived HA (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>).</p><p>The threat of another global influenza pandemic is ongoing, and bacterial coinfection is a frequent and major complication of primary IAV infection. The rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens, such as MRSA, is a further threat with respect to enhancement of IAV morbidity and mortality. In conclusion, we report the first example of a secreted staphylococcal factor that enhances IAV replication and that could represent a target for combination therapy to reduce the severity of IAV-<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> coinfection. In addition, the novel proviral activity could be applied to address global IAV vaccine shortages which are a major public health concern in the light of the threat of a global pandemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Tissue culture.</title><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) (Millipore-Sigma, United Kingdom) with 5% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen, United Kingdom) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (PSG) (Invitrogen, United Kingdom) at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
