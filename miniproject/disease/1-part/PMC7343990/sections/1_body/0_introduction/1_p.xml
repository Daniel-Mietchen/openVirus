<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family, with a segmented, negative-sense RNA genome. Aquatic birds are viewed as the reservoir host, but it infects a wide variety of vertebrate hosts, including birds, bats, and terrestrial and aquatic mammals (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The virus is antigenically diverse and across all hosts has at least 18 subtypes of the major surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), and 11 of the lower-abundance neuraminidases (NA) (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A common feature of all HA subtypes is that the molecule is synthesized as a precursor (HA
 <sub>0</sub>) that, after assembly into a trimer, must be proteolytically cleaved into HA
 <sub>1</sub> and HA
 <sub>2</sub> subunits to produce infectious virus particles (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This cleavage step is achieved in cell culture by the addition of trypsin to the media, while secreted trypsin-like proteases of respiratory or mucosal epithelia perform this role in human seasonal IAV infections or low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus infections (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Virus replication is entirely dependent on this step, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (
