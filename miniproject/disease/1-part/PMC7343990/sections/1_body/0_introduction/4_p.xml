<p>In the current study, we investigated the ability of secreted proteins of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> to enhance IAV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Unexpectedly, we discovered that a single polypeptide, lipase 1, potentiates IAV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, independently of all known 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> proteases. Lipase 1 acts during the late stages of IAV replication, separately from HA cleavage, leading to an increase in the number of infectious particles produced. These findings expand on our understanding of the molecular events that occur during IAV-
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> coinfection and identify a novel role for one of the most abundant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>-secreted proteins (
