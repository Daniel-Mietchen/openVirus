<p>In humans, IAV causes annual epidemics of respiratory illness with an estimated annual mortality rate of 290,000 to 600,000 worldwide (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Sporadic pandemics, associated with antigenically novel IAV strains, can lead to increased morbidity and mortality compared to seasonal epidemics (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Secondary bacterial coinfection is the most common complication of primary IAV, and a high incidence is reported during both epidemics and pandemics. The two bacterial species most commonly isolated from IAV coinfection patients are the Gram-positive species
