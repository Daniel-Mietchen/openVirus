 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> is found as a commensal organism in around 25% to 40% of the healthy human population but is responsible for an array of diseases, ranging from uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening conditions, such as endocarditis and necrotizing pneumonia (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Of note, the emergence of highly virulent clones of community-associated methicillin-resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> (CA-MRSA) in recent years has resulted in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> becoming the leading cause of nosocomial pneumonia in the United States (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The role of immune dysregulation during coinfection has been extensively studied, and it is believed to be one of the main underlying causes for the increased susceptibility to bacterial coinfection following primary influenza (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The contribution of individual 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> factors is less known. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, the SaeR/S system has been shown to contribute to coinfection in a murine model (

 <italic>In vitro</italic>, phenol-soluble modulins have been demonstrated to be more cytotoxic in lung epithelial cells (ECs) previously infected with IAV (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and incubation with IAV resulted in virus bound to bacterial cells and increased adherence of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> to epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Additionally, Tashiro and colleagues (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) reported that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain Wood 46 secretes a protease which can substitute for (or augment) the host proteases required to activate IAV HA, thereby enhancing the production of infectious viral particles. However, the identity of this protein remained unknown (
