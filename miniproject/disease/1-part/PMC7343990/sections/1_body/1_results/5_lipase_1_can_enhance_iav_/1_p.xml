<p>In order to examine the effect of lipase 1 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we initially utilized a murine model of IAV-
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> coinfection where bacteria were introduced 1 day after IAV infection, but there were no significant differences in weight loss or clinical scores and we saw only a moderate increase in viral titer in the coinfected animals, regardless of the presence or absence of lipase 1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig. S6</xref>). In addition, complete bacterial clearance had occurred by day 2 postcoinfection (data not shown). Animal models of IAV-
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> coinfection are limited in their capacity to recapitulate the conditions of human respiratory infection (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Furthermore, a number of studies have indicated that conventional mouse models have major limitations for the study of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>, due to immune system activation or receptor incompatibility for 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> effector proteins (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Accordingly, we next employed another established 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> system of IAV replication—embryonated hen’s eggs. Importantly, this system is also used for the commercial production of IAV vaccine, so we used a reassortant virus with glycoprotein genes from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic isolate A/California/07/2009 and the remaining segments from PR8 to mimic a vaccine strain of IAV (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Addition of ∼100 nM rlipase 1 to 10-day-old embryonated eggs did not result in toxicity to the embryos (data not shown). Addition of rlipase 1 to eggs infected with the reassortant virus resulted in increased average HA titers compared to virus-only samples, although the results did not reach statistical significance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, an assessment of the amounts of HA
 <sub>1</sub> in partially purified virus preparations by Western blotting following deglycosylation (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) showed that the addition of rlipase 1 greatly improved the yield of the vaccine antigen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Quantification of HA
 <sub>1</sub> from replicate experiments revealed a 5-fold increase in protein yield following treatment with rlipase 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Thus, rlipase 1 enhanced IAV replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, in a manner similar to that observed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, regardless of the presence of proteases 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> that cleave IAV HA and facilitate multicycle infection. Importantly, these findings suggest a potential application of rlipase 1 activity for the enhancement of IAV vaccine yield, which is currently a major limitation of standard methods for the production of influenza vaccines.
