<p>To further characterize the effect of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> lipase 1 on IAV replication, we produced polyhistidine-tagged recombinant forms of both lipase 1 (rlipase 1) and the paralog lipase 2 (rlipase 2) in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> and purified them by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">B</xref>). Both protein preparations exhibited concentration-dependent lipolytic activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, with lipase 2 showing higher activity than lipase 1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">D</xref>), consistent with previous reports (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). When CEF cells infected with IAV PR8 were incubated with the recombinant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> lipase 1 (rlipase 1), there was a concentration-dependent increase in IAV titer, whereas recombinant lipase 2 (rlipase 2) had no proviral effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). The lipolytic activity of lipase 1 has been mapped to serine 408 and histidine 643 (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), so to test if the proviral phenotype of the protein was due to lipase activity, a site-directed mutant form of rlipase 1 (rlipase 1 S408A), with the serine replaced by alanine, was similarly produced in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and purified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Importantly, mutation of the active site of rlipase 1 dramatically reduced both the lipolytic activity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2E</xref>) and the proviral activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>) of the protein, suggesting that the lipase enzymatic activity was responsible for the proviral effect.
