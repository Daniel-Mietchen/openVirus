<p>To identify the bacterial factor responsible for the observed proviral effect, the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> SEC fractions were further separated by ion-exchange chromatography (IEC; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1C</xref>), after which 3 samples were found to have consistently retained proviral activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These were analyzed by tryptic digestion followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and two proteins, lipase 1 (
 <italic>gehA</italic>) and lipase 2 (
 <italic>gehB</italic>), were found to be common to the active fractions (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material). The proviral activity of these and of two other high-scoring mass spectrometry candidates, N-acetylmuramoyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-alanine amidase domain-containing protein (amidase) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were tested by utilizing the Nebraska transposon (Tn) mutant library, constructed in the USA300 LAC background (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Culture supernatants from the relevant Tn insertion mutants were fractionated by SEC and tested for their ability to promote IAV replication as described above. Disruption of the lipase 2, amidase, or GAPDH genes had no impact on the proviral activity of USA300 culture supernatants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast, disruption of the lipase 1 gene reduced the stimulatory activity to background levels. Furthermore, the proviral phenotype could be restored by complementation of the lipase 1 Tn mutant with a plasmid encoding lipase 1 (pLip1; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the observed proviral activity of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> USA300 LAC is dependent on the presence of lipase 1.
