<p>A previous study by Tashiro et al. reported that activity of an 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>-secreted protease enhanced IAV replication via HA cleavage (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> produces a wide array of proteins involved in pathogenesis, including 10 secreted proteases (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To investigate further the role of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> proteases during influenza coinfection, we repeated the protocol employed by Tashiro et al. and fractionated culture supernatants of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strains Wood 46 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>), USA300 LAC and a deletion mutant of USA300 LAC deficient in the production of all known secreted proteases (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">B</xref> in the supplemental material) by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Aliquots of the resulting SEC fractions were added to primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells infected with the H1N1 IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) to test for their ability to support virus replication in the absence of exogenous trypsin. As expected, the addition of trypsin increased virus titer several-hundred-fold compared to samples with no exogenous protease (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Fractions 2 to 4 from both Wood 46 and USA300 LAC culture supernatants also showed significantly increased virus replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>), consistent with the original report of Tashiro et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, unexpectedly, supernatant fractions from the protease-deficient USA300 LAC strain retained proviral activity equivalent to that of the wild-type (WT) fractions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>), indicating that the pro-IAV activity was independent of the presence of known secreted proteases.
