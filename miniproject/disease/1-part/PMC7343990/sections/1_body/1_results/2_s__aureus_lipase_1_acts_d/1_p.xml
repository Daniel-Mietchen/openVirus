<p>To examine further the rlipase 1 effect on IAV, growth of the virus in the presence of rlipase 1 was investigated in detail. IAV requires specific proteolytic cleavage of HA to produce infectious virus capable of initiating a new cycle of infection. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, this is normally mediated by exogenously added trypsin. As expected, infection of CEFs at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) with trypsin supported at least two successful rounds of infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>, blue triangles). However, when the partially trypsin-independent virus A/WSN/33 (WSN) (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) was utilized, rlipase 1 increased virus yield across the whole time course, with true multicycle replication kinetics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Growth under high-MOI conditions similarly demonstrated that the presence of rlipase 1 increased IAV titer during a single round of replication for both strains of IAV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref>). Thus, rlipase 1 enhanced replication of a trypsin-dependent IAV in a single replication cycle but did not support multiple rounds of infection, suggesting that it was not acting as if it were mediating proteolytic cleavage of HA.
