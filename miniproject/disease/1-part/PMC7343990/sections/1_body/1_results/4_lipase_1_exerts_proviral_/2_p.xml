<p>The finding that the proviral effect of lipase 1 depended on its enzymatic activity suggested the hypothesis that it might affect the process of virus budding through the plasma membrane. Consistent with this, analysis of the cell surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that, at 8 h after infection with PR8, there were notably more virus particles budding from cells treated with active rlipase 1 than with from those treated with the catalytically inert version of the protein (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Treatment of PR8 MUd-infected CEF cells with active rlipase 1 but not inactive rlipase 1 resulted in a significant increase in the number of infected cells producing viral filaments, as well as in the length of the filaments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">C</xref>). Thus, overall, the results showed that rlipase 1 acts late in the viral life cycle to favorably modulate IAV morphogenesis.
