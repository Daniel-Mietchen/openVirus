<p>We considered that the increase in the number of infectious particles seen during a single infectious cycle might have been due to (i) increased levels of attachment and entry, (ii) more-efficient production of virus components, or (iii) improved assembly and release from the cell. To investigate this, rlipase 1 was added at different stages of a single-cycle infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The presence of rlipase 1 before infection or during virus absorption did not lead to an increase in titer. However, addition of rlipase 1 after the absorption period at any time up to the first 6 h postinfection (hpi) resulted in significant increases in titer, whereas addition at 7 h onward had no significant influence. These data suggested that rlipase 1 was not affecting the attachment and/or internalization of the virus but was acting later in the replication cycle. It is also possible that rlipase 1 affects virus replication in both early and late events, a scenario that this experimental setup could not exclude. To determine if rlipase 1 induced increased production of viral components, we analyzed the accumulation of viral proteins at different time points. No differences were observed between virus-infected cells and infected cells treated with rlipase 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of intracellular viral RNA also showed no significant differences between treated and untreated cells in the levels of accumulation of viral segment 2 or viral segment 7 RNAs produced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Therefore, rlipase 1 did not seem to be affecting viral macromolecular synthesis, thus suggesting an effect on assembly and/or release. To investigate the final steps of viral replication, we quantified the amounts of viral genome (a measure of overall virus particle formation) and infectious particles released into the culture supernatant. The addition of either active rlipase 1 or the catalytically inactive S408A mutant had no significant effect on the amounts of viral genomic RNA released at 8 hpi, but as before, the presence of active rlipase 1 but not inactive rlipase 1 significantly increased the titer of infectious virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Consequently, this caused a significant decrease in the genome copy number/PFU ratio of the virus population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Similar effects were seen when earlier (6 hpi) or later (10 hpi) time points were analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">B</xref>), indicating that rlipase 1 increased the infectivity of released virus. The original analysis of the molecular basis of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> enhancement of IAV disease postulated that a bacterial protease was responsible for cleaving viral HA (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). To determine if lipase 1 was able to cleave HA, partially purified virus preparations with either uncleaved or cleaved HA were treated with either rlipase 1 or trypsin. However, no HA cleavage was detected in the presence of rlipase 1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5C</xref>).
