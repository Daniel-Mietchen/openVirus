<p>To investigate if rlipase 1 had proviral activity for other strains of IAV and if this could extend to human cells, infections were performed using the H3N8 A/equine/Miami/63 (Miami) strain and primary normal human lung fibroblast (NHLF) cells. Importantly, rlipase 1 enhanced replication of PR8 and Miami in both CEF and NHLF cells, respectively, but rlipase 2 did not (

To determine the breadth of the proviral activity of rlipase 1, we tested a range of IAV strains in CEF and NHLF cells, under both single-cycle and multicycle growth conditions. Proviral activity was observed for all viruses tested, including avian strains, and for both cell types (

We also performed infections in relevant primary and continuous cell lines, including Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (used for IAV quantification by plaque assay), A549 human lung epithelial cells, DF1 cells (a spontaneous immortalized derivative of primary CEF cells), and primary human bronchial-tracheal epithelial cells (HBTECs). Of note, we did not observe a rlipase 1-mediated increase in viral titer in any of these cell lines (
