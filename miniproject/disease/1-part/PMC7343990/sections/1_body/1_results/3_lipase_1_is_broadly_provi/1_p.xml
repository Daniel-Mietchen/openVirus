<p>Lipase 1 has been reported to be one of the most abundantly secreted factors during the stationary phase of growth in the USA300 LAC strain (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the distribution and level of expression of lipase 1 among 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strains are poorly understood. Examination of 8,334 publicly available 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> genomes identified the lipase 1 gene (
