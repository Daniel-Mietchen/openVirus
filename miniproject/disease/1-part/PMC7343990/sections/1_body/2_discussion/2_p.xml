<p>Our data indicate that the effect of lipase 1 on IAV occurs during the late stages of virus replication. We propose that lipase 1 acts by modifying host cell lipids in the cell plasma membrane, leading to more efficient budding and to production of an increased number of infectious IAV particles per replication cycle. Although understanding of IAV assembly and particle budding is incomplete (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), membrane modulation is required for the formation and release of new particles, and specific lipid structures, in and out of lipid rafts (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), have been implicated as preferred budding sites. Conversely, previous work has indicated that budding of the virus can be altered both positively and negatively by perturbation of membrane composition (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The lipase 1-mediated phenotype was observed only in primary fibroblast cells, and it is possible that the lipids modified by lipase 1 are not present or are differentially regulated in immortalized cells. Indeed, immortalized cells have been reported to have numerous attenuations affecting innate intracellular immunity (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and the lipid composition of membranes (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This is consistent with the differences in proviral activity between lipase 1 and lipase 2, which have been shown to have different substrate preferences (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The apparent specificity of lipase 1 for fibroblast cells is noteworthy, as these cells are present in most lung spaces and account for about 10 to 20% of all lung cells (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and have been demonstrated to be recruited during IAV infection (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of lipase 1 on fibroblasts could partially reflect the specific timing of bacterial coinfection. Coinfection by 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> normally occurs around day 7 of IAV infection, after the viral peak (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), at a time when the lung environment begins tissue repair. Lung repair is spearheaded by fibroblasts, and these cells are recruited heavily to sites of virus-induced damage (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). As such, the increase in levels of available target cells may exacerbate the effect of lipase 1 during coinfection, resulting in the resurgence of viral titer observed during coinfection (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).
