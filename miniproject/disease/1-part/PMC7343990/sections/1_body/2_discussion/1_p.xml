<p>Secondary 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with influenza. A previous report indicated that an unidentified protease from 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain Wood 46 was responsible for enhanced IAV replication in primary avian cells (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> lipase 1 enhances IAV replication during infection of primary human and avian cells 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> and that this activity is independent of known secreted proteases. Instead, our data indicate that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> lipase 1 is responsible for this proviral effect and that this applies to a broad array of IAV subtypes of mammalian and avian origin (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>). Lipase 1 is one of the most abundantly expressed proteins secreted by the USA300 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strain (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), but an understanding of its biological role is lacking. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> expression has been implied due to detection of circulating anti-lipase antibodies (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and lipolytic activity on short-chain triglycerides has been reported, although the kinetics data suggest that it has lower activity than lipase 2 (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The specific lipolytic activity of lipase 2 has also been shown to prevent innate immune cell activation by inactivating bacterial lipoproteins and thus blocking recognition by macrophages (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, to date, no role for lipase 1 in the pathogenesis of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> has been identified. Here, we provide the first report of a role for lipase 1 activity during coinfection with IAV.
