<p>The threat of another global influenza pandemic is ongoing, and bacterial coinfection is a frequent and major complication of primary IAV infection. The rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens, such as MRSA, is a further threat with respect to enhancement of IAV morbidity and mortality. In conclusion, we report the first example of a secreted staphylococcal factor that enhances IAV replication and that could represent a target for combination therapy to reduce the severity of IAV-
