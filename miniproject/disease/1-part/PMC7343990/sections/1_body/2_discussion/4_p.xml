<p>Although we did not see an effect of lipase 1 in the murine coinfection model employed in the current study, this may have been due to the timing of bacterial challenge relative to IAV infection, prior to the maximal recruitment of fibroblasts, or to general limitations of the murine model for replicating human respiratory infection as previously established (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Furthermore, the bacteria were rapidly cleared from the lungs and levels of lipase 1 expression may not have been sufficient to mediate a proviral effect. However, using an established embryonated egg model, a clear proviral effect for rlipase 1 was identified 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This observation suggests that a potential application of the current finding is the utilization of rlipase 1 as a growth enhancer for IAV vaccine production. Vaccine production can be inefficient, particularly with recent H1N1 and H3N2 isolates, which grow poorly in eggs due to receptor incompatibilities (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> data obtained from studies performed with CEF cells indicated that rlipase 1 was active on avian strains of IAV (
