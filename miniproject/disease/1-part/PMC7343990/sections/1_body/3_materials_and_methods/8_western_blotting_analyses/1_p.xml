<p>CEF cells in 6-well plates were infected with PR8 at MOI of 1 and treated with 300 nM rlipase 1 as the standard. At 6, 8, and 10 h postinfection (hpi), cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 200 μl 2× Laemmli buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, United Kingdom). Protein was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) by the use of a Trans-Blot Turbo blotting system (Bio-Rad, United Kingdom), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were incubated for 60 min in PBS–0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, United Kingdom) (PBST)–5% (wt/vol) dried milk (Sigma-Aldrich, United Kingdom) and washed 3 times with PBST. Primary antibody mixed in PBST was added, followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature or O/N at 4°C. For detection of viral proteins, in-house rabbit sera (PB1, PB2, M1, and whole anti-PR8 virus sera for HA
 <sub>0</sub>), 1:500 anti-NP, 1:250 mouse monoclonal antibody 14C2 (M2), and 1:1,000 goat polyclonal anti-IAV H1N1 virus antibody (AbD Serotec 5315-0064) were used as primary antibodies. Tubulin was detected with a rat anti-tubulin antibody (Bio-Rad, United Kingdom) (1:1,000). HA from the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus (pH1N1) was detected with a rabbit polyclonal anti-swine H1 HA antibody (Ab91641; Abcam) (1:500). Rlipase 1 was used for the generation of a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Eurogentec, Belgium), using a proprietary 28-day program. The antibody was used at a 1:3,300 dilution to detect lipase 1 expression. Membranes were then washed 3 times for 5 min each time in PBST followed by incubation for 45 to 60 min with secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit antibody [IRDye 800RD] or goat anti-rat antibody [IRDye 680RD]; Li-Cor, United Kingdom) diluted in PBST before a further 5 or 6 washes with PBST and imaging on an infrared scanner (Li-Cor, United Kingdom) were performed.
