<p>Embryonated hen’s eggs (Henry-Stewart, United Kingdom) (10 days old) were used for all infections performed with rlipase 1. The eggs were infected with 100 PFU and 100 nM rlipase 1 (assuming an allantoic fluid volume of 10 ml) or with buffer to reach a total volume of 100 μl. The eggs were incubated for a further 48 h at 35°C and chilled O/N at 4°C, and allantoic fluid ws harvested. HA assays were performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). For partial purification of virus, the allantoic fluid from 4 or 5 eggs was pooled, clarified twice by centrifugation at 2,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and loaded onto a 30% sucrose cushion. Centrifugation was carried out at 4°C and 28,000 rpm for 3 h on a Beckman XL-71 machine (Beckman, United Kingdom) (SW28 rotor). Supernatant and sucrose were aspirated, and the tube was filled with PBS, followed by centrifugation at 28,000 rpm at 4°C for 1 h. PBS was removed, 300 μl of PBS ws added, and the pellet was allowed to lift at 4°C overnight. All samples were then equalized to the same volume before treatment was performed with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
