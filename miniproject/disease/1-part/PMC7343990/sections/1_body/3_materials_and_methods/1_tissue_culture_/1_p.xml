<p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Millipore-Sigma, United Kingdom) with 5% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen, United Kingdom) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (PSG) (Invitrogen, United Kingdom) at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. A549 and DF1 cells were maintained in DMEM–10% (vol/vol) FCS–1% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin (PS) (Invitrogen, United Kingdom). Chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells were isolated as previously described (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) with some modifications. Briefly, macerated 10-day-old embryos were incubated in trypsin/EDTA for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and passed through a 100-μm-pore-size cell strainer (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) to yield a single-cell suspension. Freshly isolated cells were maintained in M199 medium (Millipore-Sigma, United Kingdom)–4% (vol/vol) FCS–1% PS. CEF cells were used up to passage 6. Primary normal human lung fibroblast (NHLF) cells were purchased from Lonza, United Kingdom, and maintained in fibroblast growth medium, as recommended by the manufacturer. HBTECs were purchased from ATCC and cultured in airway epithelial cell basal medium supplemented with a bronchial epithelial cell growth kit (ATCC, USA). Cells were used at 80% confluence for infections.
