<p>CEF cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 3 or were subjected to mock infection. Addition of rlipase 1 or rlipase 1 S408A was performed to reach a final concentration of 300 nM after inoculum removal, per the standard protocol. At 6 h and 8 h postinfection, the supernatant was harvested and the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in RLT buffer with 143 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Qiagen, United Kingdom) (500 μl/well for a 6-well plate). Samples were processed with a QIAshredder (Qiagen, United Kingdom), and RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, United Kingdom), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a DNase step included on the column. cDNA was generated with a SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher, United Kingdom) in a 100-μl volume, per the manufacturer’s instructions, using 500 ng RNA per cDNA reaction. A 5-μl volume of a 1-in-4 dilution of the cDNA was used for quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) with FastStart universal SYBR green master mix (Roche, United Kingdom). qPCRs were performed in 20-μl reaction volumes with 400 nM forward primer and 500 nM reverse primer for the M1 and chicken actin genes (

Analysis was performed in triplicate, with the average value taken and normalized to chicken actin gene levels to give threshold cycle (Δ
