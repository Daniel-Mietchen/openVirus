<p>Recombinant protein was purified from cultures of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> BL21. Briefly, 1-liter cultures were grown in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.6 to 0.8 was reached. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside) for 4 h, pelleted, and frozen at −20°C. When required, pellets were defrosted, resuspended in 50 ml lysis buffer (50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) with complete protease inhibitor (Roche, United Kingdom), passed through a One-Shot cell disruptor (Constant Systems, Northants, United Kingdom) at 30,000 lb/in
 <sup>2</sup>, centrifuged at 4,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min, and passed through a 0.45-μm-pore-size filter. Proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) performed with a FF Crude nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom). The flow rate was 2.5 ml/min, with an elution gradient of 0% to 100% buffer (50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole) over 30 min. Protein was dialyzed in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) using Spectra/Por Float-a-Lyzer tubing with an 8,000-to-10,000-molecular-weight cutoff (Spectrum Laboratories, CA, USA). Relative protein concentrations were estimated by the use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Novagen, United Kingdom) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
