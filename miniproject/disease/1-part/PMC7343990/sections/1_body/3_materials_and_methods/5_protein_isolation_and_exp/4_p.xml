<p>For studies performed with IEC or SEC fractions, CEF cells were infected at MOI 0.01 and 50-μl volumes of ethanol-concentrated fractions were added to 1 ml of serum-free media. For studies performed with recombinant protein, 50-μl volumes of concentrated stock were added to 1 ml of serum-free medium to reach the final indicated concentration. Infections performed at MOI 0.01 were harvested at 48 h and those at MOI 3 at 24 h.</p>
