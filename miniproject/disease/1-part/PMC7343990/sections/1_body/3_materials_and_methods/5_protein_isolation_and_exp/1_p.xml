<p>For SEC, overnight (O/N) cultures in TSB were centrifuged at 4,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and filtered through a 0.45-μm-pore-size filter (Millipore, United Kingdom) and the supernatant was concentrated (5-to-7-fold) by the use of Amicon Ultra centrifugal units (10-kDa cutoff) to reach a total volume of 10 ml. Volumes (10 ml) of the concentrated supernatant were then loaded on a Superdex 75-pg size exclusion column (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5). Fractions (10 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Following chromatography, protein-containing fractions were subjected to ethanol precipitation. Briefly, 4 volumes of 100% ethanol were added to each fraction, and the fraction was frozen at −20°C for 4 h, centrifuged at 4,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min, and resuspended in 1/10 the original volume in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5). For SEC of complemented strains, cultures were grown in TSB to an optical density at 600 nm (OD
 <sub>600</sub>) of 0.6 to 0.8, induced with 125 ng/ml of tetracycline O/N, and processed as described above.
