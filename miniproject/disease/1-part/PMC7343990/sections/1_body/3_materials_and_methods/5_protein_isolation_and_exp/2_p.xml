 <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> USA300 WT SEC fractions 2 to 4, which were combined and separated on a SP Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). An elution gradient of 0% to 50% buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0]–1 M NaCl) was used at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were subjected to ethanol precipitation as described above prior to use.
