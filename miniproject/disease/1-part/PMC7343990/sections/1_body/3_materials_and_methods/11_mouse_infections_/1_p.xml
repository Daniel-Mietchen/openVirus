<p>All work involving animals was carried out under a United Kingdom Home Office license according to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Female BALB/c mice (10 to 12 weeks of age) were anaesthetized with isoflurane (Merial Animal Health Ltd.) and intranasally infected with virus (10 PFU) or bacteria (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU) in a mixture with 40 μl PBS (Gibco, United Kingdom). Mice were weighed daily and scored for visual signs of clinical disease, including inactivity, ruffled fur, and labored breathing. Clinical scores were quantitated on a scale of 0 to 3, and daily scores were added together. Animals that had exhibited severe clinical signs or had lost 25% to 30 % of their original body weight were euthanized by CO
 <sub>2</sub> asphyxiation. Lungs were removed and homogenized in PBS in a Qiagen Tissue Lyser II instrument run at 28 shakes/s for 4 min (2 runs of 2 min). The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and supernatant collected. Viral titers were determined by a standard plaque assay performed on MDCK cells.
