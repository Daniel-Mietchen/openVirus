<p>CEF cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well on glass coverslips the day prior to infection. Cells were infected at an MOI of 3, and rlipase 1 was added to reach a concentration of 300 nM immediately after inoculum removal. For confocal microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 8 hpi. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS–1% FBS and incubated with rabbit anti-PR8 antibody at 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. Following 3 washes with PBS–1% FBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher [A-21206]) (1:1,000) and DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Invitrogen) (1:10.000) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed as described above, and the glass coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using approximately 5 μl of ProLong antifade reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were imaged in a Leica LSM710 confocal microscope using a 63× lens objective. Images were collected as z-stacks across the depth of the cell membrane, generally in 0.45-μm increments, and are presented as maximum intensity projections. For counting the number of infected cells, a minimum of 60 cells were scored for the presence or absence of viral filaments. For measurement of filament length, a minimum of 60 filaments were measured using Image J (

For scanning electron microscopy, cells were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde–0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) O/N and then washed 3 times for 10 min each time with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Samples were then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide–0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 45 min. A further 3 washes (10 min each) were performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Cells were dehydrated in graded concentrations of acetone (once each at 50%, 70%, and 90% and 3 times at 100%) for 10 min each time followed by critical point drying using liquid carbon dioxide. After mounting of the specimens on aluminum stubs with carbon tabs attached, they were sputter coated with 20-nm-diameter gold palladium particles and viewed using a Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope.
