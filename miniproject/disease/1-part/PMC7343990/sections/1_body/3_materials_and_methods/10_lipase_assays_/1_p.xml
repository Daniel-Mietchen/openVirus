<p>Lipase assays were performed using purified recombinant protein as previously described (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Individual reaction mixtures contained 36 μl of Tween 20 as the substrate (diluted 1 in 10 in 20 mM Tris-HCl), 30 μl of 100 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 84 μl of 20 mM Tris (pH 8), and 50 μl recombinant protein at the indicated concentrations. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C in an Optima plate reader (Fluostar, United Kingdom), with shaking performed every 3 min. Optical density measurements at OD
 <sub>495</sub> were obtained every 5 min for a period of 24 h.
