<p>For the generation of recombinant proteins, the lipase 1 and lipase 2 genes, without their signal peptide sequences, were amplified as described above, using primer pair rLip1 F and rLip1 R and primer pair rLip2F and rLip2R (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref>), respectively, and inserted into pET15b vector, prior to transformation into 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> DH5α. Plasmid was isolated and freshly transformed into 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> BL21(DE3) cells prior to each induction. For site-directed mutagenesis, plasmid pET15b::lipase 1 was used with a QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent Technologies, United Kingdom) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
