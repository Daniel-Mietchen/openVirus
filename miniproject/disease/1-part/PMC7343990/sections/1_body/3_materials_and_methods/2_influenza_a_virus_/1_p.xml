<p>PR8, A/Udorn/307/72, A/Mallard/Netherlands/10/99, the PR8 MUd 7:1 reassortant between PR8 and A/Udorn/307/72, and a 6:2 reassortant between PR8 and A/California/07/2009 strain IAVs were generated from plasmid clones by reverse genetics (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). For generation of infectious IAV stocks, a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 was used to infect MDCK cells for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were washed, serum-free medium–2.5 μg/ml N-acetyl trypsin (NAT) (Millipore-Sigma, United Kingdom) was added, and infections were allowed to proceed for 48 h. Supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 4,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and stored at −80°C until further use. Egg-grown stocks were generated by infection of 11-day-old embryonated hen’s eggs (Henry Stewart, United Kingdom) with 100 PFU of virus. At 2 days postinfection, eggs were chilled and allantoic fluid was harvested, centrifuged twice at 4,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and stored at −80°C until further use. Infectious viral titers were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells, under an agarose overlay (

After the inoculum was removed, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), subjected to a 1-min wash using acid (10 mM HCl, 150 mM NaCl [pH 3]), and washed 3 times with PBS, after which serum-free medium without trypsin was added. Supernatant was harvested at 24 hpi and virus partially purified by ultracentrifugation as described below.
