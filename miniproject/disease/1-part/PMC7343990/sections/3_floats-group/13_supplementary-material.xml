 <p>Murine coinfection with IAV and 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> does not lead to an increase in viral titer. Groups of 5 female BALB/c animals were infected with PBS or 10 PFU PR8 intranasally in a mixture with 40 μl PBS on day 0. At 24 h later, animals were further challenged with 40 μl of 1 × 10
  <sup>7</sup> CFU of WT or lip1::tn 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> or PBS intranasally. (A) Weight loss postinfection. (B) Daily clinical scores of 0 to 3 were assigned for inactivity, ruffled fur, and labored breathing. A cumulative score representing the scores determined for all criteria is presented for each animal. (C) At 48 h after bacterial challenge, lungs were harvested and viral titers were determined by standard plaque assay. No bacteria were recovered from any of the animals. All data shown represent means ± standard errors of the means of results. Download
