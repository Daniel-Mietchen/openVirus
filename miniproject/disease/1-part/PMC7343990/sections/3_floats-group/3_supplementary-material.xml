 <p>Recombinant lipase 1 and lipase 2 are lipolytic enzymes. (A) 6xHistidine-tagged lipase 1 was purified by native immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). All fractions were diluted 1:10, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained for total protein (left) or were transferred to a membrane followed by Western blotting performed with an antihistidine antibody (right). Fraction 4 was chosen and used for further work. (B) 6xHistidine-tagged lipase 2 was purified by native IMAC. All fractions were diluted 1:10, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained for total protein (left) or transferred to a membrane followed by Western blotting performed with an anti-histidine-tagged antibody (right). Fraction 4 was chosen and used for further work. (C and D) A range of final concentrations (indicated in nanomolar) of rlipase 1 (C) or rlipase 2 (D) were used in a Tween-based lipase assay. The assay was performed in a plate reader, at 37°C, with optical density (OD) readings taken at 495 nm every 5 min for 18 h. Data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 3 independent protein preparations. (E) 6xHistidine-tagged lipase 1 or lipase 1 containing a S408A substitution was purified by native IMAC, and a final concentration of 300 nM of rlipase 1 or rlipase 1 S408A was used in a Tween-based lipolytic assay as described for panel C. Data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 3 independent protein preparations. Download
