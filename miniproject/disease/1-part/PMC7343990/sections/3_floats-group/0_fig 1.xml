   <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> lipase 1 is proviral for IAV 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>. (A) Supernatants from 
   <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> cultures were separated by SEC and 10-μl volumes of the first 10 fractions separated by SDS-PAGE and stained for total protein. Representative images of USA300 LAC fractions are shown. U, unfractionated. (B) CEF cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 0.01 and, immediately postabsorption, treated with trypsin (T; 2.5 μg/ml) or aliquots of unfractionated or fractionated supernatants from the indicated 
   <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strains. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay at 48 hpi and normalized to the level of an untreated control. (C) SEC fractions 2 to 4 from WT USA300 LAC were pooled and separated by IEC before testing for pro-IAV activity was performed as described above. Data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 3 independent infections. (D) Cells of transposon (tn) insertion mutants of indicated genes or a plasmid-complemented (Lip1::tn + pLip1) strain were grown and supernatants separated by SEC before testing for proviral activity was performed. Fractions were tested separately, but data shown represent the average values of results from fractions 1 to 5. (E) Increasing concentrations of purified rlipase 1 or rlipase 2 were added to CEF cells infected with PR8 at MOI 0.01. Infections were harvested after 48 h and infectious titers determined. (F) Aliquots of purified recombinant wild-type or catalytic site mutant (S408) lipase 1 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue or Western blotting with anti-histidine IgG. (G) A final concentration of 300 nM lipase 1 or lipase 1 S408A was added to CEF cells infected with PR8 at MOI 0.01. Infections were harvested after 48 h and infectious titers determined. Numerical data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 3 independent protein preparations (B, D, E, and G). Single asterisks (*), double asterisks (**), and triple asterisks (***) indicate 
   <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;0.05, &lt;0.01, and &lt;0.001, respectively, based on Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> test, compared to virus-only controls (B, C, and E), Tn-Lip1 (D and E), and rlipase 1 (F and G) results.
