  <p>Lipase 1 positively modulates virus budding. (A) CEF cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 3 and treated with a final concentration of 300 nM active or inactive (S408A) rlipase 1, and at 8 hpi, cells were fixed and processed for SEM. Representative images are shown at magnification of ×10,000. The scale bar indicates 2 μm. (B and C) CEF cells were infected with PR8 MUd at MOI of 3 treated with rlipase 1 or buffer as described above, and cells were fixed at 8 hpi and subjected to surface staining with an anti-PR8 antibody. Cells were imaged on a Leica confocal microscope. White arrows indicate viral filaments, and red arrows indicate cellular retraction fibers. Scale bar, 20 μm. (C) Images from panel B were analyzed, and the number of filament-producing cells and the filament length were determined. A minimum of 60 cells were counted and a minimum of 60 filaments measured from 3 independent experiments. A single asterisk (*) indicates a 
   <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05, and triple asterisks (***) indicate a 
   <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.001, based on a one-way ANOVA.
