  <p>Lipase 1 increases viral replication during a single infectious cycle. CEF cells were infected with PR8 (A) or WSN (B) at an MOI of 0.01 or with PR8 (C) or WSN (D) at an MOI of 3 in multicycle experiments (A and B) or single-cycle experiments (C and D). PBS or a final concentration of 300 nM rlipase 1 or 2.5 μg/ml trypsin was added immediately postinoculum removal. Infectious titers were determined at the indicated times. Data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 4 independent recombinant protein preparations. A single asterisk (*) indicates a 
   <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 for results of comparisons between the virus group without lipase 1 and the virus group with lipase 1, and a crosshatch symbol (#) indicates a 
   <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 for results of comparisons between the virus group without trypsin and the virus group with trypsin, based on Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test.
