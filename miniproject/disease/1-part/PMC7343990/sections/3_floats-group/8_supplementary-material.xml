 <p>Lipase 1 does not exhibit a proviral effect during infection of primary human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells. Monolayers of primary human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells were infected with PR8 at a MOI of 0.01 and treated with 2.5 μg/ml trypsin, a final concentration of 300 nM rlipase 1, or 300 nM rlipase 1S408A. Supernatant was harvested at 48 hpi, and infectious viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Data shown represent fold increases in virus-only samples. Data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 2 experiments, with 2 technical replicates per experiment. Download
