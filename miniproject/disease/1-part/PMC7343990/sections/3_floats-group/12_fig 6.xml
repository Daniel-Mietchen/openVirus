  <p>Lipase 1 enhances IAV replication 
   <italic>in ovo</italic>. (A) Groups of 4 to 6 10-day-old embryonated eggs were infected with 100 PFU of a Cal07:PR8 6:2 reassortant virus (pH1N1), and a final concentration of 100 nM rlipase 1 or 50 mM Tris was added to the virus. Eggs were chilled 48 h later, and allantoic fluid was harvested and HA titer determined. (B) Samples from the experiment described in panel A were pooled, virus was partially purified through a sucrose cushion, and HA was deglycosylated prior to Western blotting for HA. Representative images are shown. (C) The signal intensity of Western blot bands was quantified. Data shown are from 3 independent experiments performed with separate protein preparations, including 4 to 6 eggs per group per experiment. A single asterisk (*) indicates a 
   <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05, based on paired Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> tests.
