  <p>Lipase 1 increases the ratio of infectious particles produced during an infection. (A) CEF cells were treated with a final concentration of 300 nM rlipase 1 for the periods indicated by the blue lines before or after being infected with PR8 at MOI of 1. Lane A, a 1-h virus adsorption step was performed at 37°C followed by an acid wash step following inoculum removal to destroy uninternalized virus. All samples were harvested at 10 hpi and titrated by plaque assay. Data shown as means ± standard errors of the means of data representing fold change with respect to the virus-only sample for 5 independent recombinant protein preparations. (B) CEF cells infected with PR8 at MOI of 1 were lysed and Western blotting was performed as indicated. (C) CEF cells were infected as described for panel B and lysed at the indicated time points, and total RNA was extracted. qRT-PCR was performed for PR8 segment 2 (Seg 2) and Seg 7 RNAs, and values were normalized to chicken actin transcripts. Data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 2 independent protein preparations and primary cell isolations. (D and E) CEF cells were infected as described for panel B, and cell lysate was used for extraction of RNA and assay of virus titers at the indicated times. Copies of viral genomic RNA from segments 2 and 7 were quantitated by qRT-PCR (D), and genome copy number-to-PFU ratios were calculated (E). Data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 3 independent protein preparations and primary cell isolations. Single asterisks (*) and double asterisks (**) indicate 
   <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;0.05 and &lt;0.01, respectively, as assessed by one-way ANOVA and Dunn’s multiple-comparison test.
