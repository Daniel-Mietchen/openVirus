  <p>Lipase 1 proviral activity is restricted to primary cells. The indicated cell lines were infected with PR8 (A and C) or Miami (B and D) IAV at an MOI of 0.01 and a final concentration of 300 nM rlipase 1 or rlipase 2 or of 2.5 μg/ml trypsin was added. Infectious titers were determined after 48 h. All data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 3 independent protein preparations. A single asterisk (*) indicates a 
   <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05, based on a Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test, compared to the virus-only control.
