 <p>Lipase 1 expression can be detected across a range of 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> isolates. 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> strains representing a number of important sequence types (ST), or from confirmed IAV-
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> coinfections (
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>), were selected and the levels of production of lipase 1 investigated. The indicated strains were grown O/N to stationary phase in TSB in the absence of IAV and normalized to an OD
  <sub>600</sub> of 3.0, and the supernatants were harvested. Supernatants (or a final concentration of 200 nM rlipase 1 as a marker; M) were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained for total protein (top) or were transferred to a membrane followed by Western blotting performed with anti-lipase 1 antibody (bottom). Lipase 1 is indicated with a red arrow. A large amount of nonspecific background signal is present on the Western blot due to the endogenous production of protein A by 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>, which binds IgG nonspecifically (blue arrows). Note that different strains often produce differing profiles of secreted proteins, which accounts for the diversity of expression profiles observed on the SDS-PAGE gel. Signs under the images indicate whether the strain was deemed to express lipase 1 (+) or not (-). Download
