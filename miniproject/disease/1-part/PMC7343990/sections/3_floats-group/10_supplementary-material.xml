 <p>Lipase 1 increases the ratio of infectious particles produced during an infection but not by cleaving HA. (A and B) Supernatants from CEF cells infected with PR8 at a MOI of 1 were collected at the indicated times, and titers were determined for copies of viral genomic RNA from segments 2 and 7 by qRT-PCR and infectious titer by plaque assay. (B) Genome copy number-to-PFU ratios were calculated. Data shown are means ± standard errors of the means of results from 3 independent protein preparations and primary cell isolations. An asterisk (*) indicates a 
  <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05, assessed by one-way ANOVA and Dunn’s multiple-comparison test. (C) Partially purified virus with uncleaved HA (left) or cleaved HA (right) was treated with PBS (-), 2.5 μg/ml trypsin (T), or 300 nM rlipase 1 (L) for 1 h at 37°C. Samples were then separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and Western blotting was performed with goat polyclonal anti-whole H1N1 virus antibody. The images shown are representative of the results.
