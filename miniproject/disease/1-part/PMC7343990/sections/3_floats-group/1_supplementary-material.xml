  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> proviral activity is independent of known secreted proteases. (A and B) Stationary-phase supernatant from Wood 46 (A) or USA300 LAC Δprotease (B) was separated by SEC, and 10-μl volumes of the first 10 fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained for total protein. (C) SEC fractions 2 to 4 from WT USA300 LAC were pooled and separated by cation exchange chromatography. All fractions (10 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE and silver stained. U, unfractionated; RT, column flowthrough, W, wash. Images representative of multiple independent purifications are shown. Download
