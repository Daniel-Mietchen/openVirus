<p>Differential Moranâ€™s I statistic and LISA analyses were used to explore the variation of spatial autocorrelation over time. In these differential analyses, a hotspot indicated that a higher than average case incidence in the highlighted neighbourhood during the first time period led to a higher than average case incidence in the bordering neighbourhoods during the following time period. These analyses were performed for the CHIKV and ZIKV cases for each month of their epidemics: July 2014 to April 2015 for CHIKV and October 2015 to June 2016 for ZIKV cases (
