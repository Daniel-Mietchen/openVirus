<p>The total incidence of surveillance-defined or laboratory-confirmed CHIKV and ZIKV cases over the study period was linked to the neighbourhood shapefile. The number of recorded cases of each of these viral infections was divided by the population of each neighbourhood and multiplied by 10,000 to achieve an incidence rate of cases per neighbourhood per 10,000 persons at risk. The incidence was calculated for CHIKV and ZIKV for each individual monthly. The spatial structure of CHIKV and ZIKV case incidences over the study period of 2014 to 2016 was mapped using ArcGIS 10.3. (ESRI Inc., Redlands CA, USA) [
