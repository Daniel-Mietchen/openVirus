<p>As with the CHIKV SIR values, the Bayesian Poisson model of the ZIKV SIR values fitted with the explanatory variables and with no random effects showed a poor fitting performance of the incidence data (DIC: 2815.7) (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01759-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, we introduced a set of independent random effects using the model 2 approach (Text S2) to capture the remaining variability. Unlike the CHIKV SIR model 2, we did not find any significant residual spatial correlation at a global scale (Moranâ€™s I statistic: 0.0101, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 0.329) upon fitting the ZIKV SIR value data based on the model 2 approach. However, a local Moran I statistic clearly showed the presence of some residual local spatial dependence (
