<p>We minimised the limitations of the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP) [

 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] in our study by using neighbourhoods as the unit of analysis that was the smallest possible resolution available to us. However, while these analyses identified neighbourhood-level risk factors, the ecological fallacy prevented us from interpolating this to individual risk level. The statistical regression was limited by the possibility of residual confounding. There were several variables that we were unable to evaluate. The ethnicity of the people living in each neighbourhood may be important, as shown in other studies, where Afro-Colombians were shown to have lower DENV-infected case incidences [

 <xref rid="B83-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Occupation, especially since it affects the movement of populations towards and away from neighbourhoods with various disease risk factors, may play an important role, as was reported for DENV-infected case incidences in poor neighbourhoods with high populations of young (&lt;15 years old) [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Housing data were unavailable for 30% of the neighbourhoods, while the percentage of dwellings that were houses or apartments was unavailable for 19% of the neighbourhoods. We used a multiple imputation approach to mitigate the effect of unavailable data. This assumed that the unavailable data were missing at random and the imputation model was correctly specified [
