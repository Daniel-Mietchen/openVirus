<p>Further research also needs to be performed to account for differences in vector breeding, dispersal and disease transmission. During the CHIKV epidemic, the possible introduction of the virus into (a) the northern neighbourhoods and (b) the western neighbourhood (1206), located immediately adjacent to the import/export cargo warehouses via the main circular roads and further dispersal by the main road, as well as its possible later importation into (c) neighbourhood 2103 via cargo ships docking at the major international harbour, is consistent with both major roads [
