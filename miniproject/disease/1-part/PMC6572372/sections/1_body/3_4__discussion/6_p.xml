<p>Drawing spatial distinctions between the CHIKV and ZIKV cases assumed that the infected cases reported for these analyses were accurately identified. However, there are known limitations for accurate clinical discrimination amongst arboviral infections, especially since financial restraints made it impossible to perform laboratory confirmation on all suspected cases. Previous projects in Barranquilla further evaluated the frequency with which these methods were used and found that only 1% of ZIKV and 1.7% of CHIKV-infected cases were laboratory confirmed [
