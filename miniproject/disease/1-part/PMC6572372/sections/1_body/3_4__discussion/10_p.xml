<p>More in-depth data about housing vulnerability could include type of building material, exposure to the outside, and presence of air conditioning, since home air conditioning was a major factor accounting for the much lower DENV sero-positivity for the residents in a study site in Texas, USA compared to that in a twined town in Mexico [

Further analysis should assess these arboviral case incidences with the residents’ occupation and other forms of population movement. More detailed vector surveillance is also needed throughout the city to elucidate why the risk factors identified in this study are associated with higher transmission. Although adult 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> are known to fly up to 2 km if required, they usually fly much shorter distances (e.g., 10–150 m) to find blood meals and breeding sites [

As no effective treatments or vaccines exist for CHIKV and ZIKV, prevention is still the primary method of control [
