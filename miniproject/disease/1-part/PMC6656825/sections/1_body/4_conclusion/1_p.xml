<p id="Par36">In conclusion, our study confirms that hMPV, a respiratory virus causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children, was associated with severe CAP requiring ICU admission among elderly patients or patients with comorbidities, but also in healthy young subjects. These patients often underwent mechanical ventilation with long ICU and hospital stays, associated with elevated health resource consumption. The results of this study agree with recent observations [

While one out of four patients showed pneumococcal coinfection, plasma procalcitonin levels helped to implement antimicrobial stewardship.
