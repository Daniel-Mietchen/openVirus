<p id="Par22">The detection of hMPV in respiratory samples was made by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in house monoplex until July 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], real-time commercial multiplex (Luminex xTAG Respiratory viral panel [USA]) until July 2013 and Seegene Anyplex™ II RV16/Allplex™ Respiratory Panel [Republic of Korea] since then. The extraction of nucleic acids was made using an automatic BioRobot1 M48 extractor (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) until July 2009 and the NucliSENS
 <sup>®</sup> Easy-Mag platform (bio-Mèrieux SA, Marcy l’Etoile, France) from that date. The genotyping of hMPV was performed with a RT-PCR followed by sequencing [

 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> antigenuria (Alere BinaxNOW, Scarborough, ME, USA), and pharyngeal exudates with viral transport media to evaluate respiratory viruses were assessed in all the patients included in the study. Coinfection was considered when hMPV was isolated with other viral or bacterial pathogens at the same time.
