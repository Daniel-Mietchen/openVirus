<p id="Par21">All patients older than 14 years from July 2007 to June 2017 admitted in the ICU by CAP with admission PSI score ≥ 3 were considered eligible. During the first 2 years of the study, samples to detect respiratory viruses were obtained occasionally in patients with CAP. However, it turned the standard of care in the ICU after 2009 influenza pandemic. To be included, cases meet two of the following three criteria upon admission: (a) severe acute respiratory failure (paO2/FiO2 &lt; 250), (b) multilobar radiological involvement or (c) systolic arterial pressure &lt; 90 mmHg.

Exclusion criteria: subjects with nosocomial pneumonia or admitted due to non-respiratory infection (non-severe coincidental infection) and patients with pneumonia during the preceding 2 months (persistence of viral RNA in respiratory samples). Patients were recruited from the computerized records of the Microbiology department, and the medical records were revised by two clinical investigators (IT, LV). The recorded clinical variables were socio-demographic (age and sex), comorbidities, the Charlson comorbidity score and clinical symptoms at admission [
