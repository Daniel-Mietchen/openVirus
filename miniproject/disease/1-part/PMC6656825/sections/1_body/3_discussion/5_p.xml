<p id="Par34">Three different genotypes of hMPV were associated with severe CAP requiring ICU admission, which supports that all of them are able to cause severe infections in adult patients. The low number of cases of the three different hMPV lineages, the presence of coinfections and the retrospective nature of the study made impossible to analyze the clinical pattern and the evolution of the patients based on the genotype of the infecting hMPV. However, to date, there are no significant differences in the evolution or clinical manifestation between different genotypes of HMPV in adults in the outpatient setting [
