<p id="Par35">This study has some limitations and therefore, the results should be evaluated cautiously. The hMPV infection was diagnosed by oropharyngeal swab samples more than in low respiratory tract samples, mainly in non-intubated patients. The detection of a viral pathogen in respiratory samples of a patient with acute respiratory infection can be coincident and not related to ICU admission. The retrospective design of the study can underestimate the actual incidence of hMPV infection because some patients admitted because of acute respiratory infection could not be investigated for viral etiology. However, from the 2009 influenza pandemics, nasopharyngeal swab samples with respiratory viral detection are routine of care being collected in the 90% of patients with SCAP admitted to ICU. Finally, three different molecular techniques were used, with potential selection bias due to the differences in sensitivity of these techniques.</p>
