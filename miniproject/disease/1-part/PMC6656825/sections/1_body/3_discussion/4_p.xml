 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], in contrast with CRP. Some studies have recommended different cutoff points of procalcitonin to discontinue early antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired therapy, being 0.25 ng/mL and, mainly 0.1 ng/mL the most recommended [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. None of the patients with documented bacterial coinfection in this study had a procalcitonin level lower than 1 ng/mL which supports the early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in this group of patients with low plasma levels of procalcitonin. The results of this study, about procalcitonin plasma determinations, could help to develop personalized medicine in patients with CAP, helping physicians to early discrimination between viral or bacterial pneumonia and antimicrobial stewardship [
