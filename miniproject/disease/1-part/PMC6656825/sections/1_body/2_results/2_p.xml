<p id="Par25">Genotyping of hMPV was performed in 27 cases, being ten cases of hMPV group A (39.3%) and 17 of hMPV group B (60.7%). The viral strains belonged to sublineages A2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10; 39.3%), B1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11; 39.3%) and B2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6; 21.4%). Group A strains predominated until 2011 (72.7%), while later, the most frequent was genotype B (79%). After excluding seven patients with bacterial coinfection, there were not significant differences in the genotype of hMPV between six patients who developed ARDS (60% genotype B) and 15 who did not (67% genotype B).
