<p id="Par28">Seventeen (60.7%) patients had shock at admission, fourteen (50%) underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (median 5.5 days [IQR 5–14.2]) due to acute respiratory failure and four were tracheostomized due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Severe complications were frequent, highlighting acute renal failure in 12 patients (42.8%), of which two required renal replacement therapy; cardiac failure or cardiogenic shock in eight patients (28.5%); and ARDS in seven cases (25%) (two of them in patients with bacterial coinfection) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Three patients who developed ARDS were younger than 60 years (38, 47 and 54 years, respectively) without major comorbidities or bacterial coinfection. All of them underwent invasive mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure (one had coinfection with hPIV3). The main clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients are summarized in the Supplementary material (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). The majority of the patients (83.3%) had lymphocytopenia (&lt; 1000/mL) at admission (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Four patients (average age 68.5 years), three of them immunocompromised, died during the ICU stay due to complications of respiratory failure. Among survivors, ICU and hospital median stay were 6.5 [IQR 5–11.7] and 14 [IQR 10–23.3] days, respectively. Survival rate after hospital discharge at 3 and 6 months was 97.1% (
