<p>A significant result of our phylogenetic analysis of DENV-3 was that three samples were distributed into the genotype I. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time since 1988 that the presence of genotype I has been reported in Thailand [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our genotype I samples were grouped into a single clade closely related with viruses mostly circulating in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, which were either isolated from travellers returning from this region [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] or from natives during regional surveys and outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Our samples were collected from the district of HatYai in Songkhla province and the district of Takbai, in Narathiwat province, which shares a border with the Kelatan province in Malaysia. Previous studies reported a wide circulation of the genotype I in Malaysia and Indonesia [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These findings may suggest a spread of the DENV-3 genotype I from insular Southeast Asia into Southern Thailand and could lead to a replacement of the dominant genotype. However, future research is needed to determine whether genotype I is increasing in Thailand or whether our finding resulted from a time specific event in which genotype I was circulating in the region of our study.
