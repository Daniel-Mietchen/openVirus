<p>Previous studies showed that all DENVs circulated continuously in Thailand with different trends for each serotype [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This situation is not unique as DENV serotypes are endemic in many countries, resulting in so called hyperendemicity [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, even though it was proposed that the hyperendemicity could aggravate the frequency of dengue severe symptoms, the relationship between concurrent infection and disease severity remain contradictory, with variable conclusions depending on the studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In Thailand, genotype replacement for DENV-2 and DENV-3 was reported during the 1980’s and the 1990’s, respectively [
