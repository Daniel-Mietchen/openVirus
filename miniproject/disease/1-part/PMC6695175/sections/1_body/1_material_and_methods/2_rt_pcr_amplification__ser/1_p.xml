<p>Serotyping was conducted on all NS1 positive samples using a nested RT-PCR as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Viral RNA was extracted from all NS1 positive samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Bangkok, Thailand). 140μL of serum samples were used for extraction following the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified viral RNAs were stored at -80°C until the serotyping and sequencing was performed. Nested RT-PCR was performed using the SensiFast kit (Bioline, Menphis, TN, USA). The first PCR was performed using the primer pair D1F and D1R with the following cycling conditions: activation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 35 amplification cycles of 95°C for 5s, 57°C for 20s and 72°C for 1min. The nested PCR was performed on the first PCR amplicon using forward primer D1F and serotype specific reverse primer (RTS1, RTS2, RTS3 and RTS4) with the following program: activation at 95°C for 10min followed by 30 amplification cycles of 95°C for 15s, 58°C for 20min and 72°C for 1min. PCR products were visualized on a 1.8% agarose gel. Primers used to determine the serotype of the virus are provided in
