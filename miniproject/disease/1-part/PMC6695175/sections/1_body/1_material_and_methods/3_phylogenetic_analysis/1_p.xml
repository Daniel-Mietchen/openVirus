<p>To characterize the DENV isolated from clinical cases in Southern Thailand, the sequences encoding the envelope protein E were subject to robust phylogenetic analyses, along with representative DENV sequences obtained from the NCBI GenBank database (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221179.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Sequences were selected to cover a broad geographical area and includes sequences from countries where DENV circulation were reported from several decades. All sequences were referenced into the tree in a format consisting of “accession number_country_year of isolation”.
