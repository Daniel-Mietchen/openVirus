<p>These problems have been overcome, at least in part, in recent years, when methods based on nucleic acid amplification became available. Such methods exhibit enhanced sensitivity and specificity, and they can detect a broad range of pathogens within an acceptable turnaround time. Single polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) for all the known respiratory viruses and several multiplex platforms using PCR and methods for nucleic acid amplification for the simultaneous detection of two or more viruses have been developed (Hanson and Couturier, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). High-complexity multiplex panel assays that can simultaneously detect up to 20 viruses (Mahony et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), 18 viruses and two or three atypical bacteria (Gonsalves et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), 18 viruses and four bacteria (Beckmann and Hirsch, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and a total of 33 pathogens including 12 bacteria (Fast Track Diagnostic, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) within a few hours have been developed. However, not all the bacteria that play a relevant role in the determination of respiratory infections are systematically included. Some of these multiplex platforms have been marketed and largely evaluated in clinical practice in patients admitted to the emergency departments, hospital wards and intensive care units. Despite these evaluations, the actual role of these diagnostic measures is not precisely defined. In particular, it has not yet been established whether the availability of a laboratory measure able to identify several potential etiologic agents of a respiratory infection offers real advantages in term of diagnostic accuracy, choice of appropriate therapy and reduction of the social and economic problems strictly associated with pediatric respiratory diseases. Moreover, in the majority of the cases they don't allow the identification of antimicrobial resistance to commonly used drugs. In this paper, what can be derived from the presently available studies in this regard is discussed.
