<p>Carriage is common also for BV (Chow and Esper, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), which can be detected in the respiratory secretions of healthy children with the same frequency as that observed in patients with RTI (von Linstow et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Similar findings have been reported for ADV, which has been detected in the nasopharynx of healthy children in up to 11% of cases (Colvin et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Rhedin et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Pathogens that are asymptomatically carried are also the pathogens that can be most commonly detected with the most recent multiplex platforms. The carriage of 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> (
 <italic>Mp</italic>) has been identified in many asymptomatic children, although the prevalence varied according to the site of the study [21% in Denmark (Spuesens et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and 56% in the USA (Wood et al., 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>)] and the period of respiratory sample collection [3% in the spring, and 58% in the summer (Colvin et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>)]. Similarly, a certain percentage of healthy children (4â€“6%) has been shown to test positive for 
 <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> (
 <italic>Cp</italic>) (Emre et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Block et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Falck et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).
