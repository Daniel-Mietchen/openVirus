<p>When multiplex assays are used, the benefits of determining which infectious agent(s) is (are) potentially responsible for an RTI are strongly limited by the low number of drugs that are active against the respiratory targets that are currently available on these diagnostic platforms. Presently, only drugs against influenza virus, RSV and atypical bacteria are licensed. Furthermore, it is debated that these drugs should be used in all the subjects suffering from infections due to sensitive agents. The systematic use of neuraminidase inhibitors (European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and baloxavir marboxil (Hayden et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) is not recommended for all the cases of influenza because influenza is frequently a mild disease, and the advantage of drug administration is limited to a marginal reduction in the disease duration. Consequently, the use of these drugs is reserved only for extremely severe cases, although their true efficacy in these cases has not been definitively demonstrated (Lessler et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
