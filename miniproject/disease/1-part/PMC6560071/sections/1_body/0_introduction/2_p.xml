<p>WNV is a highly neurovirulent pathogen naturally maintained in an enzootic cycle between ornithophilic mosquitoes and certain birds. It is responsible for sporadic outbreaks in humans and horses, in which the infection is mainly asymptomatic even though it can also have a fatal outcome and result in epidemics and epizootics (
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Acebes and Saiz, 2012</xref>). Hundreds of bird species are susceptible to the infection, and several develop competent viremia to efficiently transmit the virus to vectors, thus playing an essential role in virus maintenance (

Therefore, assessment of the protective capability of vaccine candidates in birds that are natural hosts and virus amplifiers can be very useful to control WNV outbreaks.
