<p>Herein, we have assayed the effectiveness of a WNV-recombinant subviral particle (RSP)-based vaccine in the magpie (
 <italic>Pica pica</italic>), a member of the family Corvidae, whose habitats include cultivated land and suburban areas, and that is highly susceptible to WNV and possibly a transmission competent species (

The RSPs, also referred to as virus-like particles (VLPs), result from the co-expression of the prM and E glycoproteins of WNV and mimics immunogenic properties of the whole virion. RSPs have already shown their potential as vaccine candidates for WNV (

 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Kroeger and McMinn, 2002</xref>) in the mouse model. Here, we show that immunization with a single dose of the WNV-RSP-based vaccine protects magpies upon challenge with a neurovirulent strain of WNV. Moreover, the vaccine significantly reduced viremic titres below the threshold to consider a host as a competent amplifier and significantly reduced viral burden in feathers, remarking its value as a useful tool to control WNV.
