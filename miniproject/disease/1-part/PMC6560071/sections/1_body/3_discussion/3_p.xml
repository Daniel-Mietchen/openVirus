<p>Nowadays, the only approved vaccines are for use in equids. These vaccines have demonstrated to be highly efficient in drastically reducing infectious rates among horses in the US (

The availability of vaccines for use in birds, the natural hosts of the virus, which can break the viral cycle by helping to control it, will be highly useful, mainly during outbreaks. Such vaccines could be used in birds held in captivity in zoos, recreational installations, wildlife rehabilitation, and endangered species breeding centers, in surveillance programs, and even in birds grown for restocking or hunting activities that are yearly released by the thousands into the environment in many countries. In fact, DNA vaccines, either experimental or commercially available for equine use, have been previously tested in fish crows (

 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Malkinson et al., 2001</xref>). This latter one was even administered to 1,800 geese in a follow-up study with a survival rate over 96% (
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Samina et al., 2005</xref>). Even more, a prospective vaccination of condors in California before the virus was introduced there was claimed to act as a potential barrier from subsequent WNV infections (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2007</xref>). In most of these studies, birds were challenged 6–10 weeks after immunization, and two or three doses were necessary to observe significant antibodies titres, reduction of viremia levels and, when analyzed, of viral shedding. However, in none of these reports, the induction of herd immunity was evaluated.
