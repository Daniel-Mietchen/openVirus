<p>RSPs are potent inducers of both B cell responses (

 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Pitoiset et al., 2015</xref>), important in viral clearance (
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">McMurtrey et al., 2008</xref>), being consequently an excellent choice for vaccine development. In this sense, we have previously reported that the RSP vaccine candidate used here protects mice experimentally infected with WNV strains of different lineages (
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Merino-Ramos et al., 2014</xref>). Now we have confirmed the protective capability of the vaccine candidate in a virus natural host, as the survival rate (71.4%) of the vaccinated magpies was significantly higher than that of non-vaccinated birds (22.2%), in which the percentage of survival was similar (30%) to that previously reported in experimentally infected naïve magpies (
