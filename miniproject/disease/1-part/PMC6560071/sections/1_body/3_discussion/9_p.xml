<p>In brief, we herein report the efficacy of a single dose of an anti-WNV RSP-based candidate vaccine in conferring protection to the magpie, a natural virus amplifier host with a key role in WNV ecology. The vaccine has demonstrated to be safe for birds and its production does not require BSL-3 facilities, as RSPs are not infectious, which reduces the cost of production and facilitates its manipulation. It is also worth noting that this type of vaccine could be used without interfering with ongoing WNV surveillance programs since it could enable the differentiation between naturally infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA vaccine). In conclusion, a single dose of the RSPs vaccine protects magpies from WNV, eliciting a neutralizing immune response and interfering with the virus cycle by reducing viremia levels and the risk of horizontal contact.</p>
