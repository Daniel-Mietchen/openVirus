<p>Data analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 6 (Graph Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, 2005). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed by a log-rank (Mantel Cox) test. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s correction was applied for multiple comparisons. For single comparison and non-parametric data, U Mann-Whitney tests were performed. Significant differences are shown in the figures represented by asterisks *
