<p>Birds were aged based on plumage and molt patterns, sampled, and tested for the presence of WNV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in their sera by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) as described (
 <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2017</xref>). Real time RT-PCR was used to test the presence of WNV genome in serum and feather follicles, as described previously (
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez de Oya et al., 2018</xref>). A final group of 27 juvenile (less than 1 year old) magpies negative for WNV NAbs and WNV genome was transported to our biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities where they were housed in 2 appropriately equipped separate cages, 12 in the RSP-box, and 15 in the vehicle-box, as described (
