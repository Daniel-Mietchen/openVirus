<p>Birds were bled from the jugular vein before vaccination, at days 14 and 28 post-vaccination, and at 4, 7, 10, 14, and 19Â days post-infection (d.p.i.), corresponding to days 33, 36, 39, 43, and 48 post-vaccination. At the indicated times post-infection, birds were weighed and at least two of any growing feathers containing pulp were collected (contour feathers of the body or head, or tail or wing coverts, depending on the individual). The number of feathers employed for pulp extraction was adapted according to their size to work with approximately equal amounts of pulp (
