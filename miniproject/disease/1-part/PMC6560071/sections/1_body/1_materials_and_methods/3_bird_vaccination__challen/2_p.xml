<p>A group of 10 magpies was immunized once subcutaneously in the thigh with 50 μg/magpie of purified RSPs administered (1:1) with aluminum hydroxide gel adjuvant (Alhydrogel®, InvivoGen, San Diego, USA), while another group (vehicle) of 9 were inoculated with adjuvant alone by the same route. Twenty-nine days later, magpies (eight RSPs-immunized and nine vehicle-inoculated) were subcutaneously challenged in the inguinal space (

The inoculum was back-titrated to confirm the inoculated dose. Ten uninfected birds (six in the vehicle-inoculated group and four in the RSPs-vaccinated group, two immunized, and two not) were housed with the infected magpies, as control for bird-to-bird virus transmission (
