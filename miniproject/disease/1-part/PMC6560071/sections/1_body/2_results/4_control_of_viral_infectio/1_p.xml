<p>Viremia found in vaccinated magpies was significantly lower at 4 d.p.i. when compared with non-primed birds, and at day 7 p.i., only one vehicle-inoculated bird presented measurable viremia (

 <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml has been established to consider a viremic bird as a competent host to transmit the virus to most WNV competent mosquito vectors (
