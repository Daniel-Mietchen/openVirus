<p>Vaccinia has also proved to be a powerful tool to enhance the accuracy of super-resolution microscopes. In her paper last year, Siân Culley developed software to automatically detect artifacts sometimes generated during the post-acquisition processing of super-resolution microscopy images. Siân used vaccinia images as test data sets during the development of the software [
