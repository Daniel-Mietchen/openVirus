<p>Firstly, vaccinia encodes almost all of its own replication machinery despite being an obligate intracellular parasite. Many of these viral proteins are homologues of cellular proteins, giving scientists like me a simpler system in which to begin to understand the function of the closely related cellular proteins. For example, human cells encode over 600 kinase enzymes. As a result, it is sometimes hard to define the role of an individual human kinase within the cell. Vaccinia virus by contrast encodes just two kinases. One of these kinases, called B1, was first identified in the 1980s. The kinase activity of B1 was extensively studied and shown to be essential for viral DNA replication. A decade later, a screen for novel human proteins identified two proteins whose sequences were more than 40% identical to vaccinia B1, suggesting that these proteins would also be active kinases [

Today, we know that there is a whole family of human vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs) playing key roles in regulating cellular DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. Given that cancers can establish themselves when these processes go wrong, VRKs are implicated in several cancers including liver, lung, and breast cancer [
