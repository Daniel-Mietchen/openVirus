<p>The second key vaccinia feature is its size. Boasting dimensions of 350 nm × 250 nm × 250 nm, vaccinia virus is large (for a virus!) and can be easily tracked by live cell microscopy. In 2008, the power of this feature was exemplified when a novel virus entry pathway into cells was discovered using vaccinia [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Jason Mercer, a scientist in Zürich, imaged vaccinia virions as they interacted with the surface of human cells. Upon contact with the plasma membrane, the virus caused the whole cell to produce blebs followed by the internalisation of the virion into a large cellular intrusion. This process was highly reminiscent of the uptake of debris released from dying cells, during a process called ‘apoptotic clearance’. Jason’s further experiments showed that vaccinia displays lipids on its surface, making it look just like a piece of debris shed from a dying cell, and thus vaccinia tricks cells into actively taking it up.
