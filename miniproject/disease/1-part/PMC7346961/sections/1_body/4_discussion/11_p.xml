<p>The tested water samples were satisfactory for chlorination. However, in Burail, the drinking water pipeline and sewerage line were closely laid over and there is a possibility that due to leakage in the sewerage line, the wastewater contaminated with fecal matter was sucked into intermittently supplied drinking water system. However, we hypothesized that contamination of water in the old and corroded water pipes, after release from the tube wells, with the sewage due to negative pressure generated in the water pipes because of intermittent water supply, might be responsible for contamination and causation of this outbreak. Similarly studies done in Gujarat[

 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have reported contaminated water as the primary reason for these outbreaks. However, all the water samples were tested negative for probable fecal contamination. The results of the case control study hinted at the possible contamination of outside food as source of infection.
