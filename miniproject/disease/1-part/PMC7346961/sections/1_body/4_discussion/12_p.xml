<p>The study findings confirm dual infection with HAV and HEV. HEV was the prime etiological agent of this outbreak. However, HAV was identified at a later age (&gt;14 years) as both mono and dual infection which supports the gradual transition in age of acquiring HAV. The attack rate was 27.1 per 10,000. The shape of the epidemic curve suggested a persisting continuous transmission pattern. The gender specific attack rate was higher among males (32.8/10,000 male) as compared to females (20.8/10,000). The age-specific attack rates were higher between 10 and 29 years age group across both males and females. Pregnant women were infected with HEV and one of them had adverse outcome. The present outbreak was probably due to contamination of drinking water supplied to the affected areas with sewage water, which occurred due to old and corroded leaking pipelines of drinking water passing close to old leaking sewage lines.</p>
