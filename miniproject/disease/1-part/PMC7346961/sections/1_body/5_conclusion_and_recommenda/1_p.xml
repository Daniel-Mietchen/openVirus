<p>This study described the detailed methodology for epidemiological investigation of an outbreak and described the epidemiological features of dual hepatitis outbreak from northern India. The quality of the water both at the source of distribution and consumer end should be periodically checked for sewage contamination. There is a need of better engineering of sewage pipelines and drinking water distribution system with proper disposal systems for human feces and surveillance of status of water pipelines for any leakages especially in the old and closed communities. Authorities may consider vaccinating the susceptible population, local food vendors with licensed hepatitis A vaccine. The residents have to be informed about the possible contamination of outside food with hepatitis virus so that they avoid eating out especially in these settings, which are quite prevalent in low- and middle-income group countries.</p>
