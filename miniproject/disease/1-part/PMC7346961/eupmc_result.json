    "Context:During ongoing passive surveillance in Burail, Chandigarh an unexpected rise in number of acute viral hepatitis (AVH) was reported during December 2016. Aims:An outbreak of AVH was investigated in an urbanized village, Burail, in Chandigarh, India with an objective of describing its epidemiological features. Settings and Design:A house-to-house survey was conducted in Burail (population 51,958). Subjects and Methods:WHO's standard case definition for AVH was used to identify cases. Suspected cases were tested for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and E virus (HEV) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Drinking water samples were tested for fecal contamination. Control measures were implemented to contain the outbreak. Statistical Analysis Used:Descriptive analysis was done as per time, person, and place. Results:Out of 141 confirmed cases of AVH, 85.1% were positive for HEV, 12.8% for HAV, and 2.1% for both HAV and HEV. The attack rate was 27.1 per 10,000 in a population. Males were affected more than females (P < 0.05). One of the areas reported a leakage in drinking water pipeline and had highest attack rate (36.8/10000 population). Drinking water samples were found negative for contamination. Around 27% of confirmed cases reported history of taking food from local vendors in Burail 2-6 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. Conclusion:This study described the epidemiological features of dual hepatitis outbreak due to HAV and HEV from Chandigarh, Union Territory, north India."
