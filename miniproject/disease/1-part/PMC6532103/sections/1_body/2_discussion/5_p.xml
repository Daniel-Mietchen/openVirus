<p>Pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 viruses are occasionally detected in the CNS or CSF in humans and from experimentally inoculated ferrets and mice, even though pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses only replicated in SK-N-SH cells in the presence of trypsin (

However, these viruses are rarely isolated in high titers or detected by immunohistochemistry in the CNS of humans or experimentally inoculated ferrets and mice, indicating that these viruses might be able to enter the CNS but that replication is inefficient. This could be attributed to the limited attachment and infection and lack of an alternative HA cleavage mechanism allowing efficient replication. Previously, we showed that even in the absence of active virus replication, proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), are induced in the CNS of pH1N1 experimentally inoculated ferrets (
