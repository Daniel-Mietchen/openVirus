<p>Taken together, results of our study have shown that the presence of an MBCS and, to a lesser extent, the ability to attach are important determinants for replication of HPAI H5N1 virus in cells of the CNS. This suggests that, at least for replication within the CNS, neurotropic influenza viruses contain an alternative HA cleavage mechanism and prefer Î±-2,3-linked sialic acids.</p>
