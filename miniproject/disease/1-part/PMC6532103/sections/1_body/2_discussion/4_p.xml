<p>Previous studies on the replication kinetics of influenza viruses in cells of the CNS revealed some differences, which can in part be explained by the use of different cells, virus isolates, and experimental approaches (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Replication of HPAI H5N1 viruses in differentiated astrocytic cell lines resulted in efficient replication, similar to our observations. However, in SH-SY5Y cells, a subclone cell line derived from SK-N-SH cells, two HPAI H5N1 viruses did not replicate efficiently. This discrepancy could be due to the relatively high MOI used in this study compared to the low MOI we used and which resulted in efficient replication (
