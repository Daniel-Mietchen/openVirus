<p>One of the most common extrarespiratory complications of influenza virus infection is central nervous system (CNS) disease (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Clinically, CNS disease can range from mild febrile seizures to severe or even fatal meningoencephalitis (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although most studies on influenza virus-associated CNS disease have focused on influenza A viruses, viruses of type B are also able to cause CNS disease. This is, however, less frequently observed (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Influenza A viruses, hereinafter referred to as influenza virus, have been linked to CNS disease since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and CNS disease has been observed during all subsequent pandemics (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) as well as during seasonal epidemics, with sporadic detection of influenza virus in the CNS or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of humans (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, two recent zoonotic influenza viruses, are both associated with CNS disease (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The HPAI H5N1 virus is possibly the most neurotropic influenza virus known and has frequently been associated with CNS disease in humans and in other naturally (
