<p>To date, not much is known about the replication efficiency of different influenza viruses, especially seasonal viruses, in cells of the CNS. Thus far, evidence from both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggests that HPAI H5N1 viruses are able to infect and replicate in neurons and astrocytes (

Similarly, insights into the roles of attachment, protease availability, and presence of an MBCS on replication efficiency in cells of the CNS for these viruses are lacking. Therefore, we here determined the virus attachment, infectivity, and replication kinetics of a seasonal H3N2, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), HPAI H5N1, and WSN viruses in human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH), human astrocytoma (U87-MG), primary mouse cortex neurons (pmCortex), and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Subsequently, we established the importance of the MBCS for the replication efficiency of HPAI H5N1 virus in cells of the CNS.
