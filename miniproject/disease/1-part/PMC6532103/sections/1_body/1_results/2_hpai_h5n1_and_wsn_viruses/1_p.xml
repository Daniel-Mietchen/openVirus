<p>To determine whether efficient replication was associated with the ability of the virus to enter and infect host cells, we determined the percentage of infection 8 h postinfection (hpi) (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 3) in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, and MDCK cells, measured by flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In MDCK cells, pH1N1, HPAI H5N1, and WSN viruses infected significantly more cells than H3N2 virus. In SK-N-SH and U87-MG cells, HPAI H5N1 and WSN viruses infected significantly more cells than H3N2 or pH1N1 viruses.
