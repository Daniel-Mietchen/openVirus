  <p>HPAI H5N1 and WSN viruses attach more efficiently to SK-N-SH and U87-MG cells than pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Virus attachment of pH1N1, H3N2, HPAI H5N1, and WSN viruses (using 100 hemagglutination units [HAU] units) to SK-N-SH, U87-MG, and MDCK cells. (A) Percentages of cells to which viruses attached. (B to D) Representative histograms of SK-N-SH, U87-MG, and MDCK cells. Dotted lines indicate cell control. Data in panel A are presented as means ± SDs from at least three independent experiments. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. ***,
