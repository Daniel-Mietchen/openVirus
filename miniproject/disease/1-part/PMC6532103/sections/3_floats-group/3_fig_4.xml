  <p>In the absence of trypsin, HPAI H5N1 virus grows most efficiently in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, MDCK, and pmCortex cells. (A to D) Growth kinetics of pH1N1, H3N2, HPAI H5N1, and WSN viruses in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, MDCK, and pmCortex cells (MOI of 0.1) in the absence of trypsin. Data are presented as means ± SDs from at least three independent experiments. Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test against H5N1 virus. **,
