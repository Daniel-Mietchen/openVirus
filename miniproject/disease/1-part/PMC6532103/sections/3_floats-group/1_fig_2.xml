  <p>HPAI H5N1 and WSN viruses infect cells more efficiently than pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Percentages of infection in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, and MDCK cells were determined by FACS 8 hpi with either pH1N1, H3N2, WSN, or HPAI H5N1 virus (MOI of 3). Data are presented as means ± SDs from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. *,
