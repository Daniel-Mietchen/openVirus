    "Triggered in response to external and internal ligands in cells and animals, redox homeostasis is transmitted via signal molecules involved in defense redox mechanisms through networks of cell proliferation, differentiation, intracellular detoxification, bacterial infection, and immune reactions. Cellular oxidation is not necessarily harmful per se, but its effects depend on the balance between the peroxidationÂ and antioxidation cascades, which can vary according to the stimulus and serve to maintain oxygen homeostasis. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated during influenza virus (IV) infection have critical effects on both the virus and host cells. In this review, we outline the link between viral infection and redox control using IV infection as an example. We discuss the current state of knowledge on the molecular relationship between cellular oxidation mediated by ROS accumulation and the diversity of IV infection. We also summarize the potential anti-IV agents available currently that act by targeting redox biology/pathophysiology."
