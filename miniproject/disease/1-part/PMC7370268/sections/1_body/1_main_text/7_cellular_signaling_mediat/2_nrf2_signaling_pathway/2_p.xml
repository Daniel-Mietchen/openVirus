<p id="Par126">The highly pathogenic avian H5N1 IV reduces the levels of phosphorylated Nrf2 in the nucleus and downregulates the expression of fibronectin to a greater extent than does the human H1N1 IV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. Several studies found no changes in the levels of SOD in IV-infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]; however, other studies found a contradictory lower level of SOD1 caused by protease degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. Increased expression of SOD1 was reported in patients with asymptomatic IV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>]. Decreased levels of SOD1 have been found in children infected with H1N1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. Therefore, whether SOD1 is a marker of IV infection remains uncertain.
