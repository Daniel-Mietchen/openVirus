<p id="Par125">Redox homeostasis is maintained by cellular enzymes such as SODs, CAT, and GPx, which participate in antioxidant defense systems. IV infection can decrease the production of antioxidation targets, such as HO-1 and NQO1, SOD1 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>], GR, CAT, and GPx1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>] are downstream molecules of the Nrf2 pathway after IV infection. Thus, Nrf2 plays an important role in redox regulation upon IV infection [
