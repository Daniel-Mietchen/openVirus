<p id="Par127">Similar controversial findings have been reported for other antioxidant enzymes, such as CAT and indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO scavenges superoxide anion for oxidation or for converting tryptophan into kynurenine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. The IDO level is unaltered and the CAT levels are reduced in IV-infected cells in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. In contrast, in infected mice, both IDO and HO-1 are induced, and CAT is unchanged [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>]. Cat- peroxiredoxin-6 (Prdx6-)-deficient mice infected with H1N1 exhibit depletion of IV-permissive bronchial Clara cells and/or alveolar type 2 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>]. Similar reports showed the induction of other enzymes, such as GPX3 and HO-1. Other Nrf family members, such as Nrf1, bind to the ARE in the promoter regions of redox-related genes, although to a lesser extent than that observed for Nrf2. In contrast, Nrf3 does not behave similarly [
