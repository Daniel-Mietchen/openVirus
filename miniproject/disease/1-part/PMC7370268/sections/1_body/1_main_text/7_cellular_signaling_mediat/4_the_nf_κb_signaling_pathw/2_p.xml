<p id="Par130">Cells treated with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor Y15 or expressing dominant-negative FAK kinase show a reduction in the H1N1-induced NF-kB promoter activity. The nuclear localization of NF-kB is reduced in cells expressing dominant-negative FAK kinase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. The human parainfluenza virus type 2 phosphoprotein (P) is a key component of viral polymerase. The P gene encodes both P and accessory V proteins via specific gene editing. Moreover, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the P protein appears to be important for efficient viral polymerase activity [
