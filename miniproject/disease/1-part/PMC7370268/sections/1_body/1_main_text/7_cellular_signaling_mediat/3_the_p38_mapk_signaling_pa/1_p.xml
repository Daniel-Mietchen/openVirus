<p id="Par128">p38 MAPK plays a vital role in cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and death. For example, phosphorylated p38 is translocated into the cell nucleus and upregulates cytokines/chemokines under oxidative stress. In Bcl-2+ cells (MDCK introduced by Bcl-2), p38MAPK interacts with Bcl-2 and colocalizes in the cytoplasm, and both Bcl-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis are decreased by specific p38MAPK activity. In contrast, in Bcl-2-negative (

 </sup>) MDCK cells, which are fully permissive to viral infection, p38MAPK activity is present in nucleus predominantly, and its inhibition reduces the traffic of vRNP and the phosphorylation of viral nucleoproteins, suggesting that p38MAPK contributes to the regulation of vRNP export and viral replication [

Curcumin inactivates IAV directly, and inhibits IAV adsorption and replication; moreover, its inhibition of IAV replication may occur through the Nrf2 signal, to inhibit the IAV-induced activation of the TLR2/4, p38/JNK MAPK, and NF-κB pathways. Thus, inactivation of p38/JNK MAPK, NF-kB and TLR2/4 exerted anti-influenza virus effects. p38/ JNK MAPK is a critical mediator of oxidation-induced apoptosis, to increase ROS and COX-2 production [
