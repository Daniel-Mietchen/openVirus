<p id="Par132">IVs can modulate several oxidative-stress- and redox-activated signaling pathways, such as those involving NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>–

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. Therefore, the modulation of these signaling pathways may attenuate IV-induced pulmonary damage.
