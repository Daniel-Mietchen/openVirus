<p id="Par100">PB1-F2 in influenza type A interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocator and the voltage-dependent anion channel 1, and inactivates matrix metalloproteinases, releases proapoptotic proteins, and induces cell death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. PB1-F2 is involved in the generation of mitochondrial ROS in alveolar epithelial cells by downregulating SOD1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In addition, H7N9 PB1-F2-induced ROS trigger inflammasome activation and IL-1Î² secretion, which is inhibited by Mitotempo, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ROS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. After viral infections, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes are activated to induce pyroptosis, a cell death pathway that is inherently associated with inflammation via the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of cytokines from infected cells [
