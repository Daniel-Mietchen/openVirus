 </sup> KO mice was inhibited at day 7 after infection, although it did not differ from that observed in wild-type littermates at day 3 after infection (in the early stages of infection) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Mice expressing an inactive Nox1 (Nox1*/γ) exhibited a higher survival rate after an influenza type A virus challenge than did control mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The adaptive immune response was altered after the IV challenge in these mice, as shown by a decrease in the number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung, an increase in the number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells expressing CD127 (IL-7 receptor) in the lung, and draining of lymph nodes. These findings suggest that Nox1 negatively affects the early adaptive immune response to IV infection.
