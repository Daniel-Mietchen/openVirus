<p id="Par104">NOX4 plays a role in ROS production in lung cancer and in IV-infected primary epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. NOX4 induces both death and survival in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-challenged cerebral microvascular endothelial cells derived from newborn piglets. TNF-α-induced NOX4 activation causes oxidation-related cell death. Concomitantly, NOX4-derived ROS initiate the carbon monoxide (CO)-mediated survival of cells through the activation of heme oxygenase-2. CO prevents NOX4 activation, decreases oxidation, and ultimately promotes the survival of brain endothelial cells through the AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, CO inhibits TNF-α -induced ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in an AKT-dependent manner. These findings suggest that NOX4 is a key element in the ROS-controlled survival of endothelial cells during TNF-α-mediated brain inflammation [
