<p id="Par101">IV infection can induce cell death through viral PB1-F2, which targets mitochondria. Moreover, this cell death is conserved in IV type A, but not in IV type B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In addition to the mitochondrial respiratory complex, ROS generated from NOX are involved in the pathogenesis of IV infection. The NOX family is found in cell and phagosome membranes, and comprises several members: NOX1 to NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The NOX family is expressed in cell-type-specific manner and is critical for the infection permissiveness of IV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. NOX1 is expressed in epithelial cells in the colon, placenta, prostate, and uterus, as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells, astrocytes, microglia, neural cells, and retinal pericytes. NOX2 is detected in cardiomyocytes, the endothelium and coronary microvascular endothelial cells, phagocytes, granulocytes in the umbilical vein, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, neuronal cells, and vascular cells in skeletal muscles. NOX3 is expressed in the fetal kidney, liver, lung, and spleen and, at lower levels, in the adult colon and kidney. NOX4 is expressed in the eye, kidney, liver, lung, and ovary, as well as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, mesangial cells, neurons, osteoclasts, and smooth muscle cells. NOX5 is expressed in mammary glands and the cerebrum, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymphoid tissue, prostate, skeletal muscle, spleen, testis, and thymus, as well as vascular smooth muscle cells. Both DUOX1 and DUOX2 are detected in the colon, cecum, duodenum, floating colon, ileum, jejunum, pancreas, pancreatic islets, prostate, rectum, stomach, thyroid, sigmoidal colon, and the tracheal and bronchi epithelium [
