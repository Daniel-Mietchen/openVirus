<p id="Par106">DUOX2 is another source of ROS production during IV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. IV infection stimulates the induction of DUPX2/DUOXA2 and a moderate reduction of DUOX1 expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This DUOX2/DUOXA2 induction occurred after H1N1, but not after H3N2, infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In the human nasal epithelium and mouse nasal mucosa, DUOX2-induced ROS formation was triggered in airway cells via the type 1 and type 3 interferon (IFN) pathways, which induced the RIG-1-like receptor double-stranded RNA helicase enzyme (RIG-1) and the melanoma-associated differentiation gene 5 (MDA5) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The increase in ROS production in mitochondria mediated by DUPOX2 or NOX2 is indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>].
