<p id="Par111">IVs damage the central nervous system (CNS), leading to IV-associated encephalitis and encephalopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that IVs can infect astrocytes, which are the most abundant cells in the CNS and an integral part of the blood–brain barrier and induce a proinflammatory cytokine response and apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Lin et al. reported that human astrocytes induced the expression of CXCL9-11, NF-κB, and p38MAPK phosphorylation, as well as receptors of neurotransmitters, such as the melanocortin 2 receptor, cholinergic receptor nicotinic gamma subunit, purinergic receptor, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor α1, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2, which are involved in synaptic transmission and CNS disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. More recently, it was reported that H5N1 bound and cleaved HA with a specificity for alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids, allowing the efficient binding of IVs and their efficient replication in CNS cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Most of these reports are restricted to H5N1, except for one human H1N1 study [
