 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Moreover, in some cases, infection with H5N1 induced a high viral load and a strong proinflammatory reaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This action of H5N1 increases mortality and generates a more pronounced oxidative stress compared with other IVs, such as the human influenza A virus (H1N1).
