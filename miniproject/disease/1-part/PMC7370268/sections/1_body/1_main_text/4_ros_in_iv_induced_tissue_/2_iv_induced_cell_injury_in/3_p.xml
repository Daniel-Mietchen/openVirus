<p id="Par110">Recent studies have reported that ROS production exerts a positive or negative effect during IV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. In the former case, viral infection can generate moderate ROS levels, which play a critical role in biological reactions with few cellular damage events. In contrast, excessive ROS are the major cause of LI. Downstream ROS targets, such as NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, and DUOX2, are involved in apoptotic cell death in the epithelium and ALI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. After infection, IVs hijack the biological functions of host cells to enhance viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Accordingly, the imbalance between the redox control against IV and the production of excess ROS results in tissue damage [
