<p id="Par95">The activation of the Nrf2/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and Toll-like receptor (TLR)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways is involved in IV replication and IV-related pneumonia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In some cases, the AhR also regulates redox genes, such as the 
 <italic>NQO1</italic> gene, to maintain the ROS balance in host cells [

 <italic>NQO1</italic> gene is regulated by the ARE, which is mediated by Nrf2 and the small Maf family of proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In addition, the 
 <italic>NQO1</italic> gene is also regulated by the AhR/Arnt complex, which binds to the Dioxin- responsive element in the 
 <italic>NQO1</italic> promoter, in addition to the cytochrome p450 promoters, followed by the detoxification and blockage of the ROS production. Thus, we speculate that the binding of the AhR to the ligand after IV infection induces the oxidation of DNA, protein, and lipid components within cells to produce ROS at a higher level, thus leading to apoptosis and autophagy (
