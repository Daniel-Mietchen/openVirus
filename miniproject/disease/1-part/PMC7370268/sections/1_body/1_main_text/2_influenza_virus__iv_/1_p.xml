<p id="Par88">The genomes of IVs consist of negative single-stranded RNAs that are associated with the viral nucleoprotein (NP). They interact with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases heterotrimer, i.e., the polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) and 2 (PB2) and polymerase acidic protein, to build the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes.</p>
