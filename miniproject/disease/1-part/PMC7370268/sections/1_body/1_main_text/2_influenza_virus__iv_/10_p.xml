<p id="Par97">At the molecular level, IVs induce oxidative stress via AhR pathway in the cytoplasm, especially stresses in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which are followed by the production of ROS. Simultaneously, the AhR transcription factor is translocated into the nucleus to activate the phase I target genes, which encode detoxification enzymes, several antioxidation enzymes, and immunoregulatory and allergy-related genes of antiviral immunity [

If the extent of ROS production surpasses the level of antioxidation, the ROS balance was abrogated, and the IV-infected cells commit to apoptosis and necrosis for cell death. If the ROS generation is cancelled by the antioxidation, the redox balance is remained to commit the resistance of host cells to the IV infection and the anti-viral immunity.
