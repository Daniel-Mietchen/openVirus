<p id="Par92">It has been reported that IV infection leads to the induction of oxidative stress or ROS damage and the development of clinical output. The direct clinical use of antioxidation drugs in IV-infected patients has not been reported. In humans, IAV infection increases the levels of metabolites such as 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde, 2-isoprostane, 7-ketocholesterol, 7-beta-hydroxycholesterol, and carbonyl compounds in the plasma and urine. The levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and catalase; cytokines, such as IL-6, 1L-10, and TNF-α; and HSPs, such as HSP90 and HSP27 were also increased in H1N1-infected patients [
