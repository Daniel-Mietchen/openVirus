<p id="Par96">In general, AhR induces the detoxifying enzyme cytochrome p450 and the phase II enzyme NQO1 or HO-1, to achieve redox regulation and maintain ROS balance; these molecules contain ARE 
 <italic>cis</italic>-elements, which are controlled by Nrf2. Thus, the AhRâ€“Nrf2 transcription factor battery plays a key role in the maintenance of ROS balance. In the case of IV infection, this theory might be adopted, as like the case of phase I ligand exposure [
