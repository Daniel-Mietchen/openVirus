<p id="Par142">The effects of the dietary flavonoid kaempferol on H9N2-mediated acute LI included the repression of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses via the downregulation of NF-κB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Kaempferol inhibits the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, leading to an increase in SOD activity, the attenuation of ROS levels, and H9N2-induced acute LI [
