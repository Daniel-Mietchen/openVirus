 </sup> KO mice exhibit higher survival rates with lower viral titers, lower production of mediators of inflammation, and fewer pathological alterations in their lungs after IV infection than their wild-type counterparts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. TLR7 is also required for the efficient replication of IVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. The inhibitors of the TLR7/8–MyD88 axis possibly also inhibit IV replication and control proinflammatory cytokines and MMPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. In contrast, the expression levels of TLR4 determine H1N1 entry and infection tropism via MyD88–p38 MAPK signaling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Inactivated avian H5N1 can rapidly lead to the activation of the TLR4/TRIF/TRAF6/NF-κB axis [

 </sup> KO mice are refractory to H1N1-induced ALI, and a TLR4 antagonist decreases H1N1 viral titer and its lethality [
