<p id="Par138">NAC is a precursor of intracellular cysteine and GSH in mammals. NAC contributes to the resistance against IV infection through mechanisms that include the inhibition of IV replication, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and the prevention of IV-induced apoptosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>]. NAC suppresses viral replication and the expression of IV-mediated inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and then suppresses the inflammation induced by the highly pathogenic avian H5V1 virus [
