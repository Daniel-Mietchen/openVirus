<p id="Par139">The antiviral activity of GSH may be involved in inhibiting the synthesis of viral proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>]. A higher level of GSH might interfere with the formation of disulfide bonds, thus preventing the correct folding of viral hemagglutinin (HA), followed by the alteration of its transport and its insertion into host cell membranes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>]. Furthermore, a derivative of GSH, 
 <italic>N</italic>-butanoyl glutathione (GSH-C4), which is a cell-permeable chemical compound [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>], diminishes IV replication by maintaining the immature monomeric HA in the ER and inhibiting the targeting of mature membrane glycoproteins, which is achieved via an increase in GSH levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>]. GSH-C4 affects the inflammatory response via NF-kB signaling and improves the Th1 response against IV in old mice [
