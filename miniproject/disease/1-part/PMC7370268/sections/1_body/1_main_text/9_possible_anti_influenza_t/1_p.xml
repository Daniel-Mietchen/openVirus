<p id="Par136">During the IV infection, the cellular metabolism of host cells could be affected, leading to a dysregulation of redox homeostasis. IV viruses induce oxidative stresses via the increase in ROS generation and the alteration of ROS scavenging systems. As part of the antioxidation defense, selenoproteins, such as GPXs and thioredoxin reductases (TXNRDs), which are present in the ER, play a critical role in controlling oxidative stress [

Antioxidant genes, which can be upregulated by Nrf2, play a critical role in the elimination of ROS/RNS; therefore, enhancement of Nrf2 activity and inhibition of AhR activity have been proposed as approaches to ameliorate the IV-associated pathology. For example, the downstream target of Nrf2, SOD conjugated with a copolymer of pyran, was administered in an attempt to decay free radicals; this approach prevented infection with IV in mice [
