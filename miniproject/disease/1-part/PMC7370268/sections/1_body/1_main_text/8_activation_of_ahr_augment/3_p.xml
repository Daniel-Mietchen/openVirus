<p id="Par135">Regarding ROS production and AhR activity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, although singlet molecular oxygen (
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub>) is not fully characterized in mammals, its role is well established in plants, bacteria, and fungi. Although the mammalian enzyme myeloperoxidase mediates the production of 
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub>, its physiological role in mammals (other than photosensitization of the skin by the UVA component of solar radiation) has not been established [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. A recent report by Stanley et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>] showed that 
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub> plays a critical role in redox regulation in atrial relaxation and in controlling blood pressure in mammals during inflammation accompanied by endothelial IDO1 expression. Thus, 
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub> is an important ROS in the fields of biology and medicine.
