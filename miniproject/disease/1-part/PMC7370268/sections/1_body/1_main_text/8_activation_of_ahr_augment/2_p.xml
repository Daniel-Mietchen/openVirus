<p id="Par134">In addition to the increased pulmonary neutrophilia and iNOS levels resulting from IV infection, mice treated with TCDD, which activates AhR only transiently, exhibit a diminished IV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This suggests that the prolonged AhR activation induced by the environmental pollutant TCDD correlates with increased respiratory IAV infection. Furthermore, Boule et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>] compared the effects of four AhR agonists, TCDD, 3,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl-126 (PCB126) 2-(1
 <italic>H</italic>-indol-3-ylcarbonyl)-4-thiazolecarboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), and FICZ, on the immune response in mice infected by IVs. Treatment with TCDD, PCB, and ITE decreased the virus-specific IgM/IgG levels and the number of helper T cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells but increased the number of regulatory T cells. However, FICZ alone decreased the levels of virus-specific IgG and the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell response and increased the number of helper T cells. These studies suggest that harnessing AhR activity is critical for modulating the host cell immunity to IV infection. Dendritic cells (DCs) were another target [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]. Gene expression studies revealed changes in Lrp1, Itgam, and Fcgr1 expression, as well as alterations in genes that regulate the migration of DCs, and antigen processing/presentation disrupted by inappropriate AhR signaling during development. These studies suggest the importance of the AhR activation during development in DCs. Franhini et al. reported the genome-wide transcription map of AhR targets genes induced by influenza virus H3N2 in dendritic cells and found that the lectin receptor 
 <italic>Cd209a</italic> (DC-SIGN) and chemokine the 
 <italic>Ccl17</italic> are novel AhR target genes [
