<p id="Par133">TCDD-treated and IV-infected mice exhibit activation of AhR in the lungs and a decrease in survival, which suggests a relationship between the susceptibility to viral respiratory infections and exposure to environmental toxin ligands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this model, increased iNOS levels in endothelial cells of virus-infected mice and an increased number of neutrophils around pneumocytes are observed after AhR activation, which requires a nuclear transport signal and intact DNA-binding domains within AhR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The activation of the AhR, which occurs via kynurenine mediation, regulates the production of IFNÎ² negatively after IV infection, which allows virus propagation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. IV infection can increase kynurenine production by upregulating the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), which is a key enzyme in the kynurenine biosynthesis pathway [
