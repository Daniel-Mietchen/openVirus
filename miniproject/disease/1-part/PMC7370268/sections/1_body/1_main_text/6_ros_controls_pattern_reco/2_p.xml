<p id="Par116">In addition, the mucosal defenses of the lungs against IAVs can be followed by a single inhaled treatment comprising a synergistic combination of a TLR agonist (such as the diacylated lipopeptide ligand of TLR2/6, Pam2CSK4) and a CpG ligand for TLR9 (ODN362). These antiviral responses to viral burden attenuated the infectivity and enhanced survival potency via the protective responses afforded by ROS generation [

The innate immune receptors might modulate oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Thus, oxidative stress responses can regulate PPRs for ROS/RNS-mediated molecular targets.
