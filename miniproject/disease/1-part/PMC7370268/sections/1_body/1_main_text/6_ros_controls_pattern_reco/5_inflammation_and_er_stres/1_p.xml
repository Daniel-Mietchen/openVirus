<p id="Par119">IV infection induces a robust production of cytokines, such as IFNs; interleukins (ILs); chemokines, such as CXCL10 and CCL5; tumor necrosis factors (TNFs); and ROS, which can promote the expression of inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. The generation of ROS is required in host cells after the activation of TLRs, which may be used by IVs to promote innate immunity functions in their hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. IVs trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokines), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Some of these factors belong to the NF-κB signaling pathway, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, MIP1a, MCP-1, and RANTES [
