<p id="Par120">After IVs infect the host cells and the production of ROS/NOS surpasses the normal levels, events such as the production of oxidizing nitrogen oxides and peroxynitrite occur concomitantly. In turn, these events induce the oxidation or nitration of amino acid residues, lipid peroxidation, and DNA strand breaks, finally producing apoptotic signals in states of ER stress or of oxidative stress in mitochondria [
