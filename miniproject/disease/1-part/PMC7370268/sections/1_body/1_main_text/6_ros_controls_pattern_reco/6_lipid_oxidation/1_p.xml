<p id="Par122">Malondialdehyde, F2-isoprostane, 7-ketocholesterol, and 7Î²-hydroxycholesterol have been identified as lipid alterations that are induced by IV-mediated ROS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. IV infection induces oxidation, which is accompanied by an increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation in the presence of vitamin E, conjugated dienes, and total malondialdehyde [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. IV-infected cells or animals exhibit increased oxidation of free radicals in unsaturated lipid chains in the host membranes, which decreases their permeability. In the absence of antioxidants, the cell membranes are severely damaged and ultimately exhibit severe pathological changes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. A/Aichi/2/68 IV infection increased the levels of lipid peroxidation (conjugated dienes and total malondialdehyde) and decreased the levels of endogenous natural antioxidant vitamin E. Supplementation of mice with exogenous vitamin E before viral infection protected the lungs and blood against lipid peroxidation damage [
