<p id="Par115">The recognition of self and nonself in the innate immune reaction is carried out by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which are the germline-encoded receptors located on the plasma membranes and within endosomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>], that act as sensors to monitor infection. PRRs can sense an exogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs include ROS, heat-shock proteins, oxidized lipoproteins, and cholesterol. DAMPs can trigger innate inflammation by binding to PPRs, including TLRs, NOD-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors, and absent in melanoma (AIM) 2-like receptors (ALRs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. The interaction with these receptors can amplify the inflammatory responses in the host cells. The innate immune receptors might modulate oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondrial function. Thus, oxidative stress responses can regulate PPRs for ROS/RNS mediated molecular targets.
