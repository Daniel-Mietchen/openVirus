<p id="Par117">H3N2 infection induces the expression of MMP-9, but not of MMP-2, in Vero cells. MMP-2 production is increased in Madinâ€“Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Thus, the induction of MMPs is dependent on the epithelial cell type [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. The expression of MMP-9 is increased in the lungs of a mouse model of IAV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. The immunopathological response to IV strains via the production of MMP-9 was compared between the human IV viruses H1N1 and H3N2 in mice and revealed that H1N1 induces high mortality and severe lung changes with Gr1+ and CD11b+ cell infiltration and upregulation of CXCL6/GCP-2, CCL2/MCP-1, and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Infection with H1N1 upregulated the active and latent forms of MMP-9 in the lung and an inhibitor of MMP-2 or MMP-9 reduced in lung pathology partially. Both Gr-1+ and CD11b+ cells in H1N1-infected lungs produced ROS and RNS, indicating that MMP expression is controlled by oxidation and antioxidation. The human influenza type A virus induced the infiltration of neutrophils, which produced MMP-9 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. Thus, MMP-9 production in neutrophils is not controlled by IVs 
 <italic>per se</italic>. Other cell types, such as macrophages, might regulate IV-mediated MMP-9 production. H1N1 induced the expression of the 
 <italic>MMP-9</italic> gene and the cleavage of pro-MMP-2 into an active intermediate protein in human fetal membrane cells, resulting in the weakening of membrane integrity and the degradation of the extracellular matrix [
