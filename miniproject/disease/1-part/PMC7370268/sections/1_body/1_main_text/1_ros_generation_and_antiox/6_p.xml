<p id="Par87">The cytoplasmic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein binds to the ligands that have translocated into the nucleus and activates the expression of a large family of antioxidant molecules, i.e., the cytochrome p450 proteins (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B), in cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], as well as several other antioxidation molecules, such as NAD(P) H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), after the formation of heterodimers with Arnt. The AhR-dependent increases in neutrophilia and iNOS levels in the infected lung were reported to be mediated by AhR-regulated events extrinsic to bone-marrow-derived cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. An experiment using Cre/
 <italic>loxP</italic> technology confirmed that AhR-mediated iNOS increases and neutrophil migration to the lung during IV infection [
