<p id="Par86">The nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) controls the expression of enzymes that participate in the defense against oxidation, although many Nrf2-independent ROS clearance enzymes and nonenzymatic antioxidants also exist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the presence of normal levels of ROS, the expression of Nrf2 is controlled by the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap 1), which targets Nrf2 to ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the cytoplasm. In the presence of increased ROS production, the Nrf2 molecule dissociates from Keap 1 and moves into the nucleus, where it binds to the antioxidant-response element (ARE), together with the small MAF transcription factors, in the promoter regions of target genes that encode antioxidant enzymes. Notably, the promoter of the
