 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and its derivative, 8-nitroguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP), is also a functional molecule. The metabolic pathways of 8-nitro-cGMP are produced by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzymes, which react with SH-proteins via S-guanylation, to form 8-SH-cGMP by reacting with endogenous hydrogen sulfide/sulfanyl radical H
