<p id="Par84">The redox homeostasis is maintained in normal cells by the antioxidation reactions, which include the antioxidant systems of several enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalases (CATs), peroxiredoxins (Prdxs), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutaredoxins (GRs), and a nonenzymatic system, which consists of anserine, carnosine, carotenoids, flavonoids, glutathione (GSH), homocarnosine, melatonin, and vitamins C, and E [
