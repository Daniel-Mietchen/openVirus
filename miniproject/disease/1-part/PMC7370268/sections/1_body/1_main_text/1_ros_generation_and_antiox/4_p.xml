<p id="Par85">A comparison of the kinetic data of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> metabolism between thiol targets and GSH has been performed in mammalian cells. The decomposition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by GSH is dependent on the concentration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, and GSH has a lower affinity for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> than do GPx and Prdx. Therefore, both GPx and Prdx are the main metabolic pathways for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at low concentration, whereas GSH would have a prominent function at higher concentrations of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> [

 <sub>2</sub>O
