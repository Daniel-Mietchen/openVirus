 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Mitochondria play major roles in the production of both adenosine triphosphate and ROS during oxidative phosphorylation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radicals (
 <sup>●</sup>OH), and superoxide anions (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>–</sup>) that are generated mainly during oxidation are classified as ROS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are ROS that contain nitrogen. Based on their chemical properties, ROS/RNS have been divided into two groups: free radicals and non-free radicals. Free radicals are ROS that contain one unpaired reactive electron in the outer orbit and include one-electron oxidants, such as nitric oxide (NO), carbonate radical anion, nitrogen dioxide, alkoxyl/alkyl peroxyl, 
 <sup>●</sup>OH, and O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>–</sup>. The non-free radicals do not contain unpaired electrons and include two-electron oxidants, such as peroxynitrite, peroxynitrous acid, hypochlorous acid, singlet oxygen, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Free radicals are unstable and more reactive than non-free radicals. ROS/NRS target molecules that contain protein residues such as Cys, Met, Tyr, and Trp, and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) bonds. The targeting of ROS to macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids leads to various biochemical and pathological alterations [
