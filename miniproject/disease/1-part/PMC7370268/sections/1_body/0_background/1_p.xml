<p id="Par79">Influenza viruses (IVs) have been involved in pandemics and seasonal epidemics and are serious threats to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. IV pandemics have been noted in the past; for example, the Spanish flu caused by the H1N1 IV in 1918, the Asian flu caused by the H2N2 IV in 1957, the Hong Kong flu caused by the H3N2 IV in 1968, the bird flu caused by the H5N1 and H7N9 IVs in 2003 and 2013, respectively, and the swine flu caused by the H1N1 IV in 2009. Vaccination is currently the key strategy against IV infection, although this strategy is limited by the ability to produce effective vaccines that precisely target new and emerging IV strains.
