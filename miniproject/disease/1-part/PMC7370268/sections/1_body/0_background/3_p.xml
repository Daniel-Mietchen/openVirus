<p id="Par81">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are often produced during IV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], thus promoting apoptosis, lung injury (LI), and inflammation/allergy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These studies indicate the crucial roles of ROS in IV infection, which may have implications for therapy. In this review, we summarize ROS generation and redox control of the host cells upon IV infection and discuss how ROS can affect IV replication. We also describe the potential therapeutics against IV infection that targets ROS prevention and antioxidation in host cells. In addition, therapies aimed at inhibiting ROS-mediated cell damage are critical for future use. Thus, here we show the advantages and disadvantages of these anti-influenza drugs from new perspectives.
