  <p>Simulated infection course using within-host infection dynamics. The viral replication, the antibody dynamics, and their interaction were modelled to define epidemiological parameters. It is assumed that when the EBOV-specific antibody concentration reaches a certain threshold, it can inhibit the viral replication [
