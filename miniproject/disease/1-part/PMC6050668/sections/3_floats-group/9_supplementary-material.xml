    <bold>Figure S2.</bold> Case-fatality rate in different vaccination schemes. Simulations of a network of size ten thousand during a period of one year are performed. One thousand simulations were run, each time with a random index case. At the end of each simulation, the network of infected nodes was extracted to compute the case-fatality rate. (PDF 28 kb)
