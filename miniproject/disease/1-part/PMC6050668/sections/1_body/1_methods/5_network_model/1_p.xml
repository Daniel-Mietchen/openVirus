<p>The Europeanâ€™s contact patterns survey data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] were used to generate a network model reflecting the number of contacts and the mixing patterns among age-groups. This dataset is currently the largest collection available on human contact patterns; moreover, a similar pattern has also been observed outside Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. To make the contact pattern more specific to an EBOV-affected population, the age distribution of Freetown city in Sierra Leon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] was used to weight the contact pattern towards this area. In particular, while the contact frequency and pattern remain the same, these data were imposed on a network that has more young and less elderly subjects. A detailed description of the network implementation can be found in Availability of data and materials.
