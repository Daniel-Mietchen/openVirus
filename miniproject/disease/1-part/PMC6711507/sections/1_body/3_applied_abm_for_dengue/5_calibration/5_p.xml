<p>The calibration has been performed considering three phases: (1) the situation before the outbreak, (2) the start of the rainy season, and (3) the end of the epidemic. The first calibration phase showed that there is a strong relation between mosquito numbers, biting rates and transmission probabilities. For example, more mosquitoes with less biting rates result in the same human infections. We found some information about biting times of female mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], assumed a uniformly distributed biting time of 5 to 90 seconds and a mosquito population as large as the human population (referred to as “mosquitoes per human” and as a ratio “humans:mosquitoes”), and we assumed that all mosquitoes die at the age of 33 days. The calibration of the first 25 weeks of the year is straight-forward and leads to transmission probabilities for humans and mosquitoes.
