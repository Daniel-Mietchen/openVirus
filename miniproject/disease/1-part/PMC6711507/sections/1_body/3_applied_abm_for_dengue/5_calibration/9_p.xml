<p>We validated the model according to the ISPOR-SMDM Good Modeling Practice Guidelines on several levels: (1) face validity (i.e., by public health experts, modeling experts), and (2) internal validation (debugging, consistency and plausibility checks) [

 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Immersive face validation involves observing a simulation from the perspective of a single agent. This provides different information than from aggregated model results, which typically represent the whole system. With immersive face validation, the behaviors of single agents are tested, ideally using a graphical 3D-representation of the system. Sophisticated forms of this validation even enable the programmer to perform actions with the agent during simulation time. In our dengue model, we used a simplified version of immersive face validation to observe, how often humans are bitten by mosquitoes, how many of them were infected and how often a mosquito bites viraemic and non-viraemic humans.
