<p>Calibrating the third phase after week 37 was challenging because the developed system is inert and takes weeks to react to changes. Infected mosquitoes live for weeks, and humans are viraemic for several days after almost one week of incubation period. To stop the epidemics after week 37, two attempts were made (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221564.s003">S3 File</xref>). Attempt 1 tries to reduce the mosquito population as soon as possible at the end of rainy season. Then, there are no newborn mosquitoes for 12 days. After that, the mosquito population has reached its defined number and a regular amount of mosquitoes per day are born. However, there are still a significant number of infected persons due to incubation period and viraemic period. The newborn mosquitoes biting these persons results in an unusually high prevalence among young mosquitoes. Consequently, the epidemic emerges again in week 39 (delayed by the mosquitoesâ€™ incubation period), and a repeated smaller epidemic in week 43 appeared. In Attempt 2 a higher mosquito death rate was assumed, while still new mosquitoes are born. However, this results only in a slow decline because new mosquitoes always become infected quickly by humans.
