<p>The disease module describes the relevant health states and the disease progressions. It has been observed that a dengue outbreak is usually caused by a single serotype [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. There is no information about serotype-specific prior infections in the Philippines [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, we model only a single serotype and neglect prior infections. A transmission is possible in both directions with a given probability whenever a mosquito bites a human. However, the host must be in a viraemic state that allows spreading of the virus, and the recipient must be susceptible to the virus. The infection process in mosquitoes is well documented: mosquitoes are usually born healthy and susceptible, although transmissions from infected mothers to the offspring, so-called vertical transmissions, could be observed in rare cases [

 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Upon transmission, a mosquito becomes infectious after an incubation period [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Dengue is not harmful to mosquitoes; they simply remain infectious until they die. Humans are also susceptible at simulation start. Upon a transmission, two independent processes start. The first process makes them infectious after an incubation period, until they recover and become resistant to the virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The second process models the type and length of symptoms after another incubation period. The symptoms range from an asymptomatic disease to dengue fever (DF), severe hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and to life-threatening septic shock (DSS) [
