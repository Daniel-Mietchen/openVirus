<p>ABMs are constructed to reproduces an epidemic in a similar way as it happens in reality. The spreading process occurs based on agentsâ€™ behavior. Hence, the model gives insights into the mechanics of the underlying process, how the epidemic spreads among the population, and how system changes affect this spreading process, which eventually results in different outcomes. In particular, this allows to examine herd immunity and serotype shifts. Stochastic state transition models cannot produce an emerging behavior. They can only incorporate them if they are known for each situation, which is usually not possible for scenarios. In contrast to that, the agent-based model, where the epidemic emerges upon basic rules, automatically simulates these effects without incorporating them explicitly. Yet it is a matter of current research to find a commonly accepted definition and a standardized way for measurement of herd immunity and serotype shift, which makes it even harder to use them in models where they are explicitly required [
