<p>Our model could be further improved with regard to regionality, seasonality, serotypes, patient history and adaptive behavior. Incorporating households and the detailed location where persons and mosquitoes live can, for example, support the evaluation of targeted (regional) vaccination strategies and regional measures to contain the mosquito population. Incorporating seasonality (i.e., the impact of rain seasons on mosquito growth) could improve estimated monthly health care demand and subsequently support planning of health care provision. To differentiate between the four dengue serotypes in the model could also improve the evaluation of vaccination strategies. Studies have shown that persons can only become resistant against their serotype of infection, and that they are more likely to develop severe symptoms during secondary infections [

 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, vaccination against specific serotypes could also prevent severe symptoms of secondary infections which may be considered as an additional benefit in a cost-effectiveness analysis. The model could be refined to incorporate patient histories including previous infections or comorbidities to allow, for example, for predictions on the severity of the disease. Further advanced topics such as adaptive behavior (e.g., humans taking prevention against mosquito bites, mosquitos getting resistant against certain measures) could also be considered in decision analyses.
