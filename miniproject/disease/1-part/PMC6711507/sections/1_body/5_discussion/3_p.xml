<p>The flexibility of agent-based models supports the style of iterative modeling. Starting with a reduced and simplified model structure, more features (e.g. agent characteristics, potential disease pathways) can be added iteratively until the model complexity meets the needs of the respective (future) model applications. Reusability is an important issue because it can significantly reduce the effort for model development, and working with validated model parts increase both validity and credibility in the scientific community and for health policy decision makers. A disadvantage of individual-level ABM are longer conceptualization and model implementation times.</p>
