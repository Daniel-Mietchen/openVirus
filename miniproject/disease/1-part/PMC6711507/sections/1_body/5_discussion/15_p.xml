<p>In our case example, calibration—in particular of the declining epidemics—can be improved. Reasons of the sudden and very steep decline in our case example are not fully understood by epidemiologists. Hence, implementation of the underlying processes is difficult and may require adding additional complexity to the model. In comparison to other studies, for example the Yucatán model published by Hladish, we see a wide range of similarities [

 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the Yucatán model, the mosquito population starts to grow in May and reaches its maximum in July, before it declines in September. The number of dengue cases starts increasing in July, reaches its maximum in October, and then slowly decreases until January. Our model could reproduce such a slow decrease of dengue cases. However, the dengue epidemic in the Philippines stops abruptly within three weeks. Due to the long delay between size of mosquito population and dengue epidemic, we could not fully reproduce the rapid decline.
