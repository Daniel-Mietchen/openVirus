<p>Classical approaches for epidemic modeling often use ordinary differential equations or system dynamics, where aggregated variables represent the population of interest that is grouped by health and other attributes [

Because of this aggregation level, model development, validation and sensitivity analyses tend to be faster as compared to individual-based models. However, the high abstraction level leads to less flexibility for subgroup analyses if this was not specified upfront (e.g., vaccination of all persons of a certain age that are frequently bitten by mosquitoes). In contrast, agent-based modeling simulates individuals. An individual-based simulation allows one to include and track patient characteristics and medical history, evaluation of subgroup specific interventions, calculating specific outcomes and distributions of these outcomes as well as modeling an open cohort. A specific distinguishing feature of ABM compared to other individual-based modeling approaches is that the behavior of agents and respective emerging behavior of the epidemics [

In a compartmental model (e.g., system dynamics) this would require a restructuring of the compartments and respective underlying equations.
