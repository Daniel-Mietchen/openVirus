<p>In our modeling example, each day 20% of the mosquitoes die and are replaced by new mosquitoes. This requires deletion and creation of a large number of agents, which affects the computation performance. Thus, the runtime heavily depends on the actual implementation, on used data structures and RAM management. The model has been implemented using JAVA based on a framework developed in earlier projects [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A sample simulation of 365 days with the full population on an Intel
 <sup>®</sup> Xeon
 <sup>®</sup> 3.3 GHz processor runs in 9 minutes and 54 seconds and needs a maximum of 600 MB RAM during dry season and 1.3 GM during rainy season.
