<p>Technical model implementations do usually not follow strict guidelines or instructions. Instead, they require an algorithmic approach that heavily depends on the actual problem. Hence, existing ABM simulators often have shortcomings for specific models because they cannot consider all possible requirements. In these cases, the simulator must be extended by the user or one decides to implement the model from scratch in a general programming language. Thus, technical programming experience with the specific software is crucial for ABM modeling and advanced general computer programming skills are often necessary.</p>
