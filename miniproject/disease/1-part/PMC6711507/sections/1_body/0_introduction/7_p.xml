<p>The aim of our study is, therefore, to discuss the concepts and important characteristics of ABM for decision-analytic modeling of infectious diseases. In a case study of dengue epidemics, we apply an ABM model to analyze the impact of potential efficacy of mosquito control interventions on the number of new dengue infections in humans in the Philippines. The case study serves to illustrate model characteristics, conceptualizing the model, experiences with model calibration and model analysis.</p>
