<p>For the evaluation of interventions in the area of infectious diseases, the transmissible nature of infectious diseases plays a central role when developing a model. The reduction of the prevalence of infections in the target population often leads to a decreased risk for other individuals in the community. As a best case, the infectious disease may even be eliminated if the number of infected individuals decreases below a critical number. It is therefore paramount for decision-analytic models to capture not only the direct effect of interventions on the individuals under intervention but also indirect effects on the population level including herd immunity [

Herd immunity refers to the effect that a partly vaccinated population can prevent the spread of an infectious disease, and thereby protect unvaccinated persons. In addition, the possibility of acquiring natural immunity following recovery from infection should be considered.
