<p>ABM are individual-based models that allow researchers to model explicitly the agentsâ€™ heterogeneity regarding specific characteristics including risk factors or behavioral attributes. Risks depending on past events can be incorporated using individual characteristics of agents instead of modeling many compartments as in dynamic transmission cohort models. Modeling individual attributes that affect their behavior explicitly has a great advantage: model adaptation becomes easier. Altering or adding attributes generally does not affect the model structure, as it would be the case if information aboutattributes were captured in compartments in system dynamics models.</p>
