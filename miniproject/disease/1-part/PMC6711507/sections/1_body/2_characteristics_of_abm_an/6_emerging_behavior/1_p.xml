ABM is most suited to problems focused on how individual interactions (e.g., contact pattern) generate emergent system behaviors and structures (e.g., potential intended and unintended consequences of an epidemic such as herd immunity, serotype shift, and extinction). In the model, the dengue epidemic is not modeled directly, but is a result of mosquitoes biting humans and the ability to transmit the virus in both directions.
