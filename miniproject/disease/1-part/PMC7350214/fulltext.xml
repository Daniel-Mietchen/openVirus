Introduction</title><p>The influenza virus poses a serious global threat to human health and can cause pandemics associated with high mortality worldwide [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While influenza vaccines have been used in many countries, the seasonal influenza epidemics have not been well controlled. In addition, the outbreak of the swine-origin H1N1 influenza in 2009 resulted in an estimated 300,000 deaths [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], explicitly demonstrating how the influenza vaccination was insufficient for controlling a potential pandemic. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an approach to effectively control influenza. One approach to improve the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is to include adjuvants. While adjuvants have been used in human vaccines to enhance vaccine efficacy for almost a century, only a few adjuvants are licensed. In particular, there are three main adjuvants, alum, MF59, and AS03, which are included in currently licensed influenza vaccines [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite the fact that alum induces humoral immunity, it weakly stimulates cellular immunity [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MF59 has been shown to cause adverse effects, including pain at injection sites and the induction of inflammatory arthritis [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, cases of rare sleeping disorders and narcolepsy after vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted vaccines were reported [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the development of an ideal adjuvant, with regard to potential safety and the ability to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses that are specific to vaccine antigens, is needed.</p><p>Adjuvants targeting pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), are part of a broad approach to stimulate innate immune responses, thereby enhancing antigen-specific immunity and subsequently improving vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, numerous studies have shown the effects of TLR4-dependent adjuvants on improving vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A TLR4 agonist absorbed on alum in AS04 adjuvant was successfully used in licensed vaccines for human papillomavirus [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the hepatitis B virus [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, developing TLR4 ligands as adjuvants could be beneficial to improving antiviral vaccines such as influenza vaccine. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) is a detoxified derivative of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from <italic>Salmonella minnesota</italic> R595. MPL has been demonstrated to stimulate innate immunity via TLR4 [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and promote Th1-biased immune responses [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Even though MPL has been widely used as an adjuvant in several human vaccines [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the complicated purification process and prohibitive cost of MPL have precluded its use as an easy-to-use and cost-effective adjuvant. To address these limitations, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-produced MPL (named EcML) has been previously produced by direct extraction from genetically engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we first investigated the action mechanisms of EcML to increase innate immunity and tested its adjuvanticity using the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA). EcML triggered the activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) via TLR4 and increased the antigen processing of cells. Compared to OVA alone, OVA plus EcML-immunized mice showed an enhancement in OVA-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Finally, we explored the adjuvanticity of EcML in enhancing the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1, A/California/04/09) influenza vaccine efficacy. EcML improved the protective efficacy of the pH1N1 vaccine antigen in mice with 100% survival after viral challenge by increasing influenza-specific antibody (Ab) titers, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that EcML might be a promising adjuvant candidate for influenza vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-08-00306"><title>2.

We also observed that the expression of the costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86) and MHC II molecule were dramatically upregulated on EcML-treated BMDCs compared to those on PBS-treated BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00306-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The treatment of EcML dose-dependently increased the MFIs of CD80 and MHC-II, while the MFIs of CD86 were increased by treatment with 2.5 &#x003bc;g/mL and 5 &#x003bc;g/mL compared to that with lower concentrations such as 0.625 &#x003bc;g/mL and 1.25 &#x003bc;g/mL. The MFIs of CD40 were independent from the dose of EcML, speculating that the expression of CD40 reached a saturation point even at the lowest concentration (0.625 &#x003bc;g/mL). To investigate antigen processing, we incubated BMDCs with DQ-OVA (a self-quenching dye that emits green fluorescence upon the degradation of OVA) alone or mixed with either 2.5 &#x000b5;g/mL EcML or 2.5 &#x000b5;g/mL MPL.

Discussion</title><p>Despite the availability of annual vaccinations, influenza remains a significant cause of human infectious disease and, thus, there is a push to improve vaccine effectiveness. An adjuvant capable of enhancing vaccine immunogenicity without compromising safety would be beneficial to improving influenza vaccines. However, the main influenza vaccine adjuvants, including alum, MF59, and AS03, have limitations such as their weak induction of cellular immune responses and safety issues [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that need to be addressed. MPL has been used as an adjuvant in several human vaccines [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and has reported increasing influenza vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, its disadvantages, including the difficult manufacturing processes and prohibitive cost, have precluded its use as an easy-to-use and cost-effective adjuvant. Thus, an alternative component could be interesting and, in fact, <italic>E. coli</italic>-produced MPL (named EcML) has recently been produced by direct extraction from an engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The <italic>E. coli</italic> strain is a sustainable source and can be easily grown at a very low cost and EcML is directly extracted from the bioengineered <italic>E. coli</italic> without hydrolysis, indicating that the manufacture of EcML is more cost-effective than that of MPL [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Here, we revealed that EcML might be safe to use due to no in vitro cell cytotoxicity, unchanged body temperature, and transient systemic inflammatory responses after vaccination in mice. In addition, EcML robustly activated DCs via the TLR4-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and increased the antigen processing of cells in vitro. Moreover, EcML enhanced antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Ultimately, EcML effectively improved the protective immunity of the pH1N1 influenza vaccine antigen. </p><p>DCs play a major role in innate immunity and serve as a significant link between innate and adaptive immunity [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, targeting antigens to DCs is a crucial strategy in vaccine development. Previously, it was also reported that EcML dose-dependently enhanced the BMDC phagocytic activity against B16F10 melanoma cells [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, we showed that EcML triggered DC activation, including the high production of inflammatory cytokines and the upregulation of the expression of costimulatory and MHC-II molecules. The upregulation of these molecules has been previously seen when using MF59 adjuvants [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, we observed that EcML-treated BMDCs had much higher levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00306">Figure S1</xref>) than MPL-treated BMDCs. This result suggests that EcML might be better than MPL in enhancing innate immune responses by DCs. TLR4 agonists can activate innate immune responses and consequently augment adaptive immune responses by enhancing Th1-biased responses [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A previous study has demonstrated that MPL stimulated innate immunity via TLR4 [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In this study, we also observed that EcML activated BMDCs via TLR4-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, conferring the suppressed production of inflammatory cytokines and the low expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86) in TLR4-defective BMDCs. These results are consistent with the previous data showing that EcML-induced IFN-&#x0a7b5; production was significantly decreased in DCs by a TLR4-neutralizing antibody [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The antigen processing by antigen-presenting cells is an essential step in presenting antigens to T cells and initiating antigen-specific adaptive immunity [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We showed that EcML more efficiently facilitated the degradation of the DQ-OVA antigen, indicating that EcML enhances antigen processing, thereby enhancing adaptive immune responses.</p><p>The safety of a vaccine adjuvant is paramount as vaccines are given prophylactically to healthy individuals. A previous study reported that Lipid A, a toxic domain of LPS, was not detected after the purification of EcML, suggesting that EcML is not contaminated with LPS [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. EcML has also been demonstrated to neither significantly increase the spleen weight nor decrease mice body weight after intravenous injection [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], indicating that EcML may be appropriate for systematic administration. In this study, we further examined the safety of EcML by measuring the cell viability after in vitro treatment and changes in body temperature and systemic inflammatory responses after i.m. immunization in mice. We observed that EcML treatment did not result in any in vitro cytotoxic effects on antigen-presenting cells, including BMDCs and macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00306">Figure S2</xref>). Previous studies have reported that children vaccinated with the MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine showed adverse reactions, including redness and swelling at the injection sites [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We did not observe any such adverse effects in mice after i.m. vaccination with EcML. Mice vaccinated with LPS (an unsafe adjuvant) showed hypothermia which lowered the survival rate after challenge [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, there was no significantly different change in body temperature in the mice vaccinated using EcML. While inflammatory responses are a crucial defense mechanism against viral infection, excessive and persistent inflammation can be detrimental [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that side effects are mediated through the systemic distribution of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Here, we reported that these cytokines subsided to basal levels in the sera of EcML&#x02013;OVA-vaccinated mice at 24 h post-injection. Our results indicate that EcML induces transient inflammatory responses after vaccination, suggesting that EcML might be safe to use.</p><p>A novel vaccine adjuvant could have the ability to improve both antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity [<xref rid="B41-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Consistent with a previous study showing that EcML enhanced OVA-specific antibody response in a BALB/c mouse model [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], our results show that EcML improved OVA-specific Ab production. Moreover, we observed enhanced OVA-specific cellular immune responses by EcML after vaccination using C57BL/6 mice. In particular, EcML increased the number of MHC class I-restricted OVA<sub>257&#x02013;264</sub> peptide-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T cells and the levels of IFN-&#x003b3; release, indicating that EcML robustly enhances antigen-specific CTL activity. Additionally, we observed that EcML was better than MPL in improving OVA-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. We speculated that the adjuvanticity of EcML could be with the reason behind the enhanced levels of inflammatory responses observed for EcML compared to MPL. Currently, alum and MF59 are mainly used in influenza vaccines [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but these adjuvants primarily induce responses toward the Th2-biased immunity [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B42-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and may not be sufficiently effective in the protection against influenza virus infections. We then evaluated the efficacy of EcML as an adjuvant for the influenza vaccine, in comparison to alum. We found that EcML robustly enhanced not only humoral immune responses, including Ab production and HI titers, but also cellular immune responses, including CTL activity and IFN-&#x003b3; release. Notably, EcML-induced adaptive immune responses were higher than those induced by alum. Consequently, EcML fully protected mice (100% survival rate), while alum only partially protected mice (20% survival rate) against pH1N1 influenza virus infection.</p><p>MPL has been reported to enhance the protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We observed that EcML provided similarly protective efficacy with MPL, indicating that EcML was as good as MPL in improving the protective immunity of the pH1N1 vaccine. The induction of the cross-protective immunity of the pH1N1 vaccine is beneficial for the protection against different influenza virus subtypes. We observed that the EcML-vaccine group had an enhanced cross-reactive IFN-&#x003b3; response against H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) and reassortant H3N2 (HA and neuraminidase of A/Hong Kong/1/1968 and internal genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/34) by enhancing the release of H1N1- and H3N2- specific-IFN-&#x003b3; cytokines into the splenocyte culture supernatant after ex vivo stimulation (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00306">Figure S3</xref>). Further studies should be performed to clarify this effect of EcML. A combination of different adjuvants in specific formulations can result in the complementary and even synergistic enhancement of immune responses to specific antigens. We also previously reported that a complex of poly-&#x003b3;-glutamic acid and alum strongly induced the cross-protective efficacy of the pH1N1 vaccine, as compared to each component alone [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The AS04 adjuvant composed of MPL and alum has been used in licensed vaccines for human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, the combination of EcML with other adjuvants, such as alum, should be further studied to broaden the use of EcML in vaccines against other infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-08-00306"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In an attempt to seek a potent vaccine adjuvant capable of enhancing both cellular and humoral immune responses, we assessed EcML&#x02014;an MPL extracted from the engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. EcML was shown to be safe to use, with no in vitro cell cytotoxicity and transient systemic inflammatory responses observed in mice after vaccination. EcML robustly induced innate immune responses, including the activation and antigen processing of DCs, thereby resulting in enhanced antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunities. Importantly, EcML drastically increased the protective efficacy of the pH1N1 vaccine against influenza virus infection by enhancing Ab production, HI titers, CTL activity, and IFN-&#x003b3; release. We conclude that EcML is a promising adjuvant that may be capable of providing protection from influenza virus infections.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-vaccines-08-00306"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/2/306/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/2/306/s1</uri>, Figure S1: EcML enhances IL-6 cytokine levels in BMDCs in vitro, Figure S2: In vitro cytotoxicity of EcML, Figure S3: EcML enhances cross-reactive IFN-&#x003b3; responses after vaccination.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="vaccines-08-00306-s001"><media xlink:href="vaccines-08-00306-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, H.P.; methodology, Q.T.N., E.K., and J.Y.; investigation and data analysis, Q.T.N. and E.K.; resources, C.L., D.H.H., C.G.L., Y.R.L.; writing&#x02014;Original draft preparation, Q.T.N. and E.K.; writing&#x02014;Review and editing, J.Y. and H.P.; supervision, H.P. and C.L.; project administration, H.P.; funding acquisition, H.P.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This research was funded by grants from Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) Research Initiative Program (KGM9942011), from the Ministry of Trade, Industry &#x00026; Energy (MOTIE), Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) through the Encouragement Program for The Industries of Economic Cooperation Region (P0006222), and from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded through the Korea government (NRF-2018M3A9H4055203).</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-vaccines-08-00306"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bar-On</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Glasner</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Meningher</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Achdout</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gur</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lankry</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vitenshtein</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyers</surname><given-names>A.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandelboim</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandelboim</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neuraminidase-mediated, nkp46-dependent immune-evasion mechanism of influenza viruses</article-title><source>Cell Rep.</source><year>2013</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>1044</fpage><lpage>1050</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.034</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 23602571?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23602571</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2-vaccines-08-00306"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Glezen</surname><given-names>W.P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Emerging infections: Pandemic influenza</article-title><source>Epidemiol.
