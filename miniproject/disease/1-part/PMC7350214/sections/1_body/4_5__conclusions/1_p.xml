<p>In an attempt to seek a potent vaccine adjuvant capable of enhancing both cellular and humoral immune responses, we assessed EcML—an MPL extracted from the engineered

 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. EcML was shown to be safe to use, with no in vitro cell cytotoxicity and transient systemic inflammatory responses observed in mice after vaccination. EcML robustly induced innate immune responses, including the activation and antigen processing of DCs, thereby resulting in enhanced antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunities. Importantly, EcML drastically increased the protective efficacy of the pH1N1 vaccine against influenza virus infection by enhancing Ab production, HI titers, CTL activity, and IFN-γ release. We conclude that EcML is a promising adjuvant that may be capable of providing protection from influenza virus infections.
