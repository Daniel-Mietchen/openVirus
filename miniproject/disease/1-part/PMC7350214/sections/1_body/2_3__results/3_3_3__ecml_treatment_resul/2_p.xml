<p>To determine the concentration effects of EcML in enhancing the antigen-specific cellular immune responses, we stimulated the splenocytes of the immunized mice with OVA
 <sub>257–264</sub> peptides, which are restricted peptides presented to MHC class I molecules. We observed that the numbers of OVA
 <sub>257–264</sub> peptide-specific IFN-γ-producing cells increased significantly in mice vaccinated with OVA plus EcML as compared to mice vaccinated with OVA alone (
