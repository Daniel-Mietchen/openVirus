<p>An ideal concentration of adjuvants is important to sufficiently induce vaccine efficacy. We immunized C57BL/6 mice with 10 μg OVA protein alone or mixed with 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 μg EcML (EcML–OVA) on days 0, 14, and 28. Two weeks after the last immunization, the levels of OVA-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2b were measured in the sera of the immunized mice using ELISA. Compared to the OVA alone group, OVA-specific IgG levels significantly increased in the groups immunized with OVA plus 1.25, 2.5, or 5 μg EcML when using serum dilution factors of 300, 900, and 2700 (

There was no statistically significant difference in the IgG level between the 0.625 μg EcML–OVA and OVA alone groups or between 2.5 and 5 μg EcML–OVA groups. Moreover, OVA-specific IgG1 levels significantly increased in all EcML–OVA groups compared to the OVA alone group when using serum dilution factors of 300, 900, 2700, and 8100 (
