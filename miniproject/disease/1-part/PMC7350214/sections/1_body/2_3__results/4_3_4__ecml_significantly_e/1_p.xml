<p>To elucidate the adjuvant effects of EcML, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the adjuvants, including EcML, MPL, and alum. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 10 μg OVA protein mixed with alum (alum–OVA), MPL (MPL–OVA), or EcML (EcML–OVA) on days 0, 14, and 28. Mice immunized with either OVA protein alone or PBS were used as the negative controls. Two weeks after the final immunization, the levels of OVA-specific Abs in the sera of immunized mice were measured using ELISA. Our results showed that the levels of OVA-specific IgG were significantly higher in the EcML–OVA group than in the OVA alone group when using serum dilution factors of 300, 900, 2700, 8100, and 72,900 (

Similar levels of OVA-specific IgG were observed between the EcML–OVA and alum–OVA groups, suggesting that EcML may be as powerful as alum in Ab production. Additionally, the level of OVA-specific IgG1 in the serum of mice vaccinated with EcML–OVA was significantly higher than those of the PBS and OVA groups (

Notably, the serum level of OVA-specific IgG2b dramatically increased in the EcML–OVA group compared to those of other groups. Furthermore, we performed an ELISPOT assay to compare the adjuvanticity in the enhancement of antigen-specific cellular immunity. As shown in

 <sub>257–264</sub> peptide-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells was significantly higher in the EcML–OVA group (69 ± 27 SFUs) than those in the other groups (5 ± 2 SFUs for PBS, 9 ± 8 SFUs for OVA, 23 ± 18 SFUs for alum–OVA, and 40 ± 12 SFUs for MPL–OVA). We consistently observed that the level of released IFN-γ cytokine was significantly increased in the EcML–OVA group (627 ± 50 pg/mL) compared to those of the other groups (56 ± 4 pg/mL for PBS, 55 ± 5 pg/mL for OVA, 158 ± 18 pg/mL for alum–OVA, and 230 ± 32 pg/mL for MPL–OVA), when using splenocyte culture supernatants upon ex vivo stimulation with OVA protein (
