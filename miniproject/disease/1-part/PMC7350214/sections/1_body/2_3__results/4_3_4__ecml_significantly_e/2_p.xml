<p>To investigate whether EcML induces systemic inflammatory responses, we immunized C57BL/6 mice with 10 µg OVA protein alone or in combination with 2.5 µg EcML (EcML–OVA). MPL was used for comparison, and PBS was used as a negative control. Body temperature was measured at 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-injection. The production of systemic inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1α, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-12p70, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and GM-CSF, was determined in the sera of the immunized mice. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00306-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, mice vaccinated with EcML–OVA showed no significant changes in body temperature at different time points after the vaccination compared to the mice immunized with PBS, OVA, or MPL–OVA. Additionally, the levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 were slightly increased in the sera of mice injected with EcML–OVA, but not in other groups at 6 h post-injection. The cytokines returned to baseline levels by 24 h post-immunization (
