<p>To clarify the adjuvant effects of EcML on the protection against the pH1N1 influenza virus challenge, we examined the influenza-specific humoral and cellular responses including Ab titers, HI titers, CTL activity, and IFN-γ release, using the sera and splenocytes of the vaccinated mice. Our results showed that the influenza vaccine antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2b titers were higher in the sera of mice vaccinated with EcML–vaccine than in the sera of mice in the PBS, vaccine, and alum–vaccine groups. There were comparable levels of those Abs between EcML–vaccine and MPL–vaccine groups (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and alum–vaccine (40 ± 53 GMT, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) groups. There was no significant difference in the HI titers of the EcML–vaccine and MPL–vaccine groups (211 ± 101 GMT, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.52) (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), vaccine alone (21 ± 19 SFUs, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and alum–vaccine (40 ± 21 SFUs, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) groups. No significant difference in the cell number was observed between the EcML–vaccine and the MPL–vaccine (66 ± 33 SFUs, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.3) groups (

Additionally, the level of IFN-γ secreted in the splenocyte culture supernatant of mice vaccinated with EcML–vaccine (375 ± 20 pg/mL) was also significantly higher than that of the PBS (90 ± 6 pg/mL), vaccine (202 ± 7 pg/mL), and the alum–vaccine (246 ± 12 pg/mL) groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in the cytokine levels of the EcML–vaccine and MPL–vaccine (301 ± 33 pg/mL, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.06) groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00306-f006">Figure 6</xref>E). Collectively, our results suggest that EcML improves the protective efficacy of the pH1N1 influenza vaccine antigen by enhancing influenza-specific humoral and cellular immune responses.
