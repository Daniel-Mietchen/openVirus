<p>To evaluate whether EcML improves the influenza vaccine efficacy, we examined the effects of EcML on the protection against viral infection resulting from the pH1N1 vaccine. Mice were vaccinated with the pH1N1 split vaccine antigen mixed with alum (alum–vaccine), MPL (MPL–vaccine), or EcML (EcML–vaccine) on days 0 and 14. Vaccine antigen alone or PBS were used as controls. Fourteen days after the last immunization, the immunized mice were i.n. challenged with a lethal dose (50 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of the pH1N1 influenza virus. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00306-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, mice vaccinated with both EcML–vaccine and MPL–vaccine showed 100% survival without considerable body weight loss during 14 days after the viral challenge. By contrast, the mice vaccinated with alum–vaccine showed severe body weight loss and were partially protected, with 20% survival. Mice immunized with PBS or vaccine alone had 0% survival.
