<p>To examine whether EcML can cause cell cytotoxicity in vitro, we first treated immature BMDCs with various concentrations of EcML (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 µg/mL), 1 µg/mL LPS, or 0.5% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 37 °C. The cell cytotoxicity was investigated using a Trypan blue assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00306-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, the treatment of EcML did not affect the cell viability regardless of the tested concentrations.
