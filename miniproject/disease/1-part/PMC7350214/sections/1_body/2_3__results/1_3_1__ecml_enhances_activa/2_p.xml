<p>As DCs play an essential role in the effective induction of adaptive immune responses [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we next examined the effect of EcML on the activation of DCs in vitro. Immature BMDCs were stimulated with various concentrations of EcML (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 µg/mL) for 24 h at 37 °C. MPL was used for comparison. The production of TNF-α and the expression of various costimulatory molecules of the stimulated BMDCs were analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Our results revealed that EcML-treated BMDCs strongly enhanced TNF-α cytokine levels in a dose-dependent manner. The EcML-increased cytokine levels were significantly higher than those enhanced by PBS-treated BMDCs (

The treatment of EcML dose-dependently increased the MFIs of CD80 and MHC-II, while the MFIs of CD86 were increased by treatment with 2.5 μg/mL and 5 μg/mL compared to that with lower concentrations such as 0.625 μg/mL and 1.25 μg/mL. The MFIs of CD40 were independent from the dose of EcML, speculating that the expression of CD40 reached a saturation point even at the lowest concentration (0.625 μg/mL). To investigate antigen processing, we incubated BMDCs with DQ-OVA (a self-quenching dye that emits green fluorescence upon the degradation of OVA) alone or mixed with either 2.5 µg/mL EcML or 2.5 µg/mL MPL. Flow cytometry indicated that the percentages of DQ-OVA
