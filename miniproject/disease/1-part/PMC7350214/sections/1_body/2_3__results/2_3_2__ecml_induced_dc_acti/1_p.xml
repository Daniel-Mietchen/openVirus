<p>Innate immune responses can be activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns via TLRs, and this plays a critical role in initiating antigen-specific immune responses [

 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, we questioned whether EcML-induced DC activation was mediated by the TLR4 signaling pathway using wild-type C3H/HeN and TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ-generated BMDCs. The BMDCs were exposed to PBS, EcML (2.5 µg/mL), or MPL (2.5 µg/mL) for 24 h at 37 °C. Production of TNF-α cytokine and the expression of costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 were respectively investigated using ELISA and flow cytometry. As shown in

Additionally, treatment with EcML resulted in the dose-dependent enhancement of TNF-α cytokine levels from the BMDCs of wild-type mice. By contrast, the cytokine was significantly suppressed in BMDCs from TLR4-defective mice at the same concentration of EcML (
