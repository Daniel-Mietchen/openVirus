<p>As NF-κB activation is a major signaling pathway through which TLR4 induces innate immune responses [
 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we examined whether EcML-induced DC activation was mediated through NF-κB activation via TLR4 by evaluating the IκBα phosphorylation in BMDCs generated from wild-type C3H/HeN and TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice. Western blot analysis revealed that EcML increased the levels of phosphorylated-IκBα in wild-type BMDCs in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, the phosphorylated-IκBα levels were low in TLR4-defective BMDCs treated with EcML (
