<p>In this study, we first investigated the action mechanisms of EcML to increase innate immunity and tested its adjuvanticity using the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA). EcML triggered the activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) via TLR4 and increased the antigen processing of cells. Compared to OVA alone, OVA plus EcML-immunized mice showed an enhancement in OVA-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Finally, we explored the adjuvanticity of EcML in enhancing the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1, A/California/04/09) influenza vaccine efficacy. EcML improved the protective efficacy of the pH1N1 vaccine antigen in mice with 100% survival after viral challenge by increasing influenza-specific antibody (Ab) titers, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that EcML might be a promising adjuvant candidate for influenza vaccines.</p>
