<p>The influenza virus poses a serious global threat to human health and can cause pandemics associated with high mortality worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While influenza vaccines have been used in many countries, the seasonal influenza epidemics have not been well controlled. In addition, the outbreak of the swine-origin H1N1 influenza in 2009 resulted in an estimated 300,000 deaths [

 <xref rid="B3-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], explicitly demonstrating how the influenza vaccination was insufficient for controlling a potential pandemic. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an approach to effectively control influenza. One approach to improve the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is to include adjuvants. While adjuvants have been used in human vaccines to enhance vaccine efficacy for almost a century, only a few adjuvants are licensed. In particular, there are three main adjuvants, alum, MF59, and AS03, which are included in currently licensed influenza vaccines [

 <xref rid="B7-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the development of an ideal adjuvant, with regard to potential safety and the ability to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses that are specific to vaccine antigens, is needed.
