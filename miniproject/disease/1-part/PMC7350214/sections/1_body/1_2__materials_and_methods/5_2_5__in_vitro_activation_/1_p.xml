<p>To investigate the BMDC activation, the cells were stimulated with PBS as a negative control, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μg/mL EcML, or 5 μg/mL MPL for 24 h at 37 °C. The stimulated cells were stained with PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against mouse CD40, CD80, CD86, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, and isotype-matched control mAbs (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). To examine the antigen processing of BMDCs, we incubated the cells with 5 µg/mL DQ™-OVA, which is OVA conjugated with BODIPY FL dye (a self-quenched dye that emits fluorescence upon proteolytic degradation) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) alone or mixed with either 2.5 μg/mL EcML or MPL for 5 h at 37 °C. The cells were acquired on FACSCalibur flow cytometers (BD Biosciences), and the data were collected and analyzed using FlowJo software version 10 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).</p>
