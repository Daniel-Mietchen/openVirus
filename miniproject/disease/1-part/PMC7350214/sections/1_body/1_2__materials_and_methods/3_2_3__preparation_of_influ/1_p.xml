<p>The pH1N1 influenza virus was grown in 9- to 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (NamDuck SPF, Sungnam, Korea) for 48 h at 37 °C. The viruses were harvested from the allantoic fluids of the eggs by centrifugation at 3500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C, filtrated through 0.45 μm pore size membrane filters (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and then stored at −80 °C for further use. All viral experiments were implemented under conditions of biosafety level 2.
