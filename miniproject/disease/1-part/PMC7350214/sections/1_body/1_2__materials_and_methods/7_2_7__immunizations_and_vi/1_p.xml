<p>C57BL/6 mice were intramuscularly (i.m.) immunized with 10 µg OVA protein (Sigma-Aldrich) alone or in combination with 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 µg EcML on days 0, 14, and 28. Spleens and sera were collected 2 weeks after the last immunization. In a separate experiment, the mice were i.m. immunized with 10 µg OVA protein alone or mixed with either 2.5 µg EcML or 2.5 μg MPL. The body temperature of the immunized mice was measured at indicated time points using Thermalert TH-5 (Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA). In addition, sera were collected from the mice. In a separate experiment, the mice were i.m. immunized with 10 µg OVA protein alone or mixed with either 25 µg alum, 2.5 µg EcML, or 2.5 µg MPL on days 0, 14, and 28. Spleens and sera were collected on day 14 after the last immunization. In the influenza experiment, the mice were i.m. immunized with pH1N1 split vaccine antigen (A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A H1N1; provided by Mogam Biotechnology Research Institute, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), which contained 0.05 μg hemagglutinin (HA), alone or mixed with 25 μg alum, 2.5 μg EcML, or 2.5 μg MPL on days 0 and 14. Fourteen days after the last immunization, spleens and sera were collected from the vaccinated mice. On day 14 after the final vaccination, the mice were intranasally (i.n.) challenged with a lethal dose (50 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of the pH1N1 influenza virus. The body weight and survival of the challenged mice were monitored for 14 days after infection. Mice that lost significantly more than 25% of their body weight were considered to have reached the experimental endpoint and were sacrificed.
