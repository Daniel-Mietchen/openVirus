<p>All of the data were presented as the means ± standard deviations (SDs) and represented three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences between the two and multiple groups were assessed using the two-tailed Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test and one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s correction (ANOVA/Bonferroni), respectively. The 
 <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were considered to be statistically significant. All the analyses were implemented using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
