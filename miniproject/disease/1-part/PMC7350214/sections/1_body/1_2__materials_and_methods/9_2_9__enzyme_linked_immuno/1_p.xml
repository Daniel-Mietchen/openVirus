<p>Levels of cytokines in the cell culture supernatants were measured using OptEIA kits (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The production of antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2b Abs in the sera of the immunized mice were determined by indirect ELISA. Briefly, MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 µL of 1 µg/mL OVA protein or 0.5 µg/mL pH1N1 split vaccine antigen in carbonate solution, pH 9.5. The plates were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C and were washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. The plates were then incubated with 100 µL of diluted sera from the vaccinated mice for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 100 µL of HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2b Abs (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, the reactions were developed with the chromogenic tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BD Biosciences) and then terminated with 2N H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The optical density was measured at 450 nm using a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Francisco, CA, USA).
