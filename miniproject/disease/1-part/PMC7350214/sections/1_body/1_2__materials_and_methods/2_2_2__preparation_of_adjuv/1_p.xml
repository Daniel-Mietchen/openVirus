<p>EcML was produced by Eubiologics. Co., Ltd. (Gangwon-do, Korea) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, the EcML was purified from an engineered 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> KHSC0055 and formulated as aqueous formulations using 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and chloroform, and was then evaporated to remove chloroform. The dried EcML was rehydrated in ultrapure water at 0.45 mg/mL, and suspended by sonication at 60 °C. The MPL from 
 <italic>S. minnesota</italic> R595 was purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA, USA) and aqueously formulated using the same processes as for EcML. The resulting EcML and MPL were stored at 4 °C for further use. Alum (Alhydrogel adjuvant 2%) was obtained from InvivoGen.
