<p>Immature BMDCs generated from C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice were serum-deprived for 3 h and then stimulated with EcML at 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 μg/mL or 2.5 µg/mL MPL for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) plus a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 13,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C, and concentrations of total proteins were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Merck KGaA). The blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 and probed with anti-phospho-IκBα rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) Ab (Cell Signaling Technology). The blots were then visualized by chemiluminescence using an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The membrane was then subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) as a loading control.
