<p>The safety of a vaccine adjuvant is paramount as vaccines are given prophylactically to healthy individuals. A previous study reported that Lipid A, a toxic domain of LPS, was not detected after the purification of EcML, suggesting that EcML is not contaminated with LPS [

 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], indicating that EcML may be appropriate for systematic administration. In this study, we further examined the safety of EcML by measuring the cell viability after in vitro treatment and changes in body temperature and systemic inflammatory responses after i.m. immunization in mice. We observed that EcML treatment did not result in any in vitro cytotoxic effects on antigen-presenting cells, including BMDCs and macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 cells (

 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We did not observe any such adverse effects in mice after i.m. vaccination with EcML. Mice vaccinated with LPS (an unsafe adjuvant) showed hypothermia which lowered the survival rate after challenge [

While inflammatory responses are a crucial defense mechanism against viral infection, excessive and persistent inflammation can be detrimental [

Our results indicate that EcML induces transient inflammatory responses after vaccination, suggesting that EcML might be safe to use.
