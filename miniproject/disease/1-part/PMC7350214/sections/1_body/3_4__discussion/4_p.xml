<p>A novel vaccine adjuvant could have the ability to improve both antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity [
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Consistent with a previous study showing that EcML enhanced OVA-specific antibody response in a BALB/c mouse model [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], our results show that EcML improved OVA-specific Ab production. Moreover, we observed enhanced OVA-specific cellular immune responses by EcML after vaccination using C57BL/6 mice. In particular, EcML increased the number of MHC class I-restricted OVA
 <sub>257–264</sub> peptide-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells and the levels of IFN-γ release, indicating that EcML robustly enhances antigen-specific CTL activity. Additionally, we observed that EcML was better than MPL in improving OVA-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. We speculated that the adjuvanticity of EcML could be with the reason behind the enhanced levels of inflammatory responses observed for EcML compared to MPL. Currently, alum and MF59 are mainly used in influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but these adjuvants primarily induce responses toward the Th2-biased immunity [

 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and may not be sufficiently effective in the protection against influenza virus infections. We then evaluated the efficacy of EcML as an adjuvant for the influenza vaccine, in comparison to alum. We found that EcML robustly enhanced not only humoral immune responses, including Ab production and HI titers, but also cellular immune responses, including CTL activity and IFN-γ release. Notably, EcML-induced adaptive immune responses were higher than those induced by alum. Consequently, EcML fully protected mice (100% survival rate), while alum only partially protected mice (20% survival rate) against pH1N1 influenza virus infection.
