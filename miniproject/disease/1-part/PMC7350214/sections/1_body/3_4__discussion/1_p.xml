<p>Despite the availability of annual vaccinations, influenza remains a significant cause of human infectious disease and, thus, there is a push to improve vaccine effectiveness. An adjuvant capable of enhancing vaccine immunogenicity without compromising safety would be beneficial to improving influenza vaccines. However, the main influenza vaccine adjuvants, including alum, MF59, and AS03, have limitations such as their weak induction of cellular immune responses and safety issues [

 <xref rid="B28-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, its disadvantages, including the difficult manufacturing processes and prohibitive cost, have precluded its use as an easy-to-use and cost-effective adjuvant. Thus, an alternative component could be interesting and, in fact, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>-produced MPL (named EcML) has recently been produced by direct extraction from an engineered 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain is a sustainable source and can be easily grown at a very low cost and EcML is directly extracted from the bioengineered 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> without hydrolysis, indicating that the manufacture of EcML is more cost-effective than that of MPL [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Here, we revealed that EcML might be safe to use due to no in vitro cell cytotoxicity, unchanged body temperature, and transient systemic inflammatory responses after vaccination in mice. In addition, EcML robustly activated DCs via the TLR4-mediated NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and increased the antigen processing of cells in vitro. Moreover, EcML enhanced antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Ultimately, EcML effectively improved the protective immunity of the pH1N1 influenza vaccine antigen.
