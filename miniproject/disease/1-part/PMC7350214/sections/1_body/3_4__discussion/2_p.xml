<p>DCs play a major role in innate immunity and serve as a significant link between innate and adaptive immunity [
 <xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, targeting antigens to DCs is a crucial strategy in vaccine development. Previously, it was also reported that EcML dose-dependently enhanced the BMDC phagocytic activity against B16F10 melanoma cells [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, we showed that EcML triggered DC activation, including the high production of inflammatory cytokines and the upregulation of the expression of costimulatory and MHC-II molecules. The upregulation of these molecules has been previously seen when using MF59 adjuvants [

TLR4 agonists can activate innate immune responses and consequently augment adaptive immune responses by enhancing Th1-biased responses [

 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A previous study has demonstrated that MPL stimulated innate immunity via TLR4 [
 <xref rid="B33-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In this study, we also observed that EcML activated BMDCs via TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling, conferring the suppressed production of inflammatory cytokines and the low expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86) in TLR4-defective BMDCs. These results are consistent with the previous data showing that EcML-induced IFN-ꞵ production was significantly decreased in DCs by a TLR4-neutralizing antibody [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The antigen processing by antigen-presenting cells is an essential step in presenting antigens to T cells and initiating antigen-specific adaptive immunity [
 <xref rid="B34-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We showed that EcML more efficiently facilitated the degradation of the DQ-OVA antigen, indicating that EcML enhances antigen processing, thereby enhancing adaptive immune responses.
