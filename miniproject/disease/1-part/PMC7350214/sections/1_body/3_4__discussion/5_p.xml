<p>MPL has been reported to enhance the protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine [
 <xref rid="B28-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We observed that EcML provided similarly protective efficacy with MPL, indicating that EcML was as good as MPL in improving the protective immunity of the pH1N1 vaccine. The induction of the cross-protective immunity of the pH1N1 vaccine is beneficial for the protection against different influenza virus subtypes. We observed that the EcML-vaccine group had an enhanced cross-reactive IFN-γ response against H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) and reassortant H3N2 (HA and neuraminidase of A/Hong Kong/1/1968 and internal genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/34) by enhancing the release of H1N1- and H3N2- specific-IFN-γ cytokines into the splenocyte culture supernatant after ex vivo stimulation (

A combination of different adjuvants in specific formulations can result in the complementary and even synergistic enhancement of immune responses to specific antigens. We also previously reported that a complex of poly-γ-glutamic acid and alum strongly induced the cross-protective efficacy of the pH1N1 vaccine, as compared to each component alone [

 <xref rid="B44-vaccines-08-00306" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, the combination of EcML with other adjuvants, such as alum, should be further studied to broaden the use of EcML in vaccines against other infectious diseases.
