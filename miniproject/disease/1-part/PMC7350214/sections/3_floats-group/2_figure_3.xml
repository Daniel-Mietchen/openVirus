  <p>EcML dose-dependently improves OVA-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 per group) were intramuscularly (i.m.) immunized with 10 µg OVA protein alone or mixed with various concentrations of EcML (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 µg) on days 0, 14, and 28. Sera and spleen were obtained from the immunized mice 14 days after the last immunization. Serum levels of OVA-specific IgG (
   <bold>A</bold>), IgG1 (
   <bold>B</bold>), and IgG2b (
   <bold>C</bold>) were determined by ELISA. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The number of OVA-specific IFN-γ spot-forming units (SFUs) was determined using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. The data are representative of three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences between EcML–OVA groups versus the OVA group (A–D) were identified by ANOVA/Bonferroni; *
