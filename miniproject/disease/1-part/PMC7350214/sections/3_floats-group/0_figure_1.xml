   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-produced MPL (EcML) significantly enhances the activation and antigen processing of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>C</bold>) Immature BMDCs were treated with various concentrations of EcML (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 µg/mL) or 5 µg/mL monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) for 24 h at 37 °C. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Cytotoxicity of EcML was evaluated by measuring the cell viability using Trypan blue stain 0.4%. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Production of TNF-α in the cell culture supernatants was measured by ELISA. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cells were stained with fluorescent dye-conjugated anti-CD40, CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II Abs, and the expression levels of the molecules were then analyzed by flow cytometry. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Immature BMDCs were incubated with BODIPYL FL dye-conjugated ovalbumin (DQ-OVA), plus either 2.5 µg/mL EcML or 2.5 µg/mL MPL for 5 h at 37 °C. Fluorescent intensity was measured via flow cytometry. The numbers in the histograms indicate the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values (
   <bold>C</bold>) and the percentages of the DQ-OVA
   <sup>+</sup> cells (
   <bold>D</bold>). Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Statistical differences were analyzed by 
   <italic>t</italic>-test; **
