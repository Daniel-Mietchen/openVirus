  <p>EcML-induced dendritic cell (DC) activation is mediated through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). BMDCs were generated from C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice by culturing in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-4 for 7 days. (

   <bold>B</bold>) The cells were then stimulated with PBS, EcML, or MPL for 24 h at 37 °C. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Expression levels of CD40, CD80, and CD86 were analyzed by flow cytometry. The numbers in the histograms indicate MFI values. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The levels of TNF-α cytokine in the culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. (
   <bold>C</bold>) BMDCs were serum-starved for 3 h and then stimulated with 0.625, 1.25, or 2.5 µg/mL EcML or 2.5 µg/mL MPL for 30 min at 37 °C. Expression levels of phosphorylated-IκBα (p-IκBα) and β-actin in the cell lysates were determined by Western blotting. The data are representative of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was analyzed by
