  <p>EcML enhances the protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine antigen. C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 per group) were i.m. immunized with 0.05 μg pH1N1 split vaccine antigen combined with 25 μg alum, 2.5 μg EcML, or 2.5 μg MPL on days 0 and 14. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Two weeks after the last vaccination, the mice were i.n. challenged with 50 LD
   <sub>50</sub> pH1N1 influenza virus. Body weight changes and survival rates were monitored up to 14 days post-challenge. Each data point represents the average percentage. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Sera from the immunized mice were obtained two weeks after the final administration, and the endpoint titers of the influenza vaccine antigen-specific Abs are expressed as the means ± SD. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Serum HI titers against a pH1N1 virus were measured by HI assay. The lines indicate geometric means, and negative titers were assigned a value of 5 for calculation. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Splenocytes from the immunized mice were stimulated with UV-inactivated pH1N1 influenza (500 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>)/well) for 3 days, and the numbers of influenza virus-specific IFN-γ SFUs were then determined using ELISPOT assay. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Splenocytes from the immunized mice were stimulated with UV-inactivated pH1N1 influenza virus (500 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/well) for 5 days. The levels of IFN-γ in the pooled cell culture supernatants were measured using ELISA. The data are representative of three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences were identified by ANOVA/Bonferroni or log-rank test (for survival); *
