  <p>EcML effectively enhances OVA-specific humoral and cellular immune responses compared to alum and MPL. C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 per group) were i.m. immunized with 10 µg OVA protein alone or mixed with 25 µg alum, 2.5 µg MPL, or 2.5 µg EcML. Sera and spleen were obtained from the immunized mice 14 days after the last immunization. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The serum level of OVA-specific IgG was determined using ELISA. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Sera were diluted (1:500) in PBS and employed in ELISA to measure the IgG1 and IgG2b levels. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Splenocytes from the immunized mice were stimulated with OVA
   <sub>257–264</sub> peptide (0.5 µg/well) for 3 days, and the number of OVA
   <sub>257–264</sub>-specific IFN-γ SFUs was assessed using ELISPOT assay. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Splenocytes from the immunized mice were stimulated with 1 µg/mL OVA protein for 5 days. The levels of IFN-γ in the pooled cell culture supernatants were measured using ELISA. The data are representative of three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences between EcML–OVA group versus other groups (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) were identified by ANOVA/Bonferroni; *
