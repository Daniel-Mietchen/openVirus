<p>The Asian lineage of ZIKV was introduced into Brazil in 2013 and has affected thousands of individuals ever since. It is possible that the virus has the potential to establish a sylvatic transmission cycle in the Americas (Althouse et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Many species of Brazilian primates and mosquitoes are potentially capable of transmitting ZIKV. In a serological survey carried out in non-human primates from Bahia State, 6 animals (
 <italic>Atelidae, Callitrichidae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cebidae</italic>) presented ZIKV neutralizing antibodies. However, 2 ZIKV-positive samples were also positive for DENV, suggesting cross-reactions among these flaviviruses (Moreira-Soto et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In another study, mathematic modeling revealed a high probability of establishment of sylvatic ZIKV based on a broad range of parameters. The sylvatic transmission would depend on the sizes of the host and vector populations, in addition to the force of infection of ZIKV (Althouse et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Studies on the competence of New World monkeys and other small mammals as ZIKV hosts and on that of 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> and 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> as vectors are needed.
