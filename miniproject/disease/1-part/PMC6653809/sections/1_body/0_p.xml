<p>Urban arboviruses such as dengue viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4 (DENV 1-4), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) can infect wild animals and transfer to sylvatic maintenance cycles in South America. This group of viruses also includes the yellow fever virus (YFV), which switched to a sylvatic maintenance cycle in the past (Figueiredo, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). All these seven arboviruses have urban maintenance cycles and spread throughout tropical areas of the world causing large epidemics of severe diseases with high significance in terms of morbidity and case fatalities. In around 10% of the infected individuals, YFV can cause severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever (Vasconcelos, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). All 4 DENV are causes of acute febrile illness and, in few cases, produce a severe disease due to capillary plasma leaking in the microcirculation that leads to shock and death (WHO, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Patients infected with ZIKV virus generally present an acute febrile illness. However, 4 years ago, a severe congenital disease affecting the central nervous system was found in Brazilian children from mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy (Fran√ßa et al.,
