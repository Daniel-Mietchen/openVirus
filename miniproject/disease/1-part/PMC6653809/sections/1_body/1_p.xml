<p>YFV, DENV 1-4, and ZIKV belong to the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genera, and CHIKV to the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genera, all of which are enveloped RNA viruses and constitute the most significant human arboviruses worldwide (Kuno et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Forrester et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). All of them are originally from the Old World and were introduced into the Americas producing large outbreaks. YFV, ZIKV, and CHIKV were initially found in African primates, being transmitted by tree canopy-inhabiting mosquitoes. DENV 1-4 were originally viruses from primates of Southeast Asia that were also transmitted by these mosquitoes. All seven of these viruses, which retain high adaptative capacities, have currently begun to be transmitted by anthropophilic mosquitoes, such as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, and to use man as a reservoir. Urban maintenance cycles have enabled their spreading in tropical areas of the world causing substantial epidemics (Hanley et al.,
