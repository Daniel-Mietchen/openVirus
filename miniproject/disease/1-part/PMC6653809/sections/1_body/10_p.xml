<p>Similar to YFV, sylvatic cycles may occur with DENV 1-4, CHIKV, and ZIKV. In order for this to happen, the maintenance cycle of an urban arbovirus requires an apparently rare conjunction of factors to occur: (i) an individual infected in the urban environment feeds a sylvatic mosquito (ex: 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic>) and infects this insect with the arbovirus or (ii) an urban 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> feeds and transmits the arbovirus to a primate or another potential animal-reservoir; (iii) suitable amounts of the sylvatic vector-mosquito and the primate or other potential animal-reservoir inhabit the same ecologic niche and maintain close contact to promote and sustain the zoonotic cycle of the arbovirus (easily possible in South America, where wild primates and mosquitoes are abundant); or (iv) the animal-reservoir of the arbovirus maintains a suitable virus level in the blood to allow the infection of the vector mosquito. Moreover, eventually, a bridge-vector such as 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, which lives in urban areas but also spreads into rural, semi-rural, and forest areas, could carry the arbovirus to a sylvatic environment (Hanley et al.,
