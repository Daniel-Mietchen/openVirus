<p>CHIKV was introduced twice into Brazil. In 2013, the Asian lineage of CHIKV entered the North, whereas, the eastern, central, and southern African (ECSA) lineages were independently identified in 2014, and reported in Bahia State. A sequence of CHIKV outbreaks has stricken different regions of Brazil (Figueiredo, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Studies have shown evidence that the virus could start a sylvatic maintenance cycle in the country. 
 <italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes terrens</italic> have proven to become easily orally infected with CHIKV in the laboratory, suggesting high dissemination rates.

 <italic>leucocelaenus</italic> presents infectious viral particles in saliva and displays high rates of transmission 3 days after having an infectious blood meal. The competence of these sylvatic mosquitoes to transmit CHIKV was similar to those of several American

Moreover, in a serologic survey carried out in non-human primates of urban and peri-urban areas of Bahia State, 11 animals showed CHIKV neutralizing antibodies. However, two CHIKV-positive samples were also positive for MAYV, an arbovirus of primates that belongs to the same Semliki Forest antigenic complex of CHIKV that also causes cases of febrile illness with joint pain, producing small outbreaks or sporadic cases in North and Midwest Brazil (Moreira-Soto et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The differential diagnosis between CHIKV and MAYV is crucial in Brazil (Figueiredo, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) to determine if sylvatic maintenance cycles of CHIKV could occur in South America. Further studies are required to prove such an assumption.
