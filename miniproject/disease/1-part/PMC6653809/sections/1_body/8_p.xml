<p>Non-human American primates are highly susceptible to yellow fever, and many animals, namely howler monkeys (Alouatta), die as a consequence of this disease. In Minas Gerais State, it is estimated that 90% of the howler monkeys died from yellow fever in 2016–2017 (Lopes, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The death of primates is a precocious detectable sign of yellow fever epizootics, and the surveillance of primate deaths in Brazil became an important tool to prevent cases of human yellow fever with the rapid vaccination of inhabitants in the target region. A computational analysis based on the surveillance of dead howler monkeys (more than 600 animals) and satellite photos enabled the mapping of ecological corridors and the progression rate of yellow fever among primates in São Paulo State in 2017–2018. Public health authorities state that such surveillance avoided the epizootic stemming from Minas Gerais State from reaching São Paulo City. The results guided a plan for previous immunization of the population with the YFV17DD vaccine before the arrival of the epizootic (Fioravanti,
