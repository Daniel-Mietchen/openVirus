<p>As a form of protection concerning the emergence of new sylvatic cycles of urban arboviruses, antibody cross-neutralization, or immune responses, could abort infection with a virus of the same genus if concurrent infection of the primate occurred. Therefore, it is possible that the immunity of the primate against YFV could hinder infections by DENV and ZIKV and, thus, avoid their sylvatic cycles. Also, the competitive infection of arboviruses of the same genus in a vector could also exclude one of them producing the same effect (Moreira-Soto et al.,
