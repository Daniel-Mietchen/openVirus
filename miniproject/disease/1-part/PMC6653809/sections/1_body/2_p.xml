<p>The forest proximity to urban environments in tropical countries has led to the entry of arboviruses from the wild into cities generating human disease, enhancing the risk to start urban maintenance cycles. In Brazil, Mayaro virus (MAYV, 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) and Oropouche virus (OROV
 <italic>, Orthobunyavirus</italic>) cause outbreaks in the Amazon, Central Plateau, and Pantanal regions. MAYV, an arbovirus of primates transmitted by 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> mosquitoes that reside in treetops, stroke Manaus, a city with 2 million inhabitants, producing dozens of cases of acute febrile illness that had an initial diagnosis of dengue (Mourão et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The same occurred with OROV, a virus whose sylvatic maintenance cycle involves sloths and primates, and whose urban cycle features the midge 
 <italic>Culicoides paraensis</italic>. This virus has also caused outbreaks of acute febrile illness, including some cases of meningitis in Manaus city (Mourão et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These data are merely to highlight that arboviruses can move back and forth from sylvatic to urban environments, and vice-versa (
