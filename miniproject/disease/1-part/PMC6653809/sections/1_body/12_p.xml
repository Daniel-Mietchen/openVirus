<p>It is almost unfeasible to control sylvatic cycles of arboviruses, given it impossible to know where, when or why an arboviral spill-over would occur in wild animals. It inconceivable to tell if a spill-over infection will initiate the wild zoonotic cycle of an arbovirus. Moreover, it is considerably difficult to control infections in wild animal-reservoirs or sylvatic vector mosquitoes. On the other hand, an arbovirus in a jungle cycle could re-emerge at any moment, infecting human populations. Sylvatic transmission cycles for CHIKV and ZIKV involving non-human primates were reported in Africa, causing the cyclic reemergence of these viruses in humans. In case of arbovirus reemergence, it is crucial that patients be diagnosed and treated, and that an urban cycle of the arbovirus due to a spill-back from the sylvatic cycle be prevented (Couto-Lima et al.,
