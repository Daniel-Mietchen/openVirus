<p>During the yellow fever epizootic in southeastern Brazil, and in addition to taking care of thousands of human cases probably infected by sylvatic mosquitoes, public health authorities were significantly concerned regarding the spill-back of YFV returning to its urban cycle transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in large cities, all of which are infested by this mosquito. Brazilian 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are highly susceptible to both American and African YFV strains. Indeed, the reemergence of urban epidemics of YFV in South America could occur if the viruses were to be introduced either from a forest cycle or by a viremic patient from an endemic African region (Couto-Lima et al.,

This vaccine, containing live attenuated virus, is highly immunogenic and has been produced in Brazil since the 1940s (Frierson, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The WHO recommends vaccine coverage of 80% or more of the population to impair urban outbreaks of yellow fever (Shearer et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This sudden outbreak began in 2015 and stroke a community of the Brazilian Southeast that was poorly immunized to the virus. In order to fight against the issue, approximately 20,000,000 people were quickly vaccinated against yellow fever in 2017â€“2018.
