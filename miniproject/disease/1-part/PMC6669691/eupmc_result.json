    "Reporter influenza A viruses (IAVs) carrying fluorescent or luminescent genes provide a powerful tool for both basic and translational research. Most reporter IAVs are based on the backbone of either subtype H1N1 viruses, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) or A/WSN/1933, but no reporter subtype H3N2 virus is currently available to our knowledge. Since the IAV subtype H3N2 co-circulates with H1N1 among humans causing annual epidemics, a reporter influenza A subtype H3N2 virus would be highly valuable. In this study, the segments of A/Wyoming/3/03 (NY, H3N2) virus encoding hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, respectively, were reassorted with the six internal genes of PR8 where the NS gene was fused with a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) gene. Using reverse genetics, NY-r19-Gluc, a replication competent reassortant influenza A subtype H3N2 virus expressing reporter Gluc was successfully generated. This reporter virus is stable during replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and preliminary studies demonstrated it as a useful tool to evaluate antivirals. In addition, NY-r19-Gluc virus will be a powerful tool in other studies including the application of diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies as well as the evaluation of novel vaccines."
