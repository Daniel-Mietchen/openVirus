  <p>In vitro antiviral determination using NY-r19–Gluc virus as a tool. MDCK cells were infected with the NY-r19–Gluc virus at a MOI of 0.1 in presence of (
   <bold>a</bold>) TBHQ and (
   <bold>b</bold>) arbidol, respectively. Infections by PR8-Gluc were performed in parallel as a control. Virus infections were monitored by Gluc examination, and the inhibitory effects were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.
