  <p>Generation of reporter influenza A subtype H3N2 virus encoding the HA and NA genes of wildtype NY virus, in a backbone comprising the six internal genes of PR8. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Diagram of reassorment for generating reporter A/NY-r19-Gluc virus. A/NY-r19 virus was generated in parallel as control. (
   <bold>b</bold>) MDCK cells were infected with NY-r19-Gluc virus from serial passage experiments in MDCK cells (passages 1 to 5) at a MOI of 0.01. At 60 h p.i., luciferase assays were performed. (
   <bold>c</bold>) MDCK cells were mock-infected or infected with NY-r19 and NY-r19-Gluc virus of the indicated passages, respectively, at a MOI of 1. Cytopathic effects were observed at 60 h p.i. using Olympus inverted phase contrast microscope IX73 (magnification 200Ã—).
