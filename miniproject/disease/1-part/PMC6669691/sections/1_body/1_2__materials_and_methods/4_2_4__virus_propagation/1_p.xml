<p>The viruses of NY, NY-Gluc, NY-r18-Gluc, NY-r19, and NY-r19-Gluc were propagated in MDCK cells. MDCK cells of 80% confluence grown in 10 cm dishes were infected with the indicated viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per cell. After incubation at 37 Â°C for 1 h, the cells were washed and fresh medium was added. The viruses were harvested respectively when most cells showed the cytopathic effect (CPE) and titrated for TCID
 <sub>50</sub> values.
