<p>The NY/NS-SAnull-left and NY/NS-SAnull-right fragments were amplified from pDZ-NY/NS using primer pairs 5′-INFU-NCR-NYNS1-F/3′-SDM-NYNS-SAnull-R and 5′-SDM-NYNS-SAnull-F/3′-INFU-NYNEP-NCR-R respectively. Using an In-Fusion cloning kit, the NY/NS-SAnull-left and NY/NS-SAnull-right fragments were cloned into 
 <italic>Sap</italic> I linearized pDZ plasmid, and the resulting plasmid carries what is herein referred to as the NS ‘Splice Acceptor null’ (SA-null) gene.
