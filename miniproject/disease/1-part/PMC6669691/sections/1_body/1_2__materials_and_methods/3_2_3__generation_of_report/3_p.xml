<p>First, pDZ-NY/NS-Gluc instead of pDZ-NY/NS was used to generate a recombinant virus in which the NS gene of the NY virus was fused with the reporter gene 
 <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase, which is the same as the strategy used to construct PR8/NS-Gluc previously described [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00665" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The recombinant virus was designated as NY-Gluc accordingly.
