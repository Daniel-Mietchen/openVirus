<p>Using a third strategy, we successfully generated a reporter influenza subtype H3N2 virus NY-r19-Gluc, which is a 6:2 genetic reassortant encoding the HA and NA genes of the NY virus in a backbone comprising the six internal genes of PR8, where a Gluc gene is fused to the NS segment as previously described [
