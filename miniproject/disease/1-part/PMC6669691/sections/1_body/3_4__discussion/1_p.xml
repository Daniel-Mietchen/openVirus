<p>Reporter viruses provide a powerful tool for basic virology studies as well as antiviral development. However, the introduction of foreign genes or modifications of existing viral genes can lead to altered the virological properties, such as delayed replication kinetics or reduced virulence; moreover, such alterations can create an evolutionary pressure, leading to loss of the reporter genes [

This is not surprising, since our previous study demonstrated that the vRNA replication of an IAV segment can be impaired by the insertion of exogenous genes, resulting in an imbalance of the eight segments during genome replication [
