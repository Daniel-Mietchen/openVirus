<p>The influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of respiratory illness in humans, accounting for up to 650,000 annual deaths worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00665" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The IAV belongs to the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> of enveloped viruses, and the genome consists of 8 negative-sense, single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) segments, coding for at least 11 proteins [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00665" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the major surface glycoproteins, based on which IAVs can be classified into different subtypes. There are 16 subtypes of HA (H1–H16) and 9 subtypes of NA (N1–N9) identified in wild birds [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00665" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, two new subtypes (H17N10 and H18N11) have recently been isolated in bats [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00665" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Currently, IAV subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 as well as two influenza B virus strains of Yamagata and Victoria lineages co-circulate in humans [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00665" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], while other subtypes such as H5N1 and H7N9 can gain the ability to infect humans occasionally [
