<p>Considering that HA is a promising target for antiviral development and given the subtype-specificity of HA inhibitory small molecules, we tested NY-r19-Gluc against some group-2-specific HA inhibitors. To achieve this, MDCK cells were infected with NY-r19-Gluc at a MOI of 0.1, in presence of TBHQ, an inhibitor specifically targeting group-2 HAs, and arbidol, a broad spectrum HA inhibitor, respectively. At 72 h p.i., the expression level of Gluc was determined to monitor virus replication.</p>
