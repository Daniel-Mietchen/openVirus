<p>To determine the replication properties of the recombinant virus, the growth kinetics of NY-r19-Gluc virus was evaluated and compared to that of wild-type NY and NY-r19. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, NY-r19 showed a growth pattern similar to that of wild-type NY, while NY-r19-Gluc replicated less efficiently, with a titer roughly 15 times lower than the wild-type virus. The expression of Gluc over the virus growth period of NY-r19-Gluc was also detected. Unlike virus titers, the Gluc activity was not detectable until 36 h p.i., suggesting a slight delay in luminescence kinetics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). However, the Gluc level grew rapidly after that and showed a significant correlation with the accumulation of the infectious viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). In addition, the luciferase signal correlated well with the MOI of NY-r19-Gluc infecting MDCK cells (
