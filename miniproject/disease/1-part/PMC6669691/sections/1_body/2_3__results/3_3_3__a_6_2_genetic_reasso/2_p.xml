<p>The stability of Gluc in the reassortant virus NY-r19-Gluc was determined by serial passages in MDCK cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, no loss of Gluc expression was observed upon virus passaging (for at least 8 passages), suggesting that the reassortant virus is stable 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The CPEs in MDCK cells respectively infected with NY-r19-Gluc of early and late passages were also compared, and no difference was detected (
