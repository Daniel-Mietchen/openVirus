<p>However, an altered CPE upon NY-r18-Gluc infection into MDCK cells was observed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f002">Figure 2</xref>c, the infection of NY-r18-Gluc of passages 1 to 3 respectively caused cells to become round and detached from the culture plates, which is similar to the CPE induced by wildtype NY virus infection. However, after four passages, the NY-r18-Gluc infected cells became fibrous, and formed numbers of multinucleated syncytia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). This phenomenon implies that NY-r18-Gluc has evolved during passaging in MDCK cells, and the precise mutations and underlying mechanisms remain to be investigated, leaving the reporter virus with limited importance at present.
