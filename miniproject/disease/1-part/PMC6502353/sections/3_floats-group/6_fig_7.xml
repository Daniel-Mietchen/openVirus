  <title>Co-transfection of viral RNAs containing the 3’UTR from CHIKV-Cbn and CHIKV-LR.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> C6/36 cells were transfected with a mix of LR : LR/3’Cbn RNAs at a 9:1 ratio or 
   <bold>(B)</bold> a mix of Cbn : Cbn/3’LR RNAs at a 1:9 ratio (P0). At 72 hpt, viruses were recovered from culture media (P1) and used to infect fresh C6/36 cells (P2, virus recovered from the second viral passage). Total RNA was purified from P0, P1 and P2, subjected to RT-PCR, cloning and sequencing. Agarose gels with PCR products from P2 individual clones are shown on the bottom. Amplicons from full-length 3'UTR of CHIKV-Cbn (Cbn), full-length 3'UTR of CHIKV-LR (LR), and a DNA ladder (M) are shown as reference. The size of DNA ladder (in base pairs) is indicated on the right. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Representation of the 3’UTRs of input RNAs and RNA products of recombination. Template switching events between strands from the same (Cbn &amp; Cbn) or different (LR &amp; Cbn) lineages are schematized. Orange lines indicate the possible route of viral polymerase. Numbers refer to the individual recombinant clones in panel (A) isolated from co-transfection experiment.
