<p>To explore whether sequence duplications are associated to the duplication of RNA secondary structures, we performed alignments of repeated sequence blocks and RNA folding predictions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). We found that DR1 and DR2 do not strictly fold into conserved structural elements, while the last portion of DR3 folds into a highly stable Y-shaped stem loop structure, which is supported by base pair probabilities and nucleotide conservation (
