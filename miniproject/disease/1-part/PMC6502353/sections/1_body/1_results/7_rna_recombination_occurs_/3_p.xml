<p>To explore whether new viral variants were the result of RNA recombination events between the 3’UTRs of different re-emergent CHIKV lineages, we compared the 3’UTR of individual sequences with those of parental CHIKV-Cbn and CHIKV-LR (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007706.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). As represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, the 3’ sequences of almost 66% of the new variants were generated by deletions of DR copies from the 3’Cbn, indicating that recombination had occurred between two RNA molecules from the same lineage. In support of a template switch mechanism for recombination, 33% of the new variants contained chimeric 3’UTRs, with a 5’ portion corresponding to the 3’LR and a 3’ portion corresponding to the 3’Cbn. As a consequence of recombination, the 3’LR gains an extra DR3 copy generating a longer 3’UTR.
