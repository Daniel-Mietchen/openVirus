<p>Here, we followed the evolution of CHIKV 3’UTR during viral transmission with the aim of deciphering the significance of sequence repetitions for virus adaptation. Our experiments reveal that populations of CHIKV are greatly dynamic and the copy number of sequence repetitions at the 3’UTR varies continuously when the virus shuttles from mosquito to mammalian cells. Indeed, sequence repetitions act as functional blocks that are gained or lost during cycling to accelerate viral adaptability. Interestingly, duplication of complex RNA structures is a common feature of the 3’UTR among other RNA viruses that must cycle between hosts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, we have only recently obtained experimental insights into the function of duplicated structures for DENV, showing that duplication of a 3’ structure is beneficial in mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Here we uncovered the requirements and the underlying mechanism that maintain sequence duplications during CHIKV host cycling. Although there are evidences that support that sequence duplications at the 3’UTR provide RNA viruses with the means to replicate in hosts with conflicting demands, our results highlight the differences related to viral biology. We propose a model where RNA recombination and natural selection act concertedly to shape the composition of CHIKV populations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3</xref>), where the same deletion variant was isolated with high frequency. This can be explained by an early single recombination event followed by positive selection during passaging in cell culture.
