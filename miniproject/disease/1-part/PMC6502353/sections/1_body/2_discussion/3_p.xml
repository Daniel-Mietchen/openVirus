<p>It is well known that the repertoire of viral variants that appear in mammals experience important population bottlenecks when they pass to insect vectors [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Multifactorial circumstances (i.e. vector genetic variations, composition of viral populations, and specific mosquito/virus interactions) could influence the bottleneck size and viral genetic diversity. Following this line of thought, we explain the evolution of CHIKV during host switch under two possible scenarios: “tight” or “wide” genetic bottlenecks. In light of our experiments, we propose that under “wide” genetic bottlenecks the mammalian-adapted population undergoes a purifying selection to remove the variants with lower fitness in mosquitoes. On the other hand, “tight” genetic bottlenecks reduce genetic diversity. Variants with higher fitness in mosquitoes are underrepresented in the mammalian-adapted population and may not go through the bottleneck, posing a constraint to viral replication. In this scenario, RNA recombination can generate new viral variants that are positively selected in mosquitoes, working as an efficient strategy to rescue CHIKV from “tight” genetic bottlenecks or even providing an advantage for viral replication [
