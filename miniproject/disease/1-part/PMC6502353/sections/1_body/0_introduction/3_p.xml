<p>CHIKV is an alphavirus in the Togaviridae family of viruses and contains a non-segmented single stranded RNA genome of 11–12 kb, with a type 0 cap at the 5’ end and a poly (A) tail at the 3’ end. The 3’UTR exhibits large size variations, including extensive substitutions, insertions and deletions, suggesting that it has evolved quickly, probably due to different evolutionary selective pressures. One interesting feature about CHIKV 3’UTR is that it contains short sequence repetitions named 
 <italic>direct repeats</italic> (DRs) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Notably, copy number of DRs varies among ECSA (East, Central, and South African) and Asian lineages, indicating that the 3’UTR diverged from a common ancestor that suffered historical events of duplication. Sequences of CHIKV DRs are relatively conserved between closely related lineages, indicating that they have functional significance [

However, complex host-virus interactions could result in the transmission of only certain variants that exist in the viral population. In this regard, recent studies show that deletion of the repeated sequences reduces viral replication rate in mosquito cells but not in mammalian cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting that the DRs have host-specific functions. Nevertheless, the host selective pressures that act on these elements and their functional relevance in viral transmission are still poorly understood.
