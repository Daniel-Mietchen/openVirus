<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod borne virus that after 60 years of exclusive circulation in Asia and Africa has recently spread in Europe and America, producing about 1.7 million infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Explosive spread of CHIKV has been associated with adaptation of viral lineages to mosquito vector hosts that assured efficient transmission. For instance, the 2007 epidemics in La Reunion Island, which passed to the European continent, have been attributed to adaptive mutations within viral structural glycoproteins that allowed viruses to more readily infect the mosquito
