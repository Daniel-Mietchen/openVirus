<p>It is known that arbovirus populations experience important bottlenecks in their mosquito vectors, related to the anatomical barriers the virus has to cross within insects [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Environmental factors, mosquito species and subspecies, and the combinations of viruses and mosquito species affect bottleneck size. In some cases, bottlenecks during natural transmission could constrain genetic diversity of viral populations to levels that lead to fixation of less adapted viruses. So far, how genetic bottlenecks act in concert with host selective pressures to shape the composition of CHIKV populations remains unclear.
