<p>Sequence comparisons of RNA viruses from different groups show that those that must cycle between host species have a more diverse 3’UTR than others with a single host [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this regard, we have previously introduced the concept that 3’UTR duplications of complex RNA structures provide mosquito-borne flaviviruses with the means to efficiently switch between hosts maintaining high viral fitness [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Here, based on the heterogeneity of the 3’UTR of circulating CHIKV, we hypothesized that the number of sequence repetitions can change to accelerate viral adaptation during continuous host cycling. We found that the 3’UTR of CHIKV populations is highly dynamic in cell culture and during the infection of laboratory mosquitoes, recapitulating the observations in natural isolates. Genetic diversity of viral populations depends both on CHIKV lineage and the infected host cell, indicating that CHIKV 3’UTR is under conflicting selective pressures in mosquito and mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that CHIKV uses genetic recombination at the 3’UTR to generate virus populations with diverse 3’UTRs. This strategy allows CHIKV to overcome bottlenecks in nature, driving the generation of new viral variants that rapidly replace the existing ones during adaptation to the host. Altogether, our findings provide important insights into the function of CHIKV 3’UTR plasticity for host cell adaptation, pointing out a central role of RNA recombination on CHIKV ongoing evolution.
