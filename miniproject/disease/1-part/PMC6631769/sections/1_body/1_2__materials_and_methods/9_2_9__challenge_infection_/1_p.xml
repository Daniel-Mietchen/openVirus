<p>Eight weeks after prime immunization, mice were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection with Ketamine solution with doses adjusted to their individual body weight (2 Î¼g/g). An infectious dose of 10
 <sup>5.5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of influenza virus A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild type, was administered intra-nasally to all vaccinated and control groups. To ensure full separation between the groups and the absence of natural infection, an additional control group of five mice was added and not subjected to infection. Body weight was monitored daily and mice showing a weight loss of more than 30% of their initial body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. Mice were kept under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions at the National Research Centre facility unit, Egypt.
