<p>Female BALB/c mice (6–8 week-old) were reared and supplied from the animal house at the National Research Centre (NRC), Egypt. Mice were divided into 5 groups (7 mice/group). Two groups of mice were intramuscularly injected with 5 µg of OMVs-H1/RBD and OMVs-Empty. Three other groups were used as controls including negative control group that was injected with sterile PBS and two positive control groups that were injected either with inactivated H1N1pdm09 or inactivated MERS-CoV. All animals received booster immunizations after 3 weeks. Serum samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after prime immunization. All mice sera were separated and stored at −20 °C until used.</p>
