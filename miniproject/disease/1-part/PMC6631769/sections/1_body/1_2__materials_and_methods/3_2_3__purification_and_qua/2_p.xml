<p>OMVs are typically purified from supernatants of transformed 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10ß cells. To this point, 2 liters (4 × 500 mL) of DH10ß cultures (inoculated with 5 mL of the starter culture) were grown in LB broth at 37 °C in an orbital shaking incubator at 180 rpm until reaching the exponential phase (OD
 <sub>600nm</sub> 1.0). The grown bacteria were pelleted at 6000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and the supernatant was sterile-filtered (Millipore Express PLUS Membrane Filter, PES, 0.22 µm) to remove residual bacteria. Afterwards, the bacteria free supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration using KrosFlo Research II TFF and a 100 kDa hollow fiber membrane (Spectrum Labs, Germany) to a final volume of 30 mL. The resulting filtrate (30 mL) was subjected to further ultracentrifugation at 150,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 3 h and 4 °C in a SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman, GA, USA) to separate the OMVs fraction. Subsequently, the OMVs containing pellet was resuspended in 300 µL PBS (Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline, Biochrom GmbH), sterile filtered (Millex-GV Syringe Filter Unit, PVDF, 0.22 µm) and stored at −80 °C until use. The amount of isolated OMVs was quantified by protein concentration measurement using Bradford protein assay.
