<p>OMVs from pathogenic bacteria have been commercially used to induce specific antibodies against different bacterial strains, including 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> serogroup B [
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The composition of the OMVs can be adapted and used as a vaccine platform via incorporation of heterologous antigens into the vesicles [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This engineering approach is advantageous because (i) it retains the antigens in their native conformation, (ii) it enables the OMVs to target specific immune responses, and (iii) it provides multiple and commensurate protein antigens in a single production process [
 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, bacteria-based vaccines are not well explored to deliver viral antigens. Therefore, we engineered a stable OMVs-based dual vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV by producing OMVs with a chimeric hemagglutinin (HA) comprising of both HA1 and HA2 from the H1N1pdm09 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV.
