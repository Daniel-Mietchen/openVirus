<p>To produce outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs), comprising an expressed MERS-CoV RBD and H1N1pdm2009 HA (OMVs-H1/RBD) hybrid protein, the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain DH10ß was transformed with pMP-H1/RBD plasmid. The presence of the RBD from MERS-CoV and the H1-HA from H1N1pdm2009 in the OMVs particles was examined by immunoblot analysis using 5 µg of purified OMVs-H1/RBD. The blotting pattern confirmed the presence of RBD-linked HA viral protein; corresponding to HA0-RBD (77 kDa + 25 kDa equal 102 kDa). In contrast, OMVs isolated from untransformed DH10ß (OMVs-empty) did not show any cross-reacting proteins (
