<p>Additionally, OMVs-H1/RBD-vaccinated mice demonstrated a significant increase in the neutralizing Abs titer against MERS-CoV (1:160) at week 8 in comparison to the control group as in

These findings ensured that OMV vaccination platform can provide a protection by efficient neutralization of invading H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV. The data presented in this study are consistent with recent reports describing the potential of OMVs as biologically active, stable and highly immunogenic vaccines to protect against IAVs. A newly developed recombinant OMVs bearing the conserved M2e protein (OMVs-M2e) from IAVs efficiently protected mice from an H1N1- and H3N2-type IAV challenge [

 <xref rid="B51-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our study represents an extension of these studies and suggests the generation of OMVs that incorporate combinations of different viral antigens to generate safe and efficient vaccines in animal husbandry and for humans.
