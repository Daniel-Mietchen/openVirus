<p>Based on these observations we engineered the expression of antigenically-stable and immunogenic (OMVs)-based bivalent vaccine that elicits protective antibodies (Abs) following immunization to control infections with H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV. A recombinant construct comprising the HA of H1N1pdm09 fused to the RBD of the MERS-CoV S protein is expressed in an 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial strain. The expressed bivalent antigens were incorporated within the released OMVs (OMVs-H1/RBD).
