<p>To further confirm the role of Hsp70 in ZIKV cellular entry, we tested whether recombinant human Hsp70 (rhHsp70) could act as a competitor for the putative cell attachment protein(s) present on the ZIKV infectious particle. ZIKV was incubated with rhHsp70 and then used to infect Huh7.5 cells, after which ZIKV production was assayed by plaque assay. Incubating ZIKV with rhHsp70 reduced the amount of infectious virus in the supernatant compared to BSA-incubated control ZIKV (
