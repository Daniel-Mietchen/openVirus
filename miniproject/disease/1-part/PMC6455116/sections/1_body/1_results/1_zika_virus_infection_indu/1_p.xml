<p>We investigated the effect of ZIKV infection on the expression of Hsp70. Huh7.5 cells were infected with 3 MOI of the virus, and Hsp70 protein levels were measured by western blot at indicated time points. Hsp70 levels decreased in the initial timepoints following infection but increased almost 40% 48-h post-infection (
