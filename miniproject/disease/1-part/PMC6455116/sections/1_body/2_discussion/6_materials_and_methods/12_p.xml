<p>Real-time RT-PCR: Huh7.5 cell in 6 well plates were infected with 6 MOI ZIKV and incubated with maintenance medium containing DMSO or MKT077 (5 µm/well). Cells were harvested at an interval of 1, 3, 6 and 9 post-infection. Total cellular RNA from the collected cells was extracted using Direct-Zol RNA purification kits. ZIKV capsid (F- 5’ CAA TCA AGC CAT CAC TGG GC 3’, R- 5’ GCC AAT GAT TCC GAT GCT GG 3’) and host GAPDH (F- 5’ CTC TCT GCT CCT CCT GTT CGA C, R- 5’ TGA GCG ATG TGG CTC GGC T 3’) mRNA was amplified using one-step RT-PCR kit using a Qiagen Rotor Gene real-time PCR machine. REST 2009 Software was used for relative quantification and to analyse ZIKV RNA kinetics.</p>
