<p>Hsp70 and related proteins are part of the cellular protective response to stress including the assault from pathogens and cytotoxic agents [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Hsp70 also protects cells from reactive oxygen species that cells produce as a part of their antiviral response [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In viral infections, following entry into the cell, the virus takes over the cellular replication and translation machinery for selfish benefit. In this process, they produce viral mRNA and proteins in excess to maximize production of viral progeny. The virus requires the cellular protein folding machinery for accurate folding and stability of the accumulated superfluous viral protein sequences. Sensing these events, the cell triggers a temporary global protein synthesis shutdown by the unfolded protein response (UPR) and triggers the formation of stress granules (SG) [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. SGs maintain RNA homeostasis under stress conditions by forming dynamic cytoplasmic RNA granules composed of cellular mRNAs and stalled pre-initiation complexes [
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. DENV and WNV are known to inhibit the formation of SG. However, they exploit the SG proteins TIA-1 and TIAR to facilitate the synthesis of viral genomes [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. ZIKA has been shown to hijack and utilize the G3BP1, TIAR, and Caprin-1 SG proteins to promote its replication and impaired SG assembly and SG formation [
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Hsp70 not only acts on aggregated or misfolded clients but also on actively disassembled cellular structures. Upon viral entry, translation of the viral polymerase gene (NS5) and replication of the viral genome occurs. Hsp70 chaperones are essential to achieving the native conformation and function of NS5 and for the active replication complex [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Interestingly at early timepoints post-infection, a slight decline in Hsp70 expression was noted, possibly because the virus overwhelms the host protein synthesis machinery during that time, but Hsp70 levels were significantly increased 48-h post-infection (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Again, viral infections and heat stress lead to transcriptional reprogramming of several cellular pathways by expressing Heat shock factors (HSFs) (transcription factors). For instance, HSF-1 regulates autophagy by modulating the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase 1 (mTORC-1) and SQSTM1/p62-associated proteostasis [
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Flaviviruses including ZIKV utilize the cellular autophagy process for their replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The dsRNA viral replication intermediate is amplified inside a double membrane vesicle and thus escapes the host cellular antiviral pathway. Co-localization of Hsp70 along with dsRNA indicates similar events during ZIKV infection. Hsp70 is also in association with DNAJB1, which is known to mediate cellular RNA sensing by interacting with MDA5/MAVS [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] that could be validated for ZIKV infection in future studies. Finally, the decreased ratio of extracellular to intracellular infectious virus also demonstrates the role of Hsp70 in the process of virus egress.
