<p>Previous work identified Axl, Tyro3, and TIM1 as major cellular players in the ZIKV cell entry process. However, Cas9-mediated deletion of Axl-1 in human neuronal progenitor cells and cerebral organoids did not protect these cells from ZIKV infection indicating the multifactorial entry process of the virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and suggesting that ZIKV uses multiple classes of cell surface molecules as receptors in different cell types. As an initial event in the infection process, virus particles attach and aggregate on the cell surface, providing a window of opportunity for the virus to bind to a specific receptor(s) on the dynamic cell membrane. Other molecules (including Hsp70) have been implicated for the attachment and aggregation of other viruses [

 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although Hsp70 chaperones do not contain export signal peptide sequences, they are found on the cell surface in clathrin-coated pits and within endosome/lysosome-related vesicles [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. They translocate spontaneously from the cytosol into the plasma membrane after oligomerization and binding to phosphatidylserine [
