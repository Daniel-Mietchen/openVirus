<p>Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is an important human liver pathogen belonging to the 
 <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic> family. The virus is estimated to chronically infect 240 million people worldwide killing approximately 1 million people every year due to the HBV-associated end-stage liver diseases such as cirrhosis and HCC [

Although effective vaccines against the virus have been in existence for the past few decades, the current treatment strategies can only control and suppress the HBV viral load but unable to cure. Thus, the continuous identification of new treatment strategies against the liver pathogen is still needed. Recently, Umetsu et al. demonstrated that similar to HCV, silibinin inhibited HBV entry into the permissive HepG2-NTCP-C4 and PXB cells by blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis without affecting HBV-receptor interaction, replication or release [

More importantly, the combination of silibinin and Entecavir, a known nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, reduced HBV DNA in the culture supernatant more than either mono-treatment alone in HepG2-NTCP-C4 cells already established with HBV infection, thus highlighting the anti-HBV potential of silibinin.
