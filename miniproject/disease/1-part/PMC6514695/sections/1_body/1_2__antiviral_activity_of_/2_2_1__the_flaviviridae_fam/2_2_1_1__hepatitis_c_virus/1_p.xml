<p>The effect of silymarin on HCV has been extensively studied and the antiviral activity of the drug against HCV in vitro is well documented. Using a standardized silymarin extract (MK-001), Polyak et al. demonstrated that MK-001 not only inhibited the genotype 2a HCV strain JFH-1 infection in both the pretreatment and post-infection analysis, but also blocked TNF-α and NFκB transcriptional activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and hepatoma Huh-7 cells, respectively, suggesting that the extract possesses both antiviral and anti-inflammatory bioactivities [

Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that although MK-001 treatment alone only modestly affected the interferon (IFN) JAK-STAT pathway, the combination of MK-001 with IFN-α augmented the antiviral efficacy of exogenously added IFN, leading to the conclusion that the antiviral effect of MK-001 is mediated by potentiating the JAK-STAT antiviral signaling pathway which, in turn, inhibits HCV replication.
