<p>Using in silico drug development approach against the dengue nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B), Qaddir et al. docked 2750 phytochemicals from different medicinal plants to the DENV NS4B protein and identified nine phytochemicals possessing potential inhibitory effects against NS4B, including silibinin and other compounds from the plant
