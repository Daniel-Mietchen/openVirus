<p>Togaviruses are arthropod-borne (+)ssRNA viruses that contribute to various human diseases. Presently, there is no effective treatment or preventive vaccines against important togaviruses including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV). Both CHIKV and MAYV belong to the alphavirus genus and are implicated in a variety of human illnesses such as encephalitis, arthralgia, fever, and rash. Therefore, exploring candidate agents capable of inhibiting these togaviruses may provide potential treatment options.</p>
