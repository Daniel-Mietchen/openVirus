<p>In a similar study, Camini et al. explored the antiviral activity of silymarin against the related togavirus, MAYV [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Using an analogous approach, the CPE reduction assay, the authors demonstrated that silymarin at non-cytotoxic concentrations inhibited MAYV replication. Further experiments demonstrated that silymarin pretreatment inhibited MAYV-induced oxidative stress. However, whether the inhibition of the oxidative stress is due, in part, to the inhibition of viral replication or whether inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) itself is sufficient to impede MAYV replication was not addressed. Nonetheless, the findings above suggest that silymarin mainly inhibit alphaviruses by hindering viral replication.
