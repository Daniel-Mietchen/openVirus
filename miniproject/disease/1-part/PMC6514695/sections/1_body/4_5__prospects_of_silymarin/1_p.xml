<p>A growing number of studies have demonstrated the hepatoprotective and antiviral effect of silymarin and derivatives both in vitro and in vivo. Although the in vivo hepatoprotective activity of the drug and its derivatives is ambiguous [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], partly due to the low bioavailability, improving the bioavailability for example through nano-formulation and other approaches could help solve this controversy. Various antiviral activities of silymarin and derivatives have been shown against liver and non-liver pathogens, making them potential broad-spectrum antivirals, at least for some of the enveloped viruses explored to date. In addition, considering the polypharmacological activity of silymarin and derivatives towards multiple host cell targets, such as cell innate immunity and inflammation [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which are all cell physiological processes that are known to be elicited or subverted by many viral infections, these natural products are likely to exert their antiviral activities by modulating the cellular environment in addition to any potential direct antiviral function(s) against a specific viral protein. In the context of hepatic diseases, the ability of silymarin and derivatives to exert both hepatoprotective and antiviral activity makes them ideal candidates, particularly for hepatitis C with the greatest number of preclinical and clinical studies undertaken thus far. Given that the current antiviral agents, for example, the DAAs can only abrogate viral replication without displaying any hepatoprotective effects and are mechanistically different to silymarin’s known antiviral targeting activities, combining such drugs with silymarin or its derivatives would be expected to robustly improve the patient conditions. This notion is supported by the examples reviewed above, including the use of Legalon

 <xref rid="B58-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These findings provide compelling evidence to explore the use of silymarin and derivatives in combination with existing antivirals as a potential treatment strategy, particularly for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis. Further research to improve the bioavailability, delivery, as well as elucidating the main mechanism of antiviral activity of silymarin and derivatives could help to boost our understanding of these drugs and accelerate their development as hepatoprotective antiviral agents.
