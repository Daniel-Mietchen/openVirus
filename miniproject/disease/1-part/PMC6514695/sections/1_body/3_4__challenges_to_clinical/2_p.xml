<p>To address this challenge, several methods have also been explored to increase the bioavailability of silymarin and its constituents. These include combination with phosphatidylcholine [

 <xref rid="B75-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], which can all improve the solubility of silymarin as well as enhance the prolonged and sustained release of silybin. As an example, we have recently employed a nano-emulsification strategy in addressing the solubility and bioavailability issue of the standardized silibinin (silybin isomers). Specifically, silibinin-loaded nanoparticles (SB-NP) with diameters &lt;200 nm were successfully developed using the hydrophilic carrier polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which resulted in the transition of the silibinin crystalline structure into an amorphous state in the SB-NP and demonstrated a significantly enhanced solubility [

Interestingly, free silibinin was efficiently released from the nanoformulation at pH 7.4 but was prohibited at pH 1.2, indicating that the drug would be released extensively in the alkaline intestine rather than the acerbic stomach, thus favoring intestinal absorption. Importantly, the SB-NP retained their antioxidant activity and antiviral function against HCV infection in vitro, and were safe and orally bioavailable in vivo [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Enhanced serum concentration and superior biodistribution to the liver was observed compared to non-modified silibinin following oral administration in rats [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The orally applicable SB-NP with its improved solubility, absorption, and higher accumulation in the liver highlight an advantage for application against viral hepatitis, including hepatitis C, and underscores its potency for further development as a promising candidate drug agent.
