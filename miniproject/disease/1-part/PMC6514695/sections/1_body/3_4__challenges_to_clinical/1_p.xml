<p>Drug solubility has an important influence over drug absorption, and hence bioavailability. Despite the wide range of biological and pharmacological effects of silymarin, the extract is relatively insoluble in water (0.4 mg/mL), and the use of other solvents such as ethanol, glyceryl monooleate, polysorbate 20, and transcutol may help increase its solubility ranging from 33–350 mg/mL [

Studies based on silymarin’s primary active molecular component silybin indicate extensive enterohepatic circulation following oral administration, rapid excretion in bile and urine with an elimination half-life of about 6 h, and a low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract with a reported 0.73% of oral bioavailability in rat plasma [

 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition, the silybin content is particularly susceptible to conjugation reactions in phase II metabolism in the human liver, yielding various silybin metabolites conjugated with sulfates and glucuronides [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and an observed average of 10% of the silybin isomers as unconjugated form in the plasma of orally-administered healthy volunteers [

The recent phase II trial demonstrated in chronic hepatitis C patients who received silymarin capsules that serum level of silybin varied significantly from 2.1 to 2048 ng/mL despite the high dose range used (420–700 mg, 3x daily) in the patient, indicating absorption and bioavailability issues which likely affected the efficacy outcome of the drug against hepatitis C [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The above factors contribute to the poor oral bioavailability of silymarin and, likewise, of its active constituent silybin. For this reason, most clinical trials and case studies, including those against chronic hepatitis C and HIV/HCV coinfection, employed the more water-soluble salt-derivatives such as Legalon
