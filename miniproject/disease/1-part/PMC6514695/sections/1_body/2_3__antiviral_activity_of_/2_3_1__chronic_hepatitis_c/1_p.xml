<p>Several studies have evaluated the effect of silymarin or its component silibinin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Oral administration of silymarin capsules ranging from 140 mg 3 times per day (for 1 year) to 700 mg 3 times per day (for 24 weeks) failed to decrease HCV viral load in three previous studies conducted in Egypt [

However, interestingly, Malaguarnera et al. demonstrated in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that patients who received 12-month silybin-vitamin E-phospholipid complex pills supplemented to pegylated-interferon (Peg-IFN) + ribavirin (RBV) treatment achieved lower viral load compared to those who only received Peg-IFN+RBV treatment [
