<p>Using a different protocol, Braun et al. examined the efficacy of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL lead-in treatment in a total of 16 HIV/HCV coinfected Peg-IFN+RBV non-responding patients with advanced liver fibrosis in the clinical trial named THISTLE [

 <xref rid="B58-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. All patients were given 20 mg/kg/day of intravenous Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL monotherapy for 14 days, after which Peg-IFN+RBV combined with the HCV protease inhibitor Telaprevir was initiated for 12 weeks, followed by Peg-IFN+RBV dual regimen for another 36 weeks. Fifteen out of the 16 patients (94%) had undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 4 and 12, with 11 patients (69%) having undetectable HCV-RNA at week 48, and 10 patients (63%) reaching SVR at week 12. Six out of the 16 patients, however, could not achieve SVR 12. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL lead-in treatment in combination with Peg-IFN+RBV and HCV protease inhibitors may be an exciting alternative to treat HIV/HCV coinfected patients to prevent potential drug–drug interactions and to improve treatment success with DAAs [
