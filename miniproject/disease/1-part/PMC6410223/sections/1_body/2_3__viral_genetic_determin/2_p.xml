<p>Few studies were carried out to deduce the role of viral molecular evolution in driving the epidemics. The phenotypic effect of genetic substitutions depends on the gene function and the advantage of the substitution for the virus in the vector or host. DENV4 lineage turnover in 1998 Puerto Rican epidemic was distinguished by three non-conservative amino acids changes in NS2A [

It was associated with molecular changes in the envelope protein. Amino acids were found to be under positive selection, namely E91 and E129 substitutions were conservative; E-131 was non-conservative; E491 was conservative; while E359 changed from T to A [

In Managua, Nicaragua, it was found that the severity of dengue infection was associated with the replacement of predecessor DENV2 NI-1 clade by NI-2B clade. The circulating NI-1 clade was known to be of Asian/American origin with substitutions in capsid R97K, NS1-K94R, and NS3 P245T. A single mutation of N245S in NS4B led NI-1 evolution into the NI-2 clade. Further five mutations namely-M492V in the envelope, L279F in NS1, and K200Q, T290I, and R401K in NS5 were shown to drive NI-2 into a more infective strain, NI-2B [

Genome analysis between two outbreaks within a year revealed five nucleotide changes in E, NS1, NS4A, and NS 5 gene, suggesting molecular evolution of the virus [

One study investigating phylogenetic events that occurred in a DENV-2 1971 South Pacific outbreak revealed that substitutions in prM and non-structural genes NS2A and NS4A led to attenuation of infection [
