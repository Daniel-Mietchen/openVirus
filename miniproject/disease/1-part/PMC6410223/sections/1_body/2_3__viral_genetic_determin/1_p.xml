<p>A significant cause of viral re-emergence is the evolution and genetic mutations of the viruses that make them more virulent and allow for widespread epidemics (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00150-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). RNA viruses acquire genetic diversity because of error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a large population of infected vectors and hosts [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This fosters high mutation rates and recombination that support adaption to changes in the environment or host immunity [

 <sup>−4</sup> substitution/site/year [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The role of viral genetics in DHF is supported by the fact that two distinct genetic makeups led to the difference in disease severity in DENV3, subtype III [

A new method was developed during 1981 for virological surveillance, which included the use of mosquito C6/36 cell culture and specific anti-dengue monoclonal antibody for isolation and identification techniques. It allowed rapid monitoring of circulating DENV strain and prediction of epidemic potential [

An epidemiological study carried out during the 1989 DHF outbreak in Sri Lanka confirmed that the emergence was not correlated with the transmission or the distribution of DENV serotypes. It was proposed that the viral strain and the small genetic changes caused the intransigent and active disease cycle [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Similar observations were found in Tonga DENV2 outbreak in 1975. The severe disease pathogenesis was not related to viral profusion, host susceptibility or vector competence, but was suggested due to viral virulence [
