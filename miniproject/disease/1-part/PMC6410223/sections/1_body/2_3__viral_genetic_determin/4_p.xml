<p>Variations in epidemic potential are also attributable to a virusâ€™ capacity to interfere with the host immune system. TSV01 strain of DENV2 activated a robust type I IFN response; while NGS strain suppressed it via signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 [

In Brazil, the L6 lineage of DENV1 remained persistently circulating even after the introduction of a more fitting L1 lineage into human and vector. The reason could lie in moderate immune stimulation of the B cell and T cell responses by L6, which allowed for increased systemic replication and viremia [
