<p>Some genetic changes can influence virulence, making the virus more infective or cause worse symptoms. Mutations in the domain III of the ZIKV envelope protein may be an important factor in viral fitness as V603I and D679E substitutions were only seen in the recent epidemic ZIKV strains but not in pre-epidemic strains [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Mutation in the viral precursor membrane protein (prM) has been shown to intensify symptoms of ZIKV infection. The S139N substitution arose before the 2013 outbreak on the French Polynesia Island and has been consistently present in the subsequently epidemic American strains. The mutant prM might increase infectivity in neural progenitor cells and promote apoptosis, possibly producing the microcephaly and other pathologies seen in pregnant women during the most recent epidemic [
