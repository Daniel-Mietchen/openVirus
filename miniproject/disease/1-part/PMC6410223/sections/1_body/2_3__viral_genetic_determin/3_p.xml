<p>Subgenomic flaviviral RNA fragment (sfRNA), an extension of the 3â€²-UTR of flaviviral genomes, accumulates during replication and plays an essential role in replication and pathogenesis in both the host and vector [

The PR-2B DENV-2 clade, which was fitter than PR-1 DENV2 and caused a severe epidemic in Puerto Rico in 1994, produced more sfRNA than genomic RNA during replication in the human host. sfRNA suppressed the type I IFN response by inhibiting TRIM-25, an E3 ubiquitination ligase, leading to epidemiological fitness [
