<p>SNPs in gene encoding cytokines and chemokines also contribute to infection outcomes. There is an increased likelihood of symptomatic WNV infection in people with a C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)∆32 mutation. CCR5 promotes transport of leukocytes into the infected brain in order to contain and clear the virus. In the CCR5∆32 carriers, WNV replication could not be controlled in the brain, leading to symptomatic infection [
