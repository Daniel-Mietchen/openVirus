<p>Another set of mutations that affect the host susceptibility to viruses and severity of infection are those in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which encode the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins of the adaptive immune system. This association may be related to the ability of class I and class II alleles to provoke a strong CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell response. Weaker responses were correlated with susceptibility to symptomatic disease [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In Vietnam, it was found that children with HLA-A*24 were at an increased risk of developing DHF or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The researchers theorized that this may be due to a heightened CD8
 <sup>+</sup> response that could affect vascular permeability and cause tissue damage by viral mimicry of host proteins [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In a larger study on Thai patients, researchers discovered that HLA-A*0207 and HLA-B*51 were associated with severe DHF in patients with secondary DENV-1 and DENV-2 infections, while a number of other genotypes were protective against developing severe symptoms during the secondary infections [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Genotypes HLA-DQB1*0302 and -DQB1*0202 were positively linked to DHF and DF susceptibility, respectively [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Sri Lankans with HLA-A*31 and HLA-DRB1*08 might be more susceptible to DSS, during the secondary infection, and people with HLA-A*24 and HLA-DRB1*12 were more likely to have DHF during the primary dengue infection [
