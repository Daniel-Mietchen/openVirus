<p>Another study performed on blood donations in Guadeloupe and Martinique found increased susceptibility to Chikungunya infection in people with blood group A, Rh positive. This link between blood groups and CHIKV susceptibility may be related to several factors that are not well understood, such as different capacities to eliminate viruses by innate immune responses or being more prone to mosquito bites [

Mutations in Musashi (MSI1) proteins, important for progenitor cell growth and differentiation, may also be related to brain abnormalities caused by ZIKV infection. Polymorphisms in the 3â€² UTR of these proteins may disrupt protein binding and facilitate viral replication. Malfunction of MSI1 led to deregulation of expression of factors required for normal neural stem cell function and embryonic brain pathology [
