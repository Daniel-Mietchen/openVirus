<p>Mutations have been discovered to assist an arbovirus in its acquisition by a vector as well as adapting to a new one. The nonstructural protein (NS) 1 of a number of flaviviruses including YFV, WNV, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, DENV, and ZIKV is secreted out of host cells and is present in the host blood [

In addition to aiding in flaviviral pathogenesis in the host, NS1 when acquired together with virions enhances viral infectivity in mosquitoes by overcoming the gut immune barrier. This feature of NS1 can increase the chance of viral acquisition by mosquitoes during a short viremic phase and viral prevalence in nature. This might be a survival strategy that arboviruses have evolved to cycle efficiently between two strikingly different host environments [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Mutations in the viral genome that influence NS1 secretability may thus impact viral transmission from the vector to host and/or vice versa. Indeed, an alanine to valine substitution at the 188
 <sup>th</sup> position (A188V) in NS1 of the recent American ZIKV isolates enhanced viral infectivity and prevalence in mosquitos. This mutation made NS1 highly secretable in the mammalian host, increasing ZIKV transmissibility from the host to vector. This could partly contribute to recent epidemics in South America [
