 <italic>Aedes Aegypti</italic> was a primary vector for CHIKV in India and other countries during the 2006 to 2010 epidemics. The K211E in the envelope protein E1 and V264A in E2 were reported to increase CHIKV adaptation to 
 <italic>Ae. Aegypti</italic> [

In the recent 2016 CHIKV outbreak in Brazil, researchers discovered two new substitutions in the virus, K211T in E1 and V156A in E2, which could enhance mosquito fitness, allowing the outbreak to become an epidemic as they did for a similar epidemic in India in 2006 [

In CHIKV, a change at the position 226 of E1 protein from “A” version (in the strains before 2005) to “V” version (in 90% strains after 2005 epidemics in the Indian Ocean) rendered the virus independent of cholesterol to infect host cells. This is particularly critical for CHIKV prevalence in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes that often have insufficient cholesterol to support productive viral replication [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. These mutations together may account for the rapid spread of CHIKV by enhancing CHIKV prevalence in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, a vector populating in Southeast Asia, and by facilitating viral spread to urban centers and regions with colder climates [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. A T249P amino acid substitution in the NS3 helicase of North American WNV increased virulence in American crow, a major natural reservoir for WNV [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. On the other hand, a V159A substitution in the envelope protein of NA/WN02 strain, which replaced the initial New York NY99 strain in 2002 as the prevalent WNV strain in North America, reduced the extrinsic incubation period in 
 <italic>Culex spp.</italic> mosquitoes, facilitating WNV prevalence in mosquitoes. These mutations, when combined together, may contribute to WNV rapid spread and persistence in North America [
