<p>Phylogenetic analyses were carried out and phylogenetic tree was constructed using time to a most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) with an average clock rate of 10
 <sup>-3</sup>under GTR+I+T93 substitution model [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A Bayesian skyline coalescent distribution was implied. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) were run for 40 million generation to get adequate RSS (Random Sample Size) value of &gt;100 in BEAST v2.5.1. Separate phylogenetic tree was constructed with tip dates for DENV-1 and DENV-2 against dengue genotype database [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] along with previously reported sequences from Nepal. The runs were visualized for quality by Tracer v1.7.1 and summarized with 25% burnin and node selection were done with greater than 0.44 posterior probability value using Tree annotator v2.5.1. All trees were visualized and edited in Figtree v1.4.3 [
