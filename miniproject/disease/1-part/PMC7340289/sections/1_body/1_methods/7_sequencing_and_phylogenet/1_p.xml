<p>Among the PCR positive samples, 5 randomly selected PCR products (2 from DENV-1 and 3 from DENV-2) were further sent to Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST), Nepal for bidirectional sequencing where PCR products were purified and sequenced using the same primers as those used in the PCR performed. DNA sequences were then processed by using software FinchTV v1.4.0 &amp; Bioedit v7.0.5.3 and were visualized in Aliview v1.23 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Genotyping of the sequences were performed by phylogeny method against dengue virus genotyping database [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There were 110 and 149 sequences for DENV-1 and DENV-2 respectively which were tallied to get the phylogeny tree (
