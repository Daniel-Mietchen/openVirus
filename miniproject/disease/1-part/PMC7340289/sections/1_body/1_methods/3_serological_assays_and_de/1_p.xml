<p>Anti-DENV IgG and IgM antibodies and DENV NS1 antigen were detected in duplicate samples using standard InBios ELISA kits (Cat. no. DDGS-R, DDMS-1, and DNS1-R, respectively; InBios International, Seattle, WA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immune status ratio (ISR) was calculated according to the kit instructions to classify samples as DENV positive, negative, or equivocal. Primary and secondary infection were defined as ratios of anti-DENV IgM to IgG of ≥1.2 and &lt;1.2, respectively. The ratio was valid for the sera samples diluted in the ratio 1:100 as described by Falconar et al. [
