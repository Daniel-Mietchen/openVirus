<p>Primers were designed to amplify partial envelope gene of dengue virus. The sequences of representative genotype within different serotypes were prepared from NCBI Genbank. Those sequences were then aligned with Mafft (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] followed by visualization with Aliview v 1.23 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and conserved regions were targeted to select primers. The primers were chosen so as to perform nested PCR. Binding position for the primers on the consensus sequence and sequence of the primers along with size of amplified product is shown in supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234929.s003">S1 Table</xref>. Quality control of primers were performed by using various tools like Primer BLAST [

 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nested PCR of the cDNA was performed for all the Real Time RT-PCR positive samples using the envelope protein primers (

 <sup>®</sup> Master Mix (Cat. No. 04-11-00125). The first round of PCR condition was set to initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of the PCR with cycling conditions of denaturation 95°C for 30 sec, annealing 60°C for 45 sec and extension 72°C for 2 min. The final extension was done at 72°C for 10 min and the reaction was kept at hold at 4°C. PCR product was then taken as template for second round PCR and PCR condition was set same except for extension that was done for 1 min. Agarose gel electrophoresis was run in 1.5% agarose and the bands were visualized under UV transilluminator.
