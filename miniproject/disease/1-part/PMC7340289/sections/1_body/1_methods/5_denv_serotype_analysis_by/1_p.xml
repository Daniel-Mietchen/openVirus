<p>Dengue diagnosis kit (Cat No. KK0128) provided by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA was used for identification of DENV serotypes alongside with positive controls for dengue (DENV-1 to 4) provided with the kit. PCR master mix with final volume of 20 μL per well were prepared [RNase-free water-3.7μL, 2Xs Buffer-12.5μL, Primers Forward and Reverse for DENV-1 to 4 (D1 F/R–D4 F/R)-100 μM, Probe for DENV-1 to 4 (P1-P4) -10 μM, Superscript III Platinum one-step qRT-PCR system enzyme (Invitrogen Cat No. 11732–020)-0.5 μL] in two separate labelled Eppendorf tubes for DENV reaction and Human Specimen Control (HSC) reaction. PCR plate was loaded to Real-Time PCR machine (BIORAD-CFX96 Touch
 <sup>™</sup> Real-Time PCR Detection System) having program set of reverse transcription at 50°C for 15 min, inactivation at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 45 PCR amplification cycles (melting at 95°C for 15 sec with ramp rate 4.4°C/s, and annealing and extension temperature at 60°C for 1 min with ramp rate 2.2°C/s); cooling program set at 50°C for 20 min with ramp rate 2.2°C/s) and finally reaction was left at 4°C. The results were interpreted as positive to DENV-1, 2, 3 and 4 if amplification of probes; FAM (Blue), VIC (Green), Texas Red (Red) and Cy5 (Purple) curve were amplified respectively within Cq value 37.
