<p>DENV is rapidly spreading in Nepal, especially among the most productive age group, which is a major public health concern. However, there are currently no specific programs to control the epidemic. In this study, we showed that DENV-1, 2 and 3 serotypes were co-circulating in Nepal in late 2017, and we have reported multiple genotypes of DENV-1 and DENV-2. From phylogeny, the DENV-1 isolates from Nepal were closely related to Indian isolates belonging to genotype V whereas DENV-2 detected in this study belonged to genotype cosmopolitan IVa which is closely related to Indonesian isolates. Further, DENV-2 isolates of 2004 and 2013 clustered with genotype cosmopolitan IVb, cosmopolitan IVa and Asian II. All the DENV-2 isolates had different lineages having distinct ancestry from one another. In contrast, except for isolate from 2004, all other had ancestry to geographically distant part of the world. In summary, molecular analysis showed diverse population of DENV surfacing at different time point causing epidemic indicating potential needs to address role of genotype in dengue virus disease dynamics including dengue hemorrhagic fever. The results also show impact of global circulation of virus and its spread in previously non-endemic area, the hilly regions of Nepal. Whole experiments were carried out within Nepal with currently available little information on genetic diversity using coding region of envelope protein. This study helped shed light on picture of dengue infection of 2017. Data generated in this study will help support future viral surveillance and epidemiological investigations of dengue in Nepal.</p>
