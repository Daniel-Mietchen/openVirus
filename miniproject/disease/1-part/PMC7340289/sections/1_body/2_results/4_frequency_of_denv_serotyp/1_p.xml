<p>Despite the high frequency of NS1-positive and DENV-seropositive patients, DENV was detected in samples from only 14 of the 50 patients (28%) by qRT-PCR analysis of the DENV performed using the CDC serotyping kit. Of the 14 PCR positive samples, 2 were positive for DENV-1, 11 for DENV-2 and 1 for DENV-3 (

Serotype-specific nested PCR performed on the samples determined to be DENV positive by qRT-PCR showed amplicons of sizes 546 bp for DENV-1, 927 bp for DENV-2, and 991 bp for DENV-3. None of the patients was concomitantly infected with more than one DENV serotype.
