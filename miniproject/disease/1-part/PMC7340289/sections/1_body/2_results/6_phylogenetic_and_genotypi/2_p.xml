<p>Three DENV-2 isolates detected and sequenced in this study were more similar to Indonesian isolates of genotype cosmopolitan Iva (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234929.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234929.g007">7</xref>). Further, the isolates grouped in different clade than of the Nepal isolate of 2013 cosmopolitan genotype IVa. The 2013 isolate appears to have first diversified at around 2003 whereas 2017 isolates (this study) though belongs to same genotype but clustered in different clade. Further, the other clade of DENV-2 from 2013 belongs to different genotype i.e, Asian II which is closely related to USA and Papua New Guinea Few isolates from India that have also clustered in the same genotype, closely related to 2013 isolates. Moreover, DENV-2 circulating in Nepal appears to be of cosmopolitan IVa, while dominant genotype in Indian subcontinent is cosmopolitan IVb. But, one isolate of DENV-2 is however of genotype cosmopolitan IVb reported in 2004 distantly related to isolates from Singapore and India. In summary, cosmopolitan IVa seems to be predominant genotype of DENV-2 in Nepal with very diverse lineage that is not related to previous isolates.
