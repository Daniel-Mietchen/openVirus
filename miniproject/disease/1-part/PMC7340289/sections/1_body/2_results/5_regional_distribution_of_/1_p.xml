<p>The residence and serostatus of the 50 patients are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. DENV was detected in patients from 6 of the 7 provinces of Nepal (exception, Province 6). Of note, although DENV was previously restricted to the plain Terai regions of Nepal, it has spread rapidly; indeed, our data confirm that DENV is now circulating in provinces in the colder hill regions (elevation 100â€“7809 m). The highest number of DENV-positive patients were from Provinces 2 (n = 12, 24%), 3 (n = 19, 38%), and 5(n = 12, 24%), which encompass the central and southern Terai regions and the southern hill and mountainous regions (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234929.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The serostatus of patients in most districts (except Sarlahi and Rautahat) was consistent with primary DENV infection (25, 50%), while fewer had secondary infections (18, 36%) or were seronegative (7, 14%). These results support the spread of DENV into the hilly regions of Nepal. While several regions were represented by only one patient with primary infection, the Rautahat district of Terai was the only region in which secondary but not primary DENV infection was detected.
