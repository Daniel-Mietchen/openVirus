<p>DENV infection was first detected in Nepal in a Japanese traveler in 2004 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; this was reported as serotype 2 and cosmopolitan genotype IVb (referred to as genotype 1 in Takasaki et al.) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The report of DENV infection in Nepal in 2006 indicated that all four serotypes were circulating [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in nine districts of the lowland Terai region, but sequence information was unavailable at that time. Since then, sporadic DENV outbreaks have been reported annually, with major outbreaks occurring in 3-year cycles with a shift in dominant serotype and genotype: DENV-1 genotype V in 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], DENV-2 Cosmopolitan IVa and Asian II genotypes in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and DENV-1 of unknown genotype in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
