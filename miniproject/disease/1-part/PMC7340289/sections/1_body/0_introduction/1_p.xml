<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes spp</italic>. mosquitoes and causes an estimated 390 million infections annually [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The DENV genome is an approximately 11-kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] that encodes three structural proteins (capsid, membrane, and envelope [E]) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Among the structural proteins, the E protein plays critical roles in virus attachment and fusion to the host cell membrane and is also the most immunogenic [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. DENV exists as four serotypes that are further divided into distinct genotypes with sequence divergence not greater than 6% within the chosen genome region [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Current genotypes of DENV based on complete envelope gene sequences [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] is as shown in
