<p>In the present study, we aimed to characterize various aspects of DENV infection in Nepal in 2017 by sampling 50 patients who presented with suspected dengue disease at six hospitals throughout Nepal. Patient symptoms, serostatus and demographic data were collected and correlated with DENV serotypes and genotypes after sequencing of the DENV E protein-coding region. These data shed light on the genotypes of DENV circulating in Nepal in 2017 and add vital information on this region to the world-wide DENV sequence database. This molecular surveillance study, which is the first of its type conducted in Nepal, will be of great help in understanding the origins, genetic diversity, transmission dynamics, and epidemic potential of DENV.</p>
