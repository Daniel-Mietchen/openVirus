<p>One aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of DENV serotypes/genotypes in the temperate highland hill regions of Nepal. We found that DENV-1 and DENV-3 were circulating in the lower belts of Terai, whereas DENV-2 had spread to hill districts such as Dhading. DENV-2 was genotype cosmopolitan IVa, which, unlike Cosmopolitan IVb found in India, is closely related to genotypes found in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Singapore), indicating an unusual spread of DENV-2 into Nepal. The spread of DENV to higher altitudes could be at least partly attributed to increases in global temperatures (global increase of 0.94Â°C till 2016 [

In addition, DENV reported from hilly region all belonging to DENV-2 genotype cosmopolitan IVa might hold answer to why DENV is spreading to previously non-epidemic area. DENV-1 reported from Terai region in this study however agrees with previous reports. Despite the limited number of patients sampled in this study and the genotyping of only DENV-1 and DENV-2 serotypes, our findings identifying specific clades of DENV genotypes in Nepal make an important contribution to our understanding of the current epidemiological status of DENV infection and potential future outbreaks in this region.
