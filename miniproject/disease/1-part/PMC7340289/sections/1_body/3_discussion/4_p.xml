<p>In contrary to DENV serotypes, little is known about the genotypes and clades of DENV circulating in Nepal. Previous studies reported the presence of DENV-2 Cosmopolitan IVb genotype in 2004 (genotype 1 in Takasaki et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), DENV-1 genotype V in 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and Cosmopolitan IVa and Asian II genotypes in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the present study, (Nep 33/43_2017), DENV-1 groups in genotype V, which grouped in different clade than the DENV-1 of Nepal seen in the year 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. DENV-1 reported from Nepal in 2010 is closely related to Indian isolate reported in 2008 (JF967814_India_2008) along with Malaysian isolate (JF967935_Malaysia_2010_V) reported in 2010 itself. Nepal isolate of DENV-1 and above two isolates (Indian and Malaysian) had common ancestor at 2001. DENV-1 reported in 2010 and this study appears to be introduced in Nepal independently as they appear to have common ancestor at approximately 1976 (Figs
