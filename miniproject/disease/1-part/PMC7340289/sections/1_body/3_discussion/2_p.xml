<p>Consistent with our previous report [
 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], 78% of our study population was male. Possible explanations include the more likely infection of outdoor field workers, who tend to be male, and the better and quicker access to healthcare afforded to males compared with females. The most frequently infected age group in our study was the 16 to 45 years-old, which is also the most economically productive age group. This highlights the potentially crippling effect of DENV infection on the economy of Nepal through lost productivity [

 <xref rid="pone.0234929.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], our study of 2017 indicated that more than 50% (25 of 43 seropositive patients) presented with primary DENV infection. This finding might suggest a rise in new infections and even signal the potential for large outbreaks in the near future. Authorities should be alert to this possibility and take precautions to be ready for the next cyclic outbreaks, based on the 2010, 2013 and 2016 outbreaks [
