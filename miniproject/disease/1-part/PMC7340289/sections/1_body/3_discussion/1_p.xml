In the present study, we analyzed 50 patients who presented with dengue from September to November 2017 at hospitals in 14 districts representing all provinces except Province6. Despite the small sample number, our findings reflect the rapid expansion of DENV, including the highland hill regions neighboring Kathmandu. The rapid spread of DENV may be due to increased urbanization, better transportation, and increased adaptation of
