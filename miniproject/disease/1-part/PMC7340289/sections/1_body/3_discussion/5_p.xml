<p>Given geographic proximity to India, it is expected to have DENV isolated being reported in Nepal having ancestral origin in India. However, DENV-2 reported in this study (Nep_9/48/50_Env) do not have ancestral origin in India. Furthermore, DENV-2 reported in this study belonged to genotype IVa having ancestral origin with Indonesian and other East Asian strains. DENV-2 detected in this study and reported in 2013 epidemic [

First report of Cosmopolitan genotype IVa in Nepal was in 2013 while earlier in 2004 genotype IVb strains were reported. Asian II genotype of DENV-2 was also reported in 2013 which was similar to USA/Papua New Guinea strain and the detection in Nepalese territory could be due to accidental spill over probably by tourists. As in case of DENV-1, DENV-2 lineages also show nearest common ancestor before 2004 indicating co-circulation of different dengue strains. The diverse nature of isolates observed might be due to multiple entry of pathogen from different sources because of globalization and ever-increasing dynamic movements of people. These type of diversity in dengue virus holds risk of sudden resurgence of severe dengue disease in near future due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [
