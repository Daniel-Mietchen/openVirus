<p>For 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> transformation, vectors were linearized with the 
 <italic>SacI</italic> enzyme, and electroporation was done to obtain recombinant clones. DNA from the Zeocin
 <sup>Â®</sup>-resistant transformants was extracted and PCR was performed using specific primers for the AOX1 gene to correct cloning confirmation. Amplificons confirmed that each gene was independently integrated into the AOX1 locus of the 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> KM71H host genome (
