<p>Insertion of the genes into the expression vector pPICZαA_NS1DENV1–4 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the empty plasmid was used as a negative control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00379-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Positive gene amplification from each recombinant clone corresponded to the amplicon generated by the AOX region (downstream and upstream) added to the gene encoding the protein, and negative amplification corresponded to the AOX region amplicon without the inserted gene.
