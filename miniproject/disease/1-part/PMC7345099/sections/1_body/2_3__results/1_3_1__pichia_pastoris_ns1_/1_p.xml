<p>Four expression vectors were cloned from pPICZαA plasmid, with codon-optimized sequencing of the NS1 proteins from the DENV1–4 viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00379-f001">Figure 1</xref>A–E). Each construct yielded one protein, which has a polyhistidine tail (6× His) fused in the C-terminal portion for purification and detection.
