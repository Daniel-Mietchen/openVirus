<p>A quantitative characterization of the expression was done to determine which day the methanol-induced yeasts produced a peak of recombinant proteins. Samples were collected from the yeast culture medium from day 1 to day 6 during NS1DENV2 protein production, and it was defined by SDS-PAGE that the sixth day was ideal for protein purification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00379-f003">Figure 3</xref>). All four yeasts presented the same maximum expression profile on the sixth day. After induction and expression, the recombinant proteins (NS1DENV1, NS1DENV2, NS1DENV3, and NS1DENV4) were purified by nickel column affinity chromatography. The fractions that showed peak absorbance were collected, lyophilized, and quantified for yield calculation (
