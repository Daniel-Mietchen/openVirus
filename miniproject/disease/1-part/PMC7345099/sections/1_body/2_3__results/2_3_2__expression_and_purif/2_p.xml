<p>Purified fractions of the four recombinant NS1DENV1–4 proteins were evaluated in electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gel, Western blot was performed using a serum pool of dengue-positive patients, and the PAS reaction confirmed that the NS1DENV1–4 proteins expressed in 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> were glycosylated (
