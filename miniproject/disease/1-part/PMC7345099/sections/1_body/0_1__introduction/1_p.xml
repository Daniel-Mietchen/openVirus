<p>Dengue is a systemic infectious disease, globally distributed by establishing cycles of endemic and epidemic transmission [
 <xref rid="B1-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is caused by viruses of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, and is transmitted among humans in urban regions by mosquitoes belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In some cases, the infection is not apparent, but can cause various clinical manifestations, from low fever to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which can be fatal [
 <xref rid="B4-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This virus has four antigenically different serotypes, dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4) [
 <xref rid="B5-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], of which the serotype DENV2 is responsible for causing the most epidemics [
 <xref rid="B6-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Immunity developed after infection by one of the four serotypes does not protect the patient from reinfection by another viral serotype, which may lead to severe clinical conditions of the disease [
 <xref rid="B7-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Dengue is endemic in more than 120 countries, accounting for 3.9 billion people at risk of infection worldwide—three times more than the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported [
 <xref rid="B8-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The manufacturers of the tetravalent vaccine Dengvaxia
 <sup>®</sup> (Sanofi-Pasteur), released in 2015 [
 <xref rid="B9-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], received recommendations from the WHO to carry out more tests due to the risk of complications to individuals who had never had the disease previously [
