<p>For decades, the methylotrophic yeast 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> has been widely used for the expression of proteins with therapeutic and industrial uses [
 <xref rid="B39-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is able to grow in the presence of methanol as the unique carbon source and energy. Through genes related to methanol degradation (the AOX1 gene), biotechnology has developed strategies for the efficient production of recombinant proteins [
