<p>Using yeast for the expression of eukaryotic proteins has been extensively explored because of its capacity for producing large quantities of heterologous proteins [

 <xref rid="B36-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is an organism which permits easy genetic manipulation, thus allowing optimization for expressing specific proteins. Many proteins of commercial and pharmaceutical interest are proteins related to human biological functions, and several have post-translational modifications that can best be performed on yeast expression systems rather than in bacterial expression systems. The advantages of using yeast are the rapid growth rate, reduced cost, and the fact that large-scale production can be performed using fermentation [
