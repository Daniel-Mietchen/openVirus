<p>The non-structural 1 (NS1) protein is the first translated protein and plays a key role in virus replication [

 <xref rid="B16-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is a glycoprotein with molecular mass ranging from 46 to 55 kDa, depending on the glycosylation pattern, and is composed of three structural domains: β-roll, wing, and β-ladder. In the dimeric form, it is associated with the ER membrane lipids, aiding viral genome replication. In the hexameric form, it is secreted by infected cells, and interacts with complementary components of the immune system, related to the immune evasion and disease pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B22-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is highly immunogenic, inducing the production of IgM (acute phase) and IgG (convalescence phase) antibodies that are detected in the capture enzyme immunoassays [
