<p>Dengue is a single-stranded RNA, icosahedral, enveloped virus. The genome encodes three structural proteins (capsid (C), envelope (E), and membrane (M)) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) that are responsible for the virus genome replication. The replicative complex (formed by NS2A to NS5) is mounted on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane on the cytoplasm side [
