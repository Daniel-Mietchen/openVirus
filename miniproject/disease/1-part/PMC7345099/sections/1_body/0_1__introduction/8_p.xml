 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> has already been described [
 <xref rid="B51-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].This work, 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> yeast was transformed genetically to produce non-structural protein 1 of the viruses DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4. We used the strain KM71Hâ€”a mutant strain that has the advantage of growing in minimal medium, without the need of supplementation with essential amino acids as wild strains. Therefore, aiming for large-scale production, it becomes a good option for reducing fermentation costs. The recombinant proteins showed high antigenic potential, with the ability to be recognized by anti-dengue antibodies in positive serum samples, when used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The study is a step forward for the commercial-scale production of antigens to be used in serological tests for dengue diagnosis.
