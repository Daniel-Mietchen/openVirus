<p>For future investments, this work demonstrated that the use of yeast for antigen production to detect anti-dengue antibodies is a promising alternative which could contribute to the development of a rapid diagnostic test. The recombinant proteins NS1DENV1â€“4 thus produced are promising candidates for tests due to their high yield, antigenic integrity, and reduced cost for industrial-scale production.</p>
