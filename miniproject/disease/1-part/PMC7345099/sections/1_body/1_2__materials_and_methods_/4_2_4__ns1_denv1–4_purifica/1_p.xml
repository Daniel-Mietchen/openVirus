<p>Supernatants containing the recombinant proteins (approximately 500 mL) were diluted in 500 mL of binding buffer with pH 7.4 (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole) and subjected to affinity chromatography. A 5 mL HisTrap
 <sup>Â®</sup> Fast Flow Crude (GE HealthCare
 <sup>TM</sup>, Chicago, IL, USA) column, previously equilibrated with the binding buffer, was coupled to the AKTA purification system (GE HealthCare
 <sup>TM</sup>). Proteins were recovered using an elution buffer with pH 7.4 (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, and 400 mM imidazole), lyophilized and solubilized in 100 mM of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8. Quantification was estimated by the BCA kit (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, USA).
