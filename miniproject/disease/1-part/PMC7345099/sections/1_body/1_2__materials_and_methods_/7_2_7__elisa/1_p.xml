<p>The recombinant proteins NS1-DENV1, NS1-DENV2, NS1-DENV3, and NS1-DENV4 were used as coating antigens to sensitize 96-well high-binding ELISA plates (JetBiofil, Seoul, Korea) at 1 μg/well in a carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. Patient serum samples were diluted to 1/100, added in duplicates to the plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the plates were washed 5× with PBS, and 0.05% Tween-20 was added. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgM (Sigma) and anti-human IgG (Sigma) secondary antibodies were added to the respective plates at 1/2500 dilution and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the plates were washed 5 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween-20, and ABTS substrate (2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) (Sigma) were added, and they were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After reaction blocking with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, the plates were read (OD450 nm) in a multi-channel spectrophotometer (MultiskanGo, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
