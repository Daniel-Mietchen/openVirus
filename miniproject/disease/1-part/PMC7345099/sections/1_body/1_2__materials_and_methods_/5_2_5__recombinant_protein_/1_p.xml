<p>After purification, NS1-DENV1–4 proteins were electrophoresed (SDS-PAGE 12%, stained with Coomassie Blue) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After transference, the immunolabeling was done. In order to do this, each membrane was blocked with PBS (10 mM phosphate, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl) supplemented with 3% gelatin, and a pool of 3 polyclonal serum samples from patients infected with dengue virus was used as a primary antibody. Membranes were incubated for 24 h, and after this time were washed 5 times with PBS-Tween-20. Then, a secondary antibody with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-human IgM (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA) was added to the membranes for 2 h. After incubation, the membranes were revealed with BCIP/NBT (Sigma). For the labeling of glycoproteins, a reaction was performed using periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). NS1DENV1–4 proteins were electrophoresed (SDS-PAGE 12%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After the transfer, membranes were washed with 12% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min. The next steps were carried out at 4 °C in a dark room. Membranes were incubated with 0.5% periodic acid for 15 min, and washed 3× with 15% acetic acid for 5 min. Then, 50 mL of Schiff’s reagent was added and incubated for 30 min. Finally, 6 washes were performed with 7.5% acetic acid for 1 h, and the membranes were dried at room temperature.</p>
