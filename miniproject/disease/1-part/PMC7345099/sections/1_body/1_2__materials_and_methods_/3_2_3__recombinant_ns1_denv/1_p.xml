<p>PCR-confirmed transformants were pre-inoculated into 5 mL of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose) and maintained for 24 h at 30 °C while agitating at 200 rpm. Each culture was inoculated into 1 L of BMG minimal medium (1.34% YNB, 0.002% biotin, 1% glycerol, and 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0) and maintained for 72 h at 30 °C while agitating at 250 rpm until OD600 ≈ 20 was reached. Then, yeasts were recovered by centrifugation and solubilized in 500 mL of the BMM induction medium (1.34% YNB, 0.002% biotin, 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1% methanol) supplemented with 1% casamino acids, which according to the work of Kaushik and Rohila [
 <xref rid="B53-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] help in proteolysis reduction and favor recombinant protein secretion. Yeast cultures were maintained for 96 h at 20 °C under agitation (250 rpm), and at 12-h intervals, the media was supplemented with 0.5% (
