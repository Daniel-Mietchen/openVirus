<p>Gene sequences encoding NS1 proteins were synthesized and optimized for expression in yeast using cloning vector pUC57 (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Each gene was inserted between two specific restriction sites independently in the pPICZαA vector: 
 <italic>EcoRI</italic> and 
 <italic>NotI</italic> (DENV1, 3 and 4) and 
 <italic>KpnI</italic> and 
 <italic>NotI</italic> (DENV2). Constructs (pPICZαA_NS1-DENV1–4) were linearized with 
 <italic>SacI</italic> and used in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> KM71H transformation by electroporation. Transformants were selected on Zeocin™-resistant YPDS (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, and 18.2% sorbitol) at different antibiotic concentrations (100, 200, and 500 μg/mL), as described in the Easy Select 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> Expression kit (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA of the transforming clones was extracted, according to Looke and Kristjuhan [
 <xref rid="B52-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], with minor modifications, and insertion was confirmed by PCR using specific primers for AOX1: AOX1sense (5′gactggttccaattgacaagc3′) and AOX1antisense (5′gcaaatggcattctgacatcc3′).
