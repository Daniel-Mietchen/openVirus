<p>The strain used in this study was the methylotrophic yeast 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> KM71H. This lineage has the enzyme alcohol oxygenase 1 (AOX1) gene deleted, so that only the alcohol enzyme oxygenase 2 (AOX2) gene is functional. It is a mutant strain (MutS) and shows reduced consumption of the methanol inducer as a carbon and energy source [
 <xref rid="B40-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For secretory expression, the integrative plasmid pPICZαA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used, which has the AOX1 promoter fused to the pre-pro-factor (encoding the signal peptide to the secretion pathway) and a Zeocin™ resistance marker for transforming yeast selection. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> TOP10F was used for cloning and replication of constructs.
