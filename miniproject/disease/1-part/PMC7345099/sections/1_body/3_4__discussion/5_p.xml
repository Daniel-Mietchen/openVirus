<p>As surmised, 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> yeast acted on the protein structure with post-translational modifications, since the amino acid chains encoded by the optimized sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00379-f001">Figure 1</xref>B–E) would present approximately 40 kDa without the addition of glycans. This observation can be directly related to the improved detection of antibodies by the glycosylated recombinant proteins, which, because they are correctly folded, are recognized by antibodies acting against the dengue NS1 protein specific to the conformational epitope, already reported in human biological samples [

 <xref rid="B78-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In the 192 samples tested, we obtained 85–91% sensitivity and 91–93% specificity using IgM as a target, and 83–87% sensitivity and 81–93% specificity for anti-dengue IgG (
