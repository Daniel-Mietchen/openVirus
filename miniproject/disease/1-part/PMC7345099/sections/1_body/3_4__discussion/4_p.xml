<p>Densitometry, made from the SDS-PAGE results to quantify the expression of the recombinant proteins during induction days, confirmed that the amount of recombinant protein was at its greatest on the sixth day of induction. The recombinant protein concentration in the BMM induction medium increased as a function of time, while the yeast was in the exponential growth stage. From the sixth day onward, yeast enters into a stationary phase (which precedes the phase of death), and as a consequence its metabolism is reduced and the production of recombinant proteins decreases. A Western blot of the four proteins (NS1DENV1–4) was made using anti-dengue positive human serum. The protein identity was revealed by a nitrocellulose membrane immunostaining for each recombinant

From the Schiff reagent, a staining method was developed to detect isoforms of glycoproteins after electrophoresis by the purple-magenta color in the membrane [

 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>. The stained bands were observed at the same time in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, Western blotting, and PAS. The estimated molecular weight of the proteins, based on molecular markers, was around 45 kDa. The bands stained with anti-dengue antibodies in the Western blot revealed a subtle characteristic that is very common in protein with a glycosylation site; when expressed in a heterologous form, more than one band is revealed. This result suggests that the lower band refers to the non-glycosylated or a reduced glycosylation form of the recombinant protein. This phenomenon was addressed in the recent work by Wang and Rong [
 <xref rid="B75-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] that characterized glycosylation in 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>. They demonstrated the presence of two parallel bands of the same protein with and without glycosylation. Falgout and Chanock [
 <xref rid="B76-diagnostics-10-00379" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] revealed the existence of the NS1 protein of the dengue virus in more than one way, related to different glycosylation patterns.
