<p>In this work, we produced the NS1 proteins of the four dengue viruses in 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> yeast as an inexpensive alternative to producing the antigen as an input to the manufacture of diagnostic kits. In the first step, the genes were optimized for expression in yeast, and the objectives were reached, with results showing that 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> is a good heterologous host and worked for the production of NS1DENV1–4 recombinant proteins. Easy to grow and quick to produce, the yeast secreted ready-to-use proteins, with a final yield estimated at 2.8–4.6 milligrams per liter of culture. These values are in agreement with the yield of other works expressing protein in
