<p>The NS1 protein (the focus of this work) is the most relevant dengue molecular marker in the development of diagnostic methodologies. The study of new molecular diagnostic tests and disease detection are focused on providing better understanding in case management and more effective and faster clinical evaluation of patients in critical regions. The symptoms that characterize dengue are nonspecific and easily confused with other febrile diseases, so the definitive diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation. Disease outbreaks occur in many regions with poor populations and limited conditions of public health care. Therefore, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic tools are essential for the care, surveillance, investigation, and control of outbreaks [
