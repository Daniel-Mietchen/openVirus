<p>Tests for the detection of anti-dengue antibodies in serum samples are widely used, especially in underdeveloped countries, due to ease of use when compared to other techniques such as viral RNA detection. In primary infections with DENV, the IgM response has higher titers and is more specific than during subsequent infections. In contrast, the IgG titer is higher in repeat infections. Several IgM and IgG ELISA kits are commercially available, with sensitivity ranges of 21–99% and 8–89%, respectively, and specificities varying from 52% to 100% for IgM and from 63% to 100% for IgG, compared to ELISA tests, which are considered the gold standard. In non-endemic regions, IgM-based tests can be used in clinical surveillance with high probability of positive results to indicate recent infections (during the previous 2 to 3 months) [
