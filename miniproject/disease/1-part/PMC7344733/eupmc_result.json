    "BACKGROUND:Currently, the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines is assessed by detecting an increase of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. As neuraminidase (NA)-based immunity may be significant in protecting against influenza infection, detection of neuraminidase inhibiting (NI) antibodies may improve the assessment of the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines. METHODS:We investigated the immune response to NA in people after immunization with live influenza vaccines (LAIVs). A number of A/H7NX or A/H6NX viruses were used to detect NI antibodies, using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS:Seasonal LAIV immunization stimulated an increase in NI antibodies not only to homologous A/H1N1 influenza, but also to A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H5N1 influenza. After A/17/California/09/38 (H1N1) pdm09 LAIV vaccination, there was no statistical relationship between post-vaccinated antibody seroconversion and two surface glycoproteins in serum samples obtained from the same individuals (p = 0.24). Vaccination with LAIV of H5N2, H2N2, H7N3, and H7N9 subtypes led to 7%-29.6% NI antibody seroconversions in the absence of HI antibody conversions. There was relatively low coordination of hemagglutinin (HA) and NA antibody responses (r = 0.24-0.59). CONCLUSIONS:The previously noted autonomy for HI and NI immune responses was confirmed when assessing the immunogenicity of LAIVs. Combining the traditional HI test with the detection of NI antibodies can provide a more complete assessment of LAIV immunogenicity."
