<p>Despite the fact that the NA of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H5N1 strains differs in antigenic properties and structure, this protein catalyzes the same enzymatic reaction of the destruction of the α-ketoside bond of N-acetylneuraminic acid. Influenza virus NA is one of the most characterized sialidases; the spatial structure of the NA of several subtypes of influenza A virus and the only subtype of influenza B virus is known, and the mechanisms of the enzyme’s action and the consequences of its inhibition have been well-studied. The active center of the enzyme contains a conservative sequence of 12 amino acids located in the center of each of the four subunits deep in the receptor pocket, the walls and environment of which are also formed by amino acids that are conserved in animal and human influenza A viruses of various subtypes, as well as influenza B viruses. NA has often been seen as a target for antiviral therapy, and has been much less studied in the context of vaccine antigens.</p>
