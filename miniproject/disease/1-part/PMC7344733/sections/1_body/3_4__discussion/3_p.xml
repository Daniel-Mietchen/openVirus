<p>In 2009, the WHO announced the emergence of a new influenza pandemic caused by the influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus, which had not previously been isolated from humans or animals [

Unlike previous seasonal epidemics, an unusually severe disease was often observed among young and middle-aged people, while older people suffered the pandemic relatively easily. In this regard, immediately after the announcement of the pandemic, studies of the immune status against influenza viruses in various populations began [
 <xref rid="B33-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It was revealed that, even a year after the spread of the pandemic strain, most people did not have HI antibodies to the A/H1N1pdm09 virus at “protective” levels of ≥1:40. At the same time, a number of studies have shown that some people have cross-reacting antibodies to the NA of influenza viruses with new HA subtypes, resulting from contacts with previously circulating variants [

 <xref rid="B34-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This may be significant in reducing mortality and limiting the spread of the virus in the event of a new pandemic. Recently, it was shown that preexisting NA-specific antibodies detected in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a titer of ≥1:40 significantly reduced the duration of seasonal influenza A virus shedding in adults [

As was demonstrated, the people born during the circulation of the viruses A/H2N2 and A/H3N2, in the 1960s to 1970s, showed the lowest level of cross-reacting antibodies to the NA of the N1 subtype [
