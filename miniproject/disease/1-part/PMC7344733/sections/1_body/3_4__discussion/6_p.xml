<p>We demonstrated an increase in the titers of NI antibodies to A/H5N1 virus, not only in patients with an increased level of NI antibodies to the H1N1/2009pdm09 influenza virus, but also when vaccinated with a seasonal LAIV. These data confirm the cross-reactive properties of the NA of the N1 subtype, not only after infection, but also following vaccination with LAIV.</p>
