<p>The protective role of serum antibodies to the NA of influenza viruses was discovered in the 1970s. During the outbreak of Hong Kong influenza in 1968, the frequency of infection with the A/H3N2 virus and the number of patients with severe clinical symptoms were inversely related to the level of antibodies to N2, which was estimated even before the start of the circulation of the new subtype strain [

In animal experiments, it was demonstrated that double immunization of NA in the form of a purified or recombinant antigen, followed by infection with a drift variant of a virus with an NA of the same subtype, reduced viral reproduction in the lungs of mice by up to 1000 times, preventing deaths [
