<p>The absence of antibodies to the A/H7N9 influenza virus among people aged 18â€“49 indicates their susceptibility to infection, and the need for vaccination in the event of a pandemic threat. Despite the fact that, to other viruses, when there were no HI antibodies, a level of pre-existing antibodies to NA was detected, even to the N3 subtype, which had not previously been registered as in circulation, no preexisting NI antibodies against N9 were detected. This may be because of such features of N9 as an additional sialic acid binding site [
 <xref rid="B36-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. When vaccinating volunteers with a prototype of A/H7N9 LAIV, the HA of the vaccine strain acted as an immunodominant antigen. However, the low degree of coincidence of the serum immune response to the two surface influenza antigens indicates the need to use ELLA to more fully characterize the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines.
