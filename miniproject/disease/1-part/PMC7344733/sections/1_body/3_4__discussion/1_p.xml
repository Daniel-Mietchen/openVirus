<p>LAIVs against seasonal influenza are harmless and cause persistent homologous responses to wild-type influenza viruses [

Although licensed influenza vaccines are primarily designed to provide homotypic protection, studies show that immunization with influenza vaccines or natural infections with seasonal influenza A strains induce serum cross-reactive antibodies to antigenically different variants of viruses [

 <xref rid="B27-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Traditionally, the assessment of the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines is carried out by assessing the level of serum antibodies to the main antigenic component of the virus, the HA. The study of antibodies to influenza NA is useful when influenza viruses with new HAs appear in circulation, and the population is not immune to these subtypes. Enzyme-linked lectin assay is the simplest and least costly method of determining NA-inhibiting antibodies. To avoid non-specific reactions with antibodies to influenza A, viruses of subtype H7 and H6 are used as a source of HA [
