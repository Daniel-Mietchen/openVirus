<p>A number of LAIVs developed against pandemic and potentially pandemic influenza viruses have effectively elicited an immune response in the seronegative population. After double immunization, an increase in inhibition of the hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activity of influenza viruses, as assessed by post-vaccination sera, was revealed. Combining the traditional HI test with the detection of NI antibodies can provide a more complete assessment of the LAIV immunogenicity. NI antibodies to N1 have a certain degree of cross-reactivity against antigenically distant strains. Low preexisting NI antibodies against newly emerged influenza viruses may indicate a high-risk population for priority vaccination.</p>
