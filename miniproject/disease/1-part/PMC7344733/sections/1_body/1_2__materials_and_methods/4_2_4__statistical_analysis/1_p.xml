<p>Data were analyzed using Statistica software, version 6.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). Antibody levels were presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs). For statistical analysis, antibody titers were expressed as log2 inverse final dilutions. Comparisons of two independent groups were carried out using the non-parametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov two-sample test. To compare several independent groups, we used the Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by multiple pairwise comparisons based on the Kruskal–Wallis sums of ranks. Comparisons of two dependent variables were performed using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. Fisher’s exact two-tailed test was carried out in the case of nominal variables. A nonparametric measure of the statistical relationship between the two variables was performed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r). A
