<p>Additionally, we tested the archive serum samples collected in the fall of 2010 and 2011 from routine tests, as well as the sera from patients of the Institute for Experimental Medicine Medical Research Center collected in the 2016, and the paired sera from influenza convalescents provided by the Institute of Influenza. The patients were fully informed of the research procedures and any risks associated with participation, and consented to participate in these scientific projects. None of the authors collected any of the samples used in the study, or had access to the confidential information of patients; data were anonymized before being made available to the authors. The sera were stored frozen at −20 °C until testing. Following obtaining the approval from the Local Ethics Committee in the Institute of Experimental Medicine, No. 3/17 of 30 November 2017, these sera were provided for serological tests.</p>
