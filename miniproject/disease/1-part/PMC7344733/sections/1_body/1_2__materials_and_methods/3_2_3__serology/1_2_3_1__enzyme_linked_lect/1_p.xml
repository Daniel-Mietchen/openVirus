<p>We evaluated NI antibodies using ELLA as previously described [
 <xref rid="B18-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) were coated overnight with 150 μL of 50 μg/mL fetuin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Then, 60 μL of sera was heated at 56 °C for 30′, serially diluted in phosphate buffered saline with bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA), and incubated with an equal volume of pre-diluted virus for 30′ at 37 °C. After incubation, 100 μL of the mixture was layered on the fetuin-coated wells. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the plates were rinsed, and NA activity was estimated by incubating with peroxidase-labeled peanut lectin (2.5 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing and then adding 100 μL of peroxidase substrate 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The reaction was terminated after 5 min with 100 μL of 1 N sulfuric acid. The optical density (OD) values were measured at 450 nm using the universal microplate reader (ELx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The titer of serum NI antibodies was determined as the reciprocal dilution of the sample with 50% inhibition of NA activity. A twofold increase in the titer of NI antibodies after vaccination was considered significant.
