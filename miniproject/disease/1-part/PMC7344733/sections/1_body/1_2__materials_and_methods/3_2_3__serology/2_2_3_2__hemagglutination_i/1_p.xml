<p>The HI test with blood sera was carried out using a 0.75% suspension of human red blood cells (Group “0”) in “U”-bottom 96-well polymer plates, using previously published procedures [
 <xref rid="B19-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The investigated sera were treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) which is an extract of Vibrio cholerae NA (Denka Seiken Co., Tokyo, Japan) and heated at 56 °C for 30 min, and then tested in duplicate for HI antibodies with the test vaccine antigens starting from 1:5 or 1:10 initial serum dilutions. The titers of HI antibodies were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which HI was observed. A fourfold increase in the titer of HI antibodies after vaccination was considered significant.
