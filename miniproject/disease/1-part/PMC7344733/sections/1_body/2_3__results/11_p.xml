<p>In the next part of the study, we analyzed the cross-reactive properties of antibodies after immunization with seasonal trivalent LAIV. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibodies-09-00020-f002">Figure 2</xref>a demonstrates that immunization of volunteers who were 18â€“20 years old with seasonal LAIV (2005 year of formulation) containing the A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) vaccine strain stimulated an increase in NI antibodies, not only to homologous seasonal A/H1N1 influenza virus, but also to the antigenically distinct variants A/California/7/09 (H1N1)pdm09 and A/Vietnam/1203/04(H5N1). Antibody levels to the A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) influenza virus to some extent correlated with titers of the pandemic strain A/H1N1pdm09 (rs = 0.60; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 56; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and avian A/H5N1 influenza virus (rs = 0.46; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 56; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
