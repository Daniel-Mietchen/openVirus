<p>Interestingly, before the start of A/H1N1pdm09 circulation, only 7.1% of examined persons had A/California/7/09(H1N1)pdm09-specific NI antibodies, which obviously were cross-reacting antibodies caused by contacts with previously circulating A/H1N1 strains. However, after the pandemic virus entered circulation, the titers of NI antibodies increased not only against A/H1N1pdm09, but also for the NA of the A/Vietnam/1203/04(H5N1) avian influenza virus. In 2011, 46% of the examined volunteers had cross-reacting NI antibodies to A/Vietnam/1203/04(H5N1), compared with 16% in 2005 (

From 2009, A/California/7/09(H1N1)pdm09-like viruses circulated, which, from 2010 to 2016, were consistently included in vaccines. Not surprisingly, the level of collective immunity to A/California/7/09(H1N1)pdm09 was, by 2016, significantly higher than that to A/South Africa/3626/13(H1N1)pdm09. It was shown that, in the 2015–2016 epidemic season, the levels of NI antibodies ≥1:40 to A/California/7/09(H1N1)pdm09 amounted to about 30% [
