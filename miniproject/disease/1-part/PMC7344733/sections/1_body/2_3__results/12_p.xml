<p>The phylogenetic analysis of NA amino acid sequences of avian A/H5N1 and epidemic and pandemic A/H1N1pdm09 influenza strains demonstrated the higher homology between amino acid sequences of H5N1/2004 and H1N1/pdm09 NA than between NAs of avian A/H5N1 and epidemic A/H1N1 viruses, which had circulated before 2008 (87.9% vs. 82.6%) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibodies-09-00020-f002">Figure 2</xref>c shows the titers of NI antibodies to the H5N1/2004 virus among volunteers examined in 2011; that is, after the pandemic A/H1N1pdm09 influenza virus entered circulation. The mean NI anti-H5N1/2004 antibody titer among subjects who were positive to H1N1/2009pdm, according to NI assay, was 4.5-fold higher than that among seronegative volunteers.
