<p>The levels of NI antibodies against the NA of different subtypes were variable (
 <xref rid="antibodies-09-00020-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The highest antibody levels before vaccination were detected for the NA of N1 and N2 subtypes; that is, for viruses that have been in circulation for a long time. At the same time, the level of antibodies in the A/H5N2 vaccine strain’s NA, which was derived from a donor strain of A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2), was low. Differences in anti-N2 antibody titers for A/H5N2 and A/H2N2 before vaccination can be explained by the fact that, between 1957 and 1968, the NA of A/H2N2 viruses acquired 21 amino acid substitutions in the enzymatically active and antigenic regions of the globular head [

The increase in geometric mean titers of NI antibodies after vaccination was 1.2–2.4. Like the increase in HI antibodies, the increase in antibodies to the NA of vaccine strains was statistically significant (
