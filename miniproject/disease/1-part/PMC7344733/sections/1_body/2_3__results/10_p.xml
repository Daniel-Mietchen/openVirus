<p>There has been relatively low coordination of HA and NA antibody responses (r = 0.24â€“0.59) in clinical studies of LAIVs. These data confirm the previously obtained data on NI antibodies as independent indicators of influenza immunity, other than hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies [
 <xref rid="B25-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the case of immunization with the A/17/Anhui/2013/61 (H7N9) LAIV, there was no increase in NI without the development of an antibody response to HA, despite the absence of anti-N9 antibodies before vaccination. Thus, in this case, the HA acted as an immunodominant antigen.
