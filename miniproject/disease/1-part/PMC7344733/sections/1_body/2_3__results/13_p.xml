<p>To compare the levels of NI antibodies after LAIV vaccination and infection, we analyzed the NI antibody content in patients with confirmed influenza A infection, and recipients of A/17/California/09/38 (H1N1)pdm09 LAIV with fourfold or more HI antibody rises. It was shown that on day 6â€“8 after onset of infection, the levels of NI antibodies were significantly higher than at the beginning of the disease (
