<p>According to the HI test and ELLA, the initial immunological status of the vaccine and placebo groups of volunteers did not differ (Mann–Whitney U test,

Pre-vaccination HI antibody titers to new vaccine strains did not exceed the lower detection limits of the HI method, which was determined by the initial serum dilution (1:5–1:10). Revaccination was carried out 21 or 28 days after the first vaccination; the same period after revaccination, blood serum was collected [
