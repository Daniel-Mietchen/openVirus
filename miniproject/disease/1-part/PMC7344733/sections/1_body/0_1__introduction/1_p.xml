<p>The determination of antibodies that inhibit neuraminidase (NA) in the influenza virus (the genus 
 <italic>Influenzavirus</italic>, the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>) is of interest to science and for clinical practice. It can be used when examining the levels of collective immunity to new influenza viruses, and for assessing the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="B1-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines is assessed by detecting an increase of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. As NA-based immunity may be significant in protection against a new antigenic variant of an influenza virus, detection of neuraminidase inhibiting (NI) antibodies may improve the study of the immunogenicity of newly developed influenza vaccines. In the present study, we investigated the formation of NI antibodies in people after immunization with live influenza vaccines (LAIVs) of pandemic and potentially pandemic subtypes. The World Health Organization has noted that it is important to develop new, or improve and standardize existing, methods for detecting the humoral immune response to NAs. NI antibodies are effective in limiting the spread, reducing the severity, or preventing the development of transferred diseases [

However, a lack of experimental and clinical data in this specific area makes it difficult to quantify the protective efficacy of these antibodies and, therefore, to develop criteria for the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine assessment based on the evaluation of NI antibodies. To obtain reassortant influenza A vaccine viruses, a cold-adapted “master donor strain” (MDS) A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2) is currently used [
 <xref rid="B2-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For the production of type B vaccine strains, MDS B/USSR/60/69 [
 <xref rid="B3-antibodies-09-00020" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] is used. The seasonal vaccine viruses A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B have a 6:2 genome composition; that is, they acquire six genes of internal and non-structural proteins from MDS, and two genes of surface glycosylated proteins— hemagglutitin (HA) and NA—from epidemic influenza viruses.
