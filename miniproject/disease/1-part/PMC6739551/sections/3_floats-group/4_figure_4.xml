  <p>Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the S gene segment of Benin Republic Lassa sequences in comparison with selected Lassa sequences from Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone by the maximum likelihood method, Lagos, Nigeria, March 2018. The numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values. Isolates in green boxes are from the Benin Republic. The isolate in the red box is the positive control of the assay. Lineage I covers the 1969 Lassa LP strain while Lineage II covers strains from Lagos, the eastern states of Nigeria such as the Onitsha strain in 1974, Abakaliki, Irrua, the middle belt and the few northeast central states in Nigeria; Lineage III covers the NIG-CSF-Jos 2000 strain, the western states and northwestern states strains such as GA392 in Zaria, Nigeria; Lineages IV/V cover the Josiah strain of Sierra Leone, and the Liberian strain.</p>
