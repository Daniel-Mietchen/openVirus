  <p>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detection of Dengue virus, Lagos, Nigeria, March 2018. The gel lanes represent neat (undiluted, N) and 1:10 dilutions (D) of the RNA extracts used. Three Nigerian outbreak samples representing lanes S1–S3 (accession numbers: MF317933-35) were run alongside Benin Republic outbreak samples (S4–S5). RNase/DNase free water was used as negative extraction control (-VE CTRL) while a tissue culture inactivated sample of Dengue virus from the Virology Unit Laboratory of the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine, Germany was used as a positive control (+VE CTRL).</p>
