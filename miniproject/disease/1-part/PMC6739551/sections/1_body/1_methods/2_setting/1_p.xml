<p>In 2014, a Lassa fever outbreak was reported for the first time in the Tanguiéta and Cobly communes, Atakora Department, north-west Benin Republic. The chain of infection stemmed from a woman who died from Lassa fever 2 days after the delivery of a baby girl. The baby girl took ill 2 weeks after birth and was cared for at Hôpital de Saint Jean de Dieu, where the outbreak was enhanced by nosocomial transmission and eventual transmission within the community. Within a period of 2 weeks (15 October to 04 November), 16 suspected cases with signs and symptoms of VHF and two laboratory confirmed cases, with a case fatality of 56.3%, were recorded in the country in 2014. This included the deaths of four personnel at the healthcare facility with signs and symptoms of VHF. Due to the high case fatality rate within a short period of time, an alarm for the possible outbreak of the Ebola virus was sounded by the health authorities in the Benin Republic. However, all samples were negative for the Ebola virus; LASV was detected instead.</p>
