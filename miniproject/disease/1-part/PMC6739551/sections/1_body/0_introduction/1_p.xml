 </sup> The original LASV strain was isolated in 1969 from a missionary nurse involved in a nosocomial transmission chain from an obstetrical to patient residing in Lassa village, Maiduguri, now Borno state, in Nigeria, who travelled and sought treatment at the Evangel Hospital in Jos, Plateau state, for a septic abortion.
