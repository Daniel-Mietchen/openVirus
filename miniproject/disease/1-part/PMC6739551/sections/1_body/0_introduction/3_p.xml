 </sup> The isolation of the virus from the forest dwelling 
 <italic>Hylomyscus pamfi</italic> and ubiquitous 
 <italic>Mastomys erythroleucus</italic> highlights emerging evidence regarding the complexity of the virusâ€™ ecology. The findings add to the growing probability of the emergence of LASV in new environments other than where it currently exists in the West African region.

 </sup> This is cause for concern regarding the changing epidemiology of LASV within the African continent.
