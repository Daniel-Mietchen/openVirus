<p>This study confirms the presence of the Lassa virus in the Benin Republic, with 2 isolates having molecular epidemiological links with Lineage-II strains from Nigeria. Large-scale outbreaks of Lassa fever have been reported from Nigeria since 2015 with a frequent and widening geographical spread.

 </sup> Neighbouring countries are also at risk, because the types of rodents that harbour and spread the virus are found throughout the West African sub-region.

 </sup> The Lassa fever virus has been endemic in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia for decades; however, proven and imported cases have been reported in Ghana, the Central African Republic, Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal, Mali and Togo.

 </sup> The Benin Republic reported the first few cases of confirmed Lassa fever as evident from our laboratory findings during the 2014–2016 outbreaks. It is in no doubt that Lassa fever is becoming a regular global health burden with immense impact on most of West Africa’s communities.

 </sup> The emergence of the virus in new communities may be attributed to changes in socio-ecological and climatic conditions, global travel and improved surveillance using molecular biology tools for rapid detection of viral nucleic acids.
