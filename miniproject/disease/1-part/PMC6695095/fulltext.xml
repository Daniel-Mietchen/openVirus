To elucidate the genetic contributions of the M segment to host adaptation, and the underlying mechanisms, we examined a panel of isogenic viruses that carry avian- or human-derived M segments. Avian, but not human, M segments restricted viral growth and transmission in mammalian model systems, and the restricted growth correlated with increased expression of M2 relative to M1. M2 overexpression was associated with intracellular accumulation of autophagosomes, which was alleviated by interference of the viral proton channel activity by amantadine treatment. As M1 and M2 are expressed from the M mRNA through alternative splicing, we separated synonymous and non-synonymous changes that differentiate human and avian M segments and found that dysregulation of gene expression leading to M2 overexpression diminished replication, irrespective of amino acid composition of M1 or M2. Moreover, in spite of efficient replication, virus possessing a human M segment that expressed avian M2 protein at low level did not transmit efficiently. We conclude that (i) determinants of transmission reside in the IAV M2 protein, and that (ii) control of M segment gene expression is a critical aspect of IAV host adaptation needed to prevent M2-mediated dysregulation of vesicular homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) pandemics arise when a virus adapted to a non-human host overcomes species barriers to successfully infect humans and sustain human-to-human transmission. To gauge the adaptive potential and therefore pandemic risk posed by a particular IAV, it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying viral adaptation to human hosts. Here, we focused on the role of one of IAV&#x02019;s eight gene segments, the M segment, in host adaptation. Comparing the growth of IAVs with avian- and human-derived M segments in avian and mammalian systems revealed that the avian M segment restricts viral growth specifically in mammalian cells. We show that the mechanism underlying this host range phenotype is a dysregulation of viral gene expression when the avian IAV M segment is transcribed in mammalian cells. In particular, excess production of the M2 protein results in viral interference with cellular functions on which the virus relies. Our results therefore reveal that the use of cellular machinery to control viral gene expression leaves the virus vulnerable to over- or under-production of critical viral gene products in a new host species.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Institutes of Health (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>HHSN272201400004C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1217-0990</contrib-id><name><surname>Steel</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease through the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) contract no.

IAV lineages endemic in humans are ultimately derived from those circulating in wild waterfowl. Sporadic transmission of IAV from avian reservoirs to humans occurs mainly through domesticated intermediate hosts such as chickens and pigs [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, infection of humans with H7N9 and H5N1 subtype IAVs occurs through direct exposure to infected poultry. Although they often cause severe disease, these zoonotic cases have not led to sustained onward transmission to date and have therefore not caused a pandemic. Despite abundant circulation of IAVs at the animal-human interface, pandemics occur only rarely owing to the host specificity of IAV infection. As with all viruses, IAV must exploit host cell functions and overcome antiviral barriers to execute its life cycle. Viral replication in a new host species therefore requires adaptation to re-establish virus-host interactions broken by species-specific features of host cellular processes. IAV can undergo such adaptation through reassortment of intact gene segments between avian IAVs and those already adapted to mammals or through more incremental changes brought about by polymerase error [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With the goal of anticipating and mitigating IAV emergence in humans, it is essential to understand the species-specific barriers to infection and the mechanisms by which IAV evolution allows these impediments to be overcome.</p><p>Changes to viral receptor specificity and polymerase function necessary to overcome host species barriers have been well documented [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but it is clear that additional features of avian IAVs restrict their growth in mammalian systems [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Seminal studies, performed in the 1970s, indicated a potential role for the M segment. Avian IAVs were shown to express low levels of M1 protein during abortive infection of mammalian cells, but not avian cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the limited quantity of viral particles formed during such abortive infections correlated with the amount of M1 protein expressed. Significantly, these studies were conducted prior to the identification of a second gene product expressed from a spliced form of the M segment mRNA: the M2 protein [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that low M1 expression during abortive avian IAV infection in mammalian cells was accompanied by increased M2 mRNA and protein expression, relative to productive infection in avian cells, leading to new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms leading to abortive outcomes [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Additional evidence for a role of the M segment in host range comes from the <italic>in silico</italic> identification of positive selection acting on the M segment of the Eurasian avian-like swine lineage, following transfer of this IAV from birds to swine [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, others and we have shown that the M segment of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) strain carries determinants of transmissibility, suggesting that adaptation of this segment to humans contributed to the emergence of the pH1N1 lineage [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The mechanistic basis for this contribution; the specific roles, if any, of M1 and M2 proteins to host range; and whether the M segment plays a broader role in IAV host adaptation, remain unclear.</p><p>It is now recognized that the M segment of IAV encodes the M1 matrix and the M2 proton channel proteins via alternative splicing (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007892.s001">S1A Fig</xref>)</bold> [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. M1 forms a structural layer under the viral envelope and is a major determinant of virion morphology [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Upon endocytosis of virus particles into cells, low pH and high [K+] trigger a conformational change in M1 required for release of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. M1 is also critical for the transport of newly replicated vRNPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. At late stages of infection, cytoplasmic M1 is thought to recruit vRNP complexes to the budding site [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>M2 is a transmembrane protein that tetramerizes to form a proton channel. Within the envelope of incoming virions, this channel allows diffusion of protons into the virion core, thereby triggering the release of vRNPs from M1, as well as facilitating the intracellular transport of HA protein [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. M2 also plays an important role in the final stages of virion morphogenesis, mediating ESCRT-independent membrane scission [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Importantly for the findings reported herein, multiple groups have reported that M2 blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Under normal conditions, this fusion event allows degradation and recycling of organelles and protein aggregates contained within autophagosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and is thus important for cellular homeostasis. M2-mediated interference with autolysosome formation therefore stalls autophagic flux and leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes within the cell [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Many elegant molecular virology studies have revealed that viral strategies for regulating gene expression are central to orchestration of the viral life cycle [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Here, we report that regulation of M2 expression of IAV is an important determinant of host range. In particular, our data show that the expression of M1 and M2 from alternatively spliced M segment mRNAs is dysregulated when an avian IAV replicates in mammalian cells, and that the resultant overexpression of the M2 proton channel attenuates viral growth by disrupting the cellular autophagy pathway. The observed block in autophagy is consistent with that reported previously for lab-adapted strains of IAV [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Importantly, however, we see that lab-adapted IAVs express M2 at high levels, comparable to those seen for avian IAV M segments in mammalian cells. In contrast, IAVs carrying M segments well adapted to mammalian systems express relatively little M2 and do not trigger the accumulation of autophagosomes to the same extent as avian-origin and lab-adapted strains. These findings suggest that IAV-induced stalling of autophagic turnover is a result of aberrantly high M2 expression upon infection of mammalian cells with avian IAVs, and which is overcome in human-adapted influenza A lineages. Critically, the mechanism leading to this host-restricted phenotype occurs at the level of gene expression and is driven by host-specific differences in viral nucleic acid sequence, not amino acid changes. This mechanism constitutes a novel paradigm in RNA virus host adaptation, and reveals a new species barrier for IAV, which may be highly relevant for the emergence of avian IAVs into humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Generation of isogenic IAVs differing only in the M segment</title><p>To assess the contribution of the M segment to host adaptation, we generated a panel of IAVs possessing human- or avian-derived M segments in the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) [PR8] background (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1007892.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007892.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007892.s001">S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007892.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref></bold>).

To test whether M2 expression from avian vs. human M segments has differential effects on autophagy, we first evaluated the level of LC3B lipidation in PR8 NL09 M- and PR8 avian M-infected cells. Upon activation of the autophagy pathway, LC3B is modified through the addition of phosphotidylethanolamine [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This lipidated form, called LC3B II, remains associated with the membranes of maturing and mature autophagosomes. Thus, increased levels of LC3B II in the cell are indicative of autophagosome formation; however, under normal conditions LC3B I and II are cycled through an autophagic flux which involves autophagosome maturation and degradation via fusion with lysosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

When transcribed within mammalian cells, avian IAV M segments gave rise to abundant mRNA<sub>10</sub> and correspondingly high levels of the encoded M2 proton channel. Comparison to matched virus-host systems indicated that this M2 expression profile was an aberrant feature of avian IAV replication in mammalian cells. When present at high levels, M2 had marked effects on the infected cell, blocking the turnover of autophagic vesicles and redirecting LC3B II, the activated form of a critical autophagy mediator, to the plasma membrane. These effects were found to rely on the proton channel activity of M2 and occurred when either the avian or human M2 protein was overexpressed in infected cells. Importantly, the reduction in viral growth conferred by avian M segments in mammalian systems could be attributed at least in part to disruption of vesicular homeostasis and was fully attributed to the altered expression levels of M1 and M2. Thus, our data identify the regulation of viral gene expression as a novel host-dependent feature of the IAV lifecycle that contributes to the host range restriction of this virus (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007892.g016">Fig 16</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="ppat.1007892.g016" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007892.g016</object-id><label>Fig 16</label><caption><title>Regulation of M segment gene expression contributes to host range restriction of IAV.</title><p>When an avian IAV M segment is transcribed within mammalian cells, excessive splicing of mRNA<sub>7</sub> results in aberrant overexpression of the M2 proton channel. When highly expressed, this channel accumulates in autophagic vesicles. Abundant proton channel activity in the membranes of autophagosomes blocks their turnover by preventing fusion with lysosomes. This stalling of a critical cellular housekeeping function in turn reduces the efficiency of viral replication, contributing to the species barrier that limits the zoonotic potential of avian IAVs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1007892.g016"/></fig><p>Quantification of IAV encoded mRNAs within infected cells indicated that overexpression of M2 from avian IAV M segments stems from over-production of the corresponding mRNA. M2 is encoded by the mRNA<sub>10</sub> transcript, which is generated through splicing of the M1 message, mRNA<sub>7</sub> [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, regulation of M2 gene expression is intimately linked to the cellular splicing machinery. Our data indicate that this is a finely balanced interaction between IAV and its host cell, which is susceptible to disruption upon transfer to new species. In this regard, it is notable that the M segment splice donor and acceptor sites are identical between the human and avian IAVs examined. M segment sequences outside of these canonical splice sites have, however, been shown to modulate splicing efficiency [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Interestingly, mRNA<sub>7</sub> association with mammalian SF2/ASF [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and with mammalian hnRNPK and NS1-binding protein [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], have been shown to alter the efficiency of splicing. Nucleotide differences in these binding regions exist between human- and avian-adapted M segments. An interesting area of further investigation will be to test whether there are differences in the binding of human and avian mRNA<sub>7</sub> molecules to mammalian SF2/ASF, hnRNPK, and NS1-binding proteins.</p><p>The gene segments of IAVs circulating in humans are ultimately derived from the avian IAV gene pool. Thus, the contrasting phenotypes conferred by avian- and human-adapted M segments in mammalian cells suggest that a resetting of M segment gene expression to reduce M2 levels has been positively selected following emergence of avian IAVs into mammalian populations. Indeed, our data reveal that this adaptation has occurred in at least two independent incidences: i) within the Eurasian avian-like swine lineage M, that emerged from birds in the late 1970s and contributed the M segment to the pH1N1 virus prior to 2009; and ii) within the human seasonal lineage derived from the 1918 pandemic, which contributed its M segment to the H3N2 lineage represented by Pan99 virus. The timing of the adaptive changes is unclear in each case and cannot be inferred from our data. Importantly, M2 expression in human IAV mimics that of avian IAV in avian cells. Thus, restriction of splicing efficiency to achieve low M2 levels appears to be an important feature of IAV host adaptation. Our data furthermore suggest that the negative impact of an autophagy block on viral growth constitutes an important pressure driving this selection.</p><p>To date, most publications related to autophagy in IAV-infected cells have used the PR8 or WSN lab-adapted strains, the X31 variant of PR8, or avian IAVs [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We found that PR8 virus expresses levels of M2 in mammalian cells that are comparable with avian IAVs. This phenotype may be a result of adaptation to growth in chicken eggs. Owing to the use of viruses carrying lab-adapted M segments, the current literature suggests that IAV infection routinely induces a block in autophagy [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We also see evidence of such a block when using viruses that express high levels of M2, but we propose that this phenotype is a symptom of poor adaptation to the mammalian host cell. Analysis of viruses carrying human M segments in mammalian cells suggests that low levels of M2 and activation, but not blocking, of autophagy are the norm in IAV-infected cells.</p><p>While the previously reported block in autophagy induced by IAV has generally been interpreted as a viral defense against an antiviral mechanism, a pro-viral role for autophagy is not without precedent. In Dengue virus infection, autophagy has been reported to support viral replication. Specifically, autophagic turnover of lipid droplets in infected cells is thought to provide energy needed for viral growth and to supply phospholipids important during virion assembly [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. For IAV, the availability of activated LC3B protein was reported to be important for viral morphogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Specifically, M2 was implicated in recruitment of LC3B II to the plasma membrane, and disruption of this recruitment was found to affect budding and reduce stability of released virions [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We also noted strong redistribution of LC3B-GFP to the plasma membrane during infection with viruses that express high levels of M2. This relocalization occurred to a lesser extent in a well-matched IAV-host system (NL09 M in human cells), and may play a functionally important role in this context. A role for LC3B II in morphogenesis is consistent with the activation of autophagy having a pro-viral effect. Conversely, our data indicate that a block in autophagic turnover reduces viral growth, potentially owing to disruption of vesicular trafficking that is normally exploited by the virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], or due to disruption of cellular metabolic functions on which the virus relies.</p><p>By inhibiting the proton channel activity of the avian M2 with amantadine, we found that a functional channel is needed to bring about the observed effects on autophagy. Indeed, M2 has been shown previously to block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes in a proton channel-dependent fashion [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Surprisingly, however, amantadine treatment was also found to reduce LC3B II accumulation in PR8 NL09 M-infected cells. The pH1N1 M2 protein carries the S31N mutation, which confers resistance to amantadine. Our data suggest that this resistance is not effective at a relatively high concentration of 200 &#x003bc;M amantadine, at least in the context of intracellular viral infection.</p><p>The mutagenesis of the M segment that we carried out with the goal of separating the effects of M2 expression level from M2 amino acid sequence revealed an important constraint on M1 coding capacity. Namely, the human / avian amino acid polymorphisms introduced into the M1 ORF were found to impact regulation of M2 gene expression. Some or all of these non-synonymous changes to M1 likely modulate the efficiency of mRNA<sub>7</sub> splicing. With this new insight in mind, a fresh look at viral phenotypes previously attributed to M1 amino acid variations is warranted. Effects of M1 amino acid sequence on virion morphology [<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], for example, may in fact be directly or indirectly mediated through changes in intracellular M2 expression level.</p><p>Notably, while an avian M2 protein was sufficient to support robust viral replication in mammalian systems when expressed at low levels, this sufficiency did not extend to transmission. Virus expressing the avian M2 from a human M segment transmitted poorly, indicating that the IAV M2 carries viral determinants of transmission and that these determinants are not well conserved between avian and human strains. This novel observation also supports the notion that high replicative capacity of a virus in a given host species is not necessarily sufficient for transmission between individuals. In this context, it will be interesting to evaluate the impact of avian M2 amino acid signatures on virion stability in the environment.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that adaptive change in the M segment is needed to maintain low expression of M2 in mammalian cells and that, in the absence of such adaptive changes, excess M2 limits viral growth by blocking the autophagy pathway. These findings establish regulation of viral gene expression as a feature of the virus-host interface critical for IAV host range determination and therefore emergence into novel host populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec017"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Emory University approved the study protocol under approval number PROTO201700595.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Cells</title><p>Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (a kind gift of Peter Palese, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) were maintained in minimal essential medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin.

Thus, the amino acid composition of M1 and M2 proteins are highly conserved within wild waterfowl, particularly within isolates that circulate among dabbling ducks and geese.
