<p>The mutagenesis of the M segment that we carried out with the goal of separating the effects of M2 expression level from M2 amino acid sequence revealed an important constraint on M1 coding capacity. Namely, the human / avian amino acid polymorphisms introduced into the M1 ORF were found to impact regulation of M2 gene expression. Some or all of these non-synonymous changes to M1 likely modulate the efficiency of mRNA
 <sub>7</sub> splicing. With this new insight in mind, a fresh look at viral phenotypes previously attributed to M1 amino acid variations is warranted. Effects of M1 amino acid sequence on virion morphology [
