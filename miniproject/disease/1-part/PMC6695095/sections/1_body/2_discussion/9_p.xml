<p>In summary, our data suggest that adaptive change in the M segment is needed to maintain low expression of M2 in mammalian cells and that, in the absence of such adaptive changes, excess M2 limits viral growth by blocking the autophagy pathway. These findings establish regulation of viral gene expression as a feature of the virus-host interface critical for IAV host range determination and therefore emergence into novel host populations.</p>
