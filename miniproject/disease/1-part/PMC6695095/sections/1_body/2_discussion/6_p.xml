<p>By inhibiting the proton channel activity of the avian M2 with amantadine, we found that a functional channel is needed to bring about the observed effects on autophagy. Indeed, M2 has been shown previously to block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes in a proton channel-dependent fashion [

The pH1N1 M2 protein carries the S31N mutation, which confers resistance to amantadine. Our data suggest that this resistance is not effective at a relatively high concentration of 200 Î¼M amantadine, at least in the context of intracellular viral infection.
