<p>Examination of LC3B lipidation by Western immunoblot analysis also revealed a clear correlation between M2 expression levels and those of LC3B II within infected cells (

 </bold>). Confocal images of 293T cells transduced with LC3B-GFP and infected with the chimeric viruses were consistent with these findings. As seen for wild-type avian M segments, high M2 expression again led to the accumulation of LC3B-GFP in perinuclear puncta and at the plasma membrane (
