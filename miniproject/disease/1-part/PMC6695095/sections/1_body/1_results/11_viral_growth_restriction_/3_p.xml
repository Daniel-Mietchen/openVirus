<p>Single-cycle growth analysis of the chimeric viruses in A549 cells revealed a strong correlation between M2 expression level and viral yields (

 </bold>). Notably, all viruses with the dkAlb76 M 89G-derived nucleic acid background, which express high levels of M2 protein, grew to approximately 10-fold lower titers than the PR8 NL09 M virus, despite expression of NL09 M1 and/or M2 proteins. In addition, the PR8 NL M 7mut virus, which expresses the human M1 and avian M2 proteins at levels typical of human-adapted strains, showed equivalent growth to that seen with the PR8 NL09 M virus, indicating that amino acid changes in M2 are not required for efficient replication in human cells. Notably, the PR8 Av M 9mut virus, which encodes identical M1 and M2 proteins as PR8 NL M 7mut virus (
