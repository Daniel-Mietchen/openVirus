 </bold>. Among the viruses with the NL09 M nucleic acid background, the PR8 NL M 16mut and PR8 NL M 9mut viruses both showed increased levels of M2 relative to the PR8 NL09 M virus control, indicating that all or some of the coding changes introduced into the M1 ORF impact regulation of M2 gene expression. The PR8 NL M 7mut virus showed similar M1 and M2 expression levels as the PR8 NL09 M control, however. This virus therefore expresses the avian consensus M2 protein at low levels. All viruses with the nucleic acid background of the avian M segment showed relatively high levels of M2, similar to those seen for the PR8 dkAlb76 M 89G virus control. Thus, in the avian nucleic acid background, we were able to fully separate M2 expression level from M2 and M1 amino acid sequence.
