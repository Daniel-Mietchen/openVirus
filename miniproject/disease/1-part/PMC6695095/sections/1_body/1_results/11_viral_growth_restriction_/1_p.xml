<p>To determine whether the observed effects of avian-origin M segments on the viral life cycle and the autophagy pathway are attributable to avian-adapted amino acid sequences or rather to the overexpression of the viral proton channel, we generated a series of chimeric M segments in which the coding changes found in the NL09 M segment were transferred to an avian-adapted RNA background, and vice versa. We introduced all 16 coding changes into M1 and M2 simultaneously, or introduced only the nine or seven changes into M1 or M2, respectively. The genotypes of this panel of six chimeric viruses are outlined in
