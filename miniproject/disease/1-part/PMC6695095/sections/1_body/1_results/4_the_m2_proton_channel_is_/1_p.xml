<p>To investigate the mechanism underlying the host-restricted phenotypes conferred by avian-adapted M segments, the steady state levels of the M1 and M2 proteins were evaluated in human A549 and avian DF-1 cells infected at high MOI. Western immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody E10, which recognizes the shared N-terminus of M1 and M2, was used to monitor levels of both proteins concurrently.</p>
