<p>To evaluate the contribution of IAV M2 ion channel activity to the observed stalling of autophagy in PR8 avian M virus-infected cells, we inhibited channel activity with amantadine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Amantadine was added at 1 hpi and the level of LC3B lipidation was assessed at 8 hpi in PR8 NL09 M and PR8 avian M virus-infected A549 cells. The timing of amantadine addition was designed to avoid disruption of the early function of M2 in delivery of the viral genome to the cytoplasm, but allow inhibition of M2 activity in autophagosomes.
