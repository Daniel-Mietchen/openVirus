<p>As a complementary approach to monitor the effects of amantadine, we again used overexpressed LC3B-GFP fusion protein in infected 293T cells at 12 hpi. Using confocal microscopy, we tracked LC3B-GFP localization in the presence and absence of the ion channel blocker. In line with the Western immunoblot analyses obtained in A549 cells, we saw that amantadine reduced the accumulation of LC3B-GFP within cytoplasmic puncta and at the plasma membrane of infected cells (
