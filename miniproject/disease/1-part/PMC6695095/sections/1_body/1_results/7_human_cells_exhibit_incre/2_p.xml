<p>Western immunoblot analysis of LC3B revealed decreased LC3B I and increased LC3B II protein levels in virus-infected cells compared to mock, providing evidence of autophagy activation and/or block during IAV infection of either avian or human cells (

 </bold>). In avian DF-1 cells, levels of LC3B I were slightly decreased and levels of LC3B II were slightly increased over mock, but LC3B I and LC3B II levels were generally comparable among human M- and avian M-containing viruses (
