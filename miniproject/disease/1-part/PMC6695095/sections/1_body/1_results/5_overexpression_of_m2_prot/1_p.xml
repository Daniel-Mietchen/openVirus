<p>The M segment vRNA is transcribed by the viral polymerase to give rise to a co-linear mRNA (mRNA
 <sub>7</sub>), which can be spliced by cellular splicing factors to yield mRNA
 <sub>10</sub> or mRNA
 <sub>11</sub> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The M1 protein is translated from the unspliced mRNA
 <sub>7</sub>, while M2 is expressed from the spliced mRNA
 <sub>10</sub>. To date, no polypeptide corresponding to the short mRNA
 <sub>11</sub> ORF has been identified. Aberrantly high levels of IAV mRNA
 <sub>10</sub> in mammalian cells have been previously reported for the avian IAV, fowl plague virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that the high expression levels of M2 protein, observed for avian-adapted M segments in human cells, was due to increased splicing of mRNA
 <sub>7</sub> to yield excessive mRNA
 <sub>10</sub>. We used a RT primer extension assay to quantify the levels of each M segment-derived mRNA species in DF-1 and A549 cells infected with either PR8 NL09 M virus or one of four viruses carrying an avian-adapted M segment.
