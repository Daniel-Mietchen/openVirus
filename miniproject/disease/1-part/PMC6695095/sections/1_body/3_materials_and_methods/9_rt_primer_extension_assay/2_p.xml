<p>Radiolabeling of primers: 1 μmol of oligo DNA primer was incubated with 10 μCuries of [γ-
 <sup>32</sup>P]ATP and 10 U of T4 PNK (New England Biolabs) in 70 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 10 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 5 mM DTT. Radiolabeling reactions were carried out at 37 ºC for 1 h and diluted to 30 μL with RNase-free water after termination of the reaction. Radiolabeled primers were stored at –20 ºC until needed. 500 ng of total RNA was incubated with 0.45 μL unlabeled 5S rRNA primer, 0.05 μL radiolabeled 5S rRNA primer, 0.25 μL radiolabeled IAV segment 7 vRNA primer, and 0.25 μL radiolabeled IAV segment 7 mRNA primer in a final volume of 5 μL. Primers were annealed to RNA by sequential incubations at 95 ºC for 3 min and ice for 3 min. Reactions were pre-warmed at 50 ºC for 5 min. Transcription was initiated by the addition of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) buffer containing 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCL2, 10 mM DTT, 2mM dNTP, and 50 units of SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reactions were incubated at 50 ºC for 1 h and terminated by the addition of Gel Loading Buffer II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubation at 95 ºC for 10 min. Reactions were resolved on denaturing sequencing polyacrylamide gels (7M urea, 6% acrylamide). Gels were subsequently dried and exposed to a phosphor storage screen overnight. The intensity of bands was analyzed using a Typhoon Trio Imager (GE Healthcare) and quantified with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) after normalization to 5S rRNA. At least three biological replicate viral infections were carried out, with two technical replicates of the RT primer extension assay for each infection. Data are shown with error bars representing SD and statistical analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons in GraphPad Prism software.
