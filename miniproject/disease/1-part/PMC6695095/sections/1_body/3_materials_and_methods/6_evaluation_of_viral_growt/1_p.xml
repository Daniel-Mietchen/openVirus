<p>To assess growth, subconfluent cell monolayers in 6-well dishes were inoculated at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell (for single-cycle growth assays) or 0.01 PFU/cell (for multi-cycle growth assays) in a 200 μl volume. Following incubation for 1 h at 37°C, inocula were removed, cells washed 3x with PBS and 2 ml viral growth medium (MEM (for MDCK cells), DMEM (for 293T, and DF1 cells), or F-12K (for A549, and QT-6 cells) medium plus 3% bovine serum albumin, penicillin streptomycin, and TPCK-treated trypsin) was added. Infected cells were incubated at 37°C for the remainder of the time-course. At the indicated time points, 120 μl medium was sampled from each dish and 120 μl fresh medium was added to maintain a 2 ml volume. Samples were stored at -80°C and later titered by plaque assay on MDCK cells. Each infection was performed in triplicate and at least three biological replicate infections were carried out on different days. Data are plotted as mean with SD and analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA.</p>
