<p>Female, Hartley strain, guinea pigs weighing 300–350 g were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Prior to inoculation or nasal lavage, animals were sedated with a mixture of ketamine (30 mg/kg) and xylazine (4 mg/kg). Virus used for inoculation was diluted in PBS to allow intranasal inoculation of guinea pigs with 1x10
 <sup>1</sup> to 1x10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU in a 300 μl volume. Nasal wash samples were collected as described previously [

Animals were housed in a Caron 6040 environmental chamber set to 10°C and 20% RH throughout the seven-day period and lids were left off of the cages during this time to ensure environmental control within the cages [
