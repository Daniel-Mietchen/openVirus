<p>A549 or DF-1 cells in 6-well plates were infected with the indicated IAVs and cells were lysed with 2X Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-rad) plus 2% beta-mercaptoethanol at 8 hpi. Samples were boiled at 95°C for 10 min and resolved on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-rad), and incubation of membranes with 5% non-fat dry milk/TBST blocking buffer. Antibodies used for immunoblotting were: anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody (catalog no. V9131; Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:5000 dilution, IAV nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody (HT-103; catalog no. EMS010, Kerafast) at 1:1000 dilution, IAV matrix protein monoclonal antibody (E10; catalog no. EMS009, Kerafast) at 1:1000 dilution, and LC3B polyclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 1:1000 dilution. Bands were quantified using ImageLab software (Bio-rad) after normalization to vinculin. At least three biological replicate viral infections were carried out, with two technical replicates of the immunoblotting for each infection. Data shown with error bars representing SD and statistical analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons in GraphPad Prism software.</p>
