<p>For each hemagglutinin subtype (H1Nx to H16Nx), we aligned the available sequences to generate individual consensus M1 and M2 amino acid sequences (

 </bold>), and aligned those consensus sequences to the avian H1N1 subtype consensus M1 and M2 sequences, in order to assess amino acid diversity. The matrix proteins of each subtype, with the exception of H9Nx, were 100% conserved. The H9Nx subtype matrix protein shared 97.6% identity to the avian H1N1 sequence. The M2 proteins of each subtype were 100% conserved, excepting H9Nx, H13Nx and H16Nx subtypes, which shared 97.2%, 94.8% and 93.8% identity respectively, to the avian H1N1 consensus sequence. Thus, the amino acid composition of M1 and M2 proteins are highly conserved within wild waterfowl, particularly within isolates that circulate among dabbling ducks and geese. In these host species, both M1 and M2 proteins are at, or close to, 100% identity at the consensus amino acid level.
