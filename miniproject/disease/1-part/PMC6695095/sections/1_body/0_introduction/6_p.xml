<p>Many elegant molecular virology studies have revealed that viral strategies for regulating gene expression are central to orchestration of the viral life cycle [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Here, we report that regulation of M2 expression of IAV is an important determinant of host range. In particular, our data show that the expression of M1 and M2 from alternatively spliced M segment mRNAs is dysregulated when an avian IAV replicates in mammalian cells, and that the resultant overexpression of the M2 proton channel attenuates viral growth by disrupting the cellular autophagy pathway. The observed block in autophagy is consistent with that reported previously for lab-adapted strains of IAV [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Importantly, however, we see that lab-adapted IAVs express M2 at high levels, comparable to those seen for avian IAV M segments in mammalian cells. In contrast, IAVs carrying M segments well adapted to mammalian systems express relatively little M2 and do not trigger the accumulation of autophagosomes to the same extent as avian-origin and lab-adapted strains. These findings suggest that IAV-induced stalling of autophagic turnover is a result of aberrantly high M2 expression upon infection of mammalian cells with avian IAVs, and which is overcome in human-adapted influenza A lineages. Critically, the mechanism leading to this host-restricted phenotype occurs at the level of gene expression and is driven by host-specific differences in viral nucleic acid sequence, not amino acid changes. This mechanism constitutes a novel paradigm in RNA virus host adaptation, and reveals a new species barrier for IAV, which may be highly relevant for the emergence of avian IAVs into humans.
