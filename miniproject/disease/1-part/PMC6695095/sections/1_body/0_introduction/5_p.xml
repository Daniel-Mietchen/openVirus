<p>M2 is a transmembrane protein that tetramerizes to form a proton channel. Within the envelope of incoming virions, this channel allows diffusion of protons into the virion core, thereby triggering the release of vRNPs from M1, as well as facilitating the intracellular transport of HA protein [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. M2 also plays an important role in the final stages of virion morphogenesis, mediating ESCRT-independent membrane scission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Under normal conditions, this fusion event allows degradation and recycling of organelles and protein aggregates contained within autophagosomes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and is thus important for cellular homeostasis. M2-mediated interference with autolysosome formation therefore stalls autophagic flux and leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes within the cell [
