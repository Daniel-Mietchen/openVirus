  <title>PR8 M2 protein is overexpressed and partly localized in perinuclear vesicles in 293T cells.</title>
  <p>293T cells were inoculated with the indicated IAVs, encoding avian-, human- or PR8-derived M segments, at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell, or treated with 60 Î¼M chloroquine. Cells were fixed 8 h later and stained with anti-M2 (Mab E10; red) and DAPI (blue) followed by imaging with confocal microscopy. Examples of optical sections are shown, either as merged 2-color images or the red and blue channels alone (in grey scale). 63x magnification with 3x optical zoom. Brightness was adjusted for optimal clarity, with all images treated equally. CQ: chloroquine.</p>
