  <title>Visualization of LC3 and M2 co-localization by immunofluorescence microscopy.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were transduced with GFP-LC3 protein and inoculated 24 h later with the indicated IAVs, encoding avian- or human-derived M segments, at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell. Cells were fixed 8 h later and stained with anti-M2 (Mab E10; red) and DAPI (blue) followed by imaging with confocal microscopy. Examples of optical sections are shown, either as merged 3-color images or the red, green, and blue channels alone (in grey scale). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> 63x magnification. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> 3x magnification of the same images shown in 
   <bold>A.</bold> Brightness was adjusted for optimal clarity, with all images treated equally. CQ: chloroquine.
