  <title>Ratio of mRNA
   <sub>7</sub> (encoding M1) to mRNA
   <sub>10</sub> (encoding M2) expression in A549 cells is dependent upon viral M segment host origin.
  </title>
  <p>A549 cells were inoculated at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell with PR8 viruses encoding avian or human-derived M segments and incubated at 37Â°C for 8 h prior to RNA extraction. RT primer extension radiogram of virus-infected A549 cells: (A) 5S rRNA levels were measured to allow normalization of viral RNA. Segment 7 vRNA expression was measured to assess viral replication. Levels of mRNA
   <sub>7</sub>, mRNA
   <sub>10</sub>, and mRNA
   <sub>11</sub> mRNA expression were assessed using radiolabeled probes. (B) mRNA
   <sub>7</sub>, (C) mRNA
   <sub>10</sub>, and (D) mRNA
   <sub>11</sub> was quantitated and displayed as a percentage of total M gene expressed mRNA. Graphs in B-D show the means with SD from three independent experiments. For each experiment, two replicate radiograms were quantitated. Statistical significance was assessed using ordinary one-way ANOVA.
