  <title>pH1N1 M segment confers higher growth relative to avian M segment in mammalian cells at 37Â°C.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Canine MDCK cells or 
   <bold>(B)</bold> human A549 cells were inoculated with the indicated viruses at a low MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> MDCK cells or 
   <bold>(D)</bold> A549 cells were inoculated with the indicated viruses at a high MOI of 5 PFU/cell. In mammalian cells, the pH1N1 M segment conferred more rapid kinetics and higher peak titers than any avian-origin M segment. Multi-cycle and single-cycle growth were assessed in three independent experiments, with three technical sample replicates per experiment. Graphs show the means with SD for the three experiments. Statistical significance was determined using repeated measures, two-way, multiple ANOVA on log-transformed values, with Bonferroni correction applied to account for comparison of a limited number of means. At each time point, pairwise comparisons between viruses were performed, and asterisks corresponding to the most significant difference observed is shown.
