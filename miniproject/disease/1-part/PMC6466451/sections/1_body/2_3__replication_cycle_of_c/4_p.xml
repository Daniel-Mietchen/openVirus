<p>A study showed that the ability of CHIKV to induce apoptosis depends on the ability of the virus to replicate [

 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Inhibition of the apoptotic process by pan-caspase inhibitors (a family of intracellular cysteine proteases critical to several cellular functions, including apoptosis and inflammation) limits the number of CHIKV-infected cells [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. CHIKV infection rapidly results in the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and the production of proinflammatory cytokines as part of the innate cellular immune response [
