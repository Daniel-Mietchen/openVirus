<p>The transmission cycle of CHIKV requires the infection of female mosquitoes through a virus-containing blood meal and, following an appropriate extrinsic incubation period, transmission to another vertebrate host during subsequent feeding [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The ability of CHIKV to bind human cells and to replicate in cell cultures was documented, and the general features are similar to other alphaviruses [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. CHIKV is internalized into human target cells mainly as a result of receptor-mediated endocytosis involving clathrin-dependent mechanisms, delivering the virus to endosomes from which the viral capsid is released into the cytosol [
