<p>Studies in animal models have shown that a low dose of MTX promotes intracellular accumulation of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an intermediate in purine synthesis, and that the accumulation of AICAR is associated with increased adenosine release in inflammatory exudates; adenosine mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of MTX in animal models of both acute inflammation and adjuvant arthritis [
