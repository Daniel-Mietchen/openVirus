<p>To explain the anti-inflammatory properties of MTX, several mechanisms of action have been suggested, including the inhibition of purine and pyrimidine synthesis, suppression of transmethylation reactions with accumulation of polyamines, reduction of antigen-dependent T-cell proliferation, and promotion of adenosine release with adenosine-mediated suppression of inflammation [

In RA, the anti-inflammatory effects of MTX seem to be related to an extracellular increase in adenosine and its interaction with specific cell surface receptors. This is followed by the inhibition of purine and pyrimidine synthesis, mediated by the production of interleukin 8 (IL8)/CXCL8 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the secretion of IL6 by human monocytes, and the inhibition of other proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-α [
