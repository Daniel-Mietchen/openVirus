 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These efforts include preclinical studies of the traditional antiviral compounds, synthesis of designer molecules, in silico high-throughput screening for existing products with efficacy against CHIKV, nucleic acid compounds, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and drugs that target host cell proteins [

There has also been interest in vaccine development, including virus-like particle and measles-vectored vaccines that have reached phase 2 clinical trials [
