 <p id="Par1">Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is considered a public health problem due to its rapid spread and high morbidity. This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of CHIKVs in Colombia. A descriptive and retrospective study was carried out using sera of patients infected with Chikungunya during the outbreak in Colombia. The whole genomes of CHIKV (n = 16) were sequenced with an Illumina Hi-seq 2500 and were assembled using the Iterative Virus Assembler software. A Bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis was carried out with 157 strains of worldwide origin. The Colombian CHIKV sequences were grouped in the Asian genotype; however, three independent phylogenetic subclades were observed, probably the result of three separate introductions from Panama, Nicaragua, and St. Barts. Each subclade showed several different non-synonymous mutations (nsP2-A153V; nsp2-Y543H; nsp2-G720A; nsP3-L458P; Capside R78Q), that may have functional consequences for CHIKV biology and pathogenesis. These same mutations may affect the efficacy of potential CHIKV vaccines.</p>
