  <p>Number of mutations detected in the strains of CHIKV isolated in the present study. Each gene has a range nucleotides position depicted below the genes nsP1 to E1. Each gene shows polymorphic sites (yellow), transitions (blue), transversions (red) and nonsynonymous mutation (green). The Colombian sequences previously published in the Gen-Bank were not taken into account for this analysis.</p>
