<p id="Par22">Regarding the strain Saint Barts 2014, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship with two Colombian strains of 2014 (KR559491) and 2016 (KX496989) (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The strain KX496989 was isolated from an American woman who traveled to Bogotá D.C and had a co-infection with Zika virus and CHIKV

 </sup>; however, is possible that the woman was infected in another municipality of Cundinamarca, since in the description of the clinical case it is indicated that the woman visited urban and rural areas where she received mosquito bites

 </sup>. According to the reports of the National Institute of Health, between the years 2014–2016 in Cundinamarca, there were 19,919 cases of CHIKV
