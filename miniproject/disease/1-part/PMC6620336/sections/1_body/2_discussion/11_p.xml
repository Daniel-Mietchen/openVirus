<p id="Par24">In addition to the mutations that were identified in each clade, we found that the Colombian strains had 60 polymorphic sites, of which 70% (n = 42/60) occurred in non-structural proteins and 30% (n = 18) in structural proteins (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). These findings are similar to those reported by Stapleford
