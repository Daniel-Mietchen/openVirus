<p id="Par20">Concerning the strains found in the Risaralda and Cauca Andean area, the T3308C (aa. nsp2-Y543H), G3840C (aa. nsp2-G720A) and T5445C (aa. nsP3-L458P) mutations demonstrate their phylogenetic relationship with the Nicaraguan strain (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In a previous study, it was determined that the Nicaraguan strain was closely related to the strain of British Virgin Islands
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast, our study showed that strain BVI KJ451624 has a relationship to Mexican strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). BVI KJ451624 strain was one of the first to appear in the outbreak in January 2014 in the Caribbean islands; it is possible that the strains of CHIKV mutated in their movement from Sant Martin December 2013, British Virgin Islands, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Colombia, where the mutations were detected.
