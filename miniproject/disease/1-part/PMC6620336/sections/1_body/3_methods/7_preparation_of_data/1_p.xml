<p id="Par33">A first dataset (CHIKV3gen; n = 173) was generated with the 16 sequences assembled in this study and 157 complete genomes of CHIKV available in GenBank. The GenBank sequences belonged to the three genotypes, with collection dates between the years 1953–2016 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The 173 sequences were aligned with MUSCLE v3.8.31
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup> and manually curated while retaining the codon homology with the Geneious v11.1.2 program
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. A second dataset (CHIKVas; n = 104) was prepared from CHIKV3gen and contained only Asian CHIKVs from 1953–2016. Due to the ambiguous alignment of the UTR, only the open reading frames (ORFs) comprising 11256 nucleotides were used for the reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree and subsequent analyses. The nucleotide and amino acid positions used were based on the reference sequences KX262995, KY055011 and LN898093. All sequences were identified by the date of sampling and the location from which they originated.
