 </sup>. The analysis was run in duplicate with 90 million replicates, and the trees were sampled every 1000 steps. The coalescence model implemented was a Bayesian Skyline prior with a relaxed clock model and variation rates between branches using a log-normal distribution and the substitution model recommended by jModel Test (GTR + G + I). The convergence of MCMC chains was verified with Tracer v1. 7. The trees obtained were edited using the software FigTree v1.4.3. The alignment of the second dataset CHIKVas; (n = 104) which contained Asian genotypes was used to determine the genetic diversity (Software MEGA 7).
