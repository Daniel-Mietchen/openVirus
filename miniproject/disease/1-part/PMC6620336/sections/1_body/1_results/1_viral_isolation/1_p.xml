<p id="Par8">CHIKV was isolated from 96.5% (54/57) of the sera, 65.4% (n = 36/54) of the isolated viruses coming from Cartagena, 29% (n = 16/54) from Ovejas, 1.8% from Planeta Rica and 1.8% from San Joaquín-Mahates (SJ-Mahates). Positive cultures were obtained from samples with viral loads of 1.19 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> and 1, 25 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> viruses/mL, which generally correspond to the first four days of the acute phase of the disease. In the three sera from which viral isolation was not achieved, the viral loads were less than 4.5 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> and corresponded to the fifth day of disease. The three strains donated by the Colombian National Institute of Health (INS) were isolated in C6/36 and Vero cells. The most marked difference between the Vero cell line and C6/36 was the cell lysis and the time of appearance of the cytopathic effect (CPE). It was observed that the CPE in C6/36 cells occurred from the fifth day with the formation of syncytia. The C6/36 cell monolayer remained stable for approximately seven days. In contrast, in the Vero cells, the CPE was observed at 24–48 hours post-infection (hpi) and was characterized by plaque formation (24 hpi) and cell lysis between 3–4 days.
