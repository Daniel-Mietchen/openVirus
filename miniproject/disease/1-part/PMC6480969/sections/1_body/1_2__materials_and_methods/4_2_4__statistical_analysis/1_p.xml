<p>A correlation analysis was performed to assess the associations between disease variables (cumulative incidence, onset week, and duration from onset to the first epidemic peak) and highway network node centralities (adjacent degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, 
 <italic>SumRatio</italic>, and 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic>) using the Pearson correlation coefficient and to figure out the significant explanatory variables for the following spatial regression analysis. To investigate the quantitative relationships between epidemic characteristics (e.g., cumulative incidence, onset week, and duration) and socioeconomic factors, including Urban ratio, PopDensity, PGDP, Income, Hospital, Hos-bed, Doctor, College, MidSchool, PriSchool, CollegeStu, MidSchoolStu, PriSchoolStu, and Pig, as well as the network structure parameters of the city vertices calculated above and to quantify the contribution of road transportation and the spatial distance to the spread of the influenza virus, we used spatial autoregressive models [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] performed in MATLAB. In the models, epidemic characteristics were set to be response variables, while the selected network node centrality measures and socioeconomic factors were included as explanatory variables. We were able to collect the records of all these variables in 273 cities where Influenza A (H1N1) cases had been reported.
