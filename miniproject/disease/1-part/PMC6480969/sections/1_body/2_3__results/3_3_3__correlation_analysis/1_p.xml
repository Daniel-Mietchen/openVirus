<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01223-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, each of the two newly proposed centrality measures (
 <italic>SumRatio</italic> and 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic>) was significantly correlated with all three epidemiological features (cumulative incidence, onset week, and duration). While the correlations between classic centrality measures (degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality, except for closeness centrality) and any of the three epidemiological features were not statistically significant. In addition, 
 <italic>SumRatio</italic> and 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic> performed even better than closeness centrality. 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic> was positively correlated with the cumulative incidence (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.258, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and onset week (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.320, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) but negatively correlated with the duration from onset to the first epidemic peak (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.369, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). A positive correlation between closeness centrality and onset week (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.208, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) was identified, as well as a negative association between closeness and duration (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.126, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
 <italic>SumRatio</italic> was positively associated with the cumulative incidence (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.354, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and duration (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.265, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but negatively associated with the onset week (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.348, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The Pearson correlation coefficients between the number of slaughtered pigs and cumulative incidence, onset week, and duration of epidemics were −0.096 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.175), −0.259 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 0.271 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), respectively. Therefore, the number of pigs would not be taken as an explanatory variable of the regression model when the cumulative incidence was taken as the response variable.
