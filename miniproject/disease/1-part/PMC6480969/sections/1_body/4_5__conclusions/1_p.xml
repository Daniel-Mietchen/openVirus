<p>In summary, our study provides two major contributions to the literature. First, we propose two new node centrality measures for a national highway network: 
 <italic>SumRatio</italic> and 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic>, and both perform better than classic node centralities for statistically significant correlations with epidemiological features. Second, we conclude that road transport network and socioeconomic factors had significant impacts on the diffusion of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus at the city level in mainland China and that both should be candidates for the prevention and control of future influenza pandemics.
