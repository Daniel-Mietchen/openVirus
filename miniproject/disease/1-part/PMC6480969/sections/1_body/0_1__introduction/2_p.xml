<p>Among transport modes, road traffic should not be neglected. In the United States, the amount of people who travel daily along the interstate highways during the influenza season is larger than 3.8 million, which is over twice those who travel by air [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The mode choice was determined not only by Chinese peopleâ€™s choice preference for travel but also by the features of various travel modes. Airlines are the fastest mode, but they were relatively expensive in China in 2009, so they mainly served domestic business and government officials, although they have become much cheaper nowadays. Railways were mainly used for occasional long-distance travelling [

National highways in China are funded and constructed by the central government and are vital connections between provinces and cities, without the collection of tolls, whereas tolls on expressways are quite high, meaning car and buses tend to avoid them [
