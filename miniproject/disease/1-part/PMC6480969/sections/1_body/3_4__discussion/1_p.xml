<p>In this study, we evaluated the impacts of road traffic and other socioeconomic factors on the nationwide spread of influenza A (H1N1) across China in 2009. We constructed a national highway network and proposed two new centrality measures: 
 <italic>SumRatio</italic> and 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic>. Both new measures were significantly correlated with all three epidemiological features in question (cumulative incidence, onset week, and epidemic duration). Based on the positive association between onset week and 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic>, we understand the transmission process of influenza A (H1N1) as follows: At the very beginning, internationally infected individuals quickly arrived in the eight center cities and other cities in eastern China with frequent international communications [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The epidemic followed the classic distance decay theory, starting earlier in the cities which are closer to their nearest center cities, and this was partly supported by the findings in Reference [
