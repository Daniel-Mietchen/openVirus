<p>There are some limitations in this study. Although the trend of case reporting was consistent with that of the percentage of respiratory specimens tested positive for the influenza virus, the number of reported cases was much less than the real size of infected individuals [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It was observed globally in many influenza outbreaksthat not all cases were reported to the medical services. Therefore, data from virological and serological surveillance should be taken into consideration for further information. Additionally, even though there were several socioeconomic factors which were not significantly associated with all three epidemiological features, there still existed other effective factors that were not included in this research, such as climate conditions. As an ecological study, the results of this study cannot provide evidence for causal relationships but merely suggest probable associations. In future research, a meta-population epidemiological model driven by road travel should be constructed to investigate the diffusion process of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) under the effects of socioeconomic factors.
