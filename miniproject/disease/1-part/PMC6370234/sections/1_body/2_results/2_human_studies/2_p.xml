<p>None of the GBS group were ZIKV RT-PCR positive (0 of the 41 tested from the n = 42 group). 73.8% of the GBS group had anti-ZIKV IgM and were also anti-DENV IgM negative. By combining these ZIKV IgM results with the ZIKV IgG results, the authors determined that 97.6% of the GBS group were ZIKV-exposed. When tested by the microneutralization assay, 100% of the GBS group were deemed ZIKV exposed. Of this GBS+/ZIKV+ group (n = 42), the majority (40/42 or 95.2%) were DENV IgG+. No statistically significant difference in DENV IgG+ positivity was observed in GBS cases compared with control group 1 which had 87/98 (88.8%) DENV IgG+ individuals (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 0.4–19.9; p = 0.62). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed in DENV IgG+ GBS cases when compared with the CTR2 group that was comprised of 58/70 (82.9%) DENV IgG+ individuals (OR = 6.04; 95% CI = 0.81–269.5; p = 0.10).</p>
