<p>Terzian et al described ZIKV viral load and cytokine responses in patients presenting with acute ZIKV infection in Sao Paulo, Brazil in early 2016 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007060.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. They sampled 45 patients with acute ZIKV infection at a single time point, with acute ZIKV infection determined by testing for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV by RT-PCR. Prior DENV status was ascertained by a commercial DENV IgG ELISA assay. ZIKV viral load was measured by quantitative PCR. Cytokine profiles in acute ZIKV infections were estimated using a multiplex bead analysis assay which measured interleukin (IL) 1Î², IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-17. Of those 45 patients with molecularly confirmed ZIKV infection, 35 were DENV IgG positive and 10 were DENV IgG negative, indicating the majority had prior DENV exposure.
