 <p>Sensitivity of H1N1pdm to RH in stationary droplets following growth in HBE cells. H1N1pdm was grown in primary HBE cell lines derived from 3 different patient samples. Droplets containing virus were incubated under a range of RH conditions for 2 h. Levels of decay of the virus were compared among the three HBE cell lines, and the results were not significantly different, as determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations of the results from all of the experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate. Download
