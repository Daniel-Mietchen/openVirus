 <p>Physical loss (

  </italic>) coefficients under each set of RH conditions in the rotating drum and confirmation of virus conservation in the drum. Physical loss and dilution coefficients were determined following measurement of aerosol volume concentration using scanning mobility and aerodynamic particle sizers. Coefficients were determined by fitting the data to a first-order decay model. (A)

(C) To ensure that similar amounts of viral material were collected before and after aging during the temporal experiment performed with Perth H3N2, we performed qPCR on samples before and after aging for 15 min, 1 h, and 2 h. Data are representative of results from three replicate experiments (denoted by symbols), where viral aerosols were sampled independently three times from the RH drum. Bars represent means ± standard deviations. Download
