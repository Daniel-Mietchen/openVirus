  <p>Decay of seasonal IAV in droplets depends on virus type and propagation method. H1N1pdm and Perth H3N2 were propagated in MDCK cells or HBE cells. Virus-containing droplets were incubated under seven different RH conditions for 2 h, and infectious titers were determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assay. Viral titers of MDCK-grown virus are shown in the left graph, HBE-grown virus in the center graph, and log decay of both MDCK- and HBE-grown virus in the right graph of each panel. (A) The titers of both MDCK cell- and HBE cell-grown H1N1pdm viruses varied with RH, with the most severe loss in titer occurring at 75%, 85%, and 98% RH for the MDCK cell-grown stock. In contrast, HBE cell-grown H1N1pdm was protected from decay at mid-to-high-RH conditions. (B) Titers of both MDCK cell- and HBE cell-grown Perth H3N2 viruses varied with RH, with the greatest effect observed at midrange RH. Unlike the result seen with H1N1pdm, the cell propagation method did not affect the level of sensitivity to RH, with one exception seen at 98% RH. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations of the results from all of the experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate, and are representative of at least two biological replicate experiments. Asterisks indicate significantly different mean levels of decay between MDCK cell- and HBE cell-grown viruses under each set of conditions, as determined by two-way ANOVA, and adjusted 
   <italic>P</italic> values are reported using Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons (*,
