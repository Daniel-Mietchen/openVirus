  <p>Sensitivity of LPAI to RH in stationary droplets. LPAI viruses were grown in MDCK or HBE cells, and virus-containing droplets were exposed to seven different sets of RH conditions for 2 h. Viral titers of MDCK-grown virus are shown in the left graph, HBE-grown virus in the center graph, and log decay of both MDCK- and HBE-grown virus in the right graph of each panel. (A) Both MDCK cell-grown avH6N1 and HBE cell-grown avH6N1 viruses were highly sensitive to RH, with mean decay levels exceeding 3 log
   <sub>10</sub> at 55% RH. Decay was significantly attenuated at 33% and 55% RH in the HBE cell-grown stock compared to MDCK cell-grown virus. (B) MDCK cell-grown avH9N2 virus was similarly sensitive to midrange RH. Significantly less decay was observed for HBE cell-grown viruses at 43% and 55% RH, although we detected significantly more decay of avH9N2 (HBE) at 75% RH. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations of the results from all of the experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate, and are representative of at least two biological replicate experiments. Asterisks indicate significantly different mean levels of decay over time as determined by two-way ANOVA, and adjusted 
   <italic>P</italic> values are reported using Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons (*, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).
