  <p>Aerosolized seasonal IV are stable under a range of RH conditions. MDCK cell-grown Perth H3N2 or IBV supplemented with ASL collected from uninfected HBE cells were aerosolized into a rotating drum under five different sets of RH conditions. Infectious titers were determined in unaged and aged aerosol samples (left), and decay was quantified as the difference (right), corrected for losses in the drum. (A) Perth H3N2 plus HBE ASL did not decay after 1 h in aerosols under all five RH conditions tested. (B) Aerosolized Perth H3N2 plus HBE ASL remained equally stable after 15 min, 1 h, or 2 h at 43% RH. (C) Aerosolized IBV plus HBE ASL was highly stable under all RH conditions tested, with some (&lt;1 log
   <sub>10</sub>) decay occurring at 23% RH, although the level of decay was not significantly different from that seen with Perth H3N2 under any RH condition. Data represent mean values ± standard deviations of the results from all of the experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate.
