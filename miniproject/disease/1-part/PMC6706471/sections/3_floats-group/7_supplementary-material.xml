 <p>Pre-2009 A/Brisbane/59/2007, Bris H1N1, is protected from RH following growth in HBE cells. Bris H1N1 viruses grown in MDCK and HBE cells were exposed to seven different sets of RH conditions for 2 h in droplets. The infectious titer of the MDCK cell-grown virus showed that it was more sensitive to midrange RH than the HBE cell-grown stock, with significantly less decay of the HBE virus at 43%, 55%, and 75% RH. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations of the results from all of the experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate, using virus from a single HBE cell line. Asterisks indicate significantly different mean levels of log decay over time, as determined by two-way ANOVA, and adjusted
