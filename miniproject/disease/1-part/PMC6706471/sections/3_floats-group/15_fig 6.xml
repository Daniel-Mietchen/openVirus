  <p>HBE cell-grown avH6N1 virus is more sensitive to RH than human-pathogenic seasonal IV in stationary droplets. To compare the stability levels of distinct IV isolates following growth in HBE cells, we reanalyzed the decay of avH6N1 compared to the other human-pathogenic seasonal and LPAI isolates used in this study. (A) The level of avH6N1 decay was significantly greater than that of H1N1pdm at 75% RH. (B) The level of avH6N1 decay was significantly greater than that of Perth H3N2 at 43%, 55%, and 85% RH. (C) The level of avH6N1 decay was significantly greater than that of IBV at 85% RH. (D) The decay levels of avH6N1 were not significantly different from those of avH9N2 at any RH tested. Significance was determined at each RH using a two-way ANOVA, and adjusted
