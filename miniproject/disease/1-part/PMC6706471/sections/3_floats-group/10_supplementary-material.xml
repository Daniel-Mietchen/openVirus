 <p>Sensitivity of seasonal IBV in stationary droplets under conditions of virus growth in HBE cells. (A) Replication kinetics of IBV in HBE cells demonstrates efficient replication of the virus in a primary cell line. Data are shown as means ± standard deviations of values from three transwells representing TCID
  <sub>50</sub> per milliliter. (B) IBV was grown in primary HBE cell lines derived from 3 different patient samples. Droplets containing virus were incubated under a range of RH conditions for 2 h. Levels of decay of the virus were not significantly different among the three HBE cell lines, as determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations of the results from all of the experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate. Download
