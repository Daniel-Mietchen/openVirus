  <p>Seasonal IBV is sensitive to RH in droplets. MDCK cell- and HBE cell-propagated IBV was exposed to seven different sets of RH conditions in droplets for 2 h. Viral titers of MDCK-grown virus are shown in the left graph, HBE-grown virus in the center graph, and log decay of both MDCK- and HBE-grown virus in the right graph. Decay levels of MDCK cell- and HBE cell-grown IBV were not significantly different under any RH condition tested, as determined by two-way ANOVA. Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations of the results from all of the experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate, and are representative of at least two biological replicate experiments.</p>
