 <p>LPAI viruses propagated in HBE cells are sensitive to RH-dependent decay in droplets. (A) Replication kinetics of avH6N1 (left) and avH9N2 (right) in HBE cells demonstrating that the avian viruses grow well in the human cell line. Data are shown as means ± standard deviations of values from three transwells representing the TCID
  <sub>50</sub> per milliliter for each virus. (B) Decay of LPAI viruses grown in HBE cells. LPAI viruses were propagated in three distinct HBE cell cultures, and virus stability was determined following a 2-h exposure to 7 different sets of RH conditions. For both LPAI virus experiments, the level of decay of viruses grown in HBE 0206 was significantly different from that seen with viruses grown in the other two HBE cell lines (determined by two-way ANOVA using Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons). Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations of the results from all of the experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate. Asterisks represent RH conditions where decay of virus grown in HBE 0206 was significantly different from that seen with either one (*) or both (**) of the other two HBE cell lines. Download
