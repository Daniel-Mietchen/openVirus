<p>Recurring epidemics are driven by cocirculation of human-pathogenic seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 subtype influenza A viruses (IAV) and influenza B viruses (IBV), which persist in the population despite significant surveillance and intervention efforts (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The epidemiological spread of IAV and that of IBV are not uniform, with IAV and IBV infections peaking at different times during a season (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The impact of the environment on the seasonality of influenza viruses in temperate climates is still poorly understood. One approach to addressing this critical issue is that of comparing the environmental persistence of IV that transmit efficiently through the air (i.e., human-pathogenic seasonal viruses) to that of IV that are poorly transmissible in the human population. Low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, including H6N1 and H9N2, have caused sporadic infections in humans (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Previous pandemic IV have emerged through genetic reassortment of seasonal and zoonotic IAV (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Therefore, comparisons of the levels of environmental persistence of human IV and LPAI viruses will improve our understanding of the contribution of environmental factors to the spread of IV in the human population and enhance pandemic preparedness programs that assess the phenotypes of emerging zoonotic IAV with pandemic potential.
