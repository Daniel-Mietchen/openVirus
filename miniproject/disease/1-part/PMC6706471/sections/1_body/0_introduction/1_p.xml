<p>Seasonal influenza viruses (IV) cause yearly infection cycles that tend to peak in the winter in temperate regions and during rainy periods in tropical climates (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Seasonal IV epidemics create a significant public health burden, with the 2017-to-2018 season resulting in the highest number of deaths since 2010 and &gt;30,000 hospitalizations in the United States alone (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Seasonal variation in environmental parameters, including relative humidity (RH), has been implicated in the seasonal spread of these viruses (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Efficient epidemiological spread of IV in people is dictated by the capacity of the viruses to transmit effectively through the air within respiratory aerosols (noncontact transmission) and droplets (indirect contact, or fomite transmission) expelled from an infected host (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These modes of transmission require that the viruses maintain viability in the environment for the period of time leading up to contact with an immunologically naive recipient. However, little is known about the maintenance and duration of viral stability in the environment following release from the human airway. Clarifying the relationship between RH and viral persistence in the environment will be critical to understanding the basis for seasonal epidemiology of IV, as well as to designing nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies to limit the spread of these viruses in the human population.
