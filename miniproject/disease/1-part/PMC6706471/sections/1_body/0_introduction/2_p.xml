<p>Variations in ambient RH have previously been shown to directly affect transmission of IV in animal models (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Historically, midrange RH conditions have been shown to be detrimental to the viability of expelled IV (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, our recent work has demonstrated that the presence of airway surface liquid (ASL) collected from human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells can protect the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus from RH-dependent decay in suspended aerosols and stationary droplets (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Primary HBE cells differentiated at an air-liquid interface produce mucus, mimic the surface of the lumen of the human airway, and are highly permissive to IV infection (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Newly replicated IV collected from the apical surface of HBE cells are, therefore, expected to be very similar to those expelled in physiological respiratory droplets. Comparing the levels of stability of IV under a range of RH conditions in physiologically relevant aerosols and droplets will provide a better representation of how IV respond to environmental stressors following release from the respiratory tract and will improve assessment of the risk of transmission under different environmental conditions during an influenza epidemic.
