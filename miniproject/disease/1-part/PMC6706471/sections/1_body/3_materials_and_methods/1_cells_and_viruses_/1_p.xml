<p>Primary HBE cells derived from human lung tissue were cultured at an air-liquid interface using an institutional review board-approved protocol (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). HBE ASL was collected for RH drum experiments by washing the apical surface of uninfected HBE cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as previously described (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC) were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Influenza A viruses A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) pdm09 antiviral (AVR) reference virus M2—S31N NA—wild type (wt) (item number FR-458) and A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) FR-1 and influenza B virus B/Texas/02/2013 (Victoria lineage, cell-derived, FR-1302) were obtained through the International Reagent Resource, Influenza Division, World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). Influenza A virus A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) was a generous gift from Zhiping Ye, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration (Silver Spring, MD). LPAI influenza A viruses A/shorebird/DE Bay/230/2009 (H6N1) NR-45155 and A/shorebird/DE/127/2003 (H9N2) NR-45169 were obtained from BEI Resources, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Virus stocks were propagated in MDCK cells, harvested following detection of cytopathic effect (CPE), and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. HBE virus stocks were prepared by inoculation of each Transwell with 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml virus as previously described (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Viruses and associated HBE ASL samples were harvested by pooling collected washes from the apical cell surface with PBS at 48 to 72 h postinfection (hpi), prior to the onset of CPE. LPAI replication kinetics in HBE cells were compared using three Transwells from each of two HBE cell lines at 1, 8, 24, and 48 hpi. IV titers were determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay on MDCK cells according to the method of Reed and Muench (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).
