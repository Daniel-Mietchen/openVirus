<p>Comparisons between levels of decay in MDCK cells versus HBE cells under all RH conditions were performed with a two-way ANOVA, with adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic> values reported using Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test. Significance was determined using a 95% confidence interval where 
 <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;0.05 are denoted by a single asterisk (*) and 
 <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;0.01 are denoted by double asterisks (**), unless otherwise indicated in the text. One-way ANOVA was used with a Tukey’s multiple-comparison test to compare levels of decay among three HBE patient cell lines for H1N1pdm, Perth H3N2, and IBV strains. Two-way ANOVA was used with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison’s test to compare levels of decay in three HBE patient cell lines for avH9N2 and avH6N1. Specific details regarding statistical tests are also provided in the figure legends. Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 software.
