<p>Aerosolized viruses were exposed to selected RH conditions in a rotating, 27-liter aluminum drum housed within a biosafety cabinet, as previously described (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Briefly, virus suspensions were aerosolized into the drum using a three-jet Collison nebulizer (BGI MRE-3) at a pressure level of 40 lb/in
 <sup>2</sup>. Target RH was achieved by adjusting the flow rates of the aerosol, dry air, and saturated air into the drum. Once RH reached equilibrium, an aerosol sample representing time zero was collected onto a gelatin filter at a flow rate of 2 liters/min for 15 min. The drum was then sealed, and aerosolized virus was incubated for 1 h, after which another aerosol sample was collected. The filters were dissolved into 3 ml of prewarmed L-15 medium, and IV titers were determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay. Decay rates were corrected by RH-specific aerosol physical loss rates (
