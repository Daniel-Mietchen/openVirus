<p>In contrast to seasonal IV, LPAI viruses, including avH6N1 and avH9N2, have not caused pandemic outbreaks in people (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). As with seasonal IV, infectious avian IAV have been shown to persist for days on various surfaces, although the RH at which these experiments were conducted was not noted (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In our study, both of these viruses were highly sensitive to 55% RH in droplets following preparation in either MDCK or HBE cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Additionally, we showed that HBE cell-grown avH6N1, but not avH9N2, was significantly less stable in droplets at midrange RH than any of the other human-pathogenic seasonal IV tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that host species origin may contribute to the viral determinants of RH sensitivity. The interaction between IV and ASL under this critical midrange RH condition, including investigations of the role of ASL content in the environmental persistence of IV, will be the focus of future studies. The variations in the sensitivities of these seasonal IV and LPAI to midrange RH that we observed hints at a link between viral factors and the maintenance of viral infectivity outside the host which may impact the transmissibility of H6N1 and H9N2 LPAI viruses (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We do provide evidence for a link between HA receptor specificity and viral persistence in stationary droplets (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS8">Fig. S8</xref>), although further studies performed with additional mutants will be required to fully define this relationship. Other known determinants of IV transmissibility include viral surface protein function/stability and genomic background (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Integrational studies of these viral factors under various sets of environmental conditions will be required provide a framework for clarifying the mechanisms driving airborne transmission and may be useful for assessing the transmissibility or pandemic potential of emerging zoonotic IV without the need for animal model systems.
