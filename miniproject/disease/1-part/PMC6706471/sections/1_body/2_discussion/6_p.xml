<p>Here, we have clarified the relationship between RH and the stability of seasonal IV and LPAI strains resembling those that would be released into the environment from the airway of an infected person. This report provides a distinction between IV strains and virus stability in response to propagation method and specific environmental parameters. Aerosolized seasonal IV are highly resistant to RH-dependent decay, which suggests that removing them via increased air exchange rates, filtration, or UV germicidal irradiation may be critical to reducing the transmission of these viruses indoors. We found that RH is important for the stability of IV on surfaces but also that infectious viruses have the potential to persist on surfaces for hours in physiological droplets, reinforcing the need for surface decontamination in high-risk environments.</p>
