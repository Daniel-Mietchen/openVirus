<p>To assess the stability of human-pathogenic seasonal IV in large droplets, we used 1-μl droplets of viruses grown in MDCK or HBE cells under seven sets of RH conditions: 23%, 33%, 43%, 55%, 75%, 85%, and 98% RH for 2 h. After this incubation period, infectious viral titer was determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay on MDCK cells and compared to the titers determined using an equivalent volume (10 μl total) of virus incubated in a sealed vial outside the chamber. The levels of viral stability determined under each set of RH conditions are presented as the raw viral titer and log decay, which is the change in infectivity between experimental and control samples. Consistent with our previous findings (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Specifically, we observed a decrease of &gt;2 log
 <sub>10</sub> of virus titer for MDCK cell-grown H1N1pdm at 75% and 85% RH compared to control samples. In contrast, H1N1pdm propagated in HBE cells was resistant to RH-mediated decay. Comparisons between the level of decay determined for H1N1pdm grown in MDCK cells and that grown in HBE cells revealed a statistically significant difference in viral decay levels for HBE cell-propagated H1N1pdm compared to the MDCK cell-grown virus at 75%, 85%, and 98% RH, suggesting that growth in HBE cells enhances the stability of H1N1pdm under these RH conditions. To account for effects of patient-specific variation on IV stability, we propagated the viruses in multiple HBE cell cultures derived from different patient tissue samples for our experiments (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref> in the supplemental material). We found no significant differences in the levels of decay of H1N1pdm in any of the three primary HBE cell cultures tested (
