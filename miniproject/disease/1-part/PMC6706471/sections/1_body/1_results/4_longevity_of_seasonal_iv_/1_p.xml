<p>The risk of infection by indirect contact, or by fomite transmission, of a seasonal IV depends on the ability of the viruses to remain infectious for a long period of time following deposition onto a surface. To understand the persistence of seasonal IV in droplets, we tested the stability of HBE cell-propagated H1N1pdm, Perth H3N2, and IBV after 2, 8, and 16 h under four different sets of RH conditions: 23%, 43%, 75%, and 98%. We confirmed that the RH chamber was capable of maintaining constant temperature and humidity for the duration of our studies (

The rate of change in virus titer, presented as (Δ log decay), was determined as the difference between the decay at each RH and the mean log decay at 2 h for each virus. We performed each study in three independent biological replicates from three different patient cell lines (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). In general, we anticipated that all viruses would decay over time but that the relative amounts of decay would depend upon both virus strain and RH.
