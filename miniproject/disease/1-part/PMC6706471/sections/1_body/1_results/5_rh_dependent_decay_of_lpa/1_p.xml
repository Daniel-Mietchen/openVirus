<p>To this point, our study had focused on the persistence of epidemiologically successful human-pathogenic seasonal IV. However, the host range of IAV is quite broad, resulting in the emergence of IAV pandemics from animal sources (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). LPAI viruses, including H9N2 and H6N1 subtypes, have contributed to zoonotic infections (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) but have not yet spread efficiently through the human population (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To understand how environmental factors may affect the spread of LPAI viruses, we tested the stability of MDCK cell-propagated and HBE cell-propagated avian influenza virus H6N1 (avH6N1) and avH9N2 strains in large droplets under a range of RH conditions. Both of the LPAI virus strains replicated well in HBE cells, with titers exceeding 10

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). The severity of decay of these viruses was greater for the MDCK cell-grown stock at 43% and 55% RH than for the HBE cell-grown viruses, but both reached at least 2 log
 <sub>10</sub> decay at midrange RH, suggesting that these viruses are more sensitive to RH in droplets than the human-pathogenic seasonal H1N1pdm and Perth H3N2 viruses tested in this study. The RH sensitivity phenotypes of both avH6N1 and avH9N2 were reproduced in 2 additional HBE cell cultures, although avH6N1 grown in a third patient culture (HBE 0206) decayed significantly less than virus grown in HBE 0195 or HBE 0204 cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig. S7B</xref>). These data underscore the need to assess viral stability in samples prepared in, at minimum, three primary cell lines to ensure reproducibility.
