Seasonal IV epidemics create a significant public health burden, with the 2017-to-2018 season resulting in the highest number of deaths since 2010 and &#x0003e;30,000 hospitalizations in the United States alone (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Seasonal variation in environmental parameters, including relative humidity (RH), has been implicated in the seasonal spread of these viruses (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Efficient epidemiological spread of IV in people is dictated by the capacity of the viruses to transmit effectively through the air within respiratory aerosols (noncontact transmission) and droplets (indirect contact, or fomite transmission) expelled from an infected host (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These modes of transmission require that the viruses maintain viability in the environment for the period of time leading up to contact with an immunologically naive recipient. However, little is known about the maintenance and duration of viral stability in the environment following release from the human airway. Clarifying the relationship between RH and viral persistence in the environment will be critical to understanding the basis for seasonal epidemiology of IV, as well as to designing nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies to limit the spread of these viruses in the human population.</p><p>Variations in ambient RH have previously been shown to directly affect transmission of IV in animal models (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Historically, midrange RH conditions have been shown to be detrimental to the viability of expelled IV (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, our recent work has demonstrated that the presence of airway surface liquid (ASL) collected from human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells can protect the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus from RH-dependent decay in suspended aerosols and stationary droplets (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Primary HBE cells differentiated at an air-liquid interface produce mucus, mimic the surface of the lumen of the human airway, and are highly permissive to IV infection (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Newly replicated IV collected from the apical surface of HBE cells are, therefore, expected to be very similar to those expelled in physiological respiratory droplets. Comparing the levels of stability of IV under a range of RH conditions in physiologically relevant aerosols and droplets will provide a better representation of how IV respond to environmental stressors following release from the respiratory tract and will improve assessment of the risk of transmission under different environmental conditions during an influenza epidemic.</p><p>Recurring epidemics are driven by cocirculation of human-pathogenic seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 subtype influenza A viruses (IAV) and influenza B viruses (IBV), which persist in the population despite significant surveillance and intervention efforts (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The epidemiological spread of IAV and that of IBV are not uniform, with IAV and IBV infections peaking at different times during a season (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), which may reflect differences in their primary modes of transmission (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The impact of the environment on the seasonality of influenza viruses in temperate climates is still poorly understood. One approach to addressing this critical issue is that of comparing the environmental persistence of IV that transmit efficiently through the air (i.e., human-pathogenic seasonal viruses) to that of IV that are poorly transmissible in the human population. Low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, including H6N1 and H9N2, have caused sporadic infections in humans (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) but fail to transmit efficiently in animal models (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Previous pandemic IV have emerged through genetic reassortment of seasonal and zoonotic IAV (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Therefore, comparisons of the levels of environmental persistence of human IV and LPAI viruses will improve our understanding of the contribution of environmental factors to the spread of IV in the human population and enhance pandemic preparedness programs that assess the phenotypes of emerging zoonotic IAV with pandemic potential.</p><p>In this study, we examined the environmental persistence of six IV, including human-pathogenic seasonal and LPAI viruses (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material), in response to a range of RH conditions. We explored the contributions of virus strain background, droplet composition via various propagation methods, RH, and duration of exposure on the stability of IV in aerosols and large droplets. We found that human-pathogenic seasonal H3N2 and IBV were resistant to decay under most RH conditions for an extended period of time in aerosols containing ASL from HBE cells (HBE ASL). However, the longevities of human-pathogenic seasonal IV stability in droplets differed between subtypes H1N1, H3N2, and IBV in an RH-dependent manner, suggesting a role for virus-specific factors in the environmental persistence of IV. Surprisingly, we observed that LPAI IV were more vulnerable to decay at midrange RH than human-pathogenic seasonal IV. Together, these results confirm that human-pathogenic seasonal IV can remain infectious under a range of RH conditions, in agreement with our previous study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), but this work clearly demonstrates that RH may be an important factor affecting the stability of expelled IV over time. Overall, our results indicate that the levels of persistence of IV are not uniform and that virus-specific factors can impact the stability and longevity of IV in the environment.</p><table-wrap id="tab1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Influenza virus strains used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Identifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IAV</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A/CA/07/2009 (H1N1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">H1N1pdm</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IAV</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bris H1N1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IAV</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A/Perth/16/09 (H3N2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perth H3N2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IBV</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">B/Texas/02/2013</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IBV</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IAV</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A/Shorebird/DE Bay/230/2009 (H6N1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">avH6N1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IAV</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A/Shorebird/DE/127/2003 (H9N2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">avH9N2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="tabS1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mSphere.00552-19.9</object-id><label>TABLE&#x000a0;S1</label><p>Influenza virus passage history and references.

H1N1pdm viruses grown in HBE cells are also protected from decay under midrange RH conditions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These data suggest that HBE ASL provides a protective microenvironment for H1N1pdm. To determine whether this effect is consistent among other seasonal IV, we compared the levels of stability of aerosolized Perth H3N2 and IBV in the presence of HBE ASL.</p><p>To test the stability of other seasonal IV in aerosols, we aerosolized Perth H3N2 or IBV supplemented with a 1:10 dilution of HBE ASL collected from uninfected cells into a rotating, RH-controlled drum. Changes in infectious virus titer were determined by comparison of TCID<sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infectious dose) assay results between unaged aerosols and aerosols aged for 1&#x02009;h in the drum determined on MDCK cells. Log decay was corrected for both physical loss and dilution in the drum at each RH (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material). The titer of Perth H3N2 did not change between aged and unaged samples in the presence of HBE ASL, and we did not detect any RH-dependent decay of Perth H3N2 in aerosols after 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). To assess the persistence of aerosolized Perth H3N2, we aged viral aerosols in the presence of HBE ASL for 15 min, 1 h, and 2 h at 43% RH. We found that the virus remained fully infectious in aerosols under those conditions for up to 2&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>). Similarly, aerosolized IBV remained equally infectious using unaged and aged aerosols at 43%, 55%, 75%, and 95% RH for up to 1 h in the drum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>).

The levels of viral stability determined under each set of RH conditions are presented as the raw viral titer and log decay, which is the change in infectivity between experimental and control samples. Consistent with our previous findings (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we found that H1N1pdm is highly sensitive to midrange RH under conditions of propagation in MDCK cells but is less sensitive to RH following propagation in HBE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>). Specifically, we observed a decrease of &#x0003e;2 log<sub>10</sub> of virus titer for MDCK cell-grown H1N1pdm at 75% and 85% RH compared to control samples. In contrast, H1N1pdm propagated in HBE cells was resistant to RH-mediated decay. Comparisons between the level of decay determined for H1N1pdm grown in MDCK cells and that grown in HBE cells revealed a statistically significant difference in viral decay levels for HBE cell-propagated H1N1pdm compared to the MDCK cell-grown virus at 75%, 85%, and 98% RH, suggesting that growth in HBE cells enhances the stability of H1N1pdm under these RH conditions. To account for effects of patient-specific variation on IV stability, we propagated the viruses in multiple HBE cell cultures derived from different patient tissue samples for our experiments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref> in the supplemental material).

In contrast, analysis of the stability of Perth H3N2 IV in stationary droplets showed that the levels were not significantly different in comparisons between cell propagation methods at all RH settings, excluding 98%, where HBE-grown H3N2 decayed more than MDCK-grown H3N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4</xref>).

However, in contrast to IAV, the onset and spread of IBV within the community tends to occur primarily in children (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), with an estimated efficiency of transmission in households of &#x0003c;40% by the aerosol route (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To test the effect of RH on IBV in droplets, a strain from the Victoria lineage was grown in MDCK and HBE cells. This virus replicated to high titers in HBE cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#x000a0;S5A</xref>). MDCK cell-grown IBV stability varied with RH, with the greatest average decay (&#x0003e;2 log<sub>10</sub>) occurring at 75% RH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). Surprisingly, HBE cell-grown IBV also decayed &#x0003e;2 log<sub>10</sub> at a midrange RH (55%). No significant difference in log decay was observed between the two propagation methods, suggesting that HBE ASL does not protect IBV from sensitivity to RH. This phenotype was reproduced in two additional HBE cultures derived from distinct patient samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#x000a0;S5B</xref>). The decay of IBV did not match its resistance to RH in aerosols, which may suggest a role for aerosolization mechanism or droplet size in resistance to RH-dependent decay, although the duration of the incubation for aerosols was half as long as for droplets. The decay of HBE cell-grown IBV was significantly greater (two-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] with Bonferroni&#x02019;s multiple-comparison test) than that of HBE cell-grown Perth H3N2 at 55% RH. In addition, we did not observe a &#x0003e;2 log<sub>10</sub> decay for H1N1pdm or Perth H3N2 viruses grown in HBE cells under any RH condition. These results, as well as our observation that there was not a significant difference in decay between MDCK cell-grown IBV and HBE cell-grown IBV, in contrast to our observations with H1N1pdm, suggest that IAV and IBV isolates may respond differently to RH in droplets.

We found that stability of airborne IV in aerosols and droplets is not unique to H1N1pdm as previously reported (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) but is a trait shared by other seasonal IV isolates representative of currently circulating epidemic viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). However, a discord remains between these findings and historical evidence that suggests that the stability of IV in the environment can be influenced by RH (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We now provide a more refined explanation of the relationship between IV stability and RH that considers other factors, including virus strain background and time. We found that RH-mediated decay of seasonal IV varies with virus strain and propagation method, suggesting a role for virus- and host-specific factors in the maintenance of stability in the environment. To lend further support to this model, we have also found that the persistence of infectious virus in droplets over extended periods of time varies with RH and virus strain background.</p><p>Among seasonal IV, we identified differences between isolates of IBV and H3N2. Both viruses were stable in fine aerosols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>), but IBV decayed significantly more than H3N2 in stationary droplets at 55% RH based on our statistical tests. Important distinctions between these two experiments are that (i) IV aerosolized into the drum were supplemented with ASL from HBE cells rather than being grown in HBE cells and that (ii) the viral aerosols were exposed to each RH for only 1&#x02009;h in the rotating drum. These results, together with data from our previously published work (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), indicate that seasonal IV have the potential to remain highly stable and infectious while suspended in the atmosphere and also that aerosol or droplet size may be an important determinant of viral stability in the environment.</p><p>Among the IV exposed to a range of RH conditions in stationary droplets, all viruses responded to RH with generally more stability at low and high RH and the most decay under midrange conditions. However, the degrees of decay at midrange RH differed among the strains. Previous studies exploring the levels of stability of IAV and IBV smeared onto plastic (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and banknotes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) indicated that IAV tend to be more stable than IBV at midrange RH, but variations in ambient RH, virus suspension medium, mode of surface deposition, and surface material make direct comparisons difficult. In our study, virus strain and propagation method affected the degree to which each virus decayed under these conditions. Growth in HBE cells protected pre- and post-2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses from decay at midrange RH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</xref> in the supplemental material). In contrast, we found that HBE cell-grown Perth H3N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref>) and IBV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>) decayed similarly to their MDCK cell-grown counterparts, although IBV may be more sensitive to RH than the seasonal IAV tested here. Much less is known about transmission of IBV than about that of IAV, although its spread may be driven primarily by children through direct contact (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). A recent study identified a correlation between IAV transmission efficiency and persistence of aerosolized virus infectivity in a ferret model (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Further studies will be required to determine whether there is also a causal relationship between RH sensitivity and seasonal transmission cycles of epidemic IV.</p><p>We have shown that, similarly to the RH sensitivity results, the persistence of infectious IV over time varied with virus strain background and with RH. For example, the rate of decay of H1N1pdm in droplets did not increase for up to 16&#x02009;h after deposition at midrange RH, while both Perth H3N2 and IBV continued to decay over time under all RH conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Previous studies explored the persistence of IV, although never with viruses grown in primary human airway cells. Previous work showed that MDCK cell-grown H3N2 viruses can remain stable for up to 2&#x02009;days following inoculation of a banknote, with persistence extended to days (IBV) or weeks (H3N2) under conditions of supplementation with human nasopharyngeal secretions (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Importantly, both that previous study and our work demonstrated that infectious IV have the potential to persist on surfaces for extended periods of time. However, we have also shown that this persistence is closely linked to both atmospheric conditions and virus strain. The impact of other factors, such as deposition surface material, will also need to be considered in future studies of viruses in physiological droplets.</p><p>In contrast to seasonal IV, LPAI viruses, including avH6N1 and avH9N2, have not caused pandemic outbreaks in people (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). As with seasonal IV, infectious avian IAV have been shown to persist for days on various surfaces, although the RH at which these experiments were conducted was not noted (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In our study, both of these viruses were highly sensitive to 55% RH in droplets following preparation in either MDCK or HBE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). Additionally, we showed that HBE cell-grown avH6N1, but not avH9N2, was significantly less stable in droplets at midrange RH than any of the other human-pathogenic seasonal IV tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>), suggesting that host species origin may contribute to the viral determinants of RH sensitivity. The interaction between IV and ASL under this critical midrange RH condition, including investigations of the role of ASL content in the environmental persistence of IV, will be the focus of future studies. The variations in the sensitivities of these seasonal IV and LPAI to midrange RH that we observed hints at a link between viral factors and the maintenance of viral infectivity outside the host which may impact the transmissibility of H6N1 and H9N2 LPAI viruses (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We do provide evidence for a link between HA receptor specificity and viral persistence in stationary droplets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS8">Fig.&#x000a0;S8</xref>), although further studies performed with additional mutants will be required to fully define this relationship. Other known determinants of IV transmissibility include viral surface protein function/stability and genomic background (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Integrational studies of these viral factors under various sets of environmental conditions will be required provide a framework for clarifying the mechanisms driving airborne transmission and may be useful for assessing the transmissibility or pandemic potential of emerging zoonotic IV without the need for animal model systems.</p><p>Here, we have clarified the relationship between RH and the stability of seasonal IV and LPAI strains resembling those that would be released into the environment from the airway of an infected person. This report provides a distinction between IV strains and virus stability in response to propagation method and specific environmental parameters. Aerosolized seasonal IV are highly resistant to RH-dependent decay, which suggests that removing them via increased air exchange rates, filtration, or UV germicidal irradiation may be critical to reducing the transmission of these viruses indoors. We found that RH is important for the stability of IV on surfaces but also that infectious viruses have the potential to persist on surfaces for hours in physiological droplets, reinforcing the need for surface decontamination in high-risk environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cells and viruses.</title><p>Primary HBE cells derived from human lung tissue were cultured at an air-liquid interface using an institutional review board-approved protocol (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
