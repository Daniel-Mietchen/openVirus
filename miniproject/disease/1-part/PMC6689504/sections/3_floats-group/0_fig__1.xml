  <title>Expression of GFP and rHA in tobacco and lettuce. (A, B) Visualization of GFP expression by geminiviral vector system in tobacco (A), red lettuce and green lettuce (B) using ultra violet light. (C) Immunodetection of rHA in tobacco and lettuce leaves being agroinfiltrated with HA in geminiviral vector. (D) Quantification of the rHA yield in tobacco. Western blot analyses were performed using polyclonal anti-H3N2 HA antibody. ‘Housekeeping protein’ Rubisco, detected by Coomassie staining analysis, is shown as a loading control. N, 
   <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves; L, 
   <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> leaves; rHA, recombinant hemagglutinin; TSP, total soluble protein; cHA, commercial hemagglutinin (H3N2) of partial segment; GFP, green fluorescent protein.
