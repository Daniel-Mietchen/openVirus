<p>In view of the possible impact of different glycosylation patterns of the rHA in its surface affinity, antigenicity, and efficacy of the vaccine, we were interested in producing CIV rHA with different glycosylation patterns. We fused the full length of rHA with the ER retention signal, KDEL to prevent the entry of rHA into the Golgi apparatus where the complex glycosylation occurs. To confirm and to compare the production of rHA without complex glycan by KDEL, we expressed the full length of rHA with native signal peptide as well (N-SP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Geminiviral vector harboring rHA with native signal peptide or KDEL signal (KDEL) were infiltrated to both tobacco and lettuce leaves and the expressed proteins were analyzed in western blot. rHA protein was produced in the presence of either native signal peptide or KDEL signal in both tobacco and lettuce (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). However, the size of the rHA protein expressed with KDEL is smaller than that produced with the native signal peptide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). KDEL signal retains rHA in the ER avoiding the further addition of the carbohydrate on rHA. In this case, the rHA protein size is proportional to the basal glycans being added in the ER. On the other hand, the native signal peptide with HA produced rHA protein of size around 75 kDa which is approximately 11 kDa bigger than the calculated size (64 kDa) of HA most possibly because of extra molecular weight of complex glycans added to HA by glycosylation in Golgi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). We checked for the glycosylation sites in HA by using online glycosylation prediction site 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dtu.dk/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.dtu.dk</ext-link> and found 6 N-glycosylation sites in asparagine residues (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is interesting to observe the higher level of basal-glycosylated rHA production in lettuce than in tobacco, whereas higher level of complex-glycosylated rHA in tobacco (
