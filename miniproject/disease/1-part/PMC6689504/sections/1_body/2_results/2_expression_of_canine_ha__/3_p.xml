<p>We further cloned the full length of the HA with the native signal peptide in pBYR11ek2Md vector and transiently expressed them in grocery-purchased lettuce (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The expression level of rHA was determined 4-day-after infiltration by the western blot and probed with H3N2 HA-specific antibody. The rHA was successfully expressed in lettuce which was shown by the protein band in lettuce as similar to tobacco protein in the western blot; however, the higher level of rHA protein was produced in tobacco (
