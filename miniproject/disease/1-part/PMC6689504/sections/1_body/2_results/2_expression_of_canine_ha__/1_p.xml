<p>We then expressed rHA in an edible host plant lettuce which is amenable for the development of plant-produced oral vaccines. Lettuce offers an economical, quick and cold-chain free oral vaccine production platform. Although, transgenic expression system has been used to express the vaccine candidate protein against the human infectious viral disease in the lettuce, there is only a few report on transient expression of influenza vaccine candidate in lettuce [
