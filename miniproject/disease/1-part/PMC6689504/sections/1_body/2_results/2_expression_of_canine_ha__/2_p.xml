<p>We intended to express the rHA in lettuce because it can be further developed into a quick and inexpensive vaccine production system for pandemic and seasonal CIV. The production of vaccine antigen in lettuce could be especially more accountable at the time of emergency if we also could use the grocery lettuce for the transient production of a vaccine protein. Hence, we first tested whether geminiviral expression systems do express a recombinant protein in the lettuce bought from grocery stores. We vacuum-infiltrated the agrobacterium harboring the GFP in geminiviral vector (pBYR2eK2Md) into red lettuce head purchased from grocery store and green lettuce grown in the lab hydroponics system. The geminiviral vector system successfully worked for the GFP in the red lettuce head and green lettuce (
