<p>To test whether the codon-optimized sequences of HA (H3N2) can be translated into recombinant protein in plant system, we expressed the HA gene in 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, a well-established host plant for the production of the plant-based pharmaceutics. To this end, we cloned the full length of HA into the geminiviral vector expression system. The geminiviral vector expression system, pBYR11ek2Md is based on bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV), a DNA virus replicon system, to replicate huge amount of DNA template which produces the higher level of heterologous protein after transcription and translation in plant cell [

 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> harboring HA-carrying geminiviral vector was infiltrated into the tobacco leaves with the needless syringe or vacuum pump and the expression pattern was evaluated at the protein level. GFP-containing geminiviral vector, pBYR2eK2Md was also infiltrated as an expression control for the agroinfiltration procedure and monitor plant growth after infiltration (

The extracted protein from the infiltrated leaves was resolved in SDS-PAGE gel and HA protein was detected by western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-influenza H3N2 HA antibody. The rHA was successfully expressed in tobacco leaves as revealed by the presence of strong protein band in the western blot (
