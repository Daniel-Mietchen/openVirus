<p>Our result showed that commercially available lettuce head can be used to produce influenza antigen when geminiviral vector system was employed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This platform carries a great value for the quick response to the influenza outbreak and pandemic owing to the rapid production of influenza vaccine reducing the time required for the preparation of host plant. Though tobacco performs better and is widely used for the production of plant-based pharmaceutical, the high level of nicotine and other secondary metabolite makes the downstream process of purification and regulatory approval necessary. So, we explored the use of the rapidly growing lettuce for geminiviral mediated transient expression which can be applicable for robust and safe vaccine production since lettuce is edible and generally regarded as safe, making the downstream purification simple and inexpensive. Lettuce has the potential for the development of needleless vaccine and cold-chainless vaccine distribution system. In support of this notion, lettuce produced exendin-4 (EX4) fused with cholera toxin B subunit has showed decreased glucose level in mouse when fed with a lyophilized leaf material [
