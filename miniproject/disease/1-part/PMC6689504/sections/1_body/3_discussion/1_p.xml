<p>The goal of this study is to accomplish the transient expression of influenza HA antigen from A/canine/Korea/S3001/2015/H3N2 strain in the plant that can be developed into a vaccine. Multiple factors are responsible for the optimum expression of heterologous protein in the plant. We considered the species-specific codon usage, expression vectors system, secretion signal peptide, protein cellular compartmentation and host plant in our experiments. Viral codon of HA (H3N2) was modified to adjust codon usage by tobacco and lettuce on the basis of the codon usage table. The codon sequences not used by highly expressing protein Rubisco and ubiquitin were either avoided or maintained at a minimum in HA.</p>
