 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> harboring the respective vector was cultured in yeast extract peptone medium containing kanamycin (50 mg/L), rifampicin (50 mg/L), and gentamicin (50 mg/mL) at 28℃ for overnight with 200 rpm to get the cell concentration around 1.6–1.8 optical density (O.D.). Bacterial cell density was determined by measuring O.D. at 600 nm. The agrobacterium cells were then collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 7 minutes at 4℃. Then, the pellet was re-suspended in the infiltration buffer (10 mM MES-KOH [pH 5.7], 10 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>·7H
 <sub>2</sub>O) to give the O.D.
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.2. 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> of 6- to 7-week-old, grocery-purchased red lettuce, and hydroponically-grown green lettuce were used for agroinfiltration. Agroinfiltration was done either by 1 mL syringe without needle for an individual leaf, or vacuum for the whole plant completely submerging them within a desiccator and applying vacuum for 2 minutes for tobacco and 5 minutes for lettuce at 70 mbar to allow the infiltration of agrobacteria into the apoplast spaces of submerged plant tissue. The leaf surface was washed after infiltration, then grown those infiltrated plants in 25℃, 50% humidity environment with a 16:00/8:00-hour day/night cycle.
