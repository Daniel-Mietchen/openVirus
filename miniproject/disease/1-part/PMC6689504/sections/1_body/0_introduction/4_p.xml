<p>In this study, we investigated whether HA from Korean canine influenza strain A/canine/Korea/S3001/2015H3N2 can be expressed in 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and edible leafy plant 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> by using DNA viral vector systems. Recombinant HA (rHA) was successfully expressed in both the two plants. The fusion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal, KDEL at C-terminal of HA sequence produced the basal-glycosylated rHA while the native signal peptide of HA at N terminus of HA produced the complex-glycosylated rHA in tobacco and lettuce.
