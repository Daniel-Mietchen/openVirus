<p>At present, inactivated vaccines are produced either in egg or other animal cell systems, however, these conventional methods have shortcomings such as high production cost, long production time, and chance of human pathogen contamination, to name a few. Alternatively, the recombinant subunit vaccines from the plant-based production system may offer a novel platform for its safe, rapid, stable, consistence and scalable production. The vaccine production time could be further reduced by using instantly available plant biomass like lettuce leaves as a host cells. Also, lettuce can be used as an edible vaccine platform that does not require the need for trained personnel for immunization and cold chain distribution. The advancement of the transgenic lettuce produced hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine into a clinical trial (phase I) has proved the lettuce as an attractive and efficient host plant [
