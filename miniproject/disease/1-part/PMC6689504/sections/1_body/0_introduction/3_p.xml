<p>Influenza hemagglutinin (HA), a surface glycoprotein is the main target for subunit vaccine development because HA is the major viral antigen and it plays an important role in receptor binding and membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, HA glycoprotein is also capable of assembling in VLP in plant by mimicking the native virus-like structure and it exhibits effective immunogenicity [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HA vaccine with varying glycosylation pattern could be produced in plant by genetic engineering of the genes involved in glycosylation pathway. Many vaccine antigens for the various strain and subtype of human (H1N1, H3N2) and avian influenza (H5N1) have been expressed transiently in 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and advanced to the different phases of clinical trial [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, there is no report on the canine influenza vaccine antigen expressed in plant.
