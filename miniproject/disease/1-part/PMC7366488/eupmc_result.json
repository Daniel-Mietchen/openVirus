    "Purpose of reviewWe aim to provide the readers an up-to-date knowledge of the structure, epidemiology, and transmission followed by a detailed discussion on testing, diagnostics and management of hepatitis E virus infection. We have also included a comprehensive review of hepatitis E in pregnancy.Recent findingsEuropean Association for the Study of the Liver established clinical practice guidelines for testing and treatment of suspected hepatitis E virus infections in 2018. Evidence suggests chronic hepatitis E may follow a course similar to hepatitis B/C with progression to cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma in immunocompromised patients.SummaryHepatitis E virus is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. A combination of serology and nucleic acid amplification testing is the recommended strategy for suspected patients. Ribavirin therapy for a period of 3 months is the drug of choice for severe acute hepatitis, acute-on chronic liver failure, and chronic infections from hepatitis E virus in immunocompromised patients who are unresponsive to decreased immunosuppression. PEGylated interferon α can be used for ribavirin-resistant liver transplant patients with chronic hepatitis E. Further research in therapeutic options is essential considering the stormy course of hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and teratogenicity of all available options."
