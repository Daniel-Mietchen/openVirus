<p>Although no locally acquired CHIKV cases have been reported to date in Australia, the increasing number of infected travellers from endemic regions has become an important public health consideration for areas where the vectors are established, particularly in North Queensland, Australia where local transmission of dengue viruses occurs periodically [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Indeed, imported dengue cases have led to autochthonous dengue outbreaks in North Queensland [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] started reporting chikungunya virus infection in 2008, imported cases to Australia have been recorded [

 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases have been related to the behaviours of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that the occurrence of CHIKV outbreaks might be associated with El Niño events in India and Indonesia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To facilitate CHIKV risk assessment, it is important to understand the pattern of imported cases into Australia. We aimed to investigate the temporal pattern of imported CHIKV cases relative to the pattern of overseas arrivals, as well as identify whether variability in ENSO can predict the import of CHIKV cases in Australia.
