<p>CHIKV is a notifiable disease in Australia and suspected cases are laboratory confirmed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Monthly imported CHIKV cases were collected from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] for the period from January 2008 to December 2017. The data can be accessed from the Australian Government Department of Health website (

Data on yearly imported CHIKV cases by country of acquisition were only available from 2013 to 2017 on the Australia Government Department of Health website (

We also obtained the monthly imported CHIKV cases from New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (Qld), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (Tas), Victoria (Vic), Western Australia (WA) and Northern Territory (NT), in order to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of monthly imported CHIKV cases among different states and territories across Australia. The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) did not report cases between January 2008 and December 2017. In Australia, the majority of imported CHIKV cases were acquired from the Pacific region, Southeast Asia and South and Central Asia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, we used data on the monthly number of overseas arrivals from those areas between January 2008 and December 2017. The overseas arrivals included all recorded movements across the Australian international border [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The overseas arrivals data are available from Australian Bureau of Statistics website (
