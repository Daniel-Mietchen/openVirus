<p>Interestingly, the timing of the lowest seasonal effects exhibited a noticeable difference. For example, the weakest seasonal effects on monthly imported CHIKV cases occurred each August, followed by May and September, while monthly overseas arrivals were at their lowest in each June, followed by February and May. Almost all countries of acquisition identified in our study experience a tropical and subtropical climate and many experience a dry season from June to September (e.g. Fiji, Kiribati, Indonesia, Malaysia, Samoa, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines). Most of India experiences very hot summer weather during April to September [
