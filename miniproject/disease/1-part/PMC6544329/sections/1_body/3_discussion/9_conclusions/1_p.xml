<p>We found that the geographical distribution of countries of acquisition has expanded significantly, with the frequency and number of imported CHIKV cases into Australia increasing in recent years. Although the timing of the highest seasonal peak imported cases was consistent with overseas arrivals, the lowest seasonal peak overseas arrivals did not result in the lowest seasonal peak imported cases in Australia. The present study can provide useful information for understanding the seasonality of CHIKV risk and guide surveillance for health authorities at corresponding times of the year. Messaging might be tailored to particular seasons, importation pathways and epidemics in key countries of acquisition. It is likely that the dynamics of imported cases are related to the behaviours of ENSO. Our results suggest that climate could be a potential important driver of CHIKV epidemics and that ENSO behaviours could be a useful predictor to forecast mosquito-borne disease epidemics in endemic countries.</p>
