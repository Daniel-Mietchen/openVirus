<p>From the seasonal decomposition analysis, although the seasonal patterns of monthly imported CHIKV cases and monthly overseas arrivals were not fully synchronized, we observed the seasonal effects on both imported CHIKV cases and overseas arrivals to be strongest each January, followed by October and July. It is likely that the summer holiday period might facilitate the number of imported CHIKV cases due to returning international travellers during the peak Australian vacation season. Additionally, the second and third highest seasonal factor values occurred in each October and July, periods that coincide with Australian school and university holidays.</p>
