<p>The relationship between arboviral transmission and temperature and rainfall is complex and regionally inconsistent [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, up to a threshold, temperature generally has a positive relationship with 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. abundance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Similarly, moderate rainfall is generally found to favour higher vector abundances [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. El Niño events are typically related to warm and dry weather conditions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moderate to high temperatures could facilitate increased CHIKV transmission because increasing temperature leads to a higher biting rate and shorter extrinsic incubation period for vector mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Conversely, extremely high temperature could increase the mortality rate of mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Increased SOI could lead to a decrease in the intensity of El Niño conditions during such events [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Thus, the positive relationship between the monthly imported CHIKV cases and the 6-month lagged moving average SOI suggested that moderate weather conditions under El Niño episodes might enhance the importation of CHIKV.
