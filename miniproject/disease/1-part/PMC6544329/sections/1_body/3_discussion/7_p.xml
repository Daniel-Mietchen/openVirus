<p>Conversely, we also observed significant negative relationships between the number of monthly imported CHIKV cases and the 6-month lagged moving average SOI for the period May-August 2012 and the period January-April 2014. For these periods, an increase in SOI was likely to decrease the number of monthly imported CHIKV cases under neutral ENSO conditions (i.e. absence of La Niña or El Niño). Increased SOI could increase the chance of a La Niña event developing during the neutral ENSO period. La Niña typically leads to cold temperature and heavy rain weather conditions. Heavy rainfall could flush out mosquito breeding sites [

Conversely, neutral ENSO conditions that lead to equable weather conditions with low to moderate rainfall may lead to increased CHIKV transmission risk. It is interesting that in the period from 2012–2014 a series of CHIKV epidemics occurred in the Pacific [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], which led to large numbers of imported CHIKV cases into Australia. Our results suggest that ENSO behaviours could drive local environmental conditions, which lead to changes in the patterns of local CHIKV epidemics in different endemic regions.
