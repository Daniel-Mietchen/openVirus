<p>There were 730 imported CHIKV cases from 2008 to 2017 in Australia. The largest number of monthly imported CHIKV cases was 31 cases in January 2015. The largest number of annual imported CHIKV cases occurred in 2013 (134 cases), followed by 2016 (114 cases), 2015 (111 cases) and 2014 (110 cases). The mean of monthly imported CHIKV cases was 6.08 (range: 0–31) during the study period across Australia and varied between states (

Excluding 13 cases with unknown or unclear provenance, the five countries most frequently reported as location of CHIKV acquisition from 2013 to 2017 were Indonesia (33.27% of imported cases), India (20.25%), Samoa (8.27%), Bangladesh (6.34%) and Philippines (4.05%) (

There were eight countries of acquisition in 2013, including Indonesia (95 cases), Papua New Guinea (15 cases), India (11 cases), Philippines (6 cases), Thailand (3 cases), Singapore (2 cases), Malaysia (1 case) and Nepal (1 case). However, after 2013, the number of source countries of imported CHIKV cases substantially increased and ranged from 15 to 24 countries per year. Since 2014, the geographical distribution of countries of acquisition has expanded from Southeast Asia, South and Central Asia and Southwest Pacific region to include Eastern Africa, Western Africa, Southern Africa, North America, Central America, South America and the south Pacific regions (
