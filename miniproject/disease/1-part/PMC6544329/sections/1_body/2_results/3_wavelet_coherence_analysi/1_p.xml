<p>The wavelet coherence analysis captured some significant transient relationships between monthly imported CHIKV cases and the 6-month lagged moving average SOI in the time frequency space. The heat map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007376.g006">Fig 6</xref>) shows in which periods there were significant correlations between the two time series at a given point in time. The monthly imported number of CHIKV cases was significantly positively associated with the 6-month lagged moving average SOI with a slight lead phase, with a period of ~ 3.5–6 months from December 2009 to October 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007376.g006">Fig 6</xref>). There were significant negative relationships between the monthly imported CHIKV cases and the 6-month lagged moving average SOI, with a period of ~ 2–3 months during May to August 2012 with a slight lag phase, and with a period of ~ 2–2.5 months from January to April 2014 with a slight lead phase. The numbers of monthly imported CHIKV cases were significantly and positively related to the 6-month lagged moving average SOI, with a period of ~ 2.6–3.8 months from November 2015 to June 2016.
