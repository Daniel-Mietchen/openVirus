<p>Three- to 5-day-old F1 female mosquitoes were placed into 500 mL cardboard containers and sucrose-starved for 48 hours before being exposed to an infectious artificial blood meal (
 <bold>Hemotek</bold> Ltd, UK) using BALB/c mouse skins obtained from the University of Texas Medical Branch Animal Resource Center, as membranes. The blood meal contained a 33% volume of washed sheep erythrocytes and a 33% volume of a cell culture-derived virus stock supplemented with 21% FBS, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a final concentration of 0.005 M as a phagostimulant, and sucrose at a final concentration of 10%. After feeding for up to 60 minutes, the remaining blood meal was kept at– 80 °C for virus titration using plaque assay then mosquitoes were cold-anaesthetized and fully engorged specimens were incubated with 10% sucrose at 27°±1°C, a relative humidity of 70–75% and 12:12 h (Light:Dark) photoperiod.
