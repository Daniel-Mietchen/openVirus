<p>These important changes summarized above in the epidemiological African profile of DEN are occurring in a context where there is no vaccine against DENV recommended for all populations. Furthermore, there is a significant gap of knowledge on DENV vector bionomics and transmission dynamics in Africa to effectively prevent and control epidemics. The vector competence of mosquitoes associated with DENV in nature is poorly characterized. Except for DENV-2 [
