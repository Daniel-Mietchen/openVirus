<p>Following the 2009 Dakar DENV-3 epidemic, we initiated a vector competence study to evaluate the ability of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations from Dakar and Kedougou to transmit DENV-1 and -3, for which there is no evidence of enzootic, sylvatic circulation in Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; these two serotypes appear to circulate only in an endemic/epidemic cycle with peridomestic human amplification. Our prior results showed low susceptibility to DENV-3 but high infection and dissemination rates with DENV-1. However, the oral DENV doses used were low and transmission potential was not tested. Furthermore, only 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was tested and vector competence data for sylvatic vectors were generated for DENV-1, -3 and -4. Thereby the present study assessed the vector competence of Senegalese 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>furcifer</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>taylori</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>luteocephalus</italic> for DENV-1, -3 and -4.
