<p id="Par14">Although CFAV was discovered more than 40 years ago in an infected 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> cell culture, its first detection in mosquito pools was in Puerto Rico in 2006 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The virus was then detected in Thailand in 2007 and 2013 [14,1 9], Indonesia in 2009 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Mexico in 2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], in Brazil and Australia in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and in Africa in 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In a previous study, we detected the presence of CFAV in two 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from Texas using a microarray developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although CFAV has been detected in the field on multiple occasions, few studies have provided an estimate of the infection rate in field populations of mosquitoes. Our study reveals the presence of CFAV throughout the year in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> collected using AGO traps in the LRGV (mean IR for 2017 = 54.5, mean IR for 2018 = 56.0) and at least from May to July for the San Antonio population collected using BGS2 traps (mean IR for 2017 = 208.6, mean IR for 2018 = 166.8). This study provides evidence that CFAV is widely distributed in Texas, although a direct comparison of IRs was not possible among the LRGV and San Antonio sites given that BGS2 trapping was performed at different time points. A previous study also documented CFAV in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes collected in Galveston, TX, in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], adding to the overall picture of the geographic distribution of CFAV in Texas. Infection rates of CFAV were previously reported in an 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito population from Thailand at a much lower rate, with an IR of 6.2 (n = 2110) in 2008 and 8.2 (n = 1944) in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Differences in IRs could be due to the methodology used. In our study, mosquito homogenates were tested by PCR using gene-specific primers, whereas in the other study, mosquito homogenates were first screened for cytopathic effect in C6/36 cells, and only positive samples were tested by PCR using a pan-flavivirus assay followed by sequencing. Another insect-specific virus that infects 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes, Culex flavivirus (CxFV), has received more research attention, and studies of infection rates and seasonality have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a study done in Iowa (USA), CxFV was not detected from May to June but occurred from July to October, while in Texas, the virus was detected from November to March with no detection during the months of April to August. A possible explanation for this seasonality relates to the overall number of mosquitoes collected and tested, which was reported for CxFV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Aedes flavivirus (AeFV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] . In our study, an absence of CFAV was observed in the month of February 2018, when only nine pools (10 individual mosquitoes) were available for testing.
