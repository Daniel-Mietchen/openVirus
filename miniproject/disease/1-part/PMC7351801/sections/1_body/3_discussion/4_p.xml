<p id="Par17">To date, only one report has shown coinfection with CFAV and DENV (DENV-4) in field-collected mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In that study, mosquitoes (n = 93) were collected in the homes of DENV-infected patients, which might have increased the probability of detecting coinfection. No evidence of coinfection between CFAV and ZIKV or CHIKV has been observed. Our samples were tested previously for ZIKV and CHIKV during an arbovirus surveillance study from 2016 to 2018 and none were positive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several ISVs have demonstrated their importance in the modulation of the transmission of certain pathogens. For example, CxFV and Nhumirim virus both have the capacity to modulate WNV transmission by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The ability of CFAV to influence DENV replication has been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and its ability to influence arboviral disease transmission has been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for ZIKV and DENV by intrathoracic injection. In those studies, a reduction in arbovirus transmission was observed. Hence, if these observations are confirmed in the context of a natural infection (as opposed to intrathoracic injection), the low number of cases observed in the LRGV during the 2016-2017 ZIKV outbreak could be at least partially explained by the presence of CFAV in the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population in that area. Therefore, additional studies on the geographic prevalence of CFAV in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations in Texas could help with the prediction of emergence of arboviral disease in the region.
