<p id="Par15">The infection rate of CFAV in the LRGV was compared using two trap types, AGO and BGS2. CFAV IRs from BGS2 traps were higher than those from AGO traps. IRs from BGS2 traps were 1.1 – 5.7 times higher than those from AGO traps. BGS2 traps were originally developed to target host-seeking females and contents of the trap must be inspected after 24 h of trapping [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], while AGO traps mainly target gravid females for which the contents of the trap can be checked weekly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. While the lower rates of infection in the AGO-collected mosquito pools could have been due to degradation of the viral RNA after a week of trapping, it is also possible that the physiological status of the females collected in the different traps influences the IR. In our study, gravid females did indeed harbor fewer viral particles than unfed females. This represents an unique observation, because very few studies have documented arboviral loads in naturally infected females from the field, in part because infected individuals are rarely detected and as a result are typically tested in pools to reduce costs [

 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> colony naturally infected in Colorado [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that traps targeting gravid females should have a higher viral IR than traps targeting host-seeking females, given that gravid females are more likely to be on average older than unfed females and more likely to have had at least one bloodmeal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. While some studies comparing the West Nile virus IRs between gravid and unfed female 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes did confirm this hypothesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], other studies found no statistical differences or opposite results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. One possible explanation for the reduced viral loads in gravid females could be that the immune response in gravid females is different from that in unfed females. Variation in the mosquito immune response has been demonstrated following the ingestion of the bloodmeal or the production of eggs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Also, we found variation in the individual virus load, with some mosquitoes harboring a low number of genome equivalent while others had higher copy numbers. This reflects the natural variation in the involvement of mosquitoes when mounting an immune response to CFAV infection. While AGO traps have been developed as mosquito population surveillance and control tools, we demonstrated that samples from this trap can also be used for viral surveillance. Due to its cost efficiency and reduced equipment and labor requirements, this study suggests that the AGO trap is a viable option for monitoring vector populations for viral infection, especially in remote locations or developing countries.
