<p id="Par3">Arbovirus disease transmission has been observed to vary from region to region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, DENV transmission in Tamaulipas, Mexico, during an epidemic period can amount to thousands of cases, while on the other side of the border in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, United States, very few cases are recorded [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Disease dynamics are influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors among which the presence of microbes in the mosquito vector could enhance or reduce viral transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the last decade, insect-specific viruses (ISVs) in mosquitoes have been shown to modulate the transmission of human pathogens (reviewed in reference [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). However, ISVs can only infect and replicate in insect cells, causing no disease in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The first ISV discovered was cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) (1974), which belongs to the classical ISVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Since its isolation from a natural mosquito population in Puerto Rico, United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], CFAV has been reported in multiple other countries, including Thailand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Indonesia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While CFAV has been detected in field-collected mosquitoes, we are still lacking information regarding the prevalence and seasonality of infection in natural mosquito populations. In this study, we describe the infection rate of CFAV in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) and San Antonio, TX. Additionally, we evaluate the correlation of trap type, sex, and physiological status with the infection rate (IR) and the viral load in individual male and female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.
