<p id="Par5">In this study, we tested new samples from the LRGV and San Antonio (see above) using a conventional PCR assay with specific primers targeting a portion of the envelope gene of CFAV and a SuperScript
 <sup>TM</sup> IV VILO 
 <sup>TM</sup> Master Mix with ezDNase
 <sup>TM</sup> Enzyme Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) to screen 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito pools and individuals for CFAV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Briefly, 0.5 µl of ezDNase and 0.5 µl of 10X ezDNAse Buffer were added to 4 µL of RNA to remove genomic DNA from the RNA preparation (2 min at 37 °C). Five microliters of the cleaned RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript
 <sup>TM</sup> IV VILO 
 <sup>TM</sup> Master Mix. Two microliters of a 1:10 dilution of the cDNA was then amplified by PCR using the following cycling parameters: 94 °C for 3 min, 38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 8 min.
