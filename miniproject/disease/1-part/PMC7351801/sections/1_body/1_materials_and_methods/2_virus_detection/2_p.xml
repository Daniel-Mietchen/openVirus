<p id="Par6">PCR products were run on 2 % agarose gel for 20 min, and positive samples were purified using Exo SAP-IT PCR Product Cleanup (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and sequenced. The sequences that were obtained were aligned, cleaned, and subjected to a BLAST search against the NCBI database using Geneious version 9.1.8. Sequences showing more than 98% identity were assigned to viral species. Additionally, positive samples were confirmed using a second PCR assay targeting the NS5 gene of CFAV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The cycling protocol consisted of 95 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and final elongation at 72 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 8 min. A subset of the amplicons were then sequenced by Eton Bioscience Inc. (San Diego, CA) using forward and reverse primers. To quantify the CFAV load in individual mosquitoes, we designed a gBlock (available upon request) to use as a standard for the qPCR analysis based on the PCR procedure described above [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and a complete genome sequence of CFAV (accession no. NC_001564) in Geneious. Briefly, we used a Power SYBR Green RNA-To-Ct 1 Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 5 µL of RNA, 1 µL of each forward and reverse primer at 10 µM with the following cycling protocol: 48 °C for 30 min; 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min.
