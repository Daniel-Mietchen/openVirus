<p id="Par4">Mosquito sampling using Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (AGO) in the LRGV of South Texas was performed in seven communities (Balli, Cameron, Mesquite, Chapa, Christian Ct., La Vista and Rio Rico) located in Hidalgo County and one community (La Bonita) in Cameron County (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Briefly, AGOs baited with hay infusion were deployed inside and outside homes and sampled weekly. For mosquito sampling, BG Sentinel 2 traps (BGS2) with BG Lure (Biogents AG, Regensburg, Germany) were deployed in the community of La Piñata, Donna, TX, at 50 and 15 private residences in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In San Antonio, TX, BGS2 traps were deployed at 10 (2017) and 27 (2018) private residences across different ecological and socio-economical regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In both La Piñata and San Antonio, mosquitoes were sampled weekly (set in the morning and retrieved about 24 hours later). The species and sex of the mosquitoes from the AGO and BGS2 traps were determined and the mosquitoes from the BGS2 traps were additionally sorted by physiological status, and pools were stored at -80 °C until virus testing. To test for CFAV, we used a subset of

Mosquito pools were homogenized in Hank’s buffer salt solution (HBSS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MS) using a Tissuelyser II (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and a stainless steel bead and then centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 rpm. Subsequently, RNA was extracted from 250 µL of supernatant using a MagMAX™ CORE Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Individual mosquitoes used for the quantification of CFAV in the natural population were processed using the same protocol.
