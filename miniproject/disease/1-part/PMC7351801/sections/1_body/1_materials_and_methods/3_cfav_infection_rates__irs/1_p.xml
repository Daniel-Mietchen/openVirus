<p id="Par7">We estimated the CFAV IRs using the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. IRs were calculated per month for the mosquitoes collected from the LRGV using AGO traps and per week for the mosquito collected from the LRGV and San Antonio using BGS2 traps. To allow direct comparison, IRs for mosquitoes collected using AGO traps in the LRGV were also calculated per week of study.
