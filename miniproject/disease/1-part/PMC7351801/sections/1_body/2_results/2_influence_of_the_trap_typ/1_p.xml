<p id="Par11">In order to compare the CFAV IR according to trap type, 138 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> female pools representing 1,013 mosquitoes captured in AGO traps and 379 pools representing 1,076 females captured in BGS2 traps were tested. Both trap types were set up from epidemiological week (EW) 37-46 of 2018 in several communities of Hidalgo and Cameron counties, allowing a direct comparison. Forty of the pools collected using AGO traps and 113 pools collected using BGS2 traps were positive for CFAV. The AGO IR averaged 48.4 (95% CI = 16.4-112.3) and the BGS2 IR averaged 122.6 (95% CI = 85.8-148.6) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Overall, the average IR was higher for the mosquitoes collected in BGS2 traps than for those collected in AGO traps (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). A week-to-week comparison showed a higher CFAV IR when mosquito pools were collected from BGS2 traps as compared to AGO traps, except for EW 40; however, the ratio of the number of CFAV-positive pools did not differ by trap type (
