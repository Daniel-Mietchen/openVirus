 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes collected during the EW 37 to 46 of 2018 with BGS2 traps in the LRGV were further analyzed by sex and physiological status. The CFAV IR ranged from 32 to 206 (in male mosquitoes average = 85.8 ± 17.7), from 58 to 261 in unfed females (average = 128 ± 16), and from 0 to 215 in gravid females (mean = 129 ± 19) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). While overall, the average IR in males was lower than in females, the difference was not significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08 compared to unfed females and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.09 compared to fed females). Additionally, the proportion of infected pools was not statistically different between the different groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
