<p id="Par13">The viral load in individual mosquitoes of different sex and physiological status collected from BGS2 traps in the LRGV was determined (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The viral titer is expressed as CFAV RNA genome equivalents. Overall, no statistical difference was observed between males (n = 10) and unfed females (n = 11; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.49). The CFAV load for males ranged from 1.25 x 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 5.50 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> RNA copies per mosquito, and for females from 5.42 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> to 8.70 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> RNA copies per mosquito. A statistical difference was observed between gravid females (3.29 x 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 3.53 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> RNA copies per mosquito) and unfed females (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0134) as well as between gravid females and males (
