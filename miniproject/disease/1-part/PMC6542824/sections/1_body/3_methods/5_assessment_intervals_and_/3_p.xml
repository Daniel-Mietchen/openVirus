<p id="Par25">For the analysis presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref>, the values 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 12 weeks, and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 24 weeks were used; however, the results are robust to the choice of 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>n</italic> (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The average multipliers 〈
 <italic>λ</italic>*〉 are compared with the subsequent outbreak magnitudes, yielding a correlation coefficient 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.71 with 
 <italic>p</italic> = 6 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>. The outbreak magnitude here is defined as the total number of reported cases within a year in the time period from outbreak onset to the beginning of the subsequent assessment interval. The robustness of the results was tested by computing the correlation coefficient 
 <italic>ρ</italic> and the 
 <italic>p</italic> value for a range of 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> values and 
 <italic>n</italic> values. The results of this robustness analysis are presented in Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. To simplify the robustness analysis, the outbreak magnitudes are defined as the total number of reported cases in the year following the outbreak onset.
