Emerging work on dengue epidemic outbreaks reveals a complex problem involving antigenic differences between and within serotypes, changes in human populations caused by immune adaptation and migration patterns, complex mosquito vector ecology, climate effects, changing transmissivity and viral evolution among others

 </sup>. However desirable as a scientific tool, an explicit and highly detailed model that includes such factors would have limited utility as a public health tool because of the difficult information it would require as inputs. Notwithstanding, when viewed as a dynamic systems problem such mechanistic information may already be contained and potentially accessible in other more readily obtainable observables such as incidence data

 </sup>. Although the epidemiological variable most targeted and most readily measured is the infection rate, the size of the susceptible pool (the total number of individuals at risk of infection) can also be important for determining outbreak magnitude, but directly measuring it is problematic and may not be feasible in advance of an outbreak. Indeed existing methods for susceptible reconstruction
