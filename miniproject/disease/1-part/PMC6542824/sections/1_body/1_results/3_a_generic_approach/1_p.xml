<p id="Par13">This prediction scheme is conceived to be generic for seasonal epidemics, and its performance will vary with the specifics of the disease, including how reliable the inter-outbreak data are (affected by the severity of the disease or lack thereof), the potential role of climatic drivers during the outbreak (such as the massive hurricane in 2017) and particularly how soon before the new outbreak the new virus has evolved (whether there is sufficient advance time to assess 
 <italic>λ</italic>*). To test its generality we examined records of influenza incidence gathered from the World Health Organization database, where we identified 27 countries with data having less than 80% missing values during the assessment periods (see Methods). The results summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> show positive correlations between the 
 <italic>λ</italic>*-based predictors and outbreak magnitudes for 26 of the 27 countries. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">32</xref> shows the corresponding analyses for data on influenza-like illness in New York City and in the mid-Atlantic Census division, with results that are consistent with the results of the country-level influenza data, and slightly better for New York City. The generally weaker predictive skill (defined as the Pearson correlation) in these data than for dengue in San Juan could be related to many factors including (1) differences in the severity of the diseases with possible under-reporting of influenza in the inter-disease periods; (2) the fact that the coarser country-level flu data are generally less suitable for detecting low-dimensional dynamics

 </sup>; (3) fundamental differences in the biology of the disease, such as a faster rate of evolution for the flu virus. (4) We also note that if novel strains of the influenza virus are introduced too close to onset of an outbreak, the assessment interval will not accurately reflect the susceptible pool, and the method should not perform. This was likely the case for countries in the southern hemisphere with respect to the 2009 swine-flu pandemic, a novel virus first described at the beginning of the southern hemisphere outbreak in April of that year (too late for estimating susceptibles there). However, in the northern hemisphere, the novel swine-flu signal arising by contagion from the south produced a clear dynamic signal over the summer inter-outbreak months in the north that allowed a good sampling of the dynamics to estimate the susceptible populations. This produced a skillful forecast of subsequent very large winter outbreaks in northern countries. The case can be seen by comparing Supplementary Figs.
