<p id="Par8">Note heuristically in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>) that climatic variability could drive the parameter 
 <italic>β</italic> and thereby influence 
 <italic>λ</italic>. Indeed, for continuous seasonally recurring epidemics, outbreaks are often thought of as being driven by climatic conditions that vary between seasons,  with some of the year-to-year variability in outbreak magnitude attributed to multiyear climate variability

 </sup>. Thus, it is reasonable to view changes in 
 <italic>λ</italic> immediately leading to the transition as being driven by slow changes in 
 <italic>β</italic> that reflect the pulse of the seasonal climatic drivers. Because one annual cycle consists of a stable inter-outbreak period (where 
 <italic>λ</italic> &lt; 0) followed by a critical transition as 
 <italic>λ</italic> becomes positive, 
 <italic>λ</italic> approaching 0 becomes an early-warning indication of the imminent outbreak

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a schematic illustration of this mixed modeling scheme using the SIR model in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>), with a seasonally varying (sinusoidal) 
 <italic>β</italic> with no inter-annual variability, and randomly reset values of 
 <italic>S</italic>.
