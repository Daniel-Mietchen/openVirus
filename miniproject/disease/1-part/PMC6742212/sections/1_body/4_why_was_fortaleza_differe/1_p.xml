<p>Fortaleza was not an outlier but a unique case of a proper surveillance response to emerging threats. In 2008, a Death Investigation Committee (including infectious disease specialists, virologists, and pathologists) was created by the state to review all dengue-suspected deaths, later expanded to include other arboviruses-suspected deaths. Therefore, all reported chikungunya-related deaths in Fortaleza were thoroughly analyzed by the committee; about 85% of the deaths have met case definition (acute fever and intense arthralgia) with at least one positive laboratory test for recent infection in vivo (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] and/or immunoglobulin M [IgM]) and/or postmortem confirmation (immunohistochemistry); the other 15% had clinical records and data from epidemiological investigation. In addition, the committee described the clinical course of patients in a timeline format between the onset of chikungunya symptoms and the death in order to try to establish an association between CHIKV infection and the recorded cause of death of each patient. The committeeâ€™s work supported by postmortem diagnosis substantially reduced the underreporting of deaths due to dengue, Zika virus, and chikungunya in Fortaleza [
