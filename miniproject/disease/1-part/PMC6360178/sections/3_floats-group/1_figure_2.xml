  <p>Flavivirus shedding after infection of pMoDC and hMoDC. 
   <bold>(A–D)</bold> Viral titers released from pMoDC and hMoDC after infection with the different Flaviviruses at a MOI of 0.1 TCID
   <sub>50</sub> per cell. Supernatants were collected at 24 
   <bold>(A,C)</bold> and 48 hpi 
   <bold>(D,B)</bold>. All Flaviviruses titers were quantified using in C6/36 cells. 
   <bold>(G,H)</bold> Relative ability of the viruses to replicate in human and porcine MoDC, shown as fold change of titers at 24 
   <bold>(G)</bold> and 48 
   <bold>(H)</bold> hpi. 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold> Ratio of viral titers from at 48 vs. 24hpi for pMoDC and hMoDC, respectively. All experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three, and up to seven times with cells from different donors. Each symbol represents a different blood donor. Results are presented as scatter plots showing the mean and all points. The different superscript letters in 
   <bold>(A–D)</bold> indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) between the different viruses. Fold change infected cells results are expressed in a logarithmic scale of base 2; for each infection condition significant differences between the calculated fold change and the reference level (equal to 0, dotted line) are indicated (
   <sup>*</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05; 
   <sup>**</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.002; 
   <sup>***</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001; 
   <sup>****</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001).
