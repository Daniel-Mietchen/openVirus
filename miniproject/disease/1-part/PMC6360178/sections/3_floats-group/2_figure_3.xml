  <p>Flavivirus induced cell death in pMoDC and hMoDC. MoDC were infected with different Flaviviruses at MOI of 0.1 TCID
   <sub>50</sub> per cell. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Gating strategy to eliminate doublets and quantify shrunken dead MoDC based on their forward/side scatter plots. Representative results are shown for Mock, JEV, and USUV. 
   <bold>(B–E)</bold> Difference between the percentage of the average of shrunken in the mock with the virus-challenged cells was calculated and represented as Δ Dead MoDC (%) and represented at 24 and 48 hpi for pMoDC (
   <bold>B,C</bold>, respectively) and hMoDC (
   <bold>D,E</bold>, respectively). Each symbol represents a different blood donor. Results are presented as scatter plots showing the mean and all points. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) between the percentages of dead MoDC induced by distinct viruses. 
   <bold>(F–I)</bold> Correlation analysis between the number of dead cells and E positive cells at 24 and 48 hpi for pMoDC 
   <bold>(F,G)</bold> d hMoDC 
   <bold>(H,I)</bold> calculated by Spearman's Rho analysis. Correlations are shown as linear regression, R
   <sup>2</sup> and 
   <italic>p</italic> values are indicated for each analysis.
