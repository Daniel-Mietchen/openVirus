  <p>Cytokine responses following infection of MoDC. 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> IFN-β levels in supernatants of pMoDC harvested at 24 and 48 hpi (
   <bold>A,B</bold>, respectively). 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> IFN-β levels in supernatants of hMoDC harvested at 24 and 48 hpi (
   <bold>C,D</bold>, respectively). 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold> TNF levels in supernatants of pMoDC harvested at 24 and 48 hpi (
   <bold>A,B</bold>, respectively). 
   <bold>(G,H)</bold> TNF levels in supernatants of hMoDC harvested at 24 and 48 hpi (
   <bold>C,D</bold>, respectively). Supernatants were derived from the cultures shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. TNF was quantified by ELISA. Each symbol represents a different blood donor. Results are presented as scatter plots showing the mean and all points. Different superscript letters indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) between the amount of TNF induced in MoDC by distinct Flaviviruses. 
   <bold>(I,J)</bold> Correlation between IFN-β and TNF for pMoDC at 24 and 48 hpi. 
   <bold>(K,J)</bold> Correlation between IFN-β and TNF for hMoDC at 24 and 48 hpi. For 
   <bold>I–L</bold>, correlations were calculated by Spearman's Rho analysis and are shown as linear regression, R
   <sup>2</sup> and 
   <italic>p-</italic>values are indicated for each analysis.
