<p>Despite the relatively broad host range, Flaviviruses have preferential vertebrate hosts, which differ in a virus-specific manner demonstrating adaptation to particular vertebrates. Examples are the preferences of JEV serocomplex viruses for birds, and in the case of JEV also for pigs, in which the virus causes several days of viremia, making the pig an amplifying host during epidemics (Turtle and Solomon, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). It is also important to note that dependent on the species the outcome of vertebrate infections ranges from inapparent infection to severe disease. For example, WNV and JEV can cause particularly severe disease in horses. Furthermore, particular vertebrates play an important role in maintaining the virus in the environment and therefore play a role as a “reservoir” (Kuno et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Despite the veterinary and public health threat caused by these viruses the knowledge on the viral and host factors responsible for species tropism and the above-mentioned pathogenic features of Flavivirus infection is very limited. A relevant cell culture system modeling early events in infection, such as replication and innate immune responses would be very valuable to address the above questions. Cell lines are problematic because differences in their susceptibility to infection and support of viral replication often depend more on the different cell lines rather than the species of origin, as documented for ZIKV (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This may be due to de-differentiation during their generation.
