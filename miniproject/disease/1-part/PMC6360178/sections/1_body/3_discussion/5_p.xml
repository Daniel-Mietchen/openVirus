<p>With respect to ZIKV, although the frequency of E protein expressing pMoDC was low, porcine cells supported ZIKV replication well, in absence of any detectable IFN-Î² and TNF response. These 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data could be in line with experimental studies showing that newborn piglets developed viremia between 3 and 5 days after intra-dermal inoculation with ZIKV (Darbellay et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). In accordance to previously published work, our data show that ZIKV replicates in hMoDC in a donor dependent manner and that this infection did not induce effective innate immune responses (Bowen et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Vielle et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
