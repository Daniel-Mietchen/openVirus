<p>Considering the dual host life with alternation between arthropods and vertebrates requiring adaptation to quite different hosts, it is not surprising that many mosquito-borne Flaviviruses, such as WNV and JEV can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Nevertheless, there are clearly preferential vertebrate hosts, which differ in a viruses-specific manner demonstrating adaptation to particular vertebrates. The present study was initiated, considering that the knowledge on virus adaptation is incomplete in terms of the degree of adaptation of some of the newly emerged and some of the more locally restricted and neglected Flavivirus to particular vertebrate species is unclear. Our aim was to identify virological and immunological factors involved using MoDC as 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model. To validate the model, we selected human and pigs. Altogether, our data demonstrate prominent differences in the rate of infection, released infectious virus and innate immune responses, which were dependent on both the host and the virus species. Considering this, the crucial question is how well do these differences recapitulate what is known about species tropism. For JEV we observed that pMoDC were more permissive and replicated to the highest titers at 48 h compared to the rest of the selected Flaviviruses, which appears to be in accordance with an enormous amount of field and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental data on pigs (Mansfield et al.,

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gupta et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The high seroconversion rate in endemic areas indicates that humans are indeed highly susceptible to JEV, although only few develop the disease. Nevertheless, human do not develop viremia of sufficient duration and intensity to re-infect feeding mosquitoes (Turtle and Solomon, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A possible explanation could be that the strong IFN-Î² response identified in MoDC would limit further virus replication and dissemination in most infected individuals. Of note, it has been speculated that in those patients developing encephalitis, infected monocytic cells could be the Trojan horse mediating transport of the virus across the blood-brain barrier (Lannes et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
