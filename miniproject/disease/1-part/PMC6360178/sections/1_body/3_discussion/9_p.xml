<p>Our results showing IFN-β and TNF following certain Flavivirus infections, are in accordance with previously published works indicating that hMoDC produce both TNF and IFN type I secretion during the infection by DENV or JEV (Sooryanarain et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Schmid et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, in our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental studies in pigs we could neither detected IFN-β nor TNF in serum samples (Ricklin et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Garcia-Nicolas et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This would suggest that the production of such cytokines by MoDC would be locally restricted. Porcine MoDC, secrete lower levels of IFN-β after JEV challenge than hMoDC, which is possibly due to a delayed exposure of JEV dsRNA in the cytosolic compartment of porcine MoDC as previously reported (Espada-Murao and Morita, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The observation that certain of the selected Flaviviruses such as ZIKV, SPOV, and WESSV did not induce innate immune responses despite good replication in hMoDC, indicates differences in the viruses' ability to evade innate immunity and raises the questions about the mechanisms. For instance, in ZIKV-infected cells the existence of subgenomic Flavivirus RNA has been related to the blocking of IFN type I transcription induced by RIG-I (Manokaran et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Villordo et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). For other Flaviviruses, such as JEV, DENV or ZIKV, NS2A, NS4A, NS4B or NS5 proteins were demonstrated to participate in evasion of the IFN type I system (Miorin et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Clearly, future studies are required to investigate how these different mechanisms of innate immune evasion contribute to the species tropism of distinct viruses.
