<p>Porcine and human MoDC (pMoDC and hMoDC, respectively) were generated as previously described (Carrasco et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Vielle et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Briefly, porcine blood was collected from specific pathogen free (SPF) Swiss Large White pigs breed in our own facilities. Then peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated using ficoll-paque density centrifugation (1.077 g/L; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Dübendorf, Switzerland). Human PBMC were isolated from buffy coats of anonymous healthy blood donors (Interregional blood transfusion SRC Ltd, Bern) by the same procedure described for porcine cells. Porcine monocytes were sorted as CD172a
 <sup>+</sup> cells using monoclonal antibody (mAb), clone 74-22-15A (hybridoma kindly provided by Dr. A. Saalmüller, Veterinary University of Vienna, Austria) and anti-Mouse IgG MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Human monocytes were sorted as CD14
 <sup>+</sup> cells using coated magnetic beads (human) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). For both species, we employed LS magnetic columns and the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec). Then porcine monocytes were cultured at 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cell/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing Glutamax (ThermoFisher Scientific, Zug, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% of FBS (Gibco), porcine GM-CSF (Summerfield et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and porcine IL-4 (100 U/ml, own production; Carrasco et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Similarly, human monocytes were plated at 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), Glutamax (Gibco), penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), human GM-CSF (100 ng/ml; Miltenyi Biotec), and human IL-4 (40 ng/ml; Miltenyi Biotec). Then, cells were incubated for 6 days at 39°C (for porcine cells) or 37°C (for the human cells) and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>; on the third day of incubation fresh medium supplemented with cytokines was added to the cultures. MoDC differentiation was verified by microscopy and by flow cytometry. The culture resulted in over 95% DC-like cells defined as for porcine cells CD172a
 <sup>+</sup>CD80/86
 <sup>+</sup> and CD14
 <sup>low</sup> expression (Carrasco et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and as CD11c
 <sup>+</sup>CD14
 <sup>−</sup>CD19
 <sup>−</sup>CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>−</sup> cells (human) (Vielle et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
