<p>These analyses focused on IFN-β, TNF, or IL-1β secretion by MoDC. At none of the tested time points, we were able to detect virus-induced IL-1β with pMoDC and hMoDC. Overall, USUV induced higher secretion of IFN-β compared to the other viruses in both species and at any investigated time points (
