<p>We next determined the impact of Flavivirus infection on MoDC viability. To this end we employed forward/side scatter plots, to determine the percentages of shrunken cells with increased granularity as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. At 24 hpi, pMoDC death was limited but significantly induced following challenge with USUV, SPOV followed by ZIKV and DENV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In hMoDC, also low levels of dead cells were found at the early time point with significantly higher death induced by USUV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This dramatically changed at 48 hpi when Flavivirus infection was associated with induction of death in pMoDC by most of the tested viruses with the exceptions of DENV-3 and ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). At 48 hpi in hMoDC, USUV infection induced the highest levels of cell death followed by JEV and WNV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, the correlation between cell death and infection (E protein expression) was higher for hMoDC when compared to pMoDC (
