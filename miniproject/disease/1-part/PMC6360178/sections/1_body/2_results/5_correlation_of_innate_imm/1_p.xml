<p>As IFN-β and TNF are presumably induced by viral RNA, we analyzed the correlations of IFN-β and TNF to the percentage of virus-infected cells and also viral titers at the time of supernatant harvest. At 24 hpi the percentage of virus-infected pMoDC highly correlated with the secretion of IFN-β and TNF (R
 <sup>2</sup> values of 0.7 and 0.53, respectively), but not at 48 hpi (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that innate immune responses depend on the number of infected cells. In general, only viruses inducing relatively high levels of infection cause a detectable cytopathic effects. Importantly, for the viral titers we found neither a positive nor negative correlation with cytokine responses.
