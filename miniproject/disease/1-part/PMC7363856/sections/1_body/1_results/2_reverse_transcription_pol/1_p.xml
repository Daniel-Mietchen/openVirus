<p id="Par9">Primers were designed targeting the E1 gene and the same was found conserved in all CHIKV genotypes. Cross reactivity of primer sets were also ascertained. Standardization and optimization of the RT-PSR assay for various temperature and time was carried out. The optimum results were observed for CHIKV specific RT-PSR at 65 °C for 60 min both in digital heat block (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A</xref>) and real time turbidimeter (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2B</xref>). Positive reaction was observed by bright green fluorescence on addition of SYBR Green I dye, while the negative sample retained the original orange color (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2C</xref>). Under UV light, the color was intensified as bright green fluorescence in positive control while, no fluorescence was observed in negative control (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2D</xref>). Amplification curve was found in PTC, whereas no such curve was visible in NTC, when the reaction was performed using Loopamp real time turbidimeter (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2E</xref>). Distinct laddering pattern was visualized in the positive samples when they were resolved in 2.5% agarose gel (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2F</xref>). The reagents were subsequently lyophilized using 50% D-Trehalose (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3A</xref>). The PTC revealed green fluorescence in both naked eye and under UV light, whereas NTC retained the orange color (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>B,C). The same was also confirmed through appearance amplification curve in PTC and its absence in NTC (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3D</xref>). Distinct laddering pattern similar to wet reagents was visualized in 2.5% agarose gel (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3E</xref>). The lyophilized RT-PSR reagents were tested with PTC, NTC and clinical samples (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>F). The replicates of batches prepared with 50% trehalose were found stable at 4 °C up to 6 months as revealed through change of color (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>A-C1-3). However, the lyophilized RT-PSR reagents were found stable only up to 1 week, when stored at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>C4).
