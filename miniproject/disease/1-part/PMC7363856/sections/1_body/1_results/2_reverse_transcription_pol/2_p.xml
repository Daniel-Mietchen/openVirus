<p id="Par10">The detection limit of lyophilized RT-PSR was found to be 10 RNA copies/rxn (equivalent to 714 RNA copies/ml of sample), when performed in both tubidimeter and digital dry block (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A–C). The typical laddering pattern was observed on gel electrophoresis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). When the same dilutions of IVT RNA were subjected to SYBR green real time qRT-PCR, the detection limit was also found to be 10 RNA copies/rxn (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). RT-PSR assay didn't show any amplification with closely related alphaviruses (O’nyong-nyong virus, Semliki Forest virus, Ross River virus, and Sindbis Virus) and flaviviruses (Dengue virus serotypes 1–4, Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus), included in this study (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The templates of alphaviruses were confirmed through presence of 434 bp amplicon through end point RT-PCR; whereas flaviviruses were confirmed through virus specific real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and S7).
