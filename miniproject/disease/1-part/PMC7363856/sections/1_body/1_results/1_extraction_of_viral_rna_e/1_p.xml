<p id="Par8">Initial experiments were performed with silica coated magnetic bead nucleic acid extraction protocol along with commercially available QIAamp viral RNA kit in order to study quality and quantity of RNA. The whole set up of in-house magnetic bead based nucleic acid extraction protocol was represented in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. Duration of whole procedure was 30 min for viral RNA extraction without use of any electrical equipment. The comparative evaluation revealed the concentration of RNA to be 20 ng/µl for in house magnetic bead protocol, whereas it was 18 ng/µl in Qiagen protocol. Quality of RNA as determined through A
 <sub>260/280</sub> was 2.4 and 3.2 in magnetic bead and Qiagen protocol respectively. The suitability of extracted RNA from both protocols for molecular assay (SYBR Green qRT-PCR) was also confirmed, as demonstrated by positive reaction through amplification curve analysis ABI7500Dx real time RT-PCR system. The nucleic acid extracted from a panel of samples through both these methods revealed 100% concordance which was confirmed though CHIKV E1 specific SYBR green qRT-PCR. The Ct value obtained is summarized in Table
