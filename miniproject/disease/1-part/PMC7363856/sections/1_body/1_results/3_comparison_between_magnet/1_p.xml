<p id="Par11">The dry down reverse transcription-polymerase spiral reaction method was evaluated simultaneously SYBR Green one step real time RT-PCR using a panel of 70 suspected CHIKV serum samples. The result revealed 94.25% concordance between both the methods. Out of 50 positive samples, 46 were found positive by both the methods. However 4 samples of low viral load were missed by dry down RT-PSR assay, indicating a sensitivity of 92%. However, none of the negative and healthy sample showed any signal of positivity, indicating a specificity of 100% (Table

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Randomly selected samples (n = 10) found to be positive for both RT-PSR and SYBR Green real time PCR were subjected to DNA sequencing by Sanger’s method. BLAST analysis revealed the presence of CHIKV E1 genomic region in the specific products (Data not shown). Sequencing results thus confirmed the accuracy of PSR in detecting CHIKV in clinical samples.
