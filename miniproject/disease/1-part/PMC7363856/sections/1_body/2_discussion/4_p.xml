<p id="Par15">This assay reagents were further lyophilized in order to maintain reagent stability. We have optimized the reagent stability along with enzymes at 4 °C with addition of 50% trehalose as the stabilizer in reaction mix before lyophilization. We have observed that the lyophilized RT-PSR assay was stable at least up to 6 months at 4 °C and 1 week on room temperature. The fast and field based diagnostics including nucleic acid purification coupled rapid detection is an urgent demand in the present scenario for diagnosis of infectious diseases. A simplified aqueous chemistry for RNA extraction reported here will serve as a base method for integration of various available qRT-PCR and isothermal molecular detection platforms. A magnetic bead based simple and easy sample extraction method in conjunction with lyophilized RT-PSR reported here has enabled a rapid and field compatible molecular detection platform for Chikungunya virus. The novelty of this method lies in its simplified procedures and easier applicability in both laboratory as well field conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of RT-PSR assay against a human RNA virus. The present work can be further extended to develop rapid user friendly sample to answer detection platform for other RNA viruses.</p>
