 </sup>. The rapid and field compatible sample extraction is a bottleneck in development of rapid molecular detection systems. Another important concern is storage and transportation of these thermo-labile molecular reagents. Both these issues increase the cost and prohibit adaptation of rapid detection platforms in resource limited settings. Development of simple sample extraction along with detection employing lyophilized molecular reagents will not only help the transportation issues of temperature sensitive reagents but also aid in providing sample to answer. In this study, we report a unique aqueous chemistry to capture and purify nucleic acids on surface of magnetic bead. Clinical sensitivity and detection limits were compared with Qiagen viral RNA kit. Results revealed similar sensitivity with widely used commercial Qiagen kit. Further, this bead based extraction protocol can easily be implemented in field condition for onsite sample preparation without requiring any specific laboratory equipments.
