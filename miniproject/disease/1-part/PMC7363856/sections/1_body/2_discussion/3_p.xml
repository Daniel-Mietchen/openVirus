<p id="Par14">In this study, we coupled both a simplified magnetic bead based RNA extraction with RT-PSR for early detection of Chikungunya virus. The limit of detection of this dry down RT-PSR format was found to be 10 RNA copies/reaction, which is comparable to an off-site detection format i.e. real time SYBR Green qRT-PCR. The specificity and sensitivity of this developed assay was also found comparable to PSR assays earlier reported for other microbial agents
