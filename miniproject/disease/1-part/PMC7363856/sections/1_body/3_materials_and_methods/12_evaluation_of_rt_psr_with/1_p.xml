<p id="Par29">The lyophilized RT-PSR in combination with magnetic bead sample extraction protocol was compared with SYBR Green qRT-PCR in combination with Qiagen RNA extraction protocol. A total of 50 Chikungunya positive and 20 apparently healthy human serum samples were utilized for the evaluation of RT-PSR assay. The panel was first screened by Qiagen RNA extraction and SYBR Green one step Real time RT-PCR and the result was compared with RT-PSR assay. Ten of the randomly selected positive samples were sequenced by double pass Sangerâ€™s sequencing.</p>
