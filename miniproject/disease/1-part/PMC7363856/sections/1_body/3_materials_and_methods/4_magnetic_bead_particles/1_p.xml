 </sup>. Five hundred milligram of Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (Aldrich, USA, Cat. No. 544884) were sonicated (30 min) in a solution having 320 ml of ethanol and 80 ml of water followed by addition of 10 ml of 30% NH
 <sub>4</sub>OH solution. This solution was mixed with 2 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (Aldrich, USA, Cat No. 86578) for 45 min and the contents were allowed to stir at room temperature for additional 24 h. This silica coated nanoparticles were than separated under magnetic field, washing was done with water and ethanol and finally dried under vacuum (70 °C, 24 h). The average size of particles was found 2.3 µm and BET surface area was kept 17 m
 <sup>2</sup>/g. Finally these particles were used in a suspension of 50 mg of particles/ml in nuclease free water.
