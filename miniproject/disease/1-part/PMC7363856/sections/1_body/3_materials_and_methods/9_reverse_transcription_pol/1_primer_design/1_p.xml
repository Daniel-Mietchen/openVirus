<p id="Par24">The potential target region for designing oligonucleotide primers for RT-PSR amplification were identified with high conservity across the genome with global circulating strains pertaining to all different Chikungunya virus genotypes using ClustalW programme, available in Lasergene 5 package (DNAStar, USA). Also the multiple sequence analysis were also carried out with other closely related alphaviruses i.e. Ross river virus, O’nyong-nyong virus, Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus was also carried out to study cross reactivity. Further an outer linker sequence from a botanic gene was appended at 5′ end in both upstream and down stream primer, as required for the polymerase spiral reaction
