 </sup>. The reaction was performed in 25 µl reaction volume which includes Bst DNA polymerase (8U ) (New England Biolabs, US), MMLV RT (1 U) (Promega, US), 40 μM each of both forward (CHIKV-PSR FP) and reverse primers (CHIKV- PSR RP), 2.5 µl 10X ThermolPol reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, US) is comprised off Tris–HCl (20 mM), KCl (10 mM), (NH

 <sub>4</sub> (6 mM), each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (1.4 mM) and template RNA (5 µl). The assay was best optimized at 65 °C for 60 min. Positive template control (PTC) and no template controls (NTC) were included in each run to rule out cross contamination. The reaction was performed using a digital heat block set at 65 °C. Following amplification reaction, 0.2 µl (10,000X conc) SYBR green nucleic acid dye (Lonza, USA) was added to amplified DNA for visual detection in both naked eye or using UV transilluminator. In addition, the real time amplification of the reactions were also recorded in LoopAmp Real time turbidimeter (LA-500, Eiken, Japan). The amplified RT-PSR products were subsequently resolved in 2.5% agarose gel and recorded in gel documentation system (Bio-Rad, USA). RT-PSR experiments were repeated thrice for reproducibility.
