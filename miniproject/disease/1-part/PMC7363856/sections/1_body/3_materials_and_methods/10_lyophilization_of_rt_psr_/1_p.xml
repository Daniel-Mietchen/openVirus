<p id="Par26">D-trehalose was added in the reaction with a concentration of 50% in optimized RT-PSR master mix reagent. The master mix was aliquoted in 20 µl of reaction volume to RT-PSR reaction strips and frozen at − 80 °C for 2 h. Following freezing, the tubes were immediately placed under 0.001 mBar vaccum at − 40 °C for 3 h for lyophilisation in freeze dryer system (Labconco, USA). Freeze dried reaction mix was stored at both room temperature and 4 °C in desiccant containing sealed pouches. The stability of the reagents was studied at an interval of 1 week for 1 month and subsequently at 1 month interval up to 6 months.</p>
