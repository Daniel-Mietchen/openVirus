 </sup>. Briefly, test samples were assayed in a 25 µl reaction mixtures containing 2X SYBR reaction mix, forward and reverse primers, Reverse transcriptase/Taq mix and template RNA and final volume was adjusted with nuclease free water. No template control (NTC) and positive controls (PTC) were also included during each run. The thermal profile comprises of reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of denaturation, primer annealing and extension at 95 °C 30 s, 57 °C 1 min, 72 °C 30 s respectively). The authenticity of the amplified product was determined through analysis of a melting curve after amplification (Tm) with the software of the ABI 7,500 Dx (ABI, USA) according as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the temperature was decreased to 57 °C followed by incremental increase in temperature up to 95 °C at a rate of 1 °C/30 s/cycle with continuous measurement of fluorescence.
