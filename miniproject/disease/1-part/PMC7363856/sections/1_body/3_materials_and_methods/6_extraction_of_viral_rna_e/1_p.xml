<p id="Par21">Thirty micro liter of magnetic bead suspension were added to lysis buffer (760 µl) and sample (isolate/serum) (140 µl), further the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 8 min. Subsequently, proteinase K (25 µl) was added, to the tubes and further incubated for additional 2 min. The magnetic bead particles were separated and supernatant was discarded. Subsequently, washing buffer (500 µl) containing proteinase K solution (2.5 ml) (20 mg/ml) was added, and the beads were mixed vigorously. Further the mix was incubated for 10 min with washing buffer, the magnetic beads particles were separated by applying magnetic field and the remaining supernatant was pipetted out. The washing step was repeated again following removal of washing buffer and elution buffer (50 µl) was applied to the bead and mixed for uniform suspension. This was further kept at room temperature for 10 min. Finally the beads were separated and eluate was collected in RNase-free/tube by applying magnetic field. The purity and concentration of eluted RNA was carried out in NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The suitability of extracted viral RNA for molecular assay was confirmed through Chikungunya specific SYBR green one step qRT-PCR
