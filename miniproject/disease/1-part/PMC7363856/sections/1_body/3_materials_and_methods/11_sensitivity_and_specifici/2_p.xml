<p id="Par28">The detection limit of the Reverse Transcription-PSR assay was determined using tenfold serially diluted in vitro transcribed RNA, which was further added to RT-PSR assay along with positive and no template controls. The appearance of amplification curve and green fluorescence was observed through both real time amplification as well the naked eye visualization. The sensitivity of RT-PSR assay was then determined in both liquid and lyophilized formats. Similarly the same dilutions were also subjected to SYBR Green one-step real-time RT-PCR and the comparative results were observed. The specificity of this assay was determined by including other closely related alphaviruses (O’nyong-nyong virus, Semliki Forest virus, Ross River virus, and Sindbis Virus) and flaviviruses (Dengue virus serotypes 1–4, Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus). RNA extracted from alpha- and flavivirus infected culture supernatant (10
