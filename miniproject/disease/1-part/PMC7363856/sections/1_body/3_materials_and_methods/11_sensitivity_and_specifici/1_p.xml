<p id="Par27">The CHIKV 205 bp amplicon pertaining to the target within envelope gene (corresponding to genomic position 10,294–10,498), the same was cloned in pGEM-T easy vetor (Promega, USA) for determination of both sensitivity and specificity. This cloned target within plasmid was linearized by using restriction enzyme Pst I. After RE digestion, linearized fragment were in vitro transcribed with T7 in vitro transcription kit (MBI Fermantas, USA). After in vitro transcription the RNA was purified finally by ethanol precipitation and was further resuspended in nuclease free water. The quantity of CHIKV-RNA transcripts was determined using spectrophotometer and further the RNA molecular copies were calculated.</p>
