<p id="Par22">The extraction of viral RNA was carried out from infected material using the Qiagen viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief AVL buffer (560 µl) was added to sample (isolate/serum) (140 µl ) and thoroughly vortexed (15 s), than the mixture was further kept at room temperature (10 min). Subsequently, ethanol (560 µl) was applied to this mixture and this to was passed with the QIAamp spin column. by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 1 min), the spin column residuals were discarded. Rest of this solution was again passed through above mentioned column by recentrifugation as mentioned above. Spin column were further washed using wash buffer AW1 and AW2 (500 µl). Finally viral RNA was extracted in elution buffer (50 µl) added to the centre of the column followed by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 2 min. The purity and concentration of viral RNA was analysed with NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The suitability of extracted viral RNA for molecular assay was confirmed through Chikungunya specific SYBR green one step qRT-PCR
