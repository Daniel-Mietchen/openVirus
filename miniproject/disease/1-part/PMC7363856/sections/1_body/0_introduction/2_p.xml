 </sup>. Phenolâ€“chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation methods are time-consuming, complicated, hazardous, and not suitable for processing of large numbers of samples. These traditional methods are widely adopted with the supplement of extraction procedure based on principle of adsorption of nucleic acids to silica matrices in presence of chaotropic salts and alcohol

 </sup>. In this study, silica coated magnetic bead and formulations of alkaline, acidic and neutral buffers for binding and elution of ribonucleic acid from clinical samples was attempted. This method offers a rapid and field compatible nucleic acid extraction employing in-house ingredients, obviating the requirements of any high end equipments.
