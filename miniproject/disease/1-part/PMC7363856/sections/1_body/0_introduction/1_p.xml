 </sup>. However, PCR including nested PCR and real-time PCR has their own limitation of the cycling for heating and cooling with a need of highly pr√©cised equipments. Nucleic acid extraction is another major bottleneck in the development and inclusion of all molecular diagnostic systems. Currently molecular diagnostics are restricted to few advanced laboratory owing to these limitations
