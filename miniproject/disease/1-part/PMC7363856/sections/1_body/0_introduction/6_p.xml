 </sup>, however the adaptability of these fast nucleic acid detection platforms is limited due to absence of simple and reliable sample extraction method. It therefore seeks attention towards development of a rapid, user friendly, on-site sample to answer detection platform. Here we report the development of an in-house assay comprising of magnetic bead based RNA extraction and lyophilized RT-PSR reagents for rapid onsite detection for Chikungunya. This technology was also compared with a widely used commercial RNA extraction kit coupled with laboratory based SYBR Green qRT-PCR platform to evaluate its clinical utility.
