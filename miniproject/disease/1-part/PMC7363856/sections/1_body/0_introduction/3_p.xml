 </sup>. In the recent years various isothermal amplification techniques have been reported for amplification of nucleic acid including both DNA as well as RNA. However, only a few of these isothermal amplification methods such as Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) was widely adopted and very efficiently performed at a constant temperature using a single enzyme but suffers from the requirement of four or more primers. The limitations of other isothermal assays viz., nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) includes requirement of multiple enzymes to initiate a reaction
