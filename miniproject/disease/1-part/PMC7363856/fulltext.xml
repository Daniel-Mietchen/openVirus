However the major limitation in implementation of available molecular detection assays is the non availability of field deployable nucleic acid isolation platform coupled with gene amplification technique. The rapid and early molecular detection is crucial for employing effective measure against many viral infections. The re-emergence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has led to epidemics since 2004 in several parts of the world including India. The main association of CHIKV with severe arthritis and long-lasting arthralgia and closely mimics symptoms of Dengue and Zika virus infection requiring laboratory confirmation. In this study, a simple magnetic bead based ribonucleic acid extraction method was optimized, which was coupled with isothermal polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) technique for early and rapid detection. Subsequently, the polymerase spiral reaction reagents were converted to dry down format that led to a rapid user friendly field compatible sample processing to answer method for rapid and onsite detection of Chikungunya virus. Both the methods were evaluated with a panel of clinical samples. The sensitivity of the assays were compared with available commercial viral RNA extraction platform and qRT-PCR. The in-house nucleic acid extraction system based on magnetic bead followed by dry down RT-Polymerase Spiral Reaction assay was found to be highly sensitive with 10 copies of RNA as limit of detection in CHIKV clinical specimens. With respect to other closely related viruses no cross reactivity was observed. This novel methodology has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of infectious agents in resource limited settings around the world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Microbiology</kwd><kwd>Molecular biology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Molecular diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) has revolutionized the disease diagnosis over last three decades.

Availability of very few diagnostic kits limits its early detection in rural settings, where the disease is endemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The rapid and field compatible sample extraction is a bottleneck in development of rapid molecular detection systems. Another important concern is storage and transportation of these thermo-labile molecular reagents. Both these issues increase the cost and prohibit adaptation of rapid detection platforms in resource limited settings. Development of simple sample extraction along with detection employing lyophilized molecular reagents will not only help the transportation issues of temperature sensitive reagents but also aid in providing sample to answer. In this study, we report a unique aqueous chemistry to capture and purify nucleic acids on surface of magnetic bead. Clinical sensitivity and detection limits were compared with Qiagen viral RNA kit. Results revealed similar sensitivity with widely used commercial Qiagen kit. Further, this bead based extraction protocol can easily be implemented in field condition for onsite sample preparation without requiring any specific laboratory equipments.</p><p id="Par13">At present, number of laboratory based diagnostic techniques is used to detect Chikungunya virus infection. This includes conventional culture based identification, immunological detection through direct ELISA and molecular detection by end point RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and RT-LAMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The conventional culture method is tedious and time consuming and also need expertise with well established cell culture facilities. Though serological techniques are frequently used but still suffer from false positivity due to circulation of cross reactive viruses. Therefore detection based on molecular assay is widely preferred throughout the world for confirmatory diagnosis. Polymerase spiral reaction is a recently reported field compatible onsite isothermal rapid molecular detection platform. PSR is a novel isothermal method that fulfils the requirements of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for development of diagnostic systems. The current objectives of developing diagnostic by research laboratories mainly lies in &#x0201c;ASSURED&#x0201d; (affordable, sensitive, specific, user friendly, robust and rapid, equipment free and deliverable) philosophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The aim is now shifting towards development of onsite point of care diagnostics. The main reason behind this is the revolution in molecular biology detection platforms including various isothermal diagnostic assays. PSR method has advantages over traditional PCR methods in comparison to time, cost, specificity, sensitivity; omit the gel electrophoresis, need for high end equipment and onsite detection capabilities. Specific nucleic acids can be amplified and detected in isothermal conditions, without need of any costly equipment. A positive reaction results in accumulation of large amount of pyrophosphate so that turbidity can also be recorded for quantification purpose. Primer designing for RT-PSR is very simple and similar to conventional end point PCR (i.e. identification of a conserved gene revealed through multiple sequence alignment). Further, sequence from an unrelated species that is an exogenous or from a botanical origin is appended at the 5&#x02032; end of the primer sequence at the target region. In contrast, LAMP, another isothermal technique requires complicated primer designing tool. Therefore the PSR method has the potential to be setup in rural settings as per requirements.</p><p id="Par14">In this study, we coupled both a simplified magnetic bead based RNA extraction with RT-PSR for early detection of Chikungunya virus. The limit of detection of this dry down RT-PSR format was found to be 10 RNA copies/reaction, which is comparable to an off-site detection format i.e. real time SYBR Green qRT-PCR. The specificity and sensitivity of this developed assay was also found comparable to PSR assays earlier reported for other microbial agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">This assay reagents were further lyophilized in order to maintain reagent stability. We have optimized the reagent stability along with enzymes at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with addition of 50% trehalose as the stabilizer in reaction mix before lyophilization. We have observed that the lyophilized RT-PSR assay was stable at least up to 6&#x000a0;months at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 1&#x000a0;week on room temperature. The fast and field based diagnostics including nucleic acid purification coupled rapid detection is an urgent demand in the present scenario for diagnosis of infectious diseases. A simplified aqueous chemistry for RNA extraction reported here will serve as a base method for integration of various available qRT-PCR and isothermal molecular detection platforms. A magnetic bead based simple and easy sample extraction method in conjunction with lyophilized RT-PSR reported here has enabled a rapid and field compatible molecular detection platform for Chikungunya virus. The novelty of this method lies in its simplified procedures and easier applicability in both laboratory as well field conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of RT-PSR assay against a human RNA virus.
