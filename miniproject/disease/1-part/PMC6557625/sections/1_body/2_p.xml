<p>The influenza polymerase is a complex formed of three proteins including one called PB2 (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>). Avian-style polymerases work well in bird cells, but poorly in humans. This species-specific restriction is due to the amino acid at position 627 in the PB2 subunit, which is a glutamate in birds and a lysine in humans (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Almond, 1977</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Subbarao et al., 1993</xref>). Changing this glutamate to lysine in an avian polymerase is sufficient to make it active in human cells, but the reasons for this were unclear.
