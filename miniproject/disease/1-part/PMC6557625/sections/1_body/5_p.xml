<p>First, the experiments confirmed that ANP32A and ANP32B have a redundant role in helping the influenza virus to replicate in human cells. The double-knockout of 
 <italic>ANP32A</italic> and 
 <italic>ANP32B</italic> almost completely eliminated polymerase activity and virus replication, but simply deleting ANP32A had no effect (

Taken together, these results imply that both ANP32A and ANP32B support infection in humans, but only ANP32A performs this role in chickens, with ANP32B being unable to help the polymerase. Finally, neither human nor chicken ANP32Es played a major role during viral replication.
