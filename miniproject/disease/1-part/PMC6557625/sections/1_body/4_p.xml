<p>However, it was not that human cells lacked 
 <italic>ANP32A</italic>; rather, a duplication and insertion in chicken 
 <italic>ANP32A</italic> added a unique exon to the gene. The insertion was common to almost all ANP32A proteins across birds and it was sufficient to confer activity to polymerases of avian origin. Subsequent studies began to dissect the activity of ANP32A and identified key features of this insert. In particular, they showed that, in birds, 
 <italic>ANP32A</italic> is differentially spliced at the insert, creating ANP32A variants with different abilities to support polymerase function (

Thus, multiple lines of evidence converged on the importance of ANP32 proteins and their potential role in the evolution of influenza viruses. Now, in eLife, Barclay and colleagues at Imperial College, Edinburgh University, St George's in London and the Pirbright Institute – including Jason Long as first author – report, alongside a paper by Xiaojun Wang and colleagues in the Journal of Virology, that ANP32 proteins may have an even more intriguing evolutionary history (
