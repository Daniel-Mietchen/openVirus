<p>An in-depth investigation of ANP32B in chicken revealed that everything was not as it seemed. Evolutionary analyses showed that avian 
 <italic>ANP32B</italic> forms a distinct group, and may actually be more closely related to 
 <italic>ANP32C</italic> genes (and perhaps should be referred to as such) (

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2019b</xref>). Birds lost or never possessed the 
 <italic>ANP32B</italic> version found in mammals, while the 
 <italic>ANP32C</italic> gene that is closely related to avian 
 <italic>ANP32B</italic> emerged in placental mammals as a non-functional pseudogene. Both Long et al. and Zhang et al. exploited their knockout cells to show that only two amino acid changes in chicken ANP32B eliminate its ability to support the viral polymerase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Avian ANP32A has asparagine and aspartate at residues 129 and 130, whereas avian ANP32B has isoleucine and asparagine at the same sites. These differences control the ability of the protein to interact with and promote the activity of the viral polymerase. Human ANP32A and ANP32B both have asparagine and aspartate at these sites, explaining why either protein supports the activity of the viral polymerase. These studies provide compelling evidence that subtle changes in ANP32 proteins can have large impacts on how viruses can exploit these proteins to replicate.
