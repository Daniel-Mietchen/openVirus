<p id="Par14">Cross-species transmission and the evolution of the H7N9 virus from a low pathogenic to high pathogenic phenotype emphasizes the importance of One Health â€“ which is based upon the premise that there is an intimate relationship between human, animal and environmental health. Only when we maintain this broader perspective can we hope to prevent the next endemic/pandemic with an HxNy influenza virus. In this article, we will use the outbreak of H7N9 influenza viruses in humans as an example of the benefits of implementing a rapid and comprehensive One Health approach for emerging zoonotic infections.</p>
