<p id="Par13">Human infections with avian influenza virus H7N9 were first identified in March 2013 in south-eastern China. The virus then spread rapidly to the inner provinces of China. As of March 2nd 2018, 1567 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infected with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), including at least 615 deaths (a fatality rate of 39%) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the lack of effective intervention strategies by the agricultural departments, led to a large number of viral infections in poultry and six discreet ‘waves’ of human infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The first H7N9 epidemic wave started in March and ended in June 2013. In subsequent waves (2013–2018), the H7N9 influenza virus infection season typically started in October and lasted until the following June. From October 2016 to June 2017, the number of human H7N9 influenza virus infections increased to 759 cases (almost the same as the sum of the previous four waves) and spread across 23 provinces and 6 municipalities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This cross-disciplinary effort from numerous government department led to a rapid decline in the number of human H7N9 influenza virus infections and only 3 cases have been reported since July 2017 [
