<p id="Par15">Influenza A virus H7N9 is a negative sense RNA virus with two key surface glycoproteins, the haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). It is capable of undergoing both antigenic drift (driven by point mutations) and antigenic shift (as a result of co-infection and genome reassortment). The NA of H7N9 influenza viruses isolated from human cases most closely resembles that found in migrating birds from South Korea [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Typically, the HA of avian influenza viruses shows a strong preference to bind to α-2,3 linked sialic acids whilst the HA of human influenza viruses typically binds to α-2,6 linked sialic acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Since the upper respiratory tract of humans is rich in α-2,6 receptors, human influenza viruses are well adapted for efficient human-to-human transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, via the introduction of point mutations in viral HA (Q226L/I, G186 V), the avian H7N9 influenza virus increased its avidity to human receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, it breached the species barrier and was able to spread from poultry to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. By retaining its ability to bind to α-2,3 linked sialic acid, the virus predominately replicated in the lower respiratory tract, limiting the efficacy of person-to-person spread [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This dual receptor specificity allowed the virus to continue to circulate in poultry, including chickens and quails [
