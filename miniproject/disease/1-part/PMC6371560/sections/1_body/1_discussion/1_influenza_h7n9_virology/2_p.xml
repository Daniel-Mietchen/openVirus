<p id="Par16">In the first four waves of the H7N9 outbreak, the cleavage site of the viral HA possessed only a single amino acid R (arginine), indicating a low pathogenic phenotype in poultry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, in viruses isolated from live poultry markets (LPM) in Guangdong province during the fifth wave, researchers found four amino acids (RKRT) inserted into the HA cleavage site (4 of 69 strains). This insertion was associated with the conversion of the virus from a low to high pathogenic phenotype in poultry [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The 588 V mutation has previously been associated with enhanced viral pathogenesis in mammalian species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Indeed, there were at least 23 different genotypes of H7N9 influenza viruses detected by the end of December 2017. Among those, seven genotypes were genetically distinct, whilst 16 were found to have evolved from the 2013 H7N9 influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although the HPAI virus H7N9 was first isolated from LPMs in Guangdong, it is believed that the HPAI virus H7N9 originated from the Yangtze river delta and spread to the southeast coast via live poultry transactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The HPAI virus H7N9 then evolved into multiple genotypes via reassortment with H9N2 influenza viruses and local low pathogenic H7N9 viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As of July 2017, the HPAI H7N9 influenza virus has spread to more than 12 different provinces in China [
