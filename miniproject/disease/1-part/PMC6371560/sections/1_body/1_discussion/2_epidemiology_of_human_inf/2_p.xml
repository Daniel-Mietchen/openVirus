<p id="Par18">Among all human H7N9 influenza virus infections recorded to date, almost 50% of cases have occurred in individuals over the age of 60. It is also striking to note that the majority of infections have occurred in males. Retired individuals are likely to have a higher risk of virus exposure, as the elderly frequently visit LPMs. Indeed, approximately 80% of patients exposed to poultry did so at a LPM, whilst occupational exposure only accounted for approximately 10% of patients [
