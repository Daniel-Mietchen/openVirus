<p id="Par20">When human infections with the H7N9 influenza virus were first identified, control strategies focused on patient isolation and health education [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. As more information became available about the transmission of the H7N9 virus, disease control departments focused on strengthening disease prevention and surveillance amongst poultry industry workers, enhancing the sanitation of LPMs and improving hygiene during poultry slaughter and transactions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. LPMs were also closed when human and/or poultry cases were reported. After the HPAI virus H7N9 was identified and caused significant poultry morbidity and mortality, animal and public health authorities organized various conferences to bring together veterinary, epidemiology and virology experts. These conferences helped establish strong inter-departmental collaborations to prevent and control the spread of H7N9 influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This approach proved to be highly successful and only 3 cases of human infection with H7N9 influenza virus were reported in the last wave (Fig.Â
