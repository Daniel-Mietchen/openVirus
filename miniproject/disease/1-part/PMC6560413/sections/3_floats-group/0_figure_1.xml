  <p>Timeline after arthritogenic alphavirus infection. After infection by a bite from an infected mosquito, an incubation period of 3â€“8 days takes place. Viremia starts before the onset of symptoms and lasts only a few days, leaving a very short window for direct diagnosis by RT-PCR or virus isolation. If the infection is symptomatic (&gt;60% of cases), the patient presents with brutal onset of fever associated with polyarthralgia and other general symptoms, and after a few days, a delayed rash often appears. Lymphadenopathy is particularly frequent in ONNV infection. General blood tests during the acute phase can show lymphopenia, thrombopenia, hypocalcemia and mild rhabdomyolysis (with cytolysis and increased creatinine kinase). Polyarthralgia with or without arthritis and asthenia might be prolonged during the sub-acute phase (2 weeks to 3 months) or as chronic symptoms, sometimes as post-infectious chronic inflammatory rheumatism mimicking rheumatoid arthritis. Indirect diagnosis by serology requires two blood samples separated by at least 12 days to show appearance and/or disappearance of IgM (that may stay positive for over 6 months) and appearance of IgG.</p>
