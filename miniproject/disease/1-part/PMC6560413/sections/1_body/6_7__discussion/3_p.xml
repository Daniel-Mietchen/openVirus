While this does not mean it is currently happening in the wild, these observations are a warning of what could occur in the future, particular if vector populations expand and overlap and further adaptation to new vectors occurs. Public health services should keep this on their radar, especially because alphaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that are known to evolve rapidly [
 <xref rid="B264-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>]. One point mutation or one recombination event might favor infection of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and/or 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> compared to the original vector and trigger a worldwide epidemic, as has happened for CHIKV (during the La Reunion epidemic with the A226V mutation [

 <xref rid="B85-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] and during the American outbreak with a duplication of the 3â€™UTR [
 <xref rid="B265-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]). Because these vectors are widely distributed anthropophilic mosquitoes, the risk of initiating an urban cycle could be high, and further enabled by high viremia in humans.
