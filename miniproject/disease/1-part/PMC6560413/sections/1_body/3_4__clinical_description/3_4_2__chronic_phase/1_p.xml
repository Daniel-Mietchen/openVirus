<p>With over 40 clinical studies to date, the chronic joint pain (i.e., persisting after 12 weeks of onset of symptoms) is very well described and represents the major burden of CHIKV infection because it can be responsible for very heavy and long term incapacity [
 <xref rid="B130-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis estimated that 43% of patients after three months and 21% after one year still experience symptoms linked to CHIKV. This rate seems to depend on which CHIKV strain is involved [

Indeed, whereas the latter is only treated with pain killers possibly associated with steroids, the former requires a heavier treatment including methotrexate [
