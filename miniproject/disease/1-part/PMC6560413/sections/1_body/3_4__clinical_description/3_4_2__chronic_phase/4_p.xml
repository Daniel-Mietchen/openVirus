This last study, apart from insisting on the difficulty of differentiating post-infectious chronic arthralgia from differential diagnosis, also implied a higher prevalence of chronic joint pain in the elderly, that also present with more comorbidities (even though this was not discussed in the paper). Although there is no human data available, in vitro and in vivo data suggest that post-RRV infection arthritis may be erosive [
