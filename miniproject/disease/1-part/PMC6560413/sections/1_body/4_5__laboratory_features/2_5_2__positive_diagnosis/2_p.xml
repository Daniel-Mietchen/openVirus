<p>Indirect diagnosis is achieved by serological tests to detect IgM and IgG. The antibodies arise later than viremia, but are long lasting in comparison. Indeed, as it has been shown for CHIKV, IgM can arise as soon as two days after onset of symptoms and is usually positive after a week [

Whatever the commercial or in-house serological test used (most often by enzymatic immune assay or hemagglutination inhibition), two samples per patient, taken at least 10 days apart, are needed to show the appearance of IgM and/or IgG or disappearance of IgM.
