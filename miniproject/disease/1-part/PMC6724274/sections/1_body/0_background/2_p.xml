<p id="Par15">There is however a critical lack of data describing viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in young children with CF aged less than 2 years, when RTIs are particularly frequent and potentially more severe at this early period of life. Some studies conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s have drawn a pessimistic scenario of viral RTIs in this vulnerable population that is no longer observed. In these seminal studies, clinical manifestations were described as severe, frequently requiring hospitalization and prolonged oxygen supply or mechanical ventilation [

 <italic>respiratory syncytial virus</italic> (RSV) was found to be the most frequently recovered virus, but diagnostic tools were limited to immunological assays and viral culture, thus limiting the spectrum of virus that may be recovered. Recent studies have shown that RSV epidemics may be associated with the occurrence of more pulmonary exacerbations [
