<p id="Par31">One-third of the viral samples collected outside RTI episodes were virus-positive (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Compared to those recovered during RTI, the proportions were quite similar for RV, adenoviruses and metapneumovirus. However, a smaller proportion of RSV and influenza but a higher proportion of bocavirus and coronavirus were found in nasal swabs collected outside RTI periods.
