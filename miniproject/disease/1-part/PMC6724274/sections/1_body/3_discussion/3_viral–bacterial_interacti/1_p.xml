<p id="Par41">We found that there was a trend toward a higher frequency of total RTI in young children in whom the first isolation of PA and SM occurred during the year of follow-up. However, we did not find the same trend for SA. However the study was not powered to specifically address this question, thus preventing us from drawing a firm conclusion. The risk factor that RTI represents for PA colonization was underlined several years ago, particularly after a severe episode of RTI [

Whether viruses are able to directly alter airway bacterial flora in young patients with CF or these alterations are related to the frequent usage of antibiotics remains to be determined.
