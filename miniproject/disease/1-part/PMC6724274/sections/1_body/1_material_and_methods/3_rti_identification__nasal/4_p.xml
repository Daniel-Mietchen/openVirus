<p id="Par23">Respiratory specimen sampling (pharyngeal swabs) for bacterial cultures was performed at each center visit (four to six samples per patient per year depending on the age at inclusion). Bacterial cultures were performed on specific medias in order to identify major CF pathogens such as SA or PA. Colonies morphology, gram staining were than used for a first identification of each bacterial species. Than a MALDI-TOF-MS approach was done for the final identification.</p>
