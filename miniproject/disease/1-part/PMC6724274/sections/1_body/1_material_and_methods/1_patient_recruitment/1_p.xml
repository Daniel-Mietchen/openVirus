<p id="Par17">Between March 2015 and April 2016, 33 families were contacted. Eight refused to participate (three because repeated nasal swab samplings were required, two because of the overall burden of the study, two for unexplained reasons, one for a language barrier issue). Finally, 25 young children with CF aged less than 24 months were recruited to participate in the study. All had confirmed CF based on compatible clinical features associated with two positive sweat tests (sweat chloride concentration ≥ 60 mmol/L) and/or two CFTR gene mutations. None received palivizumab because it is not used in our current practice.</p>
