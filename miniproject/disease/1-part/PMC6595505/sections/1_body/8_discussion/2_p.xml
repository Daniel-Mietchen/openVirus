<p>Similarly, the absence of consistent differences observed in the prevalence and intensity of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in each assay. When data from all three assays are combined, the oocyst ratio between TR and WT was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.63â€“1.4). If the assays were performed with higher mean oocysts and/or more mosquitoes were dissected per assay, or if more than three repeat feeds were performed, the range of 95% CI could become narrower. However, the insignificant result (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.8) suggests that even if Ag(DSM)2 females were released into the environment, they would pose no additional risk to a release of the same number of wild-type females with regard to this characteristic.
