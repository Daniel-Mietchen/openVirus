<p>Four doses of ONNV from 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/ml were made by serial 10-fold dilutions. Viruses were mixed with an equal volume of defibrinated rabbit blood and a final concentration of 2 mM ATP. TR and WT mosquitoes were fed in an isolation glove box located in a BL2/ACL2 insectary. Infectious blood was heated to 37°C in a Hemotek feeding apparatus (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, Lancashire, UK) for 1 h. Then, fully engorged mosquitoes were separated from unfed females and were transferred into fresh cartons with 10% sucrose water on cotton for extrinsic incubation at 28°C, a typical mean tropical temperature.
