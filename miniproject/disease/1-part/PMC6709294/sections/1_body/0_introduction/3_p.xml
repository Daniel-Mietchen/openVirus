<p>The major modes of viral hepatitis transmission include either mucous membrane contact or percutaneous exposure to infected blood or other body fluid (ie unsterile medical injections, needle stick injuries, blood transfusions, tattooing, body piercing, dental care, injecting drug use, and sexual intercourse).
