<p>We found a HBsAg seroprevalence of 0.22% among the Brazilian conscripts in this study. Data from a systematic review performed by Schweitzer et al showed a hepatitis B seroprevalence rate of 0.65% for both sexes in all age groups in Brazil. Higher HBsAg seroprevalences of 0.49% (95% CI 0.23–1.02) and 0.30% (95% CI 0.11–0.82) were observed in the North and Northeast regions, respectively.
