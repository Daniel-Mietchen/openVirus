<p>In conclusion, our data suggest a low prevalence of HBV and HCV infections (0.22% and 0.28%, respectively) and relatively low rates of self-reported HBV immunization among Brazilian young men. History of STIs, high number of sex partners, inconsistent use of condoms, and lack of awareness regarding the routes of transmission were significantly associated with HBV and HCV infections.</p>
