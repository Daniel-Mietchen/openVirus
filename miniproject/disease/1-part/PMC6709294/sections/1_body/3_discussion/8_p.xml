<p>Sexual transmission of viral hepatitis B plays a major role in the spread of the hepatitis B epidemic, whereas sexual transmission of viral hepatitis C, although possible, is much less common. Special attention should be given to certain populations such as men who have not been vaccinated against hepatitis B virus and heterosexual persons with multiple sexual partners. Safer sex practices, including minimizing the number of sexual partners and consistently and correctly using male and female condoms, offer powerful protection against viral hepatitis B and C and a wide range of other STIs.
