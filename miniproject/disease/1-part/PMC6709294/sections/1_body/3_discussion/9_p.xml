<p>Hepatitis B is preventable with the currently available safe and effective vaccines. The main objective of hepatitis B immunization strategies is to prevent chronic infection and its consequences, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the WHO, the complete vaccine series induces protective antibody levels in more than 95% of infants, children and young adults, for acute and chronic infections. Protection lasts at least 20 years and is probably lifelong. Nevertheless, it is known that a proportion of vaccinated children (5–10%) have a poor response to vaccination, and will remain susceptible as adults to acquisition of HBV infection.

 </sup> Approximately 2/3 (29.0%, n = 10,388) of the conscripts self-reported that they have received the hepatitis B vaccine. In Brazil, hepatitis B vaccination was incorporated into the national immunization program in 1996 for all children younger than 1 year of age, but it was only widely available in 1998 due to a vaccine shortage; the vaccine is also recommended for citizens up to 49 years of age.

 </sup> Thus, it would be expected that a higher proportion of participants had reported receiving hepatitis B vaccination; however, due to the young age at which patients receive vaccination, many of the participants did not remember whether they had taken it. Recent studies reported that the vaccine coverage in Brazil in adolescents and young adults is approximately 55% to 60%, based on serological evidence of hepatitis B immunization (anti-HBs titers above 10 UI/L and a negative HBsAg and/or anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) status).

 </sup> Other studies reported that hepatitis B vaccination coverage among military personnel in the Southeast and South regions of Brazil is between 57% and 70%.

 </sup> Regarding hepatitis C, as there is no vaccine currently available, primary prevention is aimed at reducing or eliminating transmission due to unsafe injection drug use, unprotected sex with multiple partners, exposure to blood in healthcare settings, and other risky behaviors (for example, tattooing, and body piercing).
