Globally, in 2015, an estimated 257 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and 71 million people with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> From 1999 to 2017, 218,257 HBV and 160,105 HCV confirmed infection cases have been reported in Brazil.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Worldwide, mortality due to hepatitis B and C was comparable to that due to tuberculosis and higher than that due to HIV.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> In Brazil, deaths related to HCV infection are the leading cause of deaths among viral hepatitis patients; the number of deaths due to this etiology has been increasing over the years in all Brazilian regions. From 2010 to 2016, 50,179 deaths related to HCV and 14,172 deaths related to HBV have been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>The major modes of viral hepatitis transmission include either mucous membrane contact or percutaneous exposure to infected blood or other body fluid (ie unsterile medical injections, needle stick injuries, blood transfusions, tattooing, body piercing, dental care, injecting drug use, and sexual intercourse).<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> In more recent years, as increased screening of blood products and the use of sterile equipment for medical injection has reduced transmission via these routes, injection drug use has become proportionately more important as a vector for viral hepatitis transmission.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>HCV and HBV infections can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma if patients are not diagnosed and do not receive timely and effective clinical management. HBV infection requires lifelong treatment whereas HCV can be cured using highly effective direct-acting antivirals.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> In both cases, an efficient response to the hepatitis epidemics, especially the hepatitis C epidemic, requires a well-structured public health policy. For this purpose, up to date epidemiological information is essential.</p><p>Since 1996, the Brazilian Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Viral Hepatitis (DIAHV) in collaboration with the Ministry of Defense has been conducting periodic serosurveys of conscripts enlisted for the Brazilian army to assess STI prevalence and to obtain data on knowledge and risk factors pertaining to STIs. Assessment of knowledge about viral hepatitis was included in the 6th edition of the serosurvey performed in 2002 <sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> while HCV and HBV serological testing was included only in the 2016 edition.

This prevalence is lower than the overall HCV antibody prevalence of 0.7% obtained in a previous survey among Brazilian conscripts (Villar, 2015) or the estimated prevalence of 1.38% for both sexes in the Brazilian population, reported from a cross-sectional study.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Our data show that the Central-west Region presented the highest anti-HCV seroprevalence rate (0.65%, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;18), followed by the South (0.42%, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21) and the North (0.40%, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13).</p><p>The risk factors associated with a positive anti-HCV status were having had sexual intercourse, self-reported history of having a STI and having more than 5 casual partners within the last year, while the risk factor associated with a positive HBsAg status was not making consistent use of condoms with steady partners. Although most of the risk factors assessed in our study are well-described predictors<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> for viral hepatitis, we did not observe such association among Brazilian conscripts.</p><p>The association between the number of sexual partners and positivity of serologic markers of hepatitis B and other STIs has often been reported in Brazilian studies conducted at blood donation centers, in specific groups, or in the general population.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Data available at the 2018 Brazilian Epidemiological Bulletin of Viral Hepatitis indicated that during 2017, sexual transmission was the probable source of infection in 21.2% and 9.2% of the of HBV and HCV infections, respectively. Thus, in Brazil, sexual transmission overtook drug use (8.1%), and blood transfusions (6.8%) as the source of transmission of these infections in 2017.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>Sexual transmission of viral hepatitis B plays a major role in the spread of the hepatitis B epidemic, whereas sexual transmission of viral hepatitis C, although possible, is much less common. Special attention should be given to certain populations such as men who have not been vaccinated against hepatitis B virus and heterosexual persons with multiple sexual partners. Safer sex practices, including minimizing the number of sexual partners and consistently and correctly using male and female condoms, offer powerful protection against viral hepatitis B and C and a wide range of other STIs.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>Hepatitis B is preventable with the currently available safe and effective vaccines. The main objective of hepatitis B immunization strategies is to prevent chronic infection and its consequences, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the WHO, the complete vaccine series induces protective antibody levels in more than 95% of infants, children and young adults, for acute and chronic infections. Protection lasts at least 20 years and is probably lifelong. Nevertheless, it is known that a proportion of vaccinated children (5&#x02013;10%) have a poor response to vaccination, and will remain susceptible as adults to acquisition of HBV infection.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Approximately 2/3 (29.0%, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10,388) of the conscripts self-reported that they have received the hepatitis B vaccine. In Brazil, hepatitis B vaccination was incorporated into the national immunization program in 1996 for all children younger than 1 year of age, but it was only widely available in 1998 due to a vaccine shortage; the vaccine is also recommended for citizens up to 49 years of age.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Thus, it would be expected that a higher proportion of participants had reported receiving hepatitis B vaccination; however, due to the young age at which patients receive vaccination, many of the participants did not remember whether they had taken it. Recent studies reported that the vaccine coverage in Brazil in adolescents and young adults is approximately 55% to 60%, based on serological evidence of hepatitis B immunization (anti-HBs titers above 10&#x0200a;UI/L and a negative HBsAg and/or anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) status).<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Other studies reported that hepatitis B vaccination coverage among military personnel in the Southeast and South regions of Brazil is between 57% and 70%.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Regarding hepatitis C, as there is no vaccine currently available, primary prevention is aimed at reducing or eliminating transmission due to unsafe injection drug use, unprotected sex with multiple partners, exposure to blood in healthcare settings, and other risky behaviors (for example, tattooing, and body piercing).<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>Additionally, while the majority of primary healthcare units as well as testing and counseling centers offer HBV and HCV testing services, there is nevertheless a low demand for these services among young men; this may be because these young men are unaware of the availability of these services, revealing that there is an urgent need to provide the population with information about the availability of no-cost HBV and HCV testing services.</p><p>Both HBV and HCV infections are hepatotropic infections and share common routes of transmission.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Being unaware of these routes of transmission imply a high risk of acquiring these infections and also unknowingly transmitting them to others. Although the major HBV transmission route in Brazil is unprotected sexual intercourse,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> less than half (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14,674) of the conscripts were aware of this information. Concerning HCV transmission, sharing drug-use instruments<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> accounts for most of the infections acquired in the country; however, approximately one-third (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11,876) of the study population was unaware of this information. We also observed lack of knowledge regarding well-known routes of transmission<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> (i.e., blood transfusions, sharing nail technician instruments, sharing razor blades or waxing and obtaining tattoos or piercings). Similarly, other studies have already demonstrated a low level of knowledge about viral hepatitis, suggesting the need for strategies to increase access to information, such as awareness campaigns targeted towards this population.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup></p><p>Early diagnosis of hepatitis infections is critical for effective treatment and care. The DIAHV has recommended that to define a seropositive HCV infection status, a positive anti-HCV screening test result should be confirmed by a positive HCV RNA assay.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> HCV RNA testing was not performed on the specimens in the current study. Nevertheless, recent studies have proposed the use of signal-to-cut-off (S/CO) ratios of screening-test-positive results as an alternative to a supplemental test in some circumstances, minimizing the number of specimens that require supplemental testing and providing a result that has a high probability of reflecting the person's true antibody status.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Recent studies have shown that a Elecsys Anti-HCV II S/CO ratio within 12.27 to 19.0 is predictive of a true positive result in &#x02265;95% of the cases.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup></p><p>This study was subject to some limitations:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>the screening methodology for anti-HCV employed in this study shows high sensitivity, which may have resulted in false-positive results, and consequently an overestimation of HCV seroprevalence levels;</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>data regarding Hepatitis B vaccination were self-reported by the conscripts;</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>illiterate conscripts were dismissed from military service and were not enrolled in the study;</p></list-item><list-item><label>4.</label><p>self-reported questionnaires were used, which may have led to losses due to inadequate responses regarding relevant information.</p></list-item></list><p>Nevertheless, these limitations were minimized by the use of standardized data collection instruments and laboratory measurements, the large size of the sample, and by the study design applied. Noteworthy, the DIAHV designed this study to assess the frequency and distribution of the STIs allowing the generalizability of the results at national level.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest a low prevalence of HBV and HCV infections (0.22% and 0.28%, respectively) and relatively low rates of self-reported HBV immunization among Brazilian young men. History of STIs, high number of sex partners, inconsistent use of condoms, and lack of awareness regarding the routes of transmission were significantly associated with HBV and HCV infections.</p><p>In order to achieve the goal of eliminating viral hepatitis, efforts to improve access to HCV and HBV information, testing, and surveillance are indicated. Thus, as more infected patients are diagnosed and the understanding of the distribution of these viral infections in the general population increases, groups at increased risk may be identified more easily and may be targeted for implementing prevention and control programs.</p><p>Further research among the illiterate male population is advised. Also, the inclusion of other serological markers for HBV that allow for stratifying patients based on phases of infection, and the use of HCV RNA testing to prevent overestimation in the HCV seroprevalence rates are recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the Brazilian Ministry of Defense and all study participants.
