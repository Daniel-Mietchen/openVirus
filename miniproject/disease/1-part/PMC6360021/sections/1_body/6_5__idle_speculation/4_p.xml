<p>The sequence analysis of replication-defective RSV29, believed to be an early passage of the original Rous isolate, suggests that this virus is a direct precursor of the Bryan high-titer strain [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The conclusion that this also indicates defectiveness of the original isolate is not warranted, as deletion of the 
 <italic>env</italic> gene could have occurred and could be selected for within the presumably short passage history of RSV29 [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].
