<p>Most of the roles of phages in human health and disease are yet to be unravelled. However, phages in all environments including the human microbiome are increasingly acknowledged to be the puppeteers of their bacterial hosts, shaping their structure and evolution and physiology. Phages associated with bacterial pathogens have multiple, often complex interactions with their bacterial hosts, forcing them to interact differently with other bacterial and human cells. Besides being the ultimate bacterial killers, phages can change bacterial surfaces to prevent recognition by the human immune system. In cystic fibrosis, they can allow their hosts to cope with anaerobic conditions found in mucus-laden lungs, and in many bacteria, they encode potent toxins [

Their ability to be developed as targeted removers of pathogenic bacteria is likely to be critical to solving the antimicrobial resistance crisis.
