<p>During the two-day conference, about 110 participants from 20 countries contributed in productive discussion on the four topics: (1) systems virology, (2) virus-host interactions and the virome, (3) virus classification and evolution and (4) epidemiology, surveillance and evolution. A number of high quality presentations were given by leading virologists and junior scientists. In addition to the eight invited speakers, we had twelve talks selected from the contributed submissions (see

It was clear that the distinction between laboratory and computer researchers is often blurred. That collaborating teams of individuals with different skill sets are often a road to success, while individuals working alone can still make massive contributions. Data-driven research is now mainstream, and the scale and complexity of datasets is ever increasing. Discussions highlighted how virology, like all of biology, is now a data science, exploiting methods from dimensionality reduction of large datasets to data visualisation. We took from this that virus bioinformatics is evolving and succeeding as an area of research in its own right at the interface of virology and computer science and that there are many ways to be a successful researcher.
