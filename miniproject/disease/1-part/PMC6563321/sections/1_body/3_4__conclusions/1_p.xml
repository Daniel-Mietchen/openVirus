<p>The Third Annual Meeting of the European Virus Bioinformatics Center brought together scientists in the field with expertise in different disciplines for scientific exchange and provided the opportunity for discussing ongoing and new collaborations. The meeting attracted new researchers to virus bioinformatics, which was reflected by several first-time attendees. The presentations strongly underlined the interdisciplinary “virology meets bioinformatics” character of the meeting. We enjoyed lively discussions after the speakers’ presentations, in the breaks, during the poster session and at the social events.</p>
