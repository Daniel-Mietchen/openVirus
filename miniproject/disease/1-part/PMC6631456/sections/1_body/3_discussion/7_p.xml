<p id="Par37">These characteristics are of great significance for laboratory detection and field epidemiology investigations. The duration of the disease observed in this outbreak was basically consistent with that of a previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Regarding the risk factors for transmission, previous studies have focused on risk factors for transmission in hospitals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our research reveals the risk factors for school transmission in remote areas in developing countries. Some risk factors, such as occurrence in the family, contact with a patient’s eye or hands, and sharing eye drops with a patient, are similar to those reported in previous studies. In this investigation, it was found that sharing soap, bedding, and pillows with patients were also risk factors for infection. Teachers generally have no close contact with students, so the disease is not widely spread among staff.
