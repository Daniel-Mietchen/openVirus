<p id="Par39">Prior to the outbreak of EKC, clinical cases of AHC had been reported in the local community. The investigation of the index cases in the two schools found that the two cases came to the clinic after the onset of the disease and returned to school 3 to 4 days after the illness. These two cases may be the source of infection of the outbreak. The incubation period of the disease could not be obtained in this outbreak due to the lack of exposure time. The event was initially identified as an AHC outbreak, which was handled according to the guidelines in the diagnostic criteria and management principles for EKC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and the patients were isolated for 7 to 10 days. Obviously, the isolation period of 7 to 10 days for EKC patients was not enough, as some patients still shed the virus. Sometimes, it is difficult to implement strict public health measures in schools. Insufficient periods of isolation for patients and relaxed control measures may be important factors in the persistence and spread of an outbreak. In China, AHC is the only notifiable acute conjunctivitis disease. Due to the lack of an aetiological diagnosis, clinically suspected cases of viral conjunctivitis are more likely to be reported as clinically diagnosed AHC cases in many areas. There was no adenovirus isolated in our study, which may be related to specimens containing decreased virus loads.
