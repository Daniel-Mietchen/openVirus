<p id="Par35">The duration of iatrogenic EKC outbreaks in hospitals is longer than that in schools. The reason may be that iatrogenic outbreaks are not easy to detect and a large number of people are exposed in batches. School outbreaks are easy to detect, and epidemic control measures can be implemented quickly. School attendance suspension may also prevent the outbreak from continuing. Most EKC outbreaks show two or more peaks, with different intervals of time between them [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It may be that a large number of people are exposed in groups at different times. After a long period, exposed groups will develop the disease at different times, but the exact reasons for this are unclear. According to previous studies, iatrogenic EKC outbreaks can occur throughout the year, and school EKC outbreaks occur most often between May and October. It is difficult to analyse because relatively fewer school outbreaks have occurred or been reported. Previous studies have shown that acute conjunctivitis is most common in summer [
