<p id="Par15">In May 2018, two outbreaks of acute conjunctivitis occurred in Weixi County Ethnic Primary School and Yongchun Township Central Primary School in succession. Both schools were full-time boarding schools; the students returned home on weekends. Nine to 11 students shared a dormitory in both schools. The students used their own face towels, soap, toothpaste, cups, and basins. Sometimes, some students shared soap with others. Students in the same dormitory shared a towel hanging rack. The students washed their faces, brushed their teeth and bathed in a public area. The toilets in the schools flushed automatically. The first outbreak appeared in the County Ethnic Primary School. There were 559 teachers and students in the school, including 515 students (male 263, female 252) and 44 staff. Grades 4 to 6 contained 12 classes. Yongchun Township Centre Primary School was 13 km from the county township. The school had 784 teachers and students. Among them, there were 730 students (male 377, female 353) and 54 staff. There were 19 classes in grade one to six (Table
