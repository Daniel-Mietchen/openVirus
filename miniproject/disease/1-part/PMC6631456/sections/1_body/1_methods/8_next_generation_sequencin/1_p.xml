<p id="Par23">A MiSeq sequencing library was prepared for deep sequencing using an Illumina Nextera XT Kit. The sequencing results were analysed by the CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5.2 (Qiagen, Denmark) and submitted to GenBank (isolation ID: MH 634393). The sequence was aligned by using MEGA software (version7.0) with the maximum likelihood method to construct the phylogenetic tree of the whole adenovirus genome and three major capsid genes, hexon, fibre and penton. The guiding value was 1000 (other parameters were default values).</p>
