We randomly selected one of the schools experiencing an outbreak to conduct case-identification and case-control studies with face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire administered by trained investigators; the Ethnic Primary School was chosen. The variables in the questionnaire for case-identification included essential information such as name, sex, age, onset date, grade, class, and clinical manifestations. An ophthalmologist inquired about the patient’s symptoms, examined the patient with a slit lamp, and made a clinical diagnosis. We adopted a 1:1 case-control methodology. According to a bilateral test level of
