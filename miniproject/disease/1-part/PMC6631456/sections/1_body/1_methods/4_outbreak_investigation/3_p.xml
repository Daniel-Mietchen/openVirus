<p id="Par19">A case-control study was conducted in the County Ethnic Primary School. All cases in grade 4â€“5 were included; those in grade 6 were not included, as students were taking a graduation examination. The corresponding control group was selected using simple random sampling from a list of student names in the same class with the IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 software package (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). In cases when the sample in the class was insufficient, more samples were obtained from a neighbouring class using the same method.</p>
