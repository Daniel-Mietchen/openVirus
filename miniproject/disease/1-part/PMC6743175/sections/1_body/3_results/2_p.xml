<p id="Par24">Among the 402 subjects with AECOPD, 141(35.1%) cases had pathogens detected. 13 cases (3.2%) had co-infections with more than 1 pathogen identified. Among the 80 COPD control subjects, 9(11.2%) patients had pathogens detected. None had more than 1 pathogen identified in the NPA. The prevalence of microorganisms identified in the COPD (AECOPD and stable) patients is shown in Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1. Only the AECOPD group and asthma exacerbation group (not control subjects), had influenza A identified by RTPCR in the NPA. For those with AECOPD and asthma exacerbation subjects, 5 out of the 50 (10.0%) and 1 out of 19 subjects (5.26%) had the H1N1pdm09 strain identified respectively. The rest of the influenza A belonged to the H3N2 strain.
