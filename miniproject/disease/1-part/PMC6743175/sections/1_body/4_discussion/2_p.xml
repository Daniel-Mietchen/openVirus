<p id="Par33">With advances in diagnostic technology, the rate of pathogen identification is higher in the current study than our previous study 10â€‰years ago (35.1 vs 22%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and influenza A viruses remained the most common pathogen identified. Most studies reported that HRV was the commonest virus identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast, relatively few studies reported influenza A as the most frequently found virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].
