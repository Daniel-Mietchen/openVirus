<p id="Par32">Using multiplex molecular detection of respiratory pathogens of adults hospitalized for AECOPD and asthma exacerbations, this study has found that the rates of pathogens identification in the NPA were 35 and 45% respectively. The rates were much lower among the corresponding control COPD and asthma subjects, which were 11.2 and 4.8% respectively. HRV typing suggested that HRV-A and HRV-C were the more common HRV that were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations with a wide variety of genotypes. Detection of microorganism in NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect the clinical outcomes including the hospital LOS, readmissions and mortality except that patients with asthma exacerbation, identification of pathogens was associated with a lower rate of readmissions at 30 and 60â€‰days.</p>
