<p id="Par36">For children, HRV-A and HRV-C are more frequently associated with asthma exacerbations. A cross-sectional study of subjects aged &lt; 18 years in Hong Kong between October 2008 and March 2009 found that asthma exacerbation was strongly associated with HRV and specifically HRV-C infections [

The pattern thus appeared different from the findings in children. A study in Japan showed that HRV-A or HRV-C had a potential role in precipitating asthma attacks among Japanese adult patients, with a broad genetic divergence [
