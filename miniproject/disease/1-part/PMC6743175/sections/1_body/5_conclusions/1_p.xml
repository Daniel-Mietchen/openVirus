<p id="Par40">The results in this study provided the latest pattern of viral and atypical pathogens that were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations in hospitalized patients. HRV typing suggested that HRV-A and HRV-C were the more common HRV subtypes that were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations with a wide variety of genotypes. Presence of microorganisms in the NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect the clinical outcomes including the hospital LOS, readmissions and mortality except that patients who had infective aetiology identified during asthma exacerbation had lower rates of readmissions at 30 and 60â€‰days.</p>
