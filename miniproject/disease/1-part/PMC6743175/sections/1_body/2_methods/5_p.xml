<p id="Par18">The NPA specimens collected were put immediately in viral transport medium and kept at 4 °C during transportation. Both viral RNA and DNA were extracted from the specimens using QIAamp® MinElute® Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and subjected to compliance with the European Union In-Vitro Diagnostics requirement. 22 respiratory pathogens (coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (including H1 and H3), influenza A H1N1pdm09, influenza B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4, rhinovirus/enterovirus, RSV-A and RSV-B, adenovirus, bocavirus,

Real-time multiplex PCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene Q® MDx instrument (Qiagen, Germany) and detection was based on melting curve analysis. Specimens positive for HRV/enterovirus were subjected to further sequencing work for virus typing, adopted from the method we described in our previous study [
