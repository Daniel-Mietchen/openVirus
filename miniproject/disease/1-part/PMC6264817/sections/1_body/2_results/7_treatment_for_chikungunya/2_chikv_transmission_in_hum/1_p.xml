<p>All the major epidemics reported in

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Other potential modes of CHIKV transmission have been reported, including human exposure through infected blood transfusions (2/1159; 0.2%), or needle pricks with infected blood (3/1159; 0.3%); 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Accidental CHIKV transmission was reported in three articles; two in laboratory staff working with infected mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref262" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>], and one report of an infected nurse who was potentially exposed while drawing blood from an infected patient [

One study found evidence of CHIKV transmission through corneal grafts and the authors propose banning cornea donations in CHIKV endemic areas [
