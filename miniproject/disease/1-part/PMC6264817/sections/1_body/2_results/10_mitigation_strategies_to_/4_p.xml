 <bold>Insecticidal use:</bold> Insecticide use to control CHIKV vector populations was reported in 156/323 (48%) articles. Ten used a targeted ovicide (10/156; 6%),105/156 (67%) used a larvicide and 49/156 (31%) used an adulticide. Of all the articles reporting on insecticidal use, 24/156 (15%) articles evaluated the insecticide for its efficacy at the community level, while the remaining investigated plant extracts and other compounds experimentally for their efficacy as a potential insecticide. Two articles described the use of lethal ovitraps as a successful mitigation strategy against CHIKV vectors [
