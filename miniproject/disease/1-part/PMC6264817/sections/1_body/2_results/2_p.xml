<p>The focus area researched most extensively was epidemiology of chikungunya related to hosts and vectors, with a total of 912/2326 (39%) studies. A little over one third of the articles (764/2326; 33%) reported on signs, symptoms and diagnosis of CHIKV in humans. Treatment for chikungunya in humans was reported in 283/2326 (12%) studies, and mitigation strategies against CHIKV in both humans and vectors comprised 323/2326 (14%) studies. There were 410/2326 (18%) vector studies with relevance to vector competence for transmitting CHIKV and vector behavioural characteristics, while 256/2326 (11%) studies examined phylogeny and signature evolutionary mutations of CHIKV. Also included were 208/2326 (9%) studies describing surveillance programs for CHIKV in humans, other hosts and vectors. The accuracy of CHIKV diagnostic tests was evaluated in 167/2326 (7%) studies. Research areas with fewer studies included modeling studies with relevance to CHIKV and/or its vectors; 103/2326 (4%), social impact examining knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of chikungunya in various target human populations in 46/2326 (2%) studies, and 23/2326 (1%) studies on the economic burden of chikungunya. There were 406/2326 (17%) pathogenesis studies on pathways or mechanisms at the cellular level and detailed study characterization (DCU) was not conducted on these studies. Many studies reported on multiple focus areas. 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> is a heat chart of the number of studies in each major and minor focus area by study population category and is referenced throughout the manuscript to aid the reader in tracking the quantity of research underpinning different areas of chikungunya research. This ScR focuses on the detailed characteristics of the 1510 /2326 (65%) articles on vertebrate hosts for CHIKV, while only high level category information is presented for 406/2326 (17%) articles on pathogenesis and immunity related pathways of CHIKV infection. Results from CHIKV vector studies (410/2326; 18%) on important competence and behavioural vector characteristics will be summarized in a subsequent article.
