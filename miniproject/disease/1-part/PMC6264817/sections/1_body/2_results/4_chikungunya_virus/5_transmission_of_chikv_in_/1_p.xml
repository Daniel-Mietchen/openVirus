<p>Very few studies have been conducted outside Africa to investigate sylvatic transmission, but evidence from Africa has shown cyclic surges in CHIKV circulating among arboreal mosquitoes and vertebrate host populations [

One experimental study demonstrated that genetically modified mice with deficiencies in their type 1 interferon response (IRF3/7-/-) were able to transmit CHIKV mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. In addition, results from the same study showed that saliva from several infected monkeys was positive for the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus, which could potentially lead to CHIKV transmission without a vector [
