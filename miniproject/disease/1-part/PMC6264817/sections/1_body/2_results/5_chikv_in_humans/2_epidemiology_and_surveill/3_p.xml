<p>Risk factors for developing chikungunya infection in humans were investigated in 345 studies. Landscape associated risk factors were reported in 100/345 (29%) studies with variables such as coastal (8/100), inland (3/100), elevated (5/100), urban (24/100), suburban or peri-urban (8/100), rural (21/100), farm or agricultural land (3/100), forest (5/100), parks (2/100), private gardens (7/100) and type of dwelling (19/100) investigated. Climatic indices as risk factors were investigated in 75/345 (22%) studies with precipitation (28/75; 37%), season (34/75; 45%) and temperature (9/75; 12%) predominantly studied. Other risk factors studied were occupation (26/345; 8%), outdoor recreational activities (4/345; 1%), storage of tires (4/345; 1%) and stagnant water on property, in containers, vases and flower pots (23/345; 7%). Travel to and from endemic areas was reported as a risk factor in 215/345 (62%) studies. Chikungunya incidence was reported to be highest in individuals aged 55–64 years and lowest in the 0–14 age group [
