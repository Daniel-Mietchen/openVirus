<p>There were 126/208 (61%) surveillance articles reporting on CHIKV in humans (
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including 36/126 (29%) articles on travel-related syndromic surveillance and 2/126 (2%) articles on surveillance for CHIKV in the blood donor system. Active surveillance for CHIKV in humans during epidemics was reported in 26/126 (21%) studies, often in a hospital or tertiary care setting. Some results originated from resource limited countries where large epidemics were occurring and the surveillance protocol involved public health staff going door-to-door in impoverished neighbourhoods to identify CHIKV cases [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Monitoring programs in epidemic settings were reported in 6/126 (5%) human surveillance studies. These were systematic and purposeful programs mainly focussed on collecting numbers of chikungunya patients without a rigid action plan. Passive surveillance, mainly syndromic surveillance for CHIKV during epidemics was reported in 14/126 (11%) articles where data on chikungunya patients were collected in a hospital or other healthcare setting. In non-epidemic settings, there were 43/126 (34%) active surveillance articles for CHIKV in humans, 17/126 (13%) articles on monitoring programs, and 57/126 (45%) articles on passive surveillance.
