 <xref rid="pone.0207554.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. These included 117/848 (14%) epidemic investigations and 242/848 (29%) prevalence surveys. Human CHIKV prevalence results representing the burden of CHIKV during epidemics were reported in 16/242 (6.6%) studies, while 134/242 (55%) studies investigated the presence of antibodies against CHIKV in populations after an epidemic. Incidence was reported in 51/848 (6%) studies with 12/848 (1%) studies reporting CHIKV incidence during epidemics, while attack rates were reported in 31/848 (4%) studies soon after the epidemic. CHIKV related mortality was reported in 36/848 (4%) studies and in many cases death was associated with a pre-existing chronic morbidity [
