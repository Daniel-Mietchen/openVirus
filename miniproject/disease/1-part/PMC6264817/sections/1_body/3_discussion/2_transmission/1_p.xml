<p>Many studies report sylvatic transmission in Africa, where the virus is thought to be maintained by circulating between NHPs, rodents, reptiles and bats, with arboreal mosquitoes as vectors in the sylvatic cycle [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], however, there is limited research on sylvatic transmission outside Africa. While the urban transmission cycle between humans and mosquitoes is well understood, sylvatic cycles in areas outside Africa likely exist and may not be elucidated at the present time. Due to the hypermutability of CHIKV, it is conceivable that the virus could have adapted to new hosts and vectors in areas where CHIKV has expanded recently, thereby introducing a substantial risk for CHIKV to initiate a sylvatic cycle in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref287" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>]. A knowledge gap exists in our full understanding of vertebrate hosts that may contribute to the sylvatic transmission cycle and maintenance of CHIKV in endemic areas. Future research can focus on filling current knowledge gaps that could facilitate a better understanding of the roles of various hosts and vectors in CHIKV transmission cycles contributing to the spread, emergence and maintenance of CHIKV globally, as this knowledge is important for developing effective mitigation strategies and more accurate risk analyses.
