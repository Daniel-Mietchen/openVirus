<p>Vertical transmission of CHIKV was observed in humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref288" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>]. The impact of intra-uterine CHIKV infection on the fetus and neonates is not clearly understood with conflicting results from several studies. One study looked at dizygous twins born to a mother infected during pregnancy and reported one healthy neonate, while the other twin was severely ill due to congenitally acquired chikungunya [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref267" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Another study examining outcomes of CHIKV infection to the fetus during each trimester of pregnancy until post-partum reported vertical transmission in all three trimesters, with more serious outcomes to neonates when mothers were viremic at delivery [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>]. It is important to keep in mind that vertical transmission of chikungunya in an asymptomatic infected mother or neonate can also trigger a cluster of cases among pregnant women or new mothers and neonates in maternity units. A single case of microcephaly in a neonate born to a mother with gestational chikungunya infection has been described [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref290" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>]. Microcephaly is believed to be an outcome associated with ZIKV infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref291" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>]. We acknowledge that this could be a coincidental finding, but CHIKV associated microcephaly certainly warrants future research given that CHIKV and ZIKV co-circulate in many regions. There has been no research on sexual transmission of CHIKV, despite evidence for this with ZIKV. Interestingly, viable CHIKV has been isolated from an individualâ€™s semen and urine sample up to 30 days post-infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and one study provided experimental evidence for the presence of infectious CHIKV in human saliva [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], so the possibility of sexual transmission of CHIKV in humans needs to be clearly elucidated.
