<p>One of the challenges of estimating the true burden of CHIKV is due to a high proportion of asymptomatic and mild cases who may not seek medical attention. This underestimation can affect results for predictive models, mitigation strategies and other analyses that use surveillance data as inputs. Misclassification of chikungunya as dengue or zika infections could also occur as these infections are often co-circulating and share overlapping symptoms [

A complete understanding of whether co-infections with CHIKV can lead to altered symptoms or sequelae is also required. One study reported evidence of possible sequential CHIKV infection [
