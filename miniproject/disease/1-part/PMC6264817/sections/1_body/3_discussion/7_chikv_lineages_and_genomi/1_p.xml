<p>Many outbreaks in India have been linked to different CHIKV lineages [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref312" ref-type="bibr">312</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref313" ref-type="bibr">313</xref>]. Since there is evidence for two separate virus introductions in Brazil with different lineages of CHIKV during the same epidemic period [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref314" ref-type="bibr">314</xref>], it is important to keep in mind that there may be a strong likelihood that this can also occur elsewhere. With many reports of co-circulating CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>], it would be interesting to examine whether there is evidence for possible horizontal acquisition of genetic elements for virulence between co-circulating viruses in endemic areas. There has been a lot of research on CHIKV mutations and phylogeny for investigating the evolutionary relatedness of CHIKV isolates across epidemics in different geographical areas, as well as to identify genetic changes in the virus as it evolves over time. Many articles reported an important amino acid change in the EI outer membrane glycoprotein region of the virus with an alanine to valine substitution at position 226 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref315" ref-type="bibr">315</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref316" ref-type="bibr">316</xref>]. This mutation reportedly allowed the virus to gain 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> as a new and highly competent vector to aid in its transmission more efficiently [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref317" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>]. This mutation contributed significantly to the global expansion of risk areas for chikungunya and also highlights the plasticity of CHIKV and its potential to mutate, adapt and emerge or re-emerge in different areas. There is great concern that more selective mutations in the virus will facilitate its success in efficiently gaining more competent vectors and host reservoirs from invasive species [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref316" ref-type="bibr">316</xref>], and if this occurs, public health risks from CHIKV could increase globally. At the same time, there is also evidence of genetic stability in CHIKV isolates, where isolates that share a common origin but were collected over many years and in different regions maintained a high degree of identity [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref318" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. Several CHIKV mutations associated with adaptation and fitness were reported in the literature and are compiled in this ScR.
