<p>Chikungunya disease is caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>. The virus was first isolated from a patient in Tanzania during an outbreak of a dengue-like illness that had been circulating in that area between 1952 and 1953. Frequent descriptions of this illness had been reported in earlier years in other parts of Africa, including Mozambique [

The proportion of asymptomatic CHIKV infections during epidemics has been reported to be between 3 to 28% [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This makes CHIKV diagnosis difficult, particularly since there are many reports of co-circulating CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV in many areas with co-infected patients [
