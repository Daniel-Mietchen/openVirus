<p>CHIKV is an enveloped, positive strand RNA virus with a genome usually a little less than 12000 nucleotides. Its genome consists of five structural proteins; E1, E2, E3, C (Capsid protein), 6K, and four non-structural proteins; non-structural proteins 1 (nsP1), 2 (nsP2), 3 (nsP3) and 4 (nsP4) [

Evolutionary studies on the virus provide evidence that the West African lineage of CHIKV originated in Africa and subsequently moved into Asia where it evolved into a distinct Asian lineage. The CHIKV isolate from the epidemic in Reunion Island in 2005 showed that the virus evolved into the East/Central/South African (ECSA) lineage with more recent Indian Ocean strains forming an Indian Ocean sub-lineage within ECSA [
