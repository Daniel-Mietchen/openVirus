<p>The third stage of the ScR was data characterization of all relevant articles using the DCU tool; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207554.s002">S1 Protocol</xref>. Questions included general information on when and where the research was conducted, the study population and genotype of CHIKV. The research focus area(s) was selected at this step and reviewers could access a unique set of questions tailored to each focus area, which aided in efficient characterization of the research. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies examining pathogenesis and/or immunomodulatory mechanisms associated with CHIKV infection in hosts and vectors were identified at the second stage of screening; however, due to the large number of articles on this single focus area, these studies were not characterized in detail at the third stage of the ScR as this was logistically unfeasible for completion within a reasonable timeframe.
