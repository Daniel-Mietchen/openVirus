  <p>Schematic illustration of the ANXA1 receptor in the pathogenesis of IAV infection. Infection by IAV induces the upregulation of ANXA1 receptor, FPR2 (
   <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ampomah et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, ANXA1 is incorporated into the viral envelope during budding of the virus. Increased levels of FPR2 become available for activation by ANXA1 found on viral progenies. This process activates the ERK signaling pathway and ultimately results in increased viral replication (
   <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Tcherniuk et al., 2016</xref>). Also, FPR2 may enhance endosomal export of vRNP into the nucleus, which enhances viral replication and propagation (
