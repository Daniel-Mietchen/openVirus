<p>It was recently reported that Annexin A1 (ANXA1) enhances IAV infection (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Arora et al., 2016</xref>). Infection with IAV enhanced ANXA1 expression, and overexpression of ANXA1 in A549 lung epithelial cells enhanced virus replication

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited improved mortality and morbidity when infected with a lethal dose of IAV, with low viral loads in their lungs compared to their wildtype littermates. ANXA1 was found to co-localize with IAV in early and late endosomes, implying that ANXA1 facilitates endosomal trafficking of IAV (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Arora et al., 2016</xref>). This process is important for subsequent import of vRNP into the nucleus after release from the endosome. Localization of vRNP in the nucleus is essential for transcription of viral mRNA and subsequent translation into an infective virion (
