<p>Annexin A1 (ANXA1) also known as lipocortin-I, is a member of the annexin family of proteins formed by 346 amino acids (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Gerke et al., 2005</xref>). The changes that occur upon a conformational change may reflect a need for interacting with potential receptors and the functions of the proteins. Blood immune cells such as monocytes and granulocytes express high levels of ANXA1 and are the largest source of cellular ANXA1 with lymphocytes possessing moderate expression levels (
