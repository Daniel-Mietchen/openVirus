<p>The pathogenesis of IAV is dependent on both virus and host factors. Viral HA proteins bind to α2-6 sialylated glycans expressed on human epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract to facilitate viral entry into the cell. Upon infection, the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) of IAV is detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as endosomal toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) or cytosolic retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I). This induces anti-viral host responses via a series of signaling cascade for the production of type I interferon that limits viral replication. Virus-induced transcription factors such as interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), as well as IRF-7, serve essential roles in the expression of type-I interferons (
