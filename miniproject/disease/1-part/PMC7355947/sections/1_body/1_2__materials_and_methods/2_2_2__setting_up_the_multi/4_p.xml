<p>To test the coating of the antigens, we incubated 10 nM sulfo-tagged neutral chimeric avidin in the wells for 1 h at RT on shaking, washed the wells, added 150 µL of 2× sulfo-tag substrate and ran the measurement with the MSD instrument. After receiving similar signals from all the antigens with the coating control, we tested our positive control Nanogam. Once we established that the pooled serum concentrate gave signal for all antigens, we moved on to analyzing the individual serum samples.</p>
