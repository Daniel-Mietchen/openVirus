<p>U-PLEX Development Pack was obtained from Meso Scale Discovery. Linker reactions were modified to the U-PLEX 10 kit standard so that molar excess of linkers to antigens was adjusted based on the amount of biotins/antigen. For example: If antigen had four biotins, we used the recommended amount of protein and if the antigen had three biotins, 1.33 times the recommended amount of the biotinylated protein was included.</p>
