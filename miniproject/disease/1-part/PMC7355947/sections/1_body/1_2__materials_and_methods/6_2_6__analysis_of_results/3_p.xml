<p>Min-max normalization was calculated with the following formula (Equation (2)). 
 <disp-formula>scaled(x) = (((b − a) × (x − min(x))) / (max(x) − min(x))) + a
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where x, is a signal from the distribution of signals for an antigen across all (adult or child) participants, a = 0 = desired minimum value after scaling and b = desired maximum value after scaling.
