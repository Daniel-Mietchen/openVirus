<p>The sequences were obtained as synthetic gene strings from GeneArt. Hexahistidine-tags were added to the 5â€² end of the VP1s and the resulting sequences were flanked with restriction sites (BamHI and EcoRI), as well as generic sequences for PCR-amplification (not included into expression cassette). The gene strings were amplified with PCR and purified from agarose gel-electrophoresis. Both the purified VP1 sequences and pGEX-2T vectors were cut with FastDigest Restriction Enzymes BamHI and EcoRI (Thermo Scientific, Loughborough, UK), the plasmid was phosphatase treated with FastAP (Thermo Scientific, Loughborough, UK), and the cut fragments were purified using agarose gel electrophoresis. Ligation reactions were transformed into chemically competent Top 10 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells using heat shock method and plated onto LB-Amp plates. Colonies were picked, minipreps prepared and DNA-sequenced with in house Sanger sequencing service. The amino acid sequences of all the recombinant VP1 proteins have been listed for easy comparison in
