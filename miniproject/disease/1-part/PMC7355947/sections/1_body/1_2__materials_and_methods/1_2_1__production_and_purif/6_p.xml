<p>Proteins were dialyzed into PBS pH 7.4 and biotinylated for 3 h with 20× molar excess of EZ-link biotin reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, U.S.A., catalogue number #35389) at RT. Unbound biotin was removed by dialysis. Relative degree of biotinylation was analyzed densitometrically with a procedure resembling Western blotting: 10 µg of purified, biotinylated antigen were loaded on ready–made BioRad Criterion TGX stain-free gels. Monobiotinylated BSA (biotinylation quantified with a B4F assay [
 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) was loaded (10 µg, 20 µg, 40 µg, 80 µg) onto the gel as a standard. After transfer, the BSA-blocked membranes were incubated with 10 nM neutral chimeric avidin [

After a washing step an in-house rabbit-anti-avidin polyclonal antibody was used to detect the neutral chimeric avidin bound to the biotnylated antigens. Unbound antibodies were washed away and an HRP-conjugated horse-anti-rabbit antibody was used as a detection antibody. ECL reagent was added to the washed membrane and the resulting chemiluminescence was imaged and densitometrically quantified using Biorad Chemidoc instrument with Image Lab software. Nanogam was used as a positive control sample to detect VP1 antigens in Western blot.
