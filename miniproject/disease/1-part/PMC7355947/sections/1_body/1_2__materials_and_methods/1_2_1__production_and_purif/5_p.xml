<p>Samples from each purification step were run on SDS-PAGE Criterion TGX stain-free gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting to analyze the purification process and the purities of the final products. Nanogam a pooled human serum concentrate and a HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Dako cytomations P0214) were used for detection. Protein concentrations were measured using UV-VIS spectroscopy and Pierce BCA protein assay kit (23225).</p>
