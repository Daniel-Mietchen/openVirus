<p>For protein production, the verified plasmids were transformed into BL21 Star (DE3) 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and small seed cultures prepared overnight at +37 °C. Larger expression cultures were inoculated with the seed cultures and grown to OD600 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C and the VP1 production induced using 100 µM IPTG. The culturing temperature was then lowered to 28 °C and the cultures were harvested the following day. The bacteria were pelleted by 20 min centrifugation at 4,000 rcf. The pellet was resuspended into pH 8.0 PBS and the bacteria lysed using sonication. The lysate was clarified by 20 min centrifugation at 25,000 rcf and the supernatant incubated overnight with glutathione resin at +4 °C on shaking. The resin was washed with the binding buffer and the protein eluted with a Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 500 mM NaCl, pH 8) including 40 mM glutathione and 20 mM imidazole. VP1 containing fractions were pooled and bound to Histrap resin for 1 h at RT, washed with Tris buffer with 30% glycerol and eluted with Tris buffer containing 500 mM imidazole.
