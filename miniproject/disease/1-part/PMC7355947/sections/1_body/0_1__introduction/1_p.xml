<p>Enteroviruses (EV) constitute a large group of common non-enveloped RNA viruses that cause a wide variety of diseases ranging from mild skin conditions and respiratory problems to more severe inflammation in the heart [

 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], or the pancreas [

The hand, foot, and mouth disease epidemics are also frequently caused by enteroviruses and have led to severe encephalitis especially in China and Southeast Asia [

While the infections caused by enteroviruses are common and there are more than 200 known serotypes of enteroviruses, there are not many serological tools with wide coverage for diagnosing and studying them. Currently, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is widely used to diagnose these infections by detecting viral RNA in clinical samples. RT-PCR is a valuable tool when the sample can be taken at the acute phase of infection, but it cannot detect already resolved recent infections and it does not routinely allow identification of the serotype that caused the infection [

 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This can lead to wrong/false negative findings as the virus is present in a clinical sample only for a few days [
