<p>Enterovirus infections have also been linked to chronic diseases. For example, they have been linked to the development of chronic dilated cardiomyopathy, [

Studies on possible role of enterovirus infections in chronic diseases require large prospective follow-up cohort follow-ups where infections should be diagnosed long before the disease onset. In such studies, serological assays offer clear benefits since the samples do not need to be taken during the acute phase of the infection. This is particularly important aspect in enterovirus infections since the majority of acute infections are subclinical.
