<p>As testing for multiple antigens using traditional ELISA, especially with an extensive set of samples, is very labor intensive, and multiplexing platforms based on spotting cannot be changed once the antigens have been plated, we decided to use something more flexible, and adapted the test to Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) U-PLEX linker-based platform (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f001">Figure 1</xref>) which is simple, fast, and allowed us to change the antigens on the fly. The resulting multiplexed serological assay is suitable for evaluating the serological history with low sample volumes and can be quickly adapted to suit different needs by changing individual antigens.
