<p>Enterovirus species that infect humans include enteroviruses A through D (EV-A, EV-B, EV-C, EV-D) and rhinoviruses A through C (RV-A, RV-B, RV-C). Since enterovirus VP1 capsid proteins have the most sequence variation between serotypes and species, they are theoretically the best option as antigen in assays aiming at detection of antibody responses against different enterovirus types. However, they also contain the enterovirus group-specific 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal antigenic epitope, which binds antibodies that have been induced by a wide variety of different enteroviruses [

We set out to see if a panel of VP1-proteins from representatives of all human infecting enterovirus species could be used to make an assay that can identify antibody responses to enteroviruses on a species level. To this panel of species-specific antigens, we added conserved non-structural enterovirus proteins that we have shown in a previous study to act as markers for an acute enterovirus infection in adults [
