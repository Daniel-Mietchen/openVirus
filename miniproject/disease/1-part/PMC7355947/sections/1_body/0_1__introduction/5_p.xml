<p>Prototype viruses representing different species of human enterovirus and rhinovirus including CVA4 (EV-A), CVB1 (EV-B), PV1 (EV-C), EV-D68 (EV-D), RV-A89, RV-B14, and RV-C3 (nomenclature according to International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)) were selected based on their previous use as vaccines or due to their pathogenicity. For example, PV1 was chosen since vaccinating for it is a part of the national vaccination program in many countries and EV-D68 was selected due to the serious epidemics in Western countries in recent years [
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. RV-A89 and RV-B14 were picked since they are used in prototype vaccines and have been shown to produce cross-neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and RV-C3 was chosen because this serotype has been associated with asthma [
