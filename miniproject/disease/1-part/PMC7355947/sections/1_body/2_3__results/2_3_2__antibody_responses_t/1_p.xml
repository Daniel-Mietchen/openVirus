<p>We compared the antibody responses between the different adult groups based on their previous capture IgM assay results [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) as well as between adults and children (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Non-characterized adult serum samples collected from healthy individuals from Tampere biobank collection were included in the analysis as representatives of population background. The antibody responses towards EV and RV antigens are on average higher in IgM positive adult participants than in IgM negative controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Similarly, we observed the range of antibody responses in the previously non-characterized biobank samples overlapping both the responses in enterovirus IgM negative and IgM positive samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). We conducted Wilcoxon rank-sum test to study the differences of IgM negative and positive groups and the found significant difference (
