<p>To investigate antibody responses at the level of individual participants, we plotted the min–max-normalized and scaled (Equation (2)) responses as radarplots for adults and children (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,D respectively). To keep in mind the cross-reactivity of antibody responses, we also plotted the spearman correlation coefficients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f005">Figure 5</xref>B,C). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f005">Figure 5</xref>A shows that the 20 IgM positive adults have on average higher 2A and/or 3C responses than the IgM negative ones, but it is hard to pick out the possible infecting agent based solely on VP1 responses as the signal levels are often similar for several ones simultaneously, regardless of IgM antibody status. This is also reflected in the correlation coefficients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), most notably for enteroviruses A–D. Comparing 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f005">Figure 5</xref>B,C, which depict the correlation of antigen responses in adults and children, the antibody responses in children are less correlated than in adults. This is also evident when comparing individual responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,D): In adults we typically see multiple high signals simultaneously, whereas in children there are only one or two high VP1 responses. Based on these results it seems like the antibody responses in children are more species specific than in adults, likely reflecting their more limited infection history.
