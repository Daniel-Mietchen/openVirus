<p>To study the specificity of the antibody reaction in the multiplex assay, we plotted the antibody responses to antigen pairs both in adults and children (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f004">Figure 4</xref>). To reduce the background noise, we considered everything below a log10(2.5) threshold (based on measured BSA signals from dilution buffer) to have a signal level of zero and subtracted the same value from remaining positive signals. Scatterplots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B show that there is a great deal of cross-reactivity in the adult antibody responses, but very little in children. This difference is well summarized in the correlation coefficients for antigen pairs.
