<p>VP1 proteins from all human infecting enterovirus species (EV-A to EV-D) as well as rhinovirus species (RV-A to RV-C) were expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as described in materials and methods section, and their purity, biotinylation status (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), and antigenicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) were analyzed with Western blotting before they were used in the multiplex assay. For CVA4, CVB1 and EV-D68 VP1s we observed double bands, which we have seen previously for various VP1 proteins [
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and presumably the double band is a result of partial C-terminal proteolysis, as evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f0A1">Figure A1</xref>C, where anti-histag detected all VP1s. Also, Nanogam (which we have also used as positive control in the multiplex assay) recognized all VP1 proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Nanogam detected the RV VP1s most strongly as expected from a pooled human serum concentrate, since rhinoviruses are extremely common. The bands observed between 20 and 30 kDa are most likely a result of proteolysis occurring between GST and the VP1 part of the fusion protein, as the size matches with VP1 and we observed 3A6 and Dako 5D8/1 monoclonal antibodies (both of which target the EV group specific epitope [
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) recognizing this band in CVB1 sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00963-f0A1">Figure A1</xref>B,D). These analyses confirmed that the antigen preparations did not contain large amounts of impurities and that they are properly biotinylated to function as antigens in the U-PLEX assay.
