<p>We have developed a novel multiplex immunoassay covering all the enterovirus species. Using human samples from confirmed enterovirus-infected and healthy individuals, we have shown that the antibody responses towards different enteroviruses and rhinoviruses are more species specific in children than in adults. We have also shown that the developed multiplex assay is versatile and after further validation it has potential to find use in both patient diagnostics as well as for studying pathogen-disease connections associated with enteroviruses and rhinoviruses in large cohort studies.</p>
