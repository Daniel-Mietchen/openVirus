<p>There are a few possible strategies to make the assay less cross-reactive. One would involve removing the enterovirus and rhinovirus specific epitopes from VP1 antigens and another one could involve pre-incubating serum samples with said epitopes to reduce binding to the plated antigens. Using this panel of antigens for studying the IgM fraction of sera could also make the test more specific and relevant for diagnosing acute infections, as IgM responses have been shown to be less cross-reactive than IgG-response [

Studying only the IgM antibodies would however require a serum fractionation step prior to applying the samples to the assay if it is to stay on this platform. If we achieved better specificity, it could be then possible to distinguish between serotypes as well as species by looking at immune profile “fingerprint” patterns in antigen reactivity, revealing the recent infection history.
