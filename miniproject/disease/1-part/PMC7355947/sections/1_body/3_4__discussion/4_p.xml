<p>The multiplex assay is very flexible and fast to run. The U-PLEX platform is typically used as a sandwich assay [

The run time for two 96 well plates for this assay including sample preparation, coating and incubations was roughly 5 h for one person. Therefore, a multiplexed approach for studying large serum collections would greatly increase efficiency of cohort studies. The platform we chose is flexible for prototyping assays as we can easily try different combinations of antigens. This simple change could make the panel more relevant to Asian countries, where hand, foot and mouth disease caused primarily by EV-A71 and CVA16 is prevalent, while the rest of the panel stayed the same. The authors are unaware of any other immunology based multiplex assay for enteroviruses that has as broad coverage as the one we describe in the current study. This kind of multiplexed assay could solve many of the problems large scale studies such as DIPP [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] are facing. Because the assay is sensitive and requires small sample volumes, less hands-on work is required in the laboratory and a smaller number of plates needs to be run as opposed to regular ELISA. This also has the added benefit of reducing the effects of inter-plate variation.
