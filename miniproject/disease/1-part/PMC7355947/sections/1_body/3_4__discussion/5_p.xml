<p>Studying the cross-reactivity of enterovirus antibody responses using this multiplex assay is simple. Information on cross-reactivity could be important for studying prototype vaccinesâ€™ responses, or if aiming to produce more accurate assays by reducing cross-reactivity. In recent years the interest in vaccinating against enteroviruses that cause chronic diseases have gained more momentum and prototype vaccines are being developed [

 <italic>N</italic>-terminal enterovirus group-specific immunodominant epitope; however, it is not a neutralizing one [
