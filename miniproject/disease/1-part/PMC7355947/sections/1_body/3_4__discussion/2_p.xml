<p>The U-PLEX multiplex assay based on VP1 antigens from human infecting enteroviruses and rhinoviruses produced interesting results. We showed that the antibody reactions to VP1 antigens were stronger and had more cross-reactivity in adults than in children. Because the antibody responses are more specific in children, this assay could be applied for testing cohort serum libraries collected primarily from children. Running this multiplex assay for samples that have already been characterized, initially to show repeatability of results, could further validate the specificity of the antibody responses. Such validation would also tell if this assay could be suitable for clinical use as well.</p>
