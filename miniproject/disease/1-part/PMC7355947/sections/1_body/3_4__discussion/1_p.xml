<p>Immunological assays for studying enterovirus and rhinovirus infections when compared to PCR-based methods answer a different question. While RT-PCR can identify the presence of a virus, it will not tell anything about the immune response to it. Also, enteroviruses are detectable only for a short window of time in the patientâ€™s blood with RT-PCR, whereas antibody responses can be much longer lived. On one hand RT-PCR requires larger sample volumes, which can be a problem, when running analysis from unique analytes with limited volume. On the other hand, due to the variability of antibody responses, setting a clear cutoff threshold for determining acute infections for viruses as common as enteroviruses and rhinoviruses can prove difficult and would require testing multiple samples with known infection histories confirmed by other means. We believe that with further testing we could use the antibody responses for non-structural proteins to assess how acute an infection is [
