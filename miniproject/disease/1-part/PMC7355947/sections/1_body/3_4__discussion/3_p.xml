<p>The proteases 2A and 3C, included in the panel, gave similar results to our previous study focusing on enterovirus-IgM negative and IgM positive adults [
 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-08-00963" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In that study we found the antibodies against viral proteases as potent markers for an acute infection in adults. Here, we found that children often had high 3C reactivity, but low VP1 responses, indicating that either, protease specific antibodies would not serve as marker for acute infections in children or that the VP1 responses in children are more serotype specific than we expected. If the antibody responses to VP1s in children are indeed more serotype than species specific, then it could explain why we see high responses to the proteases which’ sequences are more conserved between enteroviruses than the VP1s’ [
