 <caption>
  <p>Scatterplots and correlations of antibody responses between different enterovirus antigens. The lower diagonal has scatterplots showing how pairs of antibody responses are correlated in (
   <bold>A</bold>) adults and (
   <bold>B</bold>) children and in the upper diagonal shows the corresponding Spearman correlation coefficients. In panel A, the diagonal shows the distribution of antibody responses grouped by IgM status: blue represents IgM positive group, green the IgM negative group and red the Tampere biobank samples collected from healthy adults, for which we do not know the IgM status, and which are representing the population background.
