 <caption>
  <p>Antigen specific min-max normalized antibody responses and correlations of antibody responses between different enterovirus antigens. Antigen specific min-max normalized antibody responses (see Equation (2)) in the multiplex assay illustrated as radar plots for individual (
   <bold>A</bold>) adults and (
   <bold>D</bold>) children. Radii of the sectors represent normalized signal intensities. Age grouped Spearman correlations for antibody responses are illustrated as matrices for adults (
   <bold>B</bold>) and children (
   <bold>D</bold>). Min-max normalization was performed separately for adults and children, due to differences in signal levels in the two groups. Comparing (
   <bold>A</bold>) to (
   <bold>D</bold>) and (
   <bold>B</bold>) to (
   <bold>C</bold>), the differences between antibody responses in adults and children become apparent.
