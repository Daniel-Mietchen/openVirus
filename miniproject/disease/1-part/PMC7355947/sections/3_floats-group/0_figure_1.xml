  <p>Multiplex assay development. Representative VP1 protein sequences from all human infecting enterovirus and rhinovirus species were equipped with an N-terminal GST-tag and a C-terminal 6xhis-tag for purification after bacterial expression. The purified recombinant VP1 proteins along with 2A and 3C proteases from CVB3 and a BSA control were biotinylated and each antigen was coupled to a unique U-PLEX linker. During coating each U-PLEX linker coupled antigen would target a specific site at the bottom of the well. After coating, the assay is run like a regular indirect ELISA, except for having a secondary antibody with electrochemiluminescence tag, and a suitable substrate and an MSD plate reader.</p>
