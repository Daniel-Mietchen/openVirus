<p>To investigate the inter-dependency among the substitutions, we introduced single or multiple GI virus NS2B-V99L, NS3-A78S, and NS3-E177D substitutions into rGIII viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Seven mutant rGIII viruses were generated and their infectivity evaluated using C6/36 cells at 28°C and VERO, PK-15, and DF-1 cells at 41°C. rGIII, rGI, and rGIII/GI NS1-3 viruses were included as controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g008">Fig 8B–8E</xref>). As expected, all recombinants yielded similar viral titers in C6/36 and VERO cells but rGIII virus exhibited a significantly lower titer than rGIII/GI NS1-3 viruses in PK-15 and DF-1 cells at 48 HPI. Mutant rGIII viruses encoding single NS2B-V99L, NS3-A78S, double NS2B-V99L-NS3-A78S, or triple substitutions yielded significantly higher viral titers (0.59 to 1.00-log increase in viral titer) in both PK-15 and DF-1 cells as compared to rGIII virus (p&lt; 0.05). The effect of substitutions on viral replication was further evaluated by inoculating mutant rGIII viruses into 1-day old chickens. rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus replicated to higher titer (1.02 log) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s008">S8B Fig</xref>) than rGIII virus at 48 HPI. With the exception of the NS2B-V99L substitution, the remaining mutant rGIII viruses encoding single and multiple substitutions had 0.68 to 0.96-log higher viral titers and 0.46 to 1.01-log higher viral RNA production than rGIII virus in 1-day old chicken. However, we were unable to detect an apparent synergistic effect among three substitutions.
