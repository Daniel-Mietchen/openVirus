<p>The loss-of-function experiments were also used to evaluate substitutions for the degree of influence on the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> replication ability of rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus in 1-day old chickens. The rGIII and parental rGIII/GI NS1-3 viruses were inoculated as infection controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g007">Fig 7F</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). As expected, rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus replicated to a significantly higher viremia than rGIII virus, and yielded 10
 <sup>4.25</sup> ffu/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g007">Fig 7F</xref>) and 10
 <sup>6.93</sup> viral RNA copies/ml (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s008">S8A Fig</xref>) in the chickens at 60 HPI. In contrast, the recombinant viruses encoding a single NS2B-L99V, NS3-S78A, or NS3-D177E substitution induced a significantly lower viremia or RNAemia than the parental rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus (p&lt; 0.05). The other recombinant viruses encoding a single NS2A-I6V, NS2A-T149S, NS2A-R187K or NS3-P105A substitution showed a viremia comparable to rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus in chickens. These results further supported a conclusion that the residues NS2B-99, NS3-78, and NS3-177 were involved in the replication enhancement of GI virus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and
