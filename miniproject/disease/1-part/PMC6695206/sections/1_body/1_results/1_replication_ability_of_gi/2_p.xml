<p>To analyze viral replication in mosquitoes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we fed female 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquitoes with pig blood mixed with 8x10
 <sup>6</sup> focus forming units (ffu) of GIII or GI JEVs. We determined the infection rate by detection of viral titer in each mosquito 14 days post-infection (DPI). GIII CH1392 virus and GI TC2009-1 virus had higher infectious rates (58.33% and 66.67%) than GIII T1P1 virus and GI YL2009-4 virus (25.00% and 16.67%) whereas no genotypic differences were observed in infectivity or in viral titer among positive mosquitoes (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> results suggest that the 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquito vector may play a minor role in genotype replacement.
