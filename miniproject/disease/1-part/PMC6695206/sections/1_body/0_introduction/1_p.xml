<p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome encoding three structural proteins (capsid, precursor membrane protein, and envelope protein) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [

Since then JEV has been classified into five genotypes (GI-GV) with variant geographic distribution in Asia and Australia. Traditionally, GIII virus is the most widely distributed and dominant JEV genotype in JEV endemic/epidemic regions [
