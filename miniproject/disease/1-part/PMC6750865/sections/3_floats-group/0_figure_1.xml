  <p>Possible integrated mechanism of cell injury and its relationship with microcephaly ZIKV-induced and cell death. Cell injury is determined by a complex physiopathological response, in which apoptosis, necrosis, necroptotic cell death pathway, pyroptosis, paraptosis, and autophagy can directly impact on the development of microcephaly during ZIKV congenital infection or in the death of glial cells or neurons. Classic apoptosis, associated with the progression of extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, results in the activation of caspase 3, which is responsible for programmed cell death in cells of the neural parenchyma and thereby aggravates microcephaly. The cell stress and neuroinflammatory responses promote activation of the necroptotic cell death pathway which triggers an antiviral response in neurons regulated by actuation of ZBP1, RIPK1/RIPK3, IRF1, IRG5, and itaconate. In the neural parenchyma, with a loss of tissue architecture, intense cellular damage aggravated by neuroinflammation, and extravasation of the enzymatic content, can result in the destruction of neurons and glial cells by necrosis induced by ZIKV in microcephaly cases. Another type of cell death associated with microcephaly, which is dependent on inflammasome activation, is pyroptosis. In the inflammasome, receptors (e.g., NLRP3 and AIM2) recognize ZIKV PAMPs and release caspase 1, which, once activated, promotes IL-1Î², IL-18, and IL-33 maturation; these cytokines enhance the neuroinflammatory response and promote the development of microcephaly. In addition, caspase 1 provokes pyroptosis and cell death in the neural parenchyma during ZIKV-induced microcephaly. Regarding mitochondrial damage, a new type of cell death known as paraptosis causes massive cytoplasmic vacuolization in neuronal and glial cells mainly astrocytes. This relationship intensifies the response to PIK3, IRE1, PERK, and ATF-6, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ROS. Finally, during autophagy, two ZIKV proteins (NS4A and NS4B) modulate the PIK3/AKt1 pathway, inhibiting neurogenesis and AKt1 and mTOR responses, increasing autophagic activity, and resulting in deleterious effects in vitro in neurosphere leading human fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs) to cell death.</p>
