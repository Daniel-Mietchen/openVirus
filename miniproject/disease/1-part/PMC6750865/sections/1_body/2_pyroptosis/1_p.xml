<p>Dynamic, interacting processes are linked to the immune response, and recent study of cell death mechanisms has shown that endoplasmic reticulum stress directly contributes to the activation of signaling proteins that modulate excitotoxicity, increase intracellular calcium production, and enhance cell damage.
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In the CNS, an intense neuroinflammatory response and loss of mitochondrial homeostasis results in the development of a new cell death mechanism that is extremely harmful to neurons and glial cells, i.e., pyroptosis in microcephaly cases ZIKV-induced.

 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Interestingly, pyroptosis differs from apoptosis and necrosis since it is dependent on the activation of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex characterized by the activation of NLRP3 and AIM2, receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the ZIKV and induce the release of caspase 1 to activate pyroptosis and trigger the maturation of IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33.

 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Studies of these cytokines are necessary to understand the neuroinflammatory mechanisms involved in the development of microcephaly; IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33 belong to the IL-1 family and modulate the activities of the M1 (IL-1β and IL-18) and M2 (IL-33) macrophages/microglia as well as the Th1 (IL-1β and IL-18) and Th2 (IL-33) lymphocytes.

 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Recently in experimental in vitro was showed that ZIKV enhance proinflammatory response to promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation by stabilizing caspase‐1 to suppress cGAS‐mediated type I IFN signaling. In this context, NS1 block the proteasomal degradation of the caspase 1 recruiting USP8 to cleave K11‐linked poly‐ubiquitin chains from caspase‐1 at Lys134. The implications of this process enhance inflammasome activation and inhibit type I IFN signaling.
