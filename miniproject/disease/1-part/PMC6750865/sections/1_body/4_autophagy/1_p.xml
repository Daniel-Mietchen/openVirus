<p>In addition to paraptosis, another cell death pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-infection is autophagy.
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Autophagy regulation in the brain is associated with ZIKV tropism by several CNS cells. In vitro the infection of human fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs) with ZIKV leads to impaired neurosphere formation and elevated autophagy. Infection with ZIKV strains MR766 and IbH30656 efficiently induced LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and LC3 puncta formation of fNSCs in the presence or absence of lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Interesting that in this process two ZIKV proteins (NS4A and NS4B) inhibit AKt and consequently the PIK3 cascade and mTOR production causing the deregulation of neurogenesis aberrant activation of autophagy.
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Curiously this both proteins produced by dengue virus do not have the same effect on neurogenesis. Therefore, the identification of this mechanism suggests a strong actuation of NS4A and NS4B to modulate the immune evasion of ZIKV in the viral pathogenesis.
