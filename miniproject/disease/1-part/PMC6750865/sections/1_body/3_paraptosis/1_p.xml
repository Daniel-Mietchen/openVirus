<p>As an immune escape mechanism and adaptation, ZIKV uses the cellular machinery to transform the cell into a setting for viral replication, inducing massive cytoplasmic vacuolization in human epithelial cells, primary human fibroblasts, and human astrocytes. This process is associated with a new form of cell death that does not result in apoptotic corpuscles, known as paraptosis.
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The mechanisms underlying paraptosis in cells of the CNS involve PIK3, AKt, PERK, IRE-1, and ATF-6, as well as vesicle transport orchestrated by the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.

 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Interesting that ZIKV‚Äêinduced vacuoles are dependent on viral translocation into ER through Sec61 and on PI3K/Akt signaling. Therefore, the paraptosis makes the cell a dangerous ZIKV reservoir via the massive cytoplasmic vacuolization, functional alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum, delayed phagolysosome maturation, and the excessive production of ROS; accordingly, it can contribute to cell destruction and ZIKV dissemination.
