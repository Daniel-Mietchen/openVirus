 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In cortical neurons, the activation of Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) and RIPK1/RIPK3 can trigger the formation of intracellular cascade which modulate the expression of immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1), as well as itaconate metabolite. In this process, itaconate inhibits the formation of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and consequently suppresses the replication of viral genomes.
