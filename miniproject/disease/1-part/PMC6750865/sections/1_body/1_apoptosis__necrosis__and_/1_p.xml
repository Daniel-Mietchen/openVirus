<p>The development of microcephaly presents a great challenge owing to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms and dynamics of the process. Accordingly, further studies are needed to clarify these issues and to determine the mechanisms underlying cell injury. A loss of tissue homeostasis and thereby a cell functional imbalance can result in the induction of necrosis or apoptosis pathways.
