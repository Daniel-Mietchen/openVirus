  <p>M端tter Museum vaccination kits. 
   <bold>a</bold> Left panel, M端tter catalogue # 17090.29 representative vaccination kit containing two vaccination lancets, a small metal box to hold scabrous material and glass slides to hold lymph. Upper right panel, scabrous material from M端tter catalogue # MISC-1090, subsamples of this material were used to produce library VK01. Lower right panel, metal box from Mutter catalogue # 17831.42.16, it is internally divided into four quadrants. The lower two quadrants are filled with a thick hardened residue, and a portion of the same residue remains in the upper left quadrant. This hardened substance, which we believe may be dried lymph, was used to produce library VK08. Photos courtesy of the M端tter Museum of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia. 
   <bold>b</bold> Relative metagenomic composition of the VK01, VK02, VK05, VK08 and VK12 libraries from shotgun sequencing data and 
   <bold>c</bold> post orthopoxvirus targeted enrichment. Blue portions represent reads classified as eukaryotic in origin, with the proportion specifically identified as human highlighted. Red portions represent reads classified as viral in origin with a distinction between those assigned specifically to VACV and other OPXV. Orange portions represent reads not classified as either eukaryotic or viral. Post blast analysis, assignments were visualised in Krona [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and simplified as pie charts produced using ggplot2 [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]
