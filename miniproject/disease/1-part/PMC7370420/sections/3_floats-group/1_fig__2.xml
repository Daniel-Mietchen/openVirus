  <p>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of historical vaccine strains in relation to other OPXVs. 
   <bold>a</bold> Position of the VACV clade and Mütter Museum vaccination strains within a broader OPXV phylogeny rooted using Ectromelia (ECTV) as an outgroup. 
   <bold>b</bold> Position of the Mütter Museum vaccination strains within the phylogeny of available VACV strains, rooted using VACV Tashkent KM044310 as an outgroup. Nodes with &gt; 95% bootstrap support are indicated with asterisks. All horizontal branch lengths are scaled according to the number of nucleotide substitutions per site
