<p id="Par8">The total human constituent obtained in the shotgun sequence data enabled us to reconstruct the mitochondrial genomes for the human donors from three of our samples VK01, VK02 and VK08 (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2). The haplogroups H1b, T2b4f and U5b1 are most frequently found in west Eurasia, suggesting that the vaccine donors were likely of European ancestry and not African American even though African American children were frequently used for vaccine propagation in the southern states during the American Civil War [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we concluded that VK01 and VK02 were clearly derived from female sources (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2). While the algorithm could not assign a definitive sex for VK08, an order of magnitude more reads mapped to the X-chromosome than to the Y-chromosome suggesting a low-level male contamination in that one sample (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplementary Materials and Methods, Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2). Thus, these three samples suggest that vaccine propagation was still occurring via human to human transfer.
