<p id="Par12">Our phylogenetic analysis robustly places the historical vaccination strains within the diversity of viruses labelled ‘vaccinia’. The most closely related strains of VACV include known North American vaccine strains of the twentieth century as well as many strains currently circulating in Brazil, including Cantagalo virus—a virus circulating amongst dairy cows thought to represent a historical escape of smallpox vaccine [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), their close relationship to the Cantagalo and IOC strains from Brazil may tentatively suggest a tie to the Beaugency lymph strain of the late nineteenth century that had arrived in the New England area by the 1870s [
