<p id="Par6">We were kindly granted access to five historical kits from the Mütter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia that date to the mid-to-late nineteenth century (likely circa 1859–1873) and are associated with medical practices of the American Civil War era (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Of the five vaccination kits, four were leather roll-ups containing one or two folding lancets, small glass plates for mixing lymph (fluid collected from blisters of infected patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]), and tin boxes with sliding lids to contain scab (or crust) material (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The fifth kit only contained ‘The Automatic Vaccinator’, a tool designed for use with lymph or scabs smeared into a mixture on glass plates. Museum records, donor history, and manufacturer data regarding the kits’ contents were used to determine date ranges (Additional File
