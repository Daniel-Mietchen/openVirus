<p id="Par11">Unfortunately, there is no temporal structure across the OPXV phylogeny, including within the VACV clade, making it impossible to reliably estimate either a rate of nucleotide substitution or divergence times (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Fig. S4). This lack of temporal structure likely reflects the differences in evolutionary rates within different host species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and that many of the available genomes have gone through repeated passaging and/or cell culturing after they were originally isolated (Additional File

 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S4).
