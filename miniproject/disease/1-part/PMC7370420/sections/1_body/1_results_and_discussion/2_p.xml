<p id="Par7">The metagenomic profiles of the shotgun libraries generated from these kits were overwhelmingly eukaryotic, with most reads identified as human (~ 80%), yet contained a significant (0.3–2.0%) proportion of reads mapping to VACV with unexpectedly few bacterial DNA reads (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Post enrichment for OPXV molecules (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplementary Materials and Methods), the roles were reversed, with viral reads representing the majority of the molecules sequenced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Importantly, both the endogenous human and viral sequences recovered from these historical artefacts have the characteristic signatures of ancient DNA, that is, short fragment lengths and terminal C to T damage (Additional File
