<p id="Par10">To determine the evolutionary relationships of the five Mütter vaccine strains, we placed them within an expansive OPXV phylogeny that includes representative viruses described as CPXV, HSPV, VACV and VARV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The vaccination kit viruses sit firmly within the VACV clade, indicating that VACV was indeed circulating prior to the twentieth century. To ease concerns that the phylogenetic positioning of our consensus sequences was dictated by the reference, VK01, we repeated the mapping process with an additional three VACV reference sequences and generated new consensus sequences; the positioning of VK01, VK02, VK05, VK08 and VK12, within the larger OPXV tree remained unchanged (Additional File

 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Fig. S2). Within the VACV clade, all of the vaccination kit strains recovered from the Mütter collection cluster tightly, differing from the VK01 assembly at 20–352 polymorphic positions, suggesting that there may have been little diversity in vaccination strains circulating amongst Philadelphia physicians at this time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Notably, these strains group closely with a commercially produced vaccination strain from 1902, also manufactured in Philadelphia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Importantly, that the later vaccine strain was sequenced by another group acts to validate the genomic data obtained here. Interestingly, the strain identified as HSPV, isolated from a horse in an 1976 outbreak in Mongolia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], also clusters closely with these vaccine strains. Given the age of the sample and its phylogenetic position within the larger VACV group, it is more reasonable to re-classify the 1976 Mongolian HSPV isolate as either a VACV vaccine escape strain or a VACV virus introduced into horses from an unknown animal reservoir. Similar occurrences have been noted previously in both buffalo and rabbit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and this observation fits with the Jenner-era assertion that horsepox was not found outside of Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to the paraphyletic nature of strains described as ‘cowpox’, that the ‘horsepox’, ‘buffalopox’ and ‘rabbitpox’ viruses all fall within the VACV clade further demonstrates the imprudence of naming these viruses after the host of isolation (Additional File
