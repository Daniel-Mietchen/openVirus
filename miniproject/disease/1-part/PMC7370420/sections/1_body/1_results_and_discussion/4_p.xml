<p id="Par9">We de novo assembled a nearly complete virus genome (~ 95%) from our shotgun sequencing reads from the VK01 library that had significant read depth when mapped against the VACV Copenhagen strain reference (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). This draft genome totalled 184,677 bp in length, approximately 95% the length of most VACV genomes though they vary considerably in length due to terminal repetitive motifs. We believe that our reconstructed contig represents the central core of the VK01 strain and one, perhaps partial, of the inverted terminal repeats. Repetitive regions pose serious difficulties for genome reconstruction from aDNA libraries as read lengths are extremely short and prohibit scaffold-building sections that span these regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our other shotgun libraries did not have adequate read length and/or depth for successful de novo assembly (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1, Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S3). We generated consensus sequences for the remaining four samples by mapping both the shotgun and enriched data to our VK01 contig and calling consensus sequences for positions that had at least 10x coverage with variants present at ≥ 0.9 frequency. This methodology produced consensus sequences for VK02, VK05, VK08 and VK12 that are between 97.0 and 99.9% complete at &gt; 10x coverage relative to the VK01 assembly.
