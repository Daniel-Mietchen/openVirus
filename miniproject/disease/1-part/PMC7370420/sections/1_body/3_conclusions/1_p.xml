<p id="Par14">Within the historical context of American medical practices in the 1860s and 1870s, we note that vaccination was a uniquely human process. Vaccination material was still being produced within humans and transferred directly from donors to patients, a process that changed in the following decades in response to public health concerns over iatrogenic disease spread and the for-profit industrialisation of vaccine production through animals. The similarities between the construction of the kits and their contents, which were not available in catalogues but seemingly constructed through a bespoke manner, suggest that there was a common wisdom in how vaccination was practised in this particular era. As part of this project, we surveyed instrument catalogues available in the USA during the last half of the nineteenth century and found no advertised vaccination kits. Instrument firms, however, advertised that custom-built cases would be created to order. Indeed, the similarity in the virus strains, not only from these five Civil War Era kits, but from the 1902 Mulfordâ€™s strain [
