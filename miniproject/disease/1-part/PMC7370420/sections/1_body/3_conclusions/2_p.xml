<p id="Par15">This work highlights the value of research involving historical medical collections, by presenting a novel, non-destructive methodology to recover DNA, thereby preserving these artefacts for continued display and study. Indeed, this project was only feasible as a result of the foresight and meticulous and continued conservation of museum collections by dedicated curators and collection management. The clear identification and reconstruction of near-complete genomes of VACV from these vaccination kits, which were in use during the American Civil War era, indicates that these strains were circulating within humans and via physician networks prior to the twentieth century.</p>
