<p id="Par16">Five vaccination kits dating to the mid-to-late nineteenth century were found within the collection of the Mütter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. The kits were first sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, USA, where nine specimens from the five kits were tested with amplification assays to detect VARV [

Homogenates of the scabs from Mütter collection # MISC-1090 and # 17090.33 as well as a swab from the glass plates of Mütter collection # 17831.42.16 tested positive for the generic OPXV assay and were further placed into culture: no growth was observed. The kits were then transported to the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre and processed in dedicated clean room facilities through both destructive analysis of organic materials (crusts and lymph) and non-destructive sampling of inorganic materials (lancets, boxes and glass slides). Full details of destructive and non-destructive sampling techniques and sequencing conditions are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods (Additional File
