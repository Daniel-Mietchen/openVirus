<p id="Par18">The five Mütter viral genomes were aligned with 76 representative OPXV genomes including ectromelia virus as an outgroup (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S4) using MAFFT v7.205 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The resultant alignment (263,227 bp) was cleaned of poorly aligned regions and indels using Gblocks v0.91b [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and subsequently utilised as the input for a maximum likelihood phylogeny (134,607 bp) using PhyML [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Metadata including host of virus isolation was overlain on the ML phylogeny and visualised using Grapetree [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Fig. S3). The ML phylogeny produced from the data set including the additional 76 OPXV genomes, as well as those restricted to the VACV clade, were used as input along with either year of strain collection (if known) or year of genome sequencing in root-to-tip regressions on the ML trees to determine the extent of temporal structure in the data and hence the level of support for a molecular clock of evolutionary change (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Fig. S4). Complete details of computational methods are further described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).
