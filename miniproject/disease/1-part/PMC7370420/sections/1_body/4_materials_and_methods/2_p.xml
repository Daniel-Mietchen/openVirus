<p id="Par17">We attempted to de novo assemble genomes from the pooled shotgun reads of VK01, VK02 and VK08. From the VK01 library, we were able to assemble a 184-kbp contig representing approximately 95% the total length of a VACV (Additional File

Mapped reads from separate sequencing runs and the shotgun and enriched libraries were then filtered of PCR duplicates and restricted to a minimum length of 35 bp and a minimum mapping quality of 30. The endocaller program of schmutzi v1.0 (qual -60) was then used to generate consensus base calls [
