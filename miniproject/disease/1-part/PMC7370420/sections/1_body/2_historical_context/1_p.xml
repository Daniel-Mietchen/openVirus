<p id="Par13">During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Philadelphia functioned as the second largest hospital city in the northern states, after Washington, D.C. The birthplace of American medicine, Philadelphia fostered the creation in 1787 of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, a professional-fraternal institution to advance medical practice and research, its members having founded the first hospital and medical school in the USA. The 1860s wartime influx of wounded and sick soldiers constituted such a large and growing population of medical patients that army authorities created specialty hospitals centring on the treatment of particular disorders. The work in these hospitals effectively created medical disciplines of cardiology and neurology. Wartime Philadelphia physicians employed state-of-the-art medical technology, much of it furnished by local firms, as the city had become a leading centre for the manufacture of scientific instruments. The College created the Mütter Museum, which opened during the war in 1863 as a repository of artefacts and specimens for teaching and research. The museum began to acquire vaccination material and related tools at this time. During the war, most of the College members served either in the army or as contract physicians and, as such, administered smallpox vaccination according to standard army protocol. Vaccination was required of all military recruits in northern and southern armies. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Mütter Museum possesses vaccination tools and remnants of early vaccine during Philadelphia’s concentration of medical assets during the war and into the 1870s and 1880s.</p>
