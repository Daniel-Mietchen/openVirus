<p id="Par2">Smallpox epidemics were caused by variola virus (VARV), a human-specific member of the 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic> (OPXV) genus of the 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic>, and resulted in high mortality and morbidity with survivors frequently disabled or disfigured [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Smallpox remains the only human infectious disease eradicated, a global accomplishment achieved through widespread coordinated vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite these profound public health benefits, the origins and diversity of the viruses used in the early vaccination programs remain uncertain. The World Health Organization’s success in eradicating smallpox using vaccinia virus (VACV) (1980) was in part due to the broad protective immunity induced by infection with one OPXV against subsequent infection by another.
