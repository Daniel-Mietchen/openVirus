<p id="Par5">To better characterise the origins of smallpox vaccination, we investigated the origin, diversity and propagation of early smallpox vaccine strains by extracting and sequencing total DNA and analysing both the viriome and metagenome from these kits. The results reported herein are an attempt to begin to survey viruses that were in use for smallpox vaccination and circulating in Philadelphia in the mid-to-late nineteenth century, during or just after the conclusion of the American Civil War.</p>
