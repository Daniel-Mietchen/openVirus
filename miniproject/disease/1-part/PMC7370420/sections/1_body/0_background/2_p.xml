<p id="Par3">The lack of standardisation in vaccination practices and propagation throughout most of its history means that historical vaccine strains may be any one of several OPXVs. On the basis of Edward Jenner’s work [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], cowpox virus (CPXV) was assumed to have been involved in historical vaccination, although horsepox virus (HSPV) and ‘equination’ are also cited [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both are thought to produce comparatively self-limiting infections in humans with negligible mortality rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, ‘cowpox’ and ‘horsepox’ are likely misnomers, for neither cows nor horses are considered the natural reservoirs of these viruses, and the absence of endemic CPXV or HSPV outside of Europe suggests geographically restricted hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In 1939, it was recognised that the smallpox vaccine strains being used in the twentieth century were distinct from CPXV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and these VACV strains had become the predominant smallpox vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, both the origin of VACV and its natural host or reservoir are also unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
