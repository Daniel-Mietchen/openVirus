Ross River virus (RRV) IgM was detected in acute-phase serum samples from most patients (28/28 in 2016 and 25/31 in 2017), and RRV was recovered from 4/38 serum samples assayed (1/21 in 2016 and 3/17 in 2017). Phylogenetic analyses of RRV envelope glycoprotein E2 and nonstructural protein nsP3 nucleotide sequences segregated the RRV isolates obtained in 2016 and 2017 outbreaks into 2 distinct sublineages, suggesting that each outbreak was caused by a different strain of RRV. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the 2016 outbreak suggested that some of the infections involved human-mosquito-human transmission without any intermediate host. These outbreaks highlight the importance of personal protective measures in preventing vectorborne diseases for which no vaccine or specific prophylaxis exists.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Australian Defence Force</kwd><kwd>epidemic polyarthritis</kwd><kwd>outbreak</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic analysis</kwd><kwd>Ross River virus</kwd><kwd>Australia</kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd><kwd>military personnel</kwd><kwd>vector-borne infections</kwd><kwd>arboviruses</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Epidemic polyarthritis (EPA) caused by Ross River virus (RRV) infection is the most frequently reported arboviral disease in Australia; &#x02248;55,000 cases have been reported over the past decade (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). RRV is a positive-sense, single-strand RNA, enveloped virus in the <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus of the Togaviridae family. Other viruses in this genus include chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Barmah Forest virus (BFV), Sindbis virus, and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis viruses. The prototype strain of RRV (T48) was isolated in 1959 from <italic>Aedes vigilax</italic> mosquitoes captured near the Ross River in Townsville, Queensland, Australia (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Since then, outbreaks have been recorded in all the states of Australia (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>) and in the South Pacific and Western Pacific regions, including Fiji (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>), Samoa (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>), the Cook Islands (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>), New Caledonia (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>), and Papua New Guinea (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). In Australia, most RRV infections occur during February&#x02013;May or after periods of high rainfall or spring tides (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>).</p><p>RRV is endemic and enzootic in Australia and has a natural animal-mosquito-animal transmission cycle. Humans can become infected incidentally by virus spillover, resulting in seasonal disease outbreaks. RRV has a complex ecology; &#x0003e;40 different mosquito species have been implicated as vectors, and <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>18 different wild and domestic animals and birds could serve as amplifying hosts (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Humans can carry the virus from endemic to epizootic regions, and human-mosquito-human transmission is thought to be the most common means of transmission during large epidemics (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>).</p><p>The RRV disease state varies widely between persons. This variation is readily apparent during outbreaks of the virus, wherein most persons in an infected population have asymptomatic or subclinical infection and only a few patients are substantially affected by the virus (ratio &#x02248;3:1) (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Among patients reporting clinical symptoms, most will recover in 4&#x02013;6 weeks. However, in some cases, joint pain, muscle pain, and fatigue can persist for several months or years (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). RRV-caused EPA is characterized by arthritis, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. About 20%&#x02013;60% of patients also have rash, fever, malaise, or a combination of these signs and symptoms (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Symptoms similar to EPA occur after infection with BFV, CHIKV, Epstein-Barr virus (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>), rubella virus (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>), and parvovirus B19 (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>). BFV co-circulates with RRV; &#x02248;1,600 cases of BFV infection are reported each year in Australia (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>). Although transmission of CHIKV does not occur in Australia, clinical infections have been reported in travelers returning to Australia from endemic areas (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>).</p><p>During 2016&#x02013;2017, two outbreaks of EPA occurred in Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel during and after short military exercises in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area (SWBTA) in northeastern Australia. We conducted an investigation to confirm whether the 2 outbreaks of EPA among ADF personnel in SWBTA were attributable to RRV infection by identifying RRV RNA in patient serum samples and to determine whether the viruses were novel genotypes (and, if so, their phylogenetic origin).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was a retrospective study approved by the ADF Joint Health Command Ethics Review Committee (Joint Health Command low-risk ethics panel no. 16-021).

Because of its large size, restricted access, and protected ecology, regular mosquito surveillance or control is not conducted in the area. SWBTA is populated with large numbers of mammal and bird species, which could serve as hosts for RRV, as well as &#x0003e;40 species of mosquitoes, including major RRV vectors <italic>Aedes vigilax</italic> and <italic>Culex annulirostris</italic> mosquitoes (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>).

We conducted initial analyses assuming a strict molecular clock model because the evolutionary timeframe for this study was comparatively short. However, we also acknowledged that the environmental conditions were sufficiently diverse to warrant a relaxed clock (lognormal). We used the Bayesian skyline as the demographic model for the phylogenetic trees. We performed Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis by using BEAST version 1.8.1 with a 10 million chain length and sampling every 1,000 generations and assessed convergence of parameters on the basis of the ESS value &#x0003e;200, which was viewed by using Tracer 1.6.0. We subsequently generated maximum clade credibility trees after a 10% burn-in protocol by using TreeAnnotator version 1.8.1 and formatted the final trees in FigTree 1.3.1.

Once at the UOTF, they conducted urban assault maneuvers against a 36-member opposition force for an additional 5 days. Upon conclusion of the UOTF component of the exercise, the combat unit marched back to Camp Growl, where they spent the night before returning to Brisbane, &#x02248;630 km south of SWBTA. An administration unit of 30 persons was stationed in SWBTA during the same period but remained at Camp Growl throughout the exercise.

ADF members were not screened for RRV seroconversions over the course of the exercise, so asymptomatic RRV infections could not be detected. Because most RRV infections are asymptomatic, the number of infections during these outbreaks was probably higher than the number of cases reported.</p><p>The most common symptoms experienced in the 2016 and 2017 outbreaks were, respectively, polyarthritis and muscle pain (71% and 88%), arthralgia (67% and 88%), fatigue (71% and 88%), loss of appetite (52% and 75%), stiff neck (38% and 71%), fever (33% and 47%), rash (9.5% and 65%), headache (28% and 41%), and sore throat (14% and 24%) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>). Most personnel recovered within 4&#x02013;6 weeks of symptom onset, except for 3 from the 2016 outbreak who were unfit for deployment 3 months after illness onset because of ongoing signs and symptoms.</p><p>All study participants were aware of the ADF policy of dipping uniforms and bed nets in permethrin, but none of the participants, nor their unit commanders, requested support from the Preventive Medicine Company to undertake this procedure before or during either exercise, citing time constraints (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>). More than half of the personnel failed to comply with the sleeves-down policy because of the hot and humid weather conditions. All participants stated that they used commercial repellents, which contain relatively low concentrations of N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) compared with the repellents issued by the ADF. About 57% (2016) and 82% (2017) of personnel reported sleeping under bed nets at night but noted that nets at times were abandoned because of their incompatibility with the tactical situation. Five soldiers from the 2017 outbreak reported constantly being assailed with mosquito bites (concentrated around their hands and legs) during the night even when inside their nets. Gloves and socks were worn when sleeping to address this issue. All participants reported being bitten by mosquitoes on a regular basis.</p><p>Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of 58 RRV complete E2 sequences (1,266 nt) were performed by using TN93+&#x00393;, HKY+&#x00393;, and the GTR+&#x00393;+I substitution models with both strict and relaxed clock models. All phylogenies placed the ADF RRV isolates collected in 2016 and 2017 (MIDI13.2016, MIDI4.2017, MIDI9.2017, and MIDI32.2017) into 2 distinct sublineages of lineage III (IIIE and IIIF).

The 2016 isolate (MIDI13.2016) resembled strains of RRV recovered from patients in Brisbane (&#x02248;600 km south of SWBTA) in 2014 and 2015 and belongs to sublineage IIIE. Lineage III is thought to have evolved from 2 other lineages of RRV that are believed to be extinct. The 3 isolates recovered in 2017 (MIDI4.2017, MIDI9.2017, and MIDI32.2017) shared 99.8% nucleotide identity in pairwise comparisons and have been assigned to sublineage IIIF, which contains strains of RRV recovered from the east and west coasts of Australia in 2009 and in an isolate identified in Brisbane in 2015 (BNE 2885.2015).</p><p>We observed 6 amino acid differences between the 2016 (sublineage IIIE) and 2017 (sublineage IIIF) isolates from SWBTA (N132D, Y296H, T369A, I376M, A384T, and A389T) of which only 1 (I376M) was a conservative change. All substitutions are located in the A and C domains of the E2 protein, in areas involved in the interaction with other proteins (E1, capsid, and 6k), as well as in the process of budding of alphavirus envelope proteins from host cell membranes (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>). The 2 glycosylation sites on the E2 protein were conserved in all 4 of the SWBTA isolates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The state of Queensland, where SWBTA is situated, has the highest rates of EPA in Australia, consistently recording &#x0003e;1,000 cases each year (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). RRV-caused EPA cases are reported routinely in the areas surrounding Rockhampton (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>), the nearest city to SWBTA. In 1997, nineteen RRV-caused EPA cases were reported among US Navy personnel during a joint Australia&#x02013;US military exercise located at SWBTA (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>). In 2004, RRV RNA was detected in multiple mosquito species collected in this training area (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>). The most recent common ancestor of RRV (strain T48) originated from northeastern Australia (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>), and this finding is in agreement with our phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). </p><p>In light of these data, we reasonably believe that RRV has established its natural endemic cycle in SWBTA. The recurrent outbreaks of RRV infection within SWBTA and the intermittent presence of humans in this region suggests that the 2016 and 2017 infections were spillover events in which the virus was incidentally acquired by ADF soldiers from the natural endemic animal-mosquito-animal transmission cycle made possible by large populations of native animals (e.g., kangaroos and wallabies) and the wide variety of RRV vectors (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). However, phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences of the E2 and nsP3 genes of RRV recovered from the ADF personnel in our study and from patients and mosquitoes from other parts of Australia do not support the notion of RRV strains being sequestered in endemic pockets across Australia. Instead, SWBTA isolates bore a remarkable similarity to those circulating in the wider community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figures 1&#x02013;8). A more likely explanation is that strains of RRV are not regionally locked but spread around Australia by the movement of humans, as most likely occurred in the RRV outbreak in the Pacific during 1979&#x02013;1980 (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref><italic>&#x02013;</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). More surveillance and exhaustive genetic analysis might help to resolve the precise origin and nature of these outbreaks.</p><p>The spatiotemporal characteristics of the 2016 outbreak suggested that the virus was transmitted among soldiers by local mosquitoes after the initial infection. The first wave of soldiers who sought care at the RAP at Gallipoli Barracks, Brisbane, did so within a 2-week period of leaving the SWBTA, which is consistent with the 2&#x02013;15-day incubation period proposed for RRV infection in humans (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel C). Although this first wave of soldiers might have been infected with RRV by spillover from the suspected natural, endemic animal&#x02013;mosquito&#x02013;animal transmission cycle in SWBTA, few (if any) intermediate host-macropods exist in Gallipoli Barracks from which soldiers would become infected upon their return. Soldiers who sought care for EPA signs and symptoms 19&#x02013;37 days after returning to the barracks are indicative of a potential secondary human-mosquito-human infection cycle in Gallipoli Barracks, possibly involving asymptomatic but viremic persons. This conclusion is further supported by the high level of homology shared by 3 RRV isolates from 2017. </p><p>No EPA cases were reported (except 1 case from the administration unit attached to the combat team at SWBTA) from other units at Gallipoli Barracks (a base containing &#x0003e;5,600 personnel who operate across 30 different units) upon the return of the infected personnel. This finding might simply reflect the probability of an extremely small number of infected mosquitoes finding a susceptible and unprotected human host among other units headquartered at discrete localities spread over an area of &#x0003e;200 hectares. However, without concurrent isolation of the virus from local mosquitoes in the vicinity of Gallipoli Barracks, this 2-wave theory, however plausible, remains speculative. Delayed or failed reporting of health concerns or symptoms of infected personnel can be a confounding issue when surveying soldiers attached to combat units. This difficulty is caused in part by a cultural resistance to seek medical attention for ailments of low to moderate severity; soldiers often opt to press on in the face of adversity.</p><p>A previous study based on phylogenies derived from short E2 gene sequences identified 2 lineages of RRV (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), whereas a more recent study (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>) using longer sequences identified 3 (1 from eastern Australia, 1 from western Australia, and 1 from northeastern Australia). The phylogenetic analyses in our study, which used the complete nucleotide sequences of RRV E2 and nsP3 genes, confirm the presence of 3 lineages but suggest that lineage III should be divided into 6 sublineages. Lineage I viruses were classified as the northeastern Australia lineage; examples of this lineage have not been isolated since 1977. Lineage II was classified as the western Australia lineage; examples of this lineage have not been isolated since 1991 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 1, Figures 1&#x02013;8). The virus strain of RRV that was responsible for the outbreaks in Fiji, the Cook Islands, and Samoa during 1979&#x02013;1980 has been classified as sublineage IIIA. The results of our study suggest that the lineage III viruses have been responsible for outbreaks of RRV infection in Australia since 1991. The temporal structure of the maximum clade credibility trees suggest that RRV is continuing to diversify under the pressure of natural selection and potential for further diversification exists given changes in the virus&#x02019; ecologic niche, cycles of transmission, or both. The importance of the 5 nonconservative changes in the amino acid sequences of the E2 proteins that occurred from 2016 to 2017 warrants further investigation to determine what role they might play in viral fitness. The implementation of continuous and routine viral sequencing, analysis, and monitoring will increase confidence in the proposed delineation of the sublineages within lineage III and further clarify the evolutionary process.</p><p>With the ADF&#x02019;s commitment to maintaining the natural environment in its training areas, an ongoing risk for infection with RRV persists for personnel who do not have natural immunity through prior exposure to RRV and who are required to spend prolonged periods in this RRV-endemic area. A further risk is the potential for RRV to be exported to other countries through infected, asymptomatic personnel participating in multinational exercises, which occur on a regular basis in SWBTA. This risk is of particular concern for countries with mosquitoes known to be RRV vectors (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>). The largest outbreak of RRV infection ever recorded occurred in the Pacific during 1979&#x02013;1980 (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>) and is a testament to the epidemic potential of the virus. The recent experience with Zika and chikungunya viruses underscores the serious threat posed to global health by the potential for previously obscure arboviruses to move from their historical cycles of transmission (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this investigation confirmed through viral isolation and sequence analysis that the outbreaks of EPA in the ADF in 2016 and 2017 were caused by 2 distinct sublineages of lineage III strains of RRV. Further, these outbreaks are most likely attributable to human-mosquito-human transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title/><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Appendix</title><p>Additional information regarding localized outbreaks of epidemic polyarthritis among military personnel caused by different sublineages of Ross River virus, Northeast Australia, 2016&#x02013;2017. </p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="18-1610-Techapp-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e805" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="citation"><p><italic>Suggested citation for this article</italic>: Liu W, Kizu JR, Le Grand LR, Moller CG, Carthew TL, Mitchell IR, et al.
