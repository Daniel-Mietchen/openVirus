<p>With the ADF’s commitment to maintaining the natural environment in its training areas, an ongoing risk for infection with RRV persists for personnel who do not have natural immunity through prior exposure to RRV and who are required to spend prolonged periods in this RRV-endemic area. A further risk is the potential for RRV to be exported to other countries through infected, asymptomatic personnel participating in multinational exercises, which occur on a regular basis in SWBTA. This risk is of particular concern for countries with mosquitoes known to be RRV vectors (
