<p>The spatiotemporal characteristics of the 2016 outbreak suggested that the virus was transmitted among soldiers by local mosquitoes after the initial infection. The first wave of soldiers who sought care at the RAP at Gallipoli Barracks, Brisbane, did so within a 2-week period of leaving the SWBTA, which is consistent with the 2–15-day incubation period proposed for RRV infection in humans (

Although this first wave of soldiers might have been infected with RRV by spillover from the suspected natural, endemic animal–mosquito–animal transmission cycle in SWBTA, few (if any) intermediate host-macropods exist in Gallipoli Barracks from which soldiers would become infected upon their return. Soldiers who sought care for EPA signs and symptoms 19–37 days after returning to the barracks are indicative of a potential secondary human-mosquito-human infection cycle in Gallipoli Barracks, possibly involving asymptomatic but viremic persons. This conclusion is further supported by the high level of homology shared by 3 RRV isolates from 2017.
