<p>All study participants were aware of the ADF policy of dipping uniforms and bed nets in permethrin, but none of the participants, nor their unit commanders, requested support from the Preventive Medicine Company to undertake this procedure before or during either exercise, citing time constraints (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>). More than half of the personnel failed to comply with the sleeves-down policy because of the hot and humid weather conditions. All participants stated that they used commercial repellents, which contain relatively low concentrations of N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) compared with the repellents issued by the ADF. About 57% (2016) and 82% (2017) of personnel reported sleeping under bed nets at night but noted that nets at times were abandoned because of their incompatibility with the tactical situation. Five soldiers from the 2017 outbreak reported constantly being assailed with mosquito bites (concentrated around their hands and legs) during the night even when inside their nets. Gloves and socks were worn when sleeping to address this issue. All participants reported being bitten by mosquitoes on a regular basis.
