<p>Troops from the affected unit (referred to hereafter as the combat unit) had spent 3 days in heavy rain near Camp Growl in the training area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel B). During the following 3 days, the unit moved over varied terrain, including dense bushland, in hot and humid conditions to an urban operation training facility (UOTF). Once at the UOTF, they conducted urban assault maneuvers against a 36-member opposition force for an additional 5 days. Upon conclusion of the UOTF component of the exercise, the combat unit marched back to Camp Growl, where they spent the night before returning to Brisbane, ≈630 km south of SWBTA. An administration unit of 30 persons was stationed in SWBTA during the same period but remained at Camp Growl throughout the exercise. In addition to the 44 members of the combat unit affected by EPA, 1 member from the administration unit reported symptoms of EPA, and RRV IgM was detected in this patient’s serum sample upon return to Brisbane (attack rate 3.3%) (
