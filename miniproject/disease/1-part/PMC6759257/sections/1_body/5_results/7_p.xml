<p>Although the confidence level for the separation of the 2 sublineages differs depending on the model used (posterior probabilities range from 0.63 for HKY+Γ relaxed clock to 0.89 for GTR+Γ+I relaxed clock), the bifurcation of the 2 sublineages occurs in all of the trees produced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figures 1–5). Furthermore, an analysis of 32 nsP3 sequences (1,650 nt) similarly demonstrates the bifurcation of the 2 proposed sublineages but with high posterior probability (≈1) for each of the HKY and GTR+Γ+I substitutional models with both strict and relaxed clocks. The tree for nsP3 based on the HKY substitution model with a strict clock (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) is also presented with alternative substitution models and clocks (
