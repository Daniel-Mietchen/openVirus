<p>In 2017, a total of 43 members from 3 different units had symptoms of EPA during an exercise conducted from late April to mid-May in the same area as the combat unit affected in the 2016 outbreak. Thirty-one of the 43 patients provided a serum sample. Of these, 25 samples contained RRV IgM (

Neither the advancing routes of these 3 units through SWBTA nor the epidemiologic timeline of the 2017 EPA outbreak could be obtained because of ADF operational restrictions. Additional EPA cases might have occurred during both outbreaks, given that anecdotal evidence suggests that members who were unwell at that time chose not to seek care at the RAP. ADF members were not screened for RRV seroconversions over the course of the exercise, so asymptomatic RRV infections could not be detected. Because most RRV infections are asymptomatic, the number of infections during these outbreaks was probably higher than the number of cases reported.
