<p>We observed 6 amino acid differences between the 2016 (sublineage IIIE) and 2017 (sublineage IIIF) isolates from SWBTA (N132D, Y296H, T369A, I376M, A384T, and A389T) of which only 1 (I376M) was a conservative change. All substitutions are located in the A and C domains of the E2 protein, in areas involved in the interaction with other proteins (E1, capsid, and 6k), as well as in the process of budding of alphavirus envelope proteins from host cell membranes (
