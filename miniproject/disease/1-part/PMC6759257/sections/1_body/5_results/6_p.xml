<p>Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of 58 RRV complete E2 sequences (1,266 nt) were performed by using TN93+Γ, HKY+Γ, and the GTR+Γ+I substitution models with both strict and relaxed clock models. All phylogenies placed the ADF RRV isolates collected in 2016 and 2017 (MIDI13.2016, MIDI4.2017, MIDI9.2017, and MIDI32.2017) into 2 distinct sublineages of lineage III (IIIE and IIIF). The TN93+Γ substitution model was the most highly ranked of those used, having the lowest Bayesian information criterion score (
