<p>We aligned nucleotide sequences of 58 RRV E2 genes and 32 nsP3 genes (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 1) by using the ClustalW program in Geneious. E2 and nsP3 sequences for 24 of these viruses were derived in this study. We converted the alignment file to NEXUS format by using MEGAX for use with BEAST (

We determined the nucleotide-substitution model by using the model test capability in MEGAX and confirmed the findings by using jModelTest 2.1.3 (
