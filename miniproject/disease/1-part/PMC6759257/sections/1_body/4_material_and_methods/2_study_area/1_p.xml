<p>SWBTA is a 4,545-km
 <sup>2</sup> expanse of naturally vegetated coastal region ≈80 km north of the city of Rockhampton, Queensland, in northeastern Australia. ADF and allied forces use it regularly for military training. Because of its large size, restricted access, and protected ecology, regular mosquito surveillance or control is not conducted in the area. SWBTA is populated with large numbers of mammal and bird species, which could serve as hosts for RRV, as well as &gt;40 species of mosquitoes, including major RRV vectors
