<p>RRV is endemic and enzootic in Australia and has a natural animal-mosquito-animal transmission cycle. Humans can become infected incidentally by virus spillover, resulting in seasonal disease outbreaks. RRV has a complex ecology; &gt;40 different mosquito species have been implicated as vectors, and
