  <p>Maximum clade credibility tree based on analysis of 58 complete Ross River virus E2 sequences (1,266 nt) from outbreaks among Australian Defence Force personnel during and after training in Shoalwater Bay Training Area, northeastern Australia, 2016â€“2017. Isolates were classified into 2 distinct sublineages in lineage III. We used Bayesian phylogenetic analysis method in BEAST software (http://beast.community) to analyze the aligned E2 sequences, applying the TN93 plus gamma substitution model with a strict clock model, a chain length of 10 million, and a 10% burn-in using TreeAnnotator (

   <underline>&gt;</underline>0.8 except the value for the bifurcation of the sublineages IIIE and IIIF. The naming convention of the strains was name of host/strain/year of isolation/GenBank accession number. B, birds; H, humans; M, mosquitoes; W, wallabies.
