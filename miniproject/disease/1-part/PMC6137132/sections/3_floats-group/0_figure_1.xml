  <p>Gray shading represents host genomes of two different species. Colored lines represent the viral genomes. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Genomes of two different viral strains, e.g., influenza, that are perfectly adapted to their hosts' cells. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Host genomes have evolved through mutations and natural selection. Viral adaptation has been reduced. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The two viral strains have been genetically re-assorted since they have met in the same individual(s). The new recombined strain can potentially infect both species. Mortality can be high since the new viral strain needs time to adapt effectively to its hosts' cells. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Viral strains evolved again through random mutations and natural selection. Viral adaptation has been increased again.
