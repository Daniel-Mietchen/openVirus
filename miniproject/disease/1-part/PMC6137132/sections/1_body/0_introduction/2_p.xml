<p>Viral infections are not a static phenomenon. Many viral genomes can adapt on their hosts' cellular environment while survivors of viral infections have probably special genetic characteristics that helped them remain alive. Therefore, both genomes change over time reminding us of the evolutionary race between predators and preys. Viral genomes however are smaller and more flexible, allowing viruses to rapidly adapt though random mutagenesis or due to transmission in other species. Pandemics of influenza are due to these random and sudden viral mutations or trans-species transmissions. Under this perspective, in this paper, we discuss about influenza viruses and the coevolution with the human genomes.</p>
