<p>Cells of the innate immune response are the first and fast responders upon influenza virus infection, recruited by chemokines released by airway epithelial cells. Upon viral entry, intracellular viral ssRNA and other viral molecular patterns are recognized mainly by Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3,7,8,9 and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein (RIG-1) receptors. The downstream signaling triggered by the activation of these receptors results in the activation of transcription factors like nuclear factor kappa-B and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and 7, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons (
