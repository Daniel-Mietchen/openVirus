<p>Influenza viruses exhibit vast genetic variability sourced from three molecular mechanisms: mutation, genetic re-assortment, and genetic recombination. While the first two mechanisms have been extensively studied, the significance of the third one needs clarification (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The results of these genetic procedures are antigenic shift or antigenic drift. Antigenic shift is a rapid change of the virus genome and antigenicity, coming from a combination of different viral strains. The eight RNA fragments of the influenza virus can re-assort between different strains, producing new subtypes. This happens usually inside livestock animals, in geographic regions where people live in proximity with animals (

Antigenic drifts cause more gradual changes to the viral HA and N proteins, this being the cause of the appearance of new influenza strains each year (
