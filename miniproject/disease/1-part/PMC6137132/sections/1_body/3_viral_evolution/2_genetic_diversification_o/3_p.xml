<p>Influenza A probably evolves under a negative pressure for CpG oligonucleotides. This is considered to happen due to innate immune recognition, something that is not so vital for influenza B evolution (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that antigenic drifts are more frequent to influenza A viruses than influenza B viruses (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Even though antigenic drifts are usually gradual changes regarding the viral properties, the possibility for a rapid evolutionary change due to a mutation (punctuated evolution) cannot be excluded.
