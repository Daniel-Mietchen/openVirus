<p>Another category of important proteins in human cells, defending against viral infections, are the IFITM (interferon-induced transmembrane) proteins. At least three human IFITM proteins exist (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). When upregulated (by both type I and type II interferons), they can restrict viruses outside cells, prohibiting viral penetration through the membrane lipid layers. IFITM3 seems to be more specific for influenza viruses (
