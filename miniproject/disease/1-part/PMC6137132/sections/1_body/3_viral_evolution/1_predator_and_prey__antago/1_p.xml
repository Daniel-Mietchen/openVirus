<p>Predator-prey species relationship is of great interest in evolutionary biology since the balance of attack and defense mechanisms is very important for the long-term survival of both species. A simplified example that is often given is that of lions and their prey. The faster the lions are, the most successful they can be in acquiring food, surviving, and reproducing. The faster the zebras (lions' prey) are, the better they can escape the lions, so they survive and reproduce. It is all about Darwinian fitness, since survival and robustness are related with a higher probability of having more offspring (descendants). That is translated to reproducibility and to a better chance to evolve. Darwinian fitness cannot increase simultaneously for both predator and prey species. It increases for one species and reduces for the other. But that is not stable. Afterwards the opposite happens. This is the phenomenon of antagonistic evolution that is believed to push evolution forward and sometimes can increase phenotypic diversification (
