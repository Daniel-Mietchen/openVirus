<p>Antagonistic evolution also happens between host and various pathogens including viruses. Successful viruses are the ones that can cheat cells, go inside the cytoplasm, take advantage of the cell translation system (ribosomes), reproduce, and then exit the cell by exocytosis going to infect other cells. Viruses can be considered as the predators and cells as the preys, even though viruses do not necessarily kill the cells. This is probably a major difference with the classical predator-prey relationship. Evolutionary successful viruses are transmitted from one host to another (cell or a whole organism), making minimal damage. On the other site, cellular defense mechanisms, like the MHC proteins, have the potential for evolving in a quite short evolutionary time, this being a highly effective immunological shield.</p>
