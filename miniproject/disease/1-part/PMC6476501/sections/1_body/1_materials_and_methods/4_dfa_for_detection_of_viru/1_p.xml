<p>A D3 Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening &amp; ID Kit (DIAGNOSTIC HYBRIDS, USA) was used at Beijing Childrenâ€™s Hospital for influenza antigen detection. This kit uses viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly labeled with fluorescein for the rapid detection and identification of seven respiratory viruses, including Flu A, Flu B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, and parainfluenza 3. Tests were performed manually, the sputum or alveolar lavage were collected, after addition of PBS and vortex, centrifuge to wash up mucus and set aside the supernatant for viral isolation. The prepared cell suspension were dripped onto a 10-well slide and air dried. Fix the cells to the slides using fresh, chilled acetone and incubated with DFA screening reagent. Rinse the stained cells using de-mineralized water, and then using a fluorescence microscope with magnifications between 200 to 400 times by experienced technicians.</p>
