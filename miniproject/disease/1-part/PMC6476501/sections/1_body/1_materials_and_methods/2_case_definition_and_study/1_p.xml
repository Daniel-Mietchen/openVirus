 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In total, 36,792 unrepeated patients with ILI who sought medical services at Beijing Childrenâ€™s Hospital and Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital from December 2016 to February 2018 were enrolled in this study. Patients ranged in age from 0 to 98 years old and were divided into eight age groups: 1,031 (2.80%) cases aged between 13 h and 30 days, 5,486 (14.91%) cases aged between 1 and 12 months, 11,950 (32.48%) cases aged 1 to 3 years, 5,608 (15.24%) cases aged 4 to 5 years, 10,590 (28.78%) cases aged 6 to 17 years, 402 (1.09%) cases aged 18 to 35 years, 529 (1.44%) cases aged 36 to 60 years, and 1,196 (3.25%) cases aged over 60 years. In the 36,792 cases, 519 children from the 2016 flu season (December 2016 to February 2017) and 404 children from the 2017 flu season (December 2017 to February 2018) were concomitantly assayed with direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) for antigen to Flu A and Flu B and defined as paired groups. Other 2,340 adults and 1,978 children with Flu A and Flu B antigen tested by an IRDT method during 2016 and 2017 winter flu seasons were included as unpaired groups, with purpose to use the antigen as indicators for virus epidemics (
