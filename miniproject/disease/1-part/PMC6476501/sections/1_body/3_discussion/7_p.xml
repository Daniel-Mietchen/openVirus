<p>Analysis of monthly distribution of IgM Abs indicated that both IgM Abs increased from autumn to winter and decreased from spring to summer. The trends of IgM Abs to Flu B were consistent between children and adults [

However, two waves of discordance for Flu A between children and adults were observed, one in December 2016 (increased in adults but smooth in children) and another in November of 2017 (increased in children but stable in adults). This could be explained by the erratic epidemic of Flu A especially with the subtype changing and diverse susceptibilities of adults and children to viruses. Studies had indicated that various subtypes of Flu A tend to infect people of different age. For example, p(H1N1) preferentially infects children under 14 years of age, whereas sH3N2 preferentially infects patients between 30 and 39 years of age, and sH1N1 infects patients more than 70 years of age [
