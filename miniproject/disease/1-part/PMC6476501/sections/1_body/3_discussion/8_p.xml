<p>There was an epidemic of the B/Yamagata strain in winter of 2017 in Beijing [

 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the epidemic was also confirmed by our group using RT-PCR and by data from China CDC [

 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. By analyzing unpaired and paired data of antigen to IgM Abs, we found that antigen to Flu B was significantly increased in 2017 winter compared with that in 2016, while there was no simultaneous increase in IgM Abs to Flu B. Since sensitivity of antigen detection by IRDT is lower than by RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the actual Flu B infection should be severer than that indicated by antigen-positivity rate. Thus, some IgM Abs to Flu B in the 2017 winter flu season should have been present, but not detected by the single assay. Additionally, vaccinations [

 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and immune memories in patients with sub-clinical infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] may also be contributed to higher IgM Abs detection. As a result, it is still unclear whether the positivity rate of IgM Abs to Flu B detected at a high frequency from 4â€“5 years old is a symbol of true infection or a reminiscent response. As China CDC administered a trivalent vaccine that does not include the B/Yamagata strain in 2017, we suspect that the IgM Abs to Flu B in 2017 winter might be true reflection of the Flu B virus infection.
