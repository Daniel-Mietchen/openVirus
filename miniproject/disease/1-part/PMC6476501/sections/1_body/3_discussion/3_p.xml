<p>However, the assay is widely taken advantage for single detection use in the clinical setting. The improper use may lead to clinical misdiagnosis and mistreatment. A study once indicated that IgM Abs to Flu A, as determined by the IIFA method, could be used for diagnosis in 64% of single sera with complement-fixation Abs titred between 32 to 256 [

Another study indicated that using ELISA to detect IgM, IgG, and IgA Abs responses to influenza p(H1N1) hemagglutinin in infected persons during the 2009 pandemic exhibited lower sensitivity compared with hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. Cross-reactive Abs against homologous and heterologous subtypes did exist in serologic Abs studies [
