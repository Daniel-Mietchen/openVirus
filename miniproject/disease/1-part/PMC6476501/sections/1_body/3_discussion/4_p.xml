<p>In this study, we reviewed and summarized the results of single serum IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B viruses in 36,792 ILI cases, and compared IgM Abs with unpaired and paired antigens tests over the same period, with purpose to offer insights on rational screening methods selection facing the epidemic of Flu A and Flu B viruses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the correlation of IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B with influenza antigen detection. Beijing Childrenâ€™s Hospital and Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital are two tertiary hospitals in Beijing; one is located at the south end of the city, and the other is located at the north end of the city. As a result, patients are representative of the epidemiology of the whole city. All IgM Abs had been screened using the IIFA product by EUROIMMUN at two hospitals.</p>
