<p>In conclusion, we retrospectively reviewed the presence of IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B in ILI cases from December 2016 to February 2018. The results indicated that IgM Abs were distributed across different age groups, with Flu A peaking in the 18–35-year-old group and Flu B peaking in the 4–5-year-old group. Seasonal distribution was also observed. Of clinical significance, single assayed IgM Abs were less effective for the diagnosis of acute influenza virus infection owing to lack of detection of IgM Abs to Flu A in two winter flu seasons in children and IgM Abs to Flu B in the 2017 winter flu epidemic in both children and adults. These results do not support the use of single IgM Abs assay for diagnosis and epidemiological evaluations. Thus, further studies are needed to develop new broad spectrum of influenza diagnostic assays based on serum.</p>
