<p>Indeed, during the 2017â€“2018 winter season, China experienced a national wide influenza epidemic. Reported influenza cases throughout the entire nation in winter of 2017 (December 2017 to February 2018) increased 5.7 times as compared with that in winter of 2016 (December 2016 to February 2017).

The epidemics have highlighted the need for simpler and rapider assays to facilitate the diagnosis of influenza infections and differentiate the subtypes/lineages of the viruses. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests, influenza rapid diagnostic test (IRDT), and serological detection of specific antibodies (IgM Abs and IgG Abs) targeting the viruses were recommended to assist with influenza diagnosis from ILI cases in the clinical setting [
