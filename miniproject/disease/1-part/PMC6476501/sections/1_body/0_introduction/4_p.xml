<p>Developed since early 1980s, most publications about serum IgM Abs assay were based on complement-fixation tests [

 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B in two tertiary hospitals in Beijing during the period from December 2016 to February 2018, covering 15 months and two winter flu seasons. Frequencies of IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B were compared with the findings of contemporary antigen tests, providing insights into the use of IgM Abs for influenza diagnosis.
