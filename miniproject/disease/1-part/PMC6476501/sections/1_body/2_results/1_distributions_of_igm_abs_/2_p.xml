<p>The detection rates of IgM Abs to Flu A were higher in adults than in children (p &lt; 0.01), with the highest detection rate (12.69%) in the 18–35-year-old group (

The IgM Abs to Flu A declined to 8.61% in the over-60-year-old group, significance could be seen when compared to adult groups of 18–35 (P = 0.02) and 36–60 (p = 0.01) years old. Flu B IgM Abs were much more prevalent than Flu A IgM Abs in both children and adults, but its frequencies in children were much higher than in adults (p &lt; 0.01), with the detection rate peaked in 4–5 year group, and then decreased gradually in other aged groups (p &lt; 0.01) (
