<p>The importance of gestation length and small litters in the BRT model suggest that slow pace of life, more typical of large mammals, may influence susceptibility. Pregnancy in bats, typically small-bodied but with slow life histories, has been linked to both high seroprevalence and seasonal spillover of Hendra, Nipah and Ebola viruses [
