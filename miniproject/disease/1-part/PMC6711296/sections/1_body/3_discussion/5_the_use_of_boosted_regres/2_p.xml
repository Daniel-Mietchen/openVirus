<p>Statistical inference in comparative studies is generally complicated by phylogenetic non-independence among species [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In regression analyses of comparative data, such as phylogenetic generalized least squares, the current best practice is to estimate the degree of phylogenetic non-independence jointly with the regression coefficients, allowing for us to optimize the error structure of the residuals [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, current BRT approaches cannot do simultaneous estimation of phylogenetic non-independence. While we show that BRTs can have high predictive accuracy for comparative data, the lack of phylogenetic comparative methods for BRTs means that we should be cautious when making strong statistical statements regarding relationships among traits. However, the results of BRTs for comparative data are still beneficial to report, and the phylogenetic signal in predicted host status indicates that influential traits revealed by the BRT suggest there are lineages with high potential for being Ebolavirus hosts. Our results thus warrant the development of phylogenetic comparative methods for GBMs to allow more robust inferences of these important traits (
