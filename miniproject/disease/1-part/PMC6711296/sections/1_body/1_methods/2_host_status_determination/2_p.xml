<p>We compiled a list of species representing either wild, captive, or domestic animals in Africa (
 <italic>n</italic> = 119) that have been tested for exposure to Ebolaviruses. We assigned a binary code to each of these mammal species according to their status as a host species known to be permissive to infection by any Ebolavirus as determined by antibody, RNA or viral assayâ€”a subset of 23 species. In this way, host status was determined after an extensive literature search using key terms: 
 <italic>Ebola</italic>, Host OR Reservoir OR Animal in Web of Science and EBSCO HOST through 2019. Results from the two literature repositories were combined and abstracts were read to determine whether animals were surveyed for Ebolaviruses, and if so, which Ebolavirus. If data were available in the abstract, we recorded location, species and Ebolavirus (or Ebolavirus strain) directly. If the abstract did not provide sufficient information, the full manuscript was examined for relevant details. We also compiled information from appendices on the methods by which hosts were tested for evidence of pathogen exposure and sample sizes. We restricted the final dataset to include only species on which laboratory assays were performed, excluding unverified evidence of Ebolavirus infection from animal mortality reportedly associated with human Ebola outbreaks or wildlife disease events, and to taxa identified to species.
