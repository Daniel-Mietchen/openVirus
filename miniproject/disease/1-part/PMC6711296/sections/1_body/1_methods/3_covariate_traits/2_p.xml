<p>We used trait data from PanTHERIA [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and from EltonTraits 1.0 [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as covariates of host status. For all extant or recently extinct species with the class Mammalia, Jones 
 <italic>et al</italic>. gathered 25 types of ecological and life-history information from the literature to create the 30 specific variables and 19 derived variables that make up the PanTHERIA dataset. After dropping traits with greater than 90% correlation with body mass (e.g. adult head body length and neonate body mass) and those covering fewer than 20 species, we included 29 variables related to life history, diet, activity and home range, which vary in their completeness across mammal species (
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337TB1" ref-type="table">tableÂ 1</xref>). EltonTraits provides literature-derived data on diet type/diversity, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size for extant bird and mammal species. Because EltonTraits interpolates data where literature values are unavailable, we restricted our use of EltonTraits to data on diet composition, which was unavailable from PanTHERIA. Continuous variables for life-history traits that spanned several orders of magnitude were log
 <sub>10</sub>-transformed.
