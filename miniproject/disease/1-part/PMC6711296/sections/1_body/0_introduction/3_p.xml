<p>Bats have long been viewed as reservoirs of Ebolavirus and other filoviruses [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite long-term asymptomatic infection of bats by Ebolavirus, and viral replication induced through experimental inoculation [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], live virus has not been found in any wild bat species to date [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition to bats, hosts from multiple other taxa may play a part in the maintenance and circulation of Ebolavirus [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ebolavirus persistence and spillover may be influenced by variation in host community composition, depending on whether they contain species that serve as endemic hosts, resistant hosts or hosts supporting stuttering chains of transmission [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Bats may also be critical in transmitting the virus between hosts and over distances [
