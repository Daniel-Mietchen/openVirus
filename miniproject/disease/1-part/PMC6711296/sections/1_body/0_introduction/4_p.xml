<p>Human Ebolavirus transmission often arises from contact with infected wild mammals, which may thus serve to transmit infection [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hosts may include species that are tolerant of long-term infections as well as those exhibiting high mortality rates from Ebolavirus infection. Given that previous human epidemics have been attributed to handling infected carcasses [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], identifying shared traits and spatio-temporal patterns among sylvatic hosts may offer insights about the ecological mechanisms that drive spillover infection in humans. Research on possible phylogenetic patterns in Ebolavirus competency, and the degree to which hosts comprise a group of species whose feeding niche or other habitat requirements tend to bring them into contact with Ebolavirus reservoirs, has significant potential to advance our understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of the virus in the sylvatic setting.
