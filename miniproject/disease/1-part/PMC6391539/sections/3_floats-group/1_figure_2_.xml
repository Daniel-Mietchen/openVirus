  <p>Depiction of swine reassortants. Seasonal influenza from human hosts (left) can be transmitted into susceptible swine. Concurrent infection by avian strains (H5Nx) with seasonal influenza strains can lead to reassortants, novel influenza viruses that contain genetic segments from both humans and avian viruses. These novel viruses can then be transmitted into susceptible human populations, possibily leading to a pandemic outbreak.</p>
