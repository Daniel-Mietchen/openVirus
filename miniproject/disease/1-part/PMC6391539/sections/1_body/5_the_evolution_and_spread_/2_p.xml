<p>This rapid expansion of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996-like viruses was driven by reassortment with other AIVs.

 </sup> Following the goose/Guangdong virus emergence, H5N1 viruses continued to circulate in China with a seasonal pattern peaking from October to March when the temperature is below 20°C.

 </sup> In 2003, the H5N1 outbreaks in humans revealed that the goose/Guangdong-like viruses had diverged into eight genotypes. Several of these genotypes survived, while others went extinct.

 </sup> Specific adaptations to the viral genome led to an increased fitness of select strains that continued to circulate in southern China.

 </sup> A series of genetic reassortment events led to the initial human outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997, which can be directly traced back to a viral genotype in chickens and ducks named ‘Z’. Strains of the genotype Z replaced the genotypes A-E, X, and Y in 1997 and then became dominant in aquatic fowl and terrestrial poultry. The overall prevalence of H5 viruses has increased since 2010. The most prevalent AIVs are viruses in the H5N6 and H5N8 subtype circulating in domestic waterfowl in China.
