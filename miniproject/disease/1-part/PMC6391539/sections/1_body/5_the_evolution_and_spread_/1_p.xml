<p>The A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 virus was initially detected in wild birds in Southeast Asia, but shortly thereafter was detected in several areas in Asia, Europe, Africa, and recently North America.

 </sup> Sequence analysis of the H5N1 viral gene segments isolated from poultry in Hong Kong distinguished two groups of viruses circulating in domestic poultry.

 </sup> During infection, the HA segment did not undergo mutation to adapt to the human hosts. However, the PA, PB2, NP, and M2 gene products had multiple amino-acid changes after replicating in human hosts.

 </sup> Those mutated amino acids were similar to those in viruses that commonly infect the human population.

 </sup> There are nine different types of H5 viruses in wild-bird populations (H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, H5N7, H5N8, and H5N9). These H5 subtypes can present considerable risk to the human population.
