<p>Currently, organizations such as the WHO have taken global surveillance efforts in order to monitor the occurance of influenza H5 infections in humans. The widespread epidemic of H5Nx strains in poultry poses a considerable threat to human public health. The specific objectives of the WHO include (a) monitoring the global occurrence of influenza H5 viral infection in humans; (b) identifying and characterizing emergen inflluenza strains, (c) monitoring changes in transmission patterns of influenza H5 viruses and detecting potential human-to-human transmission of influenza H5 viruses; (d) monitoring unusual morbidity and mortality due to acute respiratory illness; (e) contributing to the monitoring of outbreaks of HPAIV in animal populations.

 </sup> Surveillance efforts of H5 viruses will increase researchers knowledge on the nature of H5Nx reassortant events and can help government organizations predict new reference strains for pandemic vaccine development.
