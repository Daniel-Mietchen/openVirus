<p>Since 2008, HPAIV subtypes H5N5, H5N2, and H5N8 viruses have caused outbreaks in poultry across Asia, Europe, and North American.

 </sup> By 2014, outbreaks of novel reassortant viruses such as H5N6 and H5N8 were reported in Asia.

 </sup> Viral reassortants of H5N1 and H5N2 variants have also been isolated from chickens and waterfowl and have caused outbreaks in chickens in Hebei Province in China during December 2013.

 </sup> The H5N2 viruses expressing the HA gene from clade 2.3.2, 2.3.4 or 7.2 have been isolated with internal genes from both clade 7.2 H5N1 viruses and H9N2 viruses. H5N2 viruses contain gene segments from multiple viral clades including HA, PA, M1, PB2, NS1 from 2.3.4.4, and three American wild birds lineage genes NA, NP, and PB1.

 </sup> These H5N2 viruses were the source of an outbreak in Hubei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces in China. Low pathogenic H5N2 influenza viruses naturally infect wild birds.

 </sup> However, these LPAI H5N2 viruses can transform into an HPAIV isolate by either adding basic amino acids to its cleavage site or by loss of a N-glycosylation at amino acid site 11.

 </sup> These viruses rapidly adapted to replicate in terrestrial poultry by adding an additional glycosylation site on the HA molecule, as well as deleting 19 amino acids in the NA stalk region.
