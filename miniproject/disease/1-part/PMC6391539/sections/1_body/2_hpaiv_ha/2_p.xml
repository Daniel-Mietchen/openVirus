<p>The polybasic cleavage site on HA is a strong determinant for high pathogenicity of H5 viruses, however insertion of polybasic sequences into an LPAIV HA does not always result in a lethal phenotype as tested in chickens.

 </sup> Other influenza proteins such as PB2, PB1, and NP may increase pathogenicity of an influenza virus. The pathogenic phenotype of H5 viruses is not HA dependent. Pathogenicity and efficiency of replication can also be dependent on PB2, NP, NA, and M genes.

 </sup> The deleted stalk region of NA found in HPAIVs also confers pathogenicity, where rescue of the NA stalk region leads to a decreased pathogenesis in chickens.

 </sup> Deletion of the stalk region increases lethality and transmission compared with the wild-type viruses that display a lower lethality. In addition to H5 viruses, this same NA stalk deletion abrogates H2N2 virus replication in ducks, but shifts the virus tropism from the intestinal tract to the respiratory tract in chickens.

 </sup> The presence of the polybasic HA cleavage site was sufficient enough to induce viral neurotropism.
