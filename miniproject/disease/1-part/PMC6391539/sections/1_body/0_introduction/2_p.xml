<p>The 1997 outbreak was contained through the culling or ‘stamping out’ of all poultry in Hong Kong.

 </sup> However, AIVs continued to circulate in healthy duck populations in surrounding areas. Its re-emergence in 2003 resulted in the infection of 2 human cases caused by novel H5N1 genetic variants that continued to circulate and evolve into 10 phylogenetic clades (0–9).

 </sup> At the end of 2017, 860 laboratory confirmed cases of H5N1 influenza virus infection from 16 different countries, resulting in 454 deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).

 </sup> Infection of humans with AIVs are rare, but sporadic infections can occur due to direct contact with infected birds or through contaminated environments.

 </sup> According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), China has around 64% of the world’s domesticated ducks and 95% of the domesticated goose population breeding in live poultry markets alongside other poultry and swine. These conditions allow these markets to become breeding grounds for H5Nx influenza virus circulation.

 </sup> Outbreaks caused by AIVs have devastated live poultry markets in Asia and have had a substantial negative impact on the US economy.

 </sup> In this review, H5Nx viruses will be discussed for their replication, infection, evolution, and threat to the poultry industry, with emphasis on the need for a broadly reactive vaccine to protect the human population.
