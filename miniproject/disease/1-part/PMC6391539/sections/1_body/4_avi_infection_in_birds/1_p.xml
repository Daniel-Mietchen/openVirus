<p>Domesticated birds, such as chickens and turkeys, may become infected with AIVs through direct contact with infected waterfowl or infected poultry. AVis infect over 105 bird species across the globe, but the natural reservoirs for this virus reside in aquatic fowl such as gulls, terns, and shorebirds.

 </sup> Waterfowl can transmit AIV to other avian species such as terrestrial poultry. Infection of poultry with LPAIV can result in little to no disease. Clinical signs of LPAIV infection are ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production.

 </sup> Infection of birds with LPAIV can result in the virus mutating and adapting to the unsusceptible bird, possibly creating an HPAIV in these birds.

 </sup> Adaptation of the virus to increase replication efficacy can result in a LPAIV transforming into an HPAIV with the addition of basic amino acids inserted into the cleavage site on HA.

 </sup> Natural LPAIV infections in wild birds do not present with clinical signs of infection or tissue lesions.

 </sup> The H5N1-associated response in chickens includes a massive influx of cytokines, antiviral cytokines, and interferons, which should inhibit viral replication.

 </sup> However, some cytokines that are activated like IFN TNF-Î±, IL-8 and IL-6 may be responsible for influenza-induced pathology.
