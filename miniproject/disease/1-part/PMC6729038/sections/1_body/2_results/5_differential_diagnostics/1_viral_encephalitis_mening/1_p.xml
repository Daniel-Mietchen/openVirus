<p id="Par82">There were wide variations in the differential diagnostic recommendations for suspected viral CNS infections, reflecting the many potential causative agents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). All CMGs recommended testing for HSV and VZV and most also for enteroviruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fifty percent recommended testing for

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], with one CMG specifying only in children [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Other CMGs recommended testing for

 <italic>human herpesvirus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], adenoviruses and, depending on season or exposure, arboviruses. Testing for influenza, mumps, measles and rubella were also recommended, especially during an on-going epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Many, but not all CMGs provided differential diagnostic tables based on risk factors, such as age, immune status, travel, animal contact and seasonality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If a test is negative and still concerns about the diagnosis, it was recommended to take a second CSF sample within 3 to 7 days [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; one CMG specified a minimum of 4 days after onset of neurological symptoms [
