<p id="Par84">The different epidemiology for neonatal meningitis was reflected in the eight CMGs providing recommendations for neonates. All recommended testing for GBS, most also for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7). There were variations in the definitions of risk groups for neonates and infants. The CMG produced by MSF recommended testing for GBS and Gram-negative bacteria up to 7 days of age and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in more than 7-day-old neonates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Two CMGs recommended using the neonate recommendations in infants up to 3 months of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. For infants beyond the neonatal period, most recommended testing for 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11), 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) and Hib (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), again with variations in the age cut-offs.
