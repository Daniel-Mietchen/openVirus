<p id="Par78">Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain parenchyma associated with neurological dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which is reflected in the syndromic presentation. Meningoencephalitis affects both the brain parenchyma and meninges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Four of the 12 CMGs covering viral aetiologies described symptoms at presentation in adults [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], four in paediatric populations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Most of the guidelines cited focal neurological signs, seizures, fever, altered levels of consciousness (ALOC) and changes to personality or behaviour as signs and symptoms of encephalitis in both children and adults. It was noted that objective fever might be lacking at the time of assessment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] particularly in immunosuppressed patients [
