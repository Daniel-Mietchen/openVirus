<p id="Par79">Nine CMGs covering bacterial CNS meningitis presented symptoms at presentation in adults [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], eight in infants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and one in unspecified populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The classic symptoms of fever, headache, neck stiffness, followed by altered mental status and petechial rash, were most frequently described for adults and older children. However, for children, there were a wider range of symptoms reported, with some such as leg pain and cold hands and feet specifically described in children. The symptoms in infants and neonates were more general and can be undistinguishable from sepsis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Irritability, fever and poor feeding were most commonly described, followed by bulging fontanelle, petechial rash and lethargy. It was also highlighted by several CMGs that although high fever can be a sign of severity, fever might not always be present [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], particularly in neonates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This is consistent with the conclusions in the recent CMG by the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) that, based on evidence reviews, there are no clinical signs and symptoms that are present in all children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It was also highlighted that the classic signs of meningitis are not always present in adults either [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, bacterial meningitis cannot be ruled out based on the absence of classical signs and symptoms alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].
