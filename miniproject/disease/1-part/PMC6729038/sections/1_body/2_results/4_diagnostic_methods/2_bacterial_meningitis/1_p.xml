<p id="Par81">All CMGs covering bacterial CNS infections recommended urgent LP and most recommended blood sampling (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), since a positive CSF culture is confirmative of bacterial meningitis and enables in vitro testing of antimicrobial susceptibility to optimise antibiotic treatment, and urgent LP increases diagnostic chances [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. If CSF examination is not possible, serum markers of inflammation and blood cultures, especially if taken prior to antibiotics, can support the diagnosis and immunochromatographic antigen testing and PCR can provide additional information [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The CMG by MSF did not recommend LP for new cases in an epidemic context when a meningococcal aetiology was confirmed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Sixty-nine percent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11/16) recommended a CT scan before LP if clinical signs of raised ICP [
