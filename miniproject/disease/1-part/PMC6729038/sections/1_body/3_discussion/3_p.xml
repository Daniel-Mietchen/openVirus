<p id="Par91">There was a general consensus on diagnostic methods, but wider variations in infectious disease differential diagnostics recommendations, especially for paediatric and elderly populations. There was also general consensus on the most common bacterial causative agents for adults and older children, but variations in differential diagnostic recommendations for infants, neonates and elderly and in the definitions of these risk groups. This is illustrated by the different risk groups identified for 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection, which in two CMGs were defined as adults over 50 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], whereas over 60 years in another [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is also illustrated by the wide variations in the definition of risk groups for GBS, defined as younger than 1 week [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], 28 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], 3 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] or 24 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] in the recommendations for neonates and infants.
