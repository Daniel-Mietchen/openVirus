<p id="Par64">Central nervous system (CNS) infections continue to affect populations worldwide with high morbidity, mortality and risk of long-term sequelae and are also associated with a range of emerging and re-emerging viral threats to Europe, such as West Nile virus, Toscana virus, measles and enteroviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The epidemiology of community-acquired CNS infections is neither fixed nor homogeneous, with changes over time and between locations. The introduction of vaccines has reduced the burden of the two most common etiological agents for bacterial meningitis in adults and older children, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type B (Hib) is also becoming a rare cause of meningitis in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, reports of serotype replacement and an increased rate of reduced sensitivity to antimicrobial agents of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae,</italic> with varying rates across the region, are a cause of concern, which requires antibiotic regimes to be tailored to regions and travel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Neonatal meningitis is associated with high morbidity and higher incidence compared to older age groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In neonates, common pathophysiology are primary bloodstream infections with secondary haematogenous distribution to the CNS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] most commonly caused by 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (group B streptococcus; GBS) or 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain parenchyma associated with high morbidity and risk of long-term sequelae, is commonly caused by viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is estimated that 40 to 60% of cases remain without an aetiological diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This may partly be due to a lack of consensus on clinical case definitions and standardised diagnostic approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most commonly diagnosed causes of viral CNS infections in Europe are 
 <italic>Herpes simplex virus</italic> (HSVs), enteroviruses, 
 <italic>Varicella-zoster virus</italic> (VZV) and arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The epidemiology of encephalitis is constantly evolving [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and emerging infectious diseases may present as undifferentiated CNS infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This is ilustrated by the re-emergence of 
 <italic>West Nile virus</italic> (WNV) in south-eastern Europe and the emergence of 
 <italic>Toscana virus</italic> as a leading cause of aseptic meningitis in regions in southern Europe during the summer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another cause of concern are recent outbreaks of enterovirus-associated severe neurological disease which cause a strain on paediatric intensive care units [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
