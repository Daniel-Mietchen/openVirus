<p>NS1 deletion plasmid pHW2000-DelNS1 was constructed as described before (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Inverse PCR was performed to delete the NS1 gene using plasmid pHW2000-CA4-NS (influenza A virus) or plasmid pHW2000-8038-NS (influenza B virus) as a template. The PCR product was then gel purified, phosphorylated, and self-ligated using a standard protocol. Primers for CA4-DeNS1 inverse PCR were 5′-GACATACTTATGAGGATGTC-3′ (CA4-DelNS1-F) and 5′-CTGAAAGCTTGACATGGTGTTG-3′ (CA4-DelNS1-R). Primers for influenza B DelNS1 inverse PCR were 5′-CTCAATTTGTGTTGTGGTCATGTTGTCCGCC-3′ (Influenza b-DelNS1-F) and 5′-TGGAGGATGAAGAAGATGGCCATCGGATCCTC-3′ (Influenza b-DelNS1-R). A QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) was used to generate point mutations.
