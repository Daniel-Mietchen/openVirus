<p>All cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Human embryonic kidney cells (293T) and lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) were maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (P/S) (Life Technologies). Canine MDCK cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with the same amount of serum and antibiotics. H1N1 virus A/California/04/2009, H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1194/2004, H7N9 virus A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013, and influenza B virus B/HK/8038/2011 were rescued by reverse genetics (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2) was made with HA and NA derived from A//Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus (GenBank accession no. EPI1026704-11). CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1), WSN-DelNS1 (H1N1), CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2), H7N9-DelNS1, and B-DelNS1 (influenza B) LAIVs were constructed and rescued according to the protocols described here and in our previous report (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). CA4-DelNS1-BHA1 and CA4-DelNS1-HK4801-BHA1 were constructed to express HA1 of B/Brisbane/60/2008 in the NS1 site of either the CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) or CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 LAIV backbone. Viral gene segments were amplified and cloned into pHW2000 plasmids, resulting in eight pHW2000 plasmids, which were transfected into 293T/MDCK cell mixtures. Rescued virus was amplified in MDCK cells or embryonated chicken eggs. Mouse-adapted H1N1 A/California/04/2009, H3N2 A/HK/1/1968, B/Florida/4/2006, and B/Brisbane/60/2008 viruses were as described previously (
