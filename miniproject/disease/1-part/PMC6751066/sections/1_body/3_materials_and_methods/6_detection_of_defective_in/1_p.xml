<p>Detection of DI RNA of different segments (PB1, PB2, and PA) was done according to a previously described method (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). For comparisons, passaged CA4-DelNS1, commercial coadapted Flumist live attenuated influenza vaccine (2014â€“2015 season), plaque-purified cold-adapted H1N1 CA7 from Flumist, and passaged Flu B-DelNS1 were examined. RNA was extracted by using a viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). Viral RNAs were subjected to reverse transcription using a High-Capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and Uni-12 (Flu A) or Uni-9 (Flu B). Segment-specific viral genes were amplified using Hot start 
 <italic>Taq</italic> (TaKaRa) and long-segment-specific primers. The NS segment was also amplified as a control. PCR products were resolved by the use of 1.5% agarose gels and stained using gel red (Biotium). Images were captured by an Azure 150 system (Azure).
