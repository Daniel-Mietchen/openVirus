<p>Female BALB/c mice (4 to 6 weeks old) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Unit, the University of Hong Kong. Mice were vaccinated intranasally with DelNS1 viruses (for CA4-DelNS1, 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU; for CA4-DelNS1-HK4801, 3 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU; for DelNS1-B8038, 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU; for CA4-DelNS1-HK68, 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU; for ca-LAIV, 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU; for CA4-DelNS1-BHA1, 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU; for CA4-DelNS1-HK4801-BHA1, 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU) 3 weeks prior to virus challenge. Blood was collected for hemagglutination inhibition assay on the day before virus challenge and from the surviving mice at 14 days postinfection. To test for long-lasting immunity, mice were immunized 10 weeks before challenge with different viruses. For virus challenge, vaccinated mice were inoculated intranasally with the indicated viruses (for mouse-adapted H1N1, 10 MLD

 <sup>5</sup> PFU; for H5N1, 100 MLD

 <sub>50</sub>, 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU; for mouse-adapted H3N2 A/HK/1/68 virus, 10 MLD
 <sub>50</sub>). Body weights, disease symptoms, and survival rates were observed for 14 days. Mice with a body weight loss of greater than 25% were euthanized, in accordance with animal ethics guidelines. To evaluate viral replication in mouse lungs, lungs were collected at day 3 and homogenized in 1 ml PBS. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in MDCK cells. The protocols used in this experiment were approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching &amp; Research (CULATR-3064-13), the University of Hong Kong. The CULATR follows Hong Kong legislation-recommended and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-recommended standards/guidelines (
