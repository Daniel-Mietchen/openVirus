<p>Viruses were 10-fold serially diluted and added to confluent MDCK cells in 6-well plates and then incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and then overlaid with 1% MEM agarose containing 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. The plates were incubated at 33°C for 48 h and then fixed with 10% PBS–buffered formaldehyde solution for at least 2 h. Plaques were visualized by staining with 1% crystal violet solution.</p>
