<p>Confluent cells (A549 or MDCK) seeded in 24-well plates were infected with viruses at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI). After 1 h of adsorption, the viral supernatant was removed and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then overlaid with MEM containing 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin and incubated at the indicated temperature. Supernatants were collected at different time points, and titers were determined by plaque assay in TPCK-treated MDCK cells.</p>
