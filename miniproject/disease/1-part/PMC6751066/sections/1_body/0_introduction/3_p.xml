<p>Extending from our previous work characterizing a DelNS1 virus derived from A/WSN/1933 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), we have established a panel of DelNS1 versions of influenza A (2009 H1N1, H3N2, and H7N9) and B virus strains based on master donor strains derived from the 2009 H1N1 and HK2011 influenza B virus strains, respectively. We found that different strains of influenza viruses utilize different adaptive strategies to support replication of DelNS1 viruses. These DelNS1 viruses are avirulent in mice, regardless of whether they originated from seasonal, pandemic, or highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and are naturally cold-adapted. Importantly, immunization of mice with the H1N1 DelNS1 LAIV vaccine induces long-lasting cross protective immunity against lethal challenge with 2009 pandemic H1N1, H3N2, and avian H5N1 or H7N9 viruses. Broad protection against antigenically distantly related influenza viruses was also observed for DelNS1-H3N2 and DelNS1 B LAIVs. We show that 2009 H1N1-DelNS1 LAIV is a safe and versatile master donor backbone for making vaccine versions of other subtype viruses and for expressing additional antigens to enhance specific immunity against influenza viruses. DelNS1 LAIVs with adaptive mutations enabling growth in high-volume vaccine production systems should be considered an important strategy to be further evaluated in the quest to develop more-effective and broadly protective vaccines for seasonal and emerging pandemic influenza viruses.
