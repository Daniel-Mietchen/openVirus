<p>Influenza poses a significant disease burden, causing deaths through annual seasonal epidemics and also during sporadic pandemics, which have occurred four times since 1918. Vaccination is considered the most effective way to alleviate the disease burden and mortality associated with seasonal influenza and is also the method of choice to curb future human pandemics. However, the highly variable nature of hemagglutinin (HA) in circulating strains makes it difficult to predict the evolution of influenza viruses (IVs). An inability to induce long-lasting immunity and the effects of historical influenza virus infections on vaccine-induced immune responses further complicate the current vaccine strategy. Mismatch of seasonal influenza vaccines and circulating strains occurs regularly, resulting in severe influenza seasons (

It is also recognized that HA-based influenza vaccine technology cannot respond swiftly to emerging pandemic viruses, as evidenced during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Therefore, it is imperative to develop influenza vaccines with the ability to induce enduring broadly protective immunity against matched and mismatched seasonal influenza virus strains and that can be produced rapidly in the scenario of an emerging pandemic.
