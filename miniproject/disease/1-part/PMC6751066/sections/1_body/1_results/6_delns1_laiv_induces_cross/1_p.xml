<p>The results described above suggested that the cross protective immunity induced by CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) may be attributable to non-HA-specific antibodies or cellular immunity. To verify the role of T cell immunity following DelNS1 LAIV immunization, we first evaluated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> responses in CA4-DelNS1 virus-immunized and ca-LAIV-immunized mice. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells specific for conserved influenza virus (NP) epitopes were analyzed using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) of splenocytes from immunized mice. Both CA4-DelNS1 and ca-LAIV H1N1 viruses were found to have induced NP-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T responses 3 weeks after a single intranasal dose (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig. S6A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">B</xref>). It appears that CA4-DelNS1 induces significantly higher levels of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells than ca-LAIV. However, it remains to be determined if this difference may be caused by the single amino acid difference between the CD4 epitopes in the NP of ca-LAIV and CA4-DelNS1 virus. To determine if specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are critical to the cross protection provided by CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) LAIV, immunized mice were treated with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies, singly or in combination, to deplete these T cell subsets and were then challenged with a lethal dose of H7N9 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Depletion of T cells was confirmed 1 day before virus challenge to ensure that more than 98% depletion was achieved compared with the isotype control (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig. S6C</xref>). LAIV-immunized mice with subsequent CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and/or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion were then challenged with H7N9 virus (10 MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) and survival and body weight change monitored for 14 days. Combined depletion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells severely compromised CD4-DelNS1-immunized mice, with only 1/7 of mice surviving and with these mice showing significant body weight loss and high virus titers in lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig. S6D</xref>). While both CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are required for optimal cross protection, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> may be the more critical of the two for mediating cross protective cell immunity against influenza virus infection. However, when CA4-DelNS1 LAIV-immunized mice were depleted of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and/or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and then challenged with a lethal dose of H1N1 virus, all mice remained fully protected and showed no sign of disease or weight loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref>). The data clearly demonstrate that DelNS1 LAIV induced both antibody and T cell immunities and that cross protective immunity was mainly mediated by influenza virus-specific T cells.
