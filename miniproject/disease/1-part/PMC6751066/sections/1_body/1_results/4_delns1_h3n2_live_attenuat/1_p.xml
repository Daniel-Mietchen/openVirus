<p>To assess the suitability of the CA4-DelNS1 virus for use as a master donor backbone, we constructed a DelNS1-H3N2 LAIV using the CA4-DelNS1 backbone and HA and NA derived from the A/HK/4801/2014 H3N2 virus. The NS1-deleted version of the A/HK/4801/2014 (H3N2) virus was rescued with the six internal genome segments of the CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) virus, which carry the adaptive mutations for virus growth and temperature restriction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>) (here designated CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 in subsequent descriptions of experiments). As anticipated, CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2) virus is unable to replicate in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Analysis of growth properties in MDCK cells showed that CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2) LAIV also exhibits a preference for replication at 33°C, with growth being restricted at 37°C and 39°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This demonstrates that CA4-DelNS1 can be used as a donor master strain for the construction of other HA and NA subtype DelNS1 LAIVs. There are very few mouse-adapted H3N2 viruses available for use in challenge experiments. To assess the protective activity of the CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2) LAIV, we challenged mice with a mouse-adapted virus derived from a 1968 H3N2 isolate and also created a DelNS1 version of the original non-mouse-adapted isolate (CA4-DelNS1-HK68) (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) for use in subsequent comparisons. Mice were immunized once with CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2) or CA4-DelNS1-HK68 (H3N2) live attenuated virus and then challenged with a lethal dose of the mouse-adapted H3N2 (HK68-MA) strain 3 weeks later. As expected, mice immunized with CA4-DelNS1-HK68 were fully protected from HK68-MA virus challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Notably, mice immunized with the CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2) LAIV, which carries HA and NA whose origins are separated by nearly 50 years from those of the challenging HK68-MA virus strain, were completely protected, with no apparent body weight loss or other disease symptoms being observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>) and with significantly lower virus titers in lungs at day 3 postinfection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4A</xref>). HI analysis showed that antibodies reactive to the HK4801 strain were induced prior to virus challenge (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4B</xref>). However, these antibodies were not reactive to the HK68 strain or to a more recent H3N2 vaccine strain, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (Bris10), similarly to the results seen with CA4-DelNS1 H1N1 LAIV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2E</xref>). HI tests revealed a low but detectable level of antibodies reactive to the HK68 strain present in sera collected from CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 LAIV-protected mice 2 weeks after HK68-MA virus challenge. Neutralization tests confirmed the presence of neutralizing antibodies corresponding to both HK4801 and HK68-MA in CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 LAIV-immunized mice prior to challenge and at 2 weeks after challenge (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4C</xref>). Note that levels of both hemagglutinin inhibition and neutralization antibodies recognizing HK4801 were higher after HK68-MA virus challenge, suggesting that HK68-MA virus infection boosts the levels of antibodies initially induced by HK4801 immunization. Given that HK68-MA and HK4801 are antigenically distinct, it is possible that immunization with CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 induces a broad antibody repertoire reactive to conserved epitopes present in both strains and that these antibody repertoires are boosted following subsequent challenge with HK68-MA virus. However, the use of HK68-MA (mouse-adapted) H3N2 virus to study cross protection against antigenic drift strain has limitations, since the vaccinated strain (HK4801) evolved from it. Mouse-adapted H3N2 viruses of more recently isolated H3N2 virus strains are needed to address this issue in future. Taken together, these results show that CA4-DelNS1 virus can be used as a donor backbone for making DelNS1 viruses of other subtypes which are temperature sensitive but able to replicate efficiently in MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs. Importantly, recombinant CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2) LAIV is highly protective against challenge with antigenically distantly related viral strains. This finding is potentially important, as it suggests that DelNS1 LAIVs can elicit immunity that is sufficiently broad to overcome influenza vaccine mismatches caused by antigenic drift of seasonal influenza viruses.
