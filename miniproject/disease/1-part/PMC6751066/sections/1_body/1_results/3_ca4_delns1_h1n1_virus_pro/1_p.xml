<p>To assess the protective ability of DelNS1 virus in influenza virus infection, we immunized mice once with CA4-DelNS1 virus, through the nasal route. At 3 weeks after immunization, mice were challenged with mouse-adapted H1N1 virus or with H7N9 or H5N1 viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To understand the effectiveness of DelNS1 virus in inducing host immunity, the ca-LAIV H1N1 virus was included as a comparison. Animals were challenged with lethal doses of viruses, as indicated, and followed for 2 weeks after infection. Immunization with either CA4-DelNS1 virus or ca-LAIV fully protected against lethal challenge with mouse-adapted H1N1 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). No virus was detected in the lung tissues of mice from vaccinated groups at day 3 postinfection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3A</xref>). Interestingly, immunization with CA4-DelNS1 virus and ca-LAIV also protected against a H7N9 virus challenge with 10 50% murine lethal doses (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>), with mice displaying only slight body weight loss during the first 3 days of infection, followed by full recovery (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Consistent with this body weight loss, H7N9 virus was still actively replicating in the lungs of vaccinated mice at day 3 postchallenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection is fatal in approximately 60% of human cases. It is noteworthy that immunization with CA4-DelNS1 virus provided full protection to H5N1 virus-challenged mice, with no deaths or body weight loss observed in any of these animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Cross protection was also observed with the ca-LAIV vaccine, but it conferred only partial protection, with 3/5 mice dying and the surviving mice (2/5) experiencing significant body weight loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>), further demonstrating that CA4-DelNS1 LAIV provides better cross protective activity than ca-LAIV, which contains an intact NS1 gene. However, virus titers in the lungs of challenged mice were not significantly different (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">C</xref>). Cross protective immunity against antigenically distinct influenza A strains was also induced by CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) and CA4-DelNS1-HK4801, with the latter bearing HA and NA from the H3N2 A/HK/4801/2014 virus on the CA4-DelNS1 backbone, in a separate experiment where LAIV-vaccinated mice were challenged with mouse-adapted A/HK/1/68 (H3N2) virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">E</xref>). To investigate if cross-reactive antibodies are induced by immunization, sera from immunized mice were collected prior to virus challenge and analyzed by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay. Both CA4-DelNS1 and ca-LAIV induced a fair level of antibodies against the H1N1 virus, but antibodies specific for either H7N9 or H5N1 were undetectable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>), suggesting that the observed cross protective immunity might be facilitated by an immunological mediator other than HA-specific antibodies. To examine if the cross protective immunity mediated by DelNS1 LAIV is long-lasting, mice were immunized 10 weeks before challenge. Cross protection was observed following challenge with H1N1, H7N9, and H5N1 viruses, and the level of protection shown by CA4-DelNS1 virus against H5N1 virus was superior to that shown by ca-LAIV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">D</xref>). To test whether DelNS1 LAIV might produce defective interfering (DI) virus as cross protective antiviral agents (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we compared DI viral genomes from DelNS1 LAIV and the H1N1 vaccine strain isolated from Flumist LAIV season vaccine (2014 to 2015) passaged in eggs. While statistically significant levels of DI genomes from PB2 and PA were detected from a commercial LAIV H1N1 strain, no significant DI genomes were detected from either influenza A or influenza B DelNS1 LAIV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2E</xref>). These results show that DelNS1 live attenuated influenza virus induces sustained and highly protective immunity against lethal challenge with both homologous and heterologous subtype viruses and that deletion of NS1 from CA4 created a live attenuated influenza vaccine that seems to be more cross protective than the ca-LAIV which contains wild-type NS1.
