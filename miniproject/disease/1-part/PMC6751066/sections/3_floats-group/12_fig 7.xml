  <p>DelNS1 LAIV expression of B-HA1 antigen protected against lethal challenge with both influenza A and B viruses in mice. (A) Illustration of cloning of B-HAI region into the CA4-DelNS1 NS segment. (B) Mice were vaccinated once with CA4-DelNS1 and then challenged 3 weeks later with mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza A virus (A/California/04/2009, 10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub>) or influenza B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008, 10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub>) and monitored for 14 days. (C) Mice were vaccinated twice, 1 month apart, with 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU of either CA4-DelNS1 virus or CA4-DelNS1-BHA1, which contains the HA1 gene of influenza B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008) at the site in the NS segment from which NS1 was deleted. Mice were challenged with mouse-adapted B/Brisbane/60/2008 (10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub>) 1 month after the second vaccination and monitored for 2 weeks. (D) Mice were vaccinated once with 1 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU of either CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 (H3N2) virus or CA4-DelNS1-HK4801-BHA1 LAIV. Vaccinated mice were challenged with mouse-adapted B/Brisbane/60/2008 (10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub>) 1 month after the second dose of vaccination. Mice were monitored for body weight change and survival for 2 weeks. Body weight data represent mean values ± standard deviations of results from 6 (B and C) or 7 (D) mice.
