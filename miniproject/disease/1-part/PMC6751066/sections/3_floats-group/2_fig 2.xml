  <p>Avirulence of CA4-DelNS1 virus. (A) A549 cells were infected with CA4-WT virus, with ca-LAIV, or with CA4-DelNS1 virus at 0.01 MOI and cultured at 33°C or 37°C. ca-LAIV is a cold-adapted 2009 H1N1 virus that was isolated from the licensed LAIV vaccine (
   <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Viral supernatants were collected at different time points and titrated by plaque assay in MDCK cells. Data represent mean values ± standard deviations of results from three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons between means were performed by Student's

   <sup>6</sup> PFU of CA4-DelNS1, H7N9-DelNS1, WSN-DelNS1, or H7N9 WT virus. PBS was used as an inoculation control. Body weight and survival were observed for 14 days. Data represent mean body weight values ± standard deviations of results from 6 mice.
