  <p>Generation and characterization of CA4-DelNS1 virus. (A) Full-length and NS1 gene-deleted NS segments. NCR, noncoding region. (B) Confirmation of NS1 deletion in rescued CA4-DelNS1 virus by RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. -ve, negative control. (C) Newly rescued CA4-DelNS1 virus was passaged in MDCK cells 20 times to promote growth adaptation. After the virus titers stabilized, the entire genome of the CA4-DelNS1 virus was analyzed and adaptive mutations were identified. (D) Effect of adaptive mutations on the efficiency of CA4-DelNS1 virus rescue. DelNS1 pHW2000 plasmids with individual or combined adaptive mutations or the original DelNS1 plasmid (DelNS1-WT) were transfected together with plasmids encoding the other 7 viral segments into 293T/MDCK cell mixtures and incubated at 33°C or 37°C. After 72 h, viral supernatants were collected and titrated. (E) Growth of CA4-DelNS1 at 33°C or 37°C was analyzed. MDCK cells or embryonated chicken eggs were infected with CA4-DelNS1 or WT virus at 0.1 MOI or 1,000 PFU, respectively. Viral supernatants or allantoic fluids were collected at the indicated time points and titrated by plaque assay in MDCK cells. Data represent mean values ± standard deviations of results from three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons between means were performed by Student's
