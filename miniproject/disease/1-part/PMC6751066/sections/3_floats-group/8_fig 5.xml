  <p>Generation and characterization of DelNS1 B LAIV. (A) Generation of DelNS1-B8038 influenza B virus by reverse genetics. pHW2000 plasmids containing an NS1-deleted (DelNS1) segment and the seven remaining genome segments derived from B/Hong Kong/8038/2011 (Victoria) virus were transfected into a 293T/MDCK cell mixture. Rescued virus was passaged in MDCK cells until the virus titer stabilized. (B) Adaptive mutations in growth-adapted DelNS1-B8038 influenza B virus. Mutations in PA (T210C), NA (T1429C), NP (C182T), and M (G88C plus A280G) were identified. (C) Growth of DelNS1-B8038 influenza B virus in cell culture. MDCK or A549 cells were infected with either WT or DelNS1-B8038 virus at 0.01 MOI and incubated at 33°C or 37°C for 72 h. Virus supernatants were collected and titrated by plaque assay in MDCK cells. Data represent mean values ± standard deviations of results from three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons between means were performed by Student's

   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. (D) DelNS1-B8038 (B-DelNS1) LAIV vaccination protected mice from challenge with both Victoria and Yamagata lineage mouse-adapted viruses. Mice were vaccinated with DelNS1-B8038 (2 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU) or PBS. After 3 weeks, vaccinated mice were challenged with mouse-adapted B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria) or B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata) influenza B virus at 10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub>. Body weight and survival were observed for 14 days. Body weight data represent mean values ± standard deviations of results from 6 mice.
