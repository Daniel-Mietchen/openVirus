<p>In this study, we explored the association between six meteorological factors (temperature, UV index, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and pressure) and IV activity in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania during 2010â€“2018. In particular, we utilized correlation analysis and machine learning modeling as well as in vitro experiments to show that low temperature and UV indexes were the most predictive meteorological factors for high IV activity. Thus, our results highlighted an important role of temperature and UV index in influenza epidemics in Northern Europe.</p>
