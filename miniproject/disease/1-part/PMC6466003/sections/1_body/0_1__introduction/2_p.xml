<p>It is now becoming evident that meteorological factors are associated with seasonality of IV epidemics [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00207" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Low temperature and low humidity have been shown to enhance IV transmissibility in temperate climates at high latitudes, whereas high humidity favors outbreaks in low latitudes in tropical and subtropical zones. In mid-latitudes, semiannual outbreaks result from alternating cool and rainy conditions [
