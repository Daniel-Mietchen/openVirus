<p>Both correlation and machine learning analyses revealed that temperature was the most predictive meteorological factor of influenza activity in all six Northern European countries (

The humidity was the third most important factor associated with IV activity. Other meteorological factors, including wind speed, precipitation, and pressure showed low correlation with the peaks of IV activity and were not among the most predictive features of the machine learning Random Forest model.
