<p>We analyzed correlation between each meteorological factor and IV activity to find significant associations and to measure the strength of linear association between variables using the Pearson correlation coefficient. As the correlation analysis does not always provide an accurate picture of cause and effect, especially in nonlinear systems, where interdependence between variables is complex, we validated our results by optimizing a machine learning Random Forest model. The model was optimized for each of the analyzed countries with an average explained variation of 71%.</p>
