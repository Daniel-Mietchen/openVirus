<p>To validate the association between IV activity and low temperature and UV indexes, we performed in vitro experiments. Purified GFP-encoding influenza A/Puerto Rico/1934 virus (PR8-GFP) was incubated at different temperatures for 48 h or exposed to UVC or UVB radiation for different times. The resulting virus preparations were subjected to titration on MDCK cells. Exposure to high temperatures or prolonged UVC, but not UVB radiation, lowered virus infectivity (
