<p>Previous studies have shown that absolute humidity and temperature are major determinants of IV activity in temperate climates [

In this study, we used correlation and machine learning analyses to quantify the impact of six meteorological factors (temperature, UV index, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation) on the IV activity in six Northern European countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) during 2010â€“2018. We demonstrated that low temperature, UV indexes and humidity were associated with annual peaks of IV activity. Humidity was a less important predictor of IV activity compared to temperature and UV index. These results could be due to a statistical anomaly (UV and humidity were very close in their indices of association) or a specific phenomenon caused by the long and dark winters of Northern Europe.
