<p>GFP-expressing influenza A/PR8-NS116-GFP strain (PR8-GFP) was purified by centrifugation in sucrose gradient as previously described [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00207" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The purified virus was incubated at different temperatures for 48 h. Alternatively, the virus was exposed to UVC (λ = 254 nm) or to UVB (λ = 302 nm) using Hoefer UVC 500 Ultraviolet Crosslinker (20 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) or VM25/30/GX trans-illuminator as UV sources, respectively. Resulting viruses were titered on MDCK cells using plaque assay as described previously [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00207" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The virus titers were determined by calculating the plaque forming units (PFU) for each sample and were expressed as PFU/mL.
