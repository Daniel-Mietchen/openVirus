<p>To find correlation between colder winters and increases in the number of influenza-positive specimens for six countries, we applied the Cox–Stuart statistical test. In particular, the median winter temperatures (2010–2018) were calculated by taking a median of daily temperatures between 1st of December and the 28th of February. Then, the median winter temperatures were ordered by the number of total IV-positive specimens for each country each year. A Cox–Stuart statistical test was applied to the ordered median winter temperatures to find any significant increasing or decreasing trends (threshold of significance was set to 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05).
