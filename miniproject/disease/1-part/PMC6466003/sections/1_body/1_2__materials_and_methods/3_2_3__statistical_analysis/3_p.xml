<p>For the machine learning modeling, Random Forest (RF) was optimized to find the most predictive meteorological factors of influenza activity. More specifically, for each country, the time-series measurements for all six meteorological factors were used as input features (explanatory variables) and the number of IV-positive specimens as an output variable for the model. The optimal Random Forest hyper-parameters, which are estimated from the data and used to train the most accurate model, were identified using Bayesian optimization (mlrMBO R-package, version: 1.1.1), with five times repeated 10-fold cross validation. The optimized RF model (with the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) from cross-validation) was used to estimate the contribution of each meteorological factor as a predictive performance of IV activity. This was done by random permutation of the measurements of one of the meteorological factors, while keeping measurements for all other factors constant, followed by estimation of the impact of this procedure on model accuracy (i.e., percentage mean decrease in accuracy). RF R-package version 4.6-14 was applied for the model training, with the following hyper-parameters used for optimization: Number of trees, number of randomly sampled features at each tree split (mtry), and minimum size of terminal nodes.</p>
