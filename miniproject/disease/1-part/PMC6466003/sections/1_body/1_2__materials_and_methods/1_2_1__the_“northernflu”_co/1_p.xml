<p>To better understand the etiology of influenza epidemics in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania a “NorthernFlu” consortium was established in 2017. It consists of epidemiologists, clinicians and researchers from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The consortium aims to determine the impact of meteorological, societal, and genetic factors on IV stability and transmissibility and to improve prediction, prevention and treatment of severe IV infections.</p>
