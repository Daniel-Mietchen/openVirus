  <p>Schematic representation of the three main branches of unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6). In normal conditions, the activation of UPR helps to diminish ER stress by reducing ER protein load and increasing ER folding capacity. To evade the antiviral effects of PKR, the viral NS1 has been shown to inhibit protein kinase R (PKR) activity, which in turn will affect the PERK-induced response. Previous reports, although contradictory, also demonstrate that upon infection the virus can to some extent influence the mediated signaling of the three UPR branches. Red dotted arrows represent still controversial actions of IAV on UPR targets. Viral proteins are represented underlined.</p>
