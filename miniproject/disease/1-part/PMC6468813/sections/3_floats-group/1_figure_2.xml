  <p>Schematic representation of the interplay between cellular protein chaperones and IAV proteins throughout viral life cycle. Upon attachment with the cellular surface proteins, the virus is internalized by endocytosis and hijacks the cellular aggresome processing machinery (HDAC6) for capsid uncoating and genome release into the cytoplasm. Afterwards, the viral genome (vRNP) is imported to the nucleus together with Hsp40/DnaJB1, where it undergoes transcription and replication. Several host chaperones are involved in mediating viral replication, either by favoring or constraining viral polymerase activity. To spread infection, the virus can additionally induce host cell lysis by inducing apoptosis, a process in which host chaperones are also involved. Dotted lines refer to mechanisms associated to controversial results, as explained in the text. Viral proteins are represented underlined.</p>
