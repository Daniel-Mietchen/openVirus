<p>To successfully establish infection, viruses can manipulate the host cell to favor the synthesis of viral proteins, at the expense of host proteins, involving changes in translation and RNA synthesis and stability [

IAV uses various mechanisms of host shutoff to evade the immune response and promote viral replication, even though basal levels of cellular protein synthesis are maintained until the end of the replication cycle to ensure cell survival and, thus, an efficient infection [
