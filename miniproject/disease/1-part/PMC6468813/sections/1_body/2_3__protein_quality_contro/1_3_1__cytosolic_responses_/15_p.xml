<p>This might imply that the virus benefits from autophagy to accumulate viral elements during replication, without affecting progeny virus production. In fact, it was recently suggested that autophagy plays a role in supporting IAV-induced apoptosis and replication [

 <xref rid="B89-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], that has already been referred as crucial for an efficient replication cycle. Considering these results, it seems that IAV takes advantage of both proteasome and the autophagosome systems to efficiently replicate, in particular to allow the nuclear import of influenza particles and to permit its genome replication.
