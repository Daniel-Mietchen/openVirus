<p>On the other hand, IAV has evolved to modulate ubiquitination events to evade immune responses, by degrading or inactivating cellular proteins that limit viral growth and support virus replication. For example, NS1 interferes with the domain of TRIM25 required for RIG-I ubiquitination to circumvent downstream antiviral IFN production [
