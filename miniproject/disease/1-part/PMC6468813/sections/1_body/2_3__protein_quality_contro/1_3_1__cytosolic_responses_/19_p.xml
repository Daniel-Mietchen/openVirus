<p>Thus, IAV seems to induce the formation of inclusion bodies to escape the host cellular antiviral response and induce pathogenicity. In specific cases, the presence of RNA sensors, viral RNA, and MAVS in infected cells within cytoplasmic inclusion bodies correlates with the inhibition of an antiviral IFN-mediated response [
