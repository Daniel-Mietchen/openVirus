<p>Alternatively, misfolded proteins strongly tend to accumulate in stress granules (SGs), stress-induced cytosolic ribonucleoprotein complexes that assemblies when translation is inhibited. By sequestering polyribosome-associated components, SGs can reprioritize translation and rout the stalled components for re-initiation or degradation. The continuing accumulation of misfolded proteins can affect SGs dynamics, promoting its conversion into an aberrant aggresome-like structure that can be eventually transported to aggresomes and further degraded. The presence of cellular chaperones, specifically HSP27 and HSP70, has shown to prevent the formation of aberrant SGs and promote SGs disassembly by helping to maintain its normal composition and dynamism [
