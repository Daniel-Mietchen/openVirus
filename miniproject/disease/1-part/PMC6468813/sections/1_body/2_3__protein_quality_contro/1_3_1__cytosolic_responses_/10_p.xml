<p>A functional UPS is important for the replication of influenza viruses, in order to maintain proper function and the level of viral proteins, although it can act as a host antiviral strategy to mark viral components for degradation [

 <xref rid="B74-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Studies have shown that the disruption of proteasome activity using specific inhibitors can lead to the sequestration of incoming influenza particles in cytoplasmic endosomes, directly affecting the early stages of viral replication and blocking the following nuclear import and viral protein expression [
