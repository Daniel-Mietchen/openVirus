<p>Upon viral infection, the deregulation of proteostasis may lead to the accumulation of insoluble misfolded proteins that, along with chaperones and proteasome components, are often targeted to juxtanuclear structures termed aggresomes. These proteins are actively transported in a retrograde dynein-based manner along the microtubule cytoskeleton to the perinuclear site at the microtubule-organizing center, where they are sequestered into aggresomes [

It involves the microtubule-associated histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which can promote the autophagic clearance of protein aggregates and protect cells from cytotoxic accumulation of misfolded proteins, acting as an adaptor that binds polyubiquitin chains from substrates and dynein [
