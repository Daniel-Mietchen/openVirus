<p>The autophagosomeâ€“lysosome pathway is similarly manipulated upon infection with IAV, in a way that the formation of autophagosomes is triggered, but the fusion with lysosomes is inhibited by the virus [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Autophagy deficiency was demonstrated to significantly reduce the levels of viral proteins, mRNA, and genomic RNAs without affecting viral entry [

 <xref rid="B90-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] in a time-dependent manner [

 <xref rid="B93-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], since viral production is reduced by the depletion of autophagy-required proteins [
 <xref rid="B90-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In fact, autophagy diminishes the early IFN response to IAV [
 <xref rid="B94-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] and several viral proteins, namely NS1, HA, and M2, have shown to be involved in the upregulation of autophagy [

 <xref rid="B95-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Interestingly, the M2 homologous protein of IBV does not induce autophagosome accumulation [
