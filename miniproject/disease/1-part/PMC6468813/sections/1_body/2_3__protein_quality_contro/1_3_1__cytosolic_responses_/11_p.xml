<p>However, influenza proteins can be targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation as an antiviral mechanism employed by the cells. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 is known to interact and directly ubiquitinate the PB1 viral protein, leading to its degradation and the subsequent reduction of its polymerase activity [
