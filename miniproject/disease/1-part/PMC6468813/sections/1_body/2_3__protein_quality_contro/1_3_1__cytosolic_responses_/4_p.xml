<p>The Hsp40/DnaJA1 protein can enhance viral RNA synthesis, and ultimately IAV replication, by interacting with the viral RNA polymerase, through its polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) and PA subunits [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, Hsp70 was previously demonstrated to negatively regulate viral RNP activity [
 <xref rid="B61-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, a recent study suggests that this protein is crucial for IAV replication and transcription [
 <xref rid="B62-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Both studies support the interaction of Hsp70 with PB1 and PB2, presumably assisting the assembly of the viral polymerase complex and its translocation to the nucleus [

 <xref rid="B62-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Nevertheless, Li et al. (2011) demonstrated that high levels of Hsp70 interfere with the integrity of RNP [
 <xref rid="B61-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], whereas Manzoor et al. (2014) showed that, at normal levels, Hsp70 acts as a chaperone for the viral polymerase [
 <xref rid="B62-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Before, NS1 viral protein was shown to inhibit the processing of Hsp70 pre-mRNA, thus blocking Hsp70 protein expression [
 <xref rid="B63-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Also, Hsp90 was found to relocalize to the nucleus upon IAV infection by interacting with both PB1 and PB2 polymerase subunits. Hsp90 seems to be involved in the assembly and nuclear transport of influenza RNA polymerase subunits [
 <xref rid="B64-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and stimulates its RNA synthesis activity [
 <xref rid="B65-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In agreement, Hsp90 inhibitors impairs IAV replication [
 <xref rid="B66-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], rendering it as a potential target for the treatment of IAV infections (
