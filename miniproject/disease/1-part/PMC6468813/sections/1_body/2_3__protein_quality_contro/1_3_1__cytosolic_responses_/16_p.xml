<p>When the amount of misfolded proteins in cells exceeds the refolding or degradative capacity of the quality-control machinery, or when this machinery is disrupted, the misfolded or aggregated proteins may be sequestered and compartmentalized into stress foci to minimize their toxic effects and interference with the normal cellular functions [
