<p>In eukaryotic cells, the ER is the major site for protein folding and trafficking. Therefore, ER proteostasis perturbations, including those caused by viral infection, may lead to accumulation of misfolded proteins and their aggregation within the organellar lumen, which induces stress in the ER [
 <xref rid="B113-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Its ability to facilitate protein folding renders ER chaperones as essential and the major facilitators of proper virus assemblage. For IAV, the folding and maturation efficiency of viral glycoproteins in the ER, namely HA and NA, impact the production of viral particles [
