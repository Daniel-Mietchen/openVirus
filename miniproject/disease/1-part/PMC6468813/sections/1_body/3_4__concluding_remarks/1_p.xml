<p>Upon IAV infection, several processes within the cytosolic and the ER protein quality control mechanisms, namely protein folding, degradation and sequestration, have shown to contribute either as part of an effective replication cycle or as part of an effective cellular antiviral response to the virus. IAV seems to take advantage of the protein quality control components to replicate and spread infection, although some of the observed effects may also be part of the establishment of cellular reactions to counteract the virus. Some reports show contradictory findings and further studies are needed in order to obtain more clarity and insight into the control of cellular proteostasis mechanisms by both the virus and the host cell. </p>
