<p>In this review, we summarize and discuss the induced disruption of the cellular machinery, with focus on proteostasis imbalance, throughout the course of influenza A virus (IAV) life-cycle and explore its significance for infection efficiency. Although information on the interplay between influenza B virus (IBV) and host-cell proteostasis is scarce, we have established a parallel, where appropriate, between the two viruses.</p>
