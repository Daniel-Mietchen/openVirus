<p>Since its development in 1930, the YF-17D vaccine has been very effective as a preventive action, inducing the production of neutralizing antibodies directed against the viral envelope protein. Several vaccination strategies have been implemented, including YF vaccination in childrenâ€™s routine vaccination calendar, campaigns and providing vaccination coverage to travelers visiting yellow fever risk zones. In addition to vaccination, vector control is imperative and is also classified as a preventive action. Nevertheless, the yellow fever virus can also be transmitted between humans by the Aedes mosquito, the urban vector, resulting in urban epidemics. Therefore, yellow fever surveillance that includes humans, animals (other primate hosts) and vectors deserves special attention in Brazil, especially in the Southeast and Midwest regions
