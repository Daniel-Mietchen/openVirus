<p>In general, kidney dysfunctions appear between the fifth and seventh day of the disease, are characterized by the reduction of urinary volume and the urinary loss of albumin (a common blood protein). One frequent finding is a urinary volume lower than 500 mL/day, even if the patient is normovolemic, which may evolve to anuria and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). At this stage, there is a high rate of mortality. It is a fact that renal ischemia, intravascular coagulation, shock and tubular toxicity are induced by bilirubin and by direct effects of the virus on kidney tissues. If there is no improvement in kidney function, renal replacement therapy is indicated (peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis)
