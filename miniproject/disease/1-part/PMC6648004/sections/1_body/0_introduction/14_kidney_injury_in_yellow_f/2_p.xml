<p>The autopsy of another yellow fever patient showed that there was preservation of the parenchymal surface, showing only an irregular and hemorrhagic area in the upper pole of the left kidney, and a 1.5-cm cyst on the anterior face of the right kidney. The microscopic analysis revealed multiple interstitial nephritis foci, combined with fibrosis and tubular necrosis. Thrombosis and intraluminal inflammatory infiltrates were identified in the vessels. The suggestive zygomycotic finding was characterized as a typical fungal hypha (pauci-septated hyaline fungal hyphae with a lateral right-angle formation) in the intravascular and interstitial inflammatory foci. Moreover, multiple foci of hemorrhagic lesions and necrosis in the left adrenal gland were microscopically identified, while the right adrenal gland was normal
