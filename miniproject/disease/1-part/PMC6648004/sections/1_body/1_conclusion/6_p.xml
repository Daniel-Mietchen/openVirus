<p>Therefore, the spread of yellow fever disease can be controlled. However, once the disease is established, it is almost impossible to predict how severe it will be, especially because its first symptoms can mimic a number of respiratory, digestive and urinary non-severe infections

For this reason, we suggest that more studies on the kidney involvement in yellow fever and the early diagnosis of kidney damage should be carried out to minimize the most feared outcome, i.e., death, since the currently existing diagnostic tools neither help to avoid the severe stages of the disease
