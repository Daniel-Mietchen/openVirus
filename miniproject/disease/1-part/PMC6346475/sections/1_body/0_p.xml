<p>Zika virus, first isolated from a rhesus macaque (

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. The presence of a sylvatic cycle for Zika virus in Africa is supported by a seroprevalence of 0%â€“16% in African green monkeys (
 <italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic>) and vervet monkeys (
 <italic>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</italic>) (
