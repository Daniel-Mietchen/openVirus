<p>Because flavivirus antibodies are known to cross-react, these 6 samples were further examined for antibodies specific to the major known circulating flaviviruses in Malaysia, dengue virus serotypes 1 (DENV-1) and 2 (DENV-2), by FRNT
 <sub>50</sub>. A sample was considered to have evidence of Zika virus neutralizing antibody if the Zika virus PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> titer was ≥20 and DENV-1 and DENV-2 FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> titers were &lt;20 (2 samples) or if the Zika virus PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> titer was ≥20 and 4-fold greater than the DENV-1 and DENV-2 FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> titers (1 sample). Only 3 of 6 samples fulfilled these criteria; the remaining 3 contained detectable Zika virus, DENV-1, and DENV-2 antibodies, indicating past flavivirus infection of an indeterminate type. Thus, 3 (1.3%) of 234 samples were Zika virus seropositive, although we did not test for other flaviviruses.
