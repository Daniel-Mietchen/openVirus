  <p>Mechanism of ZIKV inhibition by long-term freeze-stored breast milk. (
   <bold>a</bold>) For cell treatment (cell), Vero E6 cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of breast milk, and thereafter inoculated with ZIKV MR766. For virion treatment (virion), ZIKV MR766 (1.58 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL) was incubated 1:1 for 10 min with 10-fold higher breast milk concentrations before the mix was diluted onto Vero E6 cells. Concentrations shown correspond to the final concentrations of milk (

   <italic>v</italic>) in cell culture. Then, 2 h after inoculation, the medium was changed and, 2 days later, the infection rates were determined by a cell-based immunodetection assay that enzymatically quantifies the flavivirus protein E. (
   <bold>b</bold>) ZIKV MR766 was incubated with PBS (90%), SDS (0.5%), Triton X-100 (1%) or milk (90%) for 1 h at 37 °C. Free (and released) RNA was incubated in buffer or degraded by RNase A (10 U) for 1 h at 37 °C. Remaining ZIKV RNA copy numbers were determined by RT-qPCR. (
   <bold>c</bold>) PBS or breast milk (5%) were incubated with ZIKV MR766 for the indicated time at room temperature before the mixture was inoculated onto Vero E6 cells. After 2 h, the medium was changed and, 2 days later, the infection rates were determined as described in (
   <bold>a</bold>). Infection data are normalized to infection rates in the absence of the respective sample. All data are represented as average values obtained from triplicates ± standard deviations.
