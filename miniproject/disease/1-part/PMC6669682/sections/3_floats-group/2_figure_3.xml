  <p>Effect of fractions derived from long-term freeze-stored breast milk on ZIKV infection. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Pooled long-term stored breast milk was defatted by centrifugation, the cream collected and resuspended in PBS at the original volume. The remaining skim milk was further ultracentrifuged to separate caseins from serum proteins. The casein-containing pellet was resuspended in PBS to the original volume and the supernatant (whey) collected. The breast milk and its components were then incubated on Vero E6 cells at indicated concentrations for 2 h. The medium was then replaced, and the cellular viability was determined 2 days later by CellTiter-Glo Assay. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Breast milk and its components were mixed 1:1 with ZIKV MR766 (1.58 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL) for 10 min before 10-fold dilution onto Vero E6 cells resulting in indicated concentrations. Then, 2 h after inoculation, the medium was changed and, 2 days later, the infection rates were determined by a cell-based immunodetection assay that enzymatically quantifies the flavivirus protein E. All data are normalized to values in the absence of the respective sample. Data are represented as average values obtained from triplicate infections ± standard deviations.
