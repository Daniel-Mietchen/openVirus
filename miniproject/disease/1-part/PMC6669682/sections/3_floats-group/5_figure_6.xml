  <p>Determination of the ZIKV titer after the incubation of the virions in breast milk at different temperatures. ZIKV MR766, GWUH, or PRV were spiked into buffer or fresh breast milk that was received from two donors resulting in 90% buffer or milk, respectively. Samples were then incubated at (
   <bold>a</bold>) 22 °C, (
   <bold>b</bold>) 37 °C, (
   <bold>c</bold>) 4 °C or (
   <bold>d</bold>) −20 °C for indicated time points up to 8 h (
   <bold>a</bold>+
   <bold>b</bold>) or 10 days (
   <bold>c</bold>+
   <bold>d</bold>), before the virus titer was determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> titration onto Vero E6 cells.
