<p>We found that fresh human breast milk obtained from individual donors does not affect ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f004">Figure 4</xref>), which was somewhat surprising given the numerous reports on antimicrobial activity of milk published so far [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the same milk samples gained potent anti-ZIKV activity upon storage for 0.5–10 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Anti-ZIKV activity varied greatly between donors and was affected by temperature and incubation times (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Some samples became antivirally active as quickly as after 30 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>c+d, donor 1+2), whereas others hardly inhibited infection after 10 h of incubation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>d, donor 3). Overall, the antiviral activity increased in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that the antiviral factor is generated over time. Surprisingly, however, after 10 h of incubation, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were not as low as for milk that was stored for more than 6 months at −20 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). This suggests that a continuous incubation might further increase milk’s antiviral activity, probably until a maximum activity is reached.
