<p>Besides determining the effect of milk on ZIKV infection, we also analyzed how milk affects ZIKV infectivity that was spiked into the body fluid, a setting which more closely reflects the in vivo situation. We observed a time- and donor-dependent reduction of viral titers by 1–2 orders of magnitude if milk/virus was incubated for more than 2 h at 37 °C, suggesting that similar rates of ZIKV inactivation may also occur in the mother. Incubation at 22 °C for the same period of time had no effect on viral titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>b), perhaps because lipases or other enzymes involved in the generation of the antiviral factor are inactive at this temperature. We also analyzed how storage of ZIKV contaminated milk in the fridge (4 °C) or freezer (−20 °C) affects viral titers. Interestingly, incubation at 4 °C for 2 days resulted in an entire loss of infectivity of the three ZIKV strains tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>c), with the exception of a small “blip” just above the detection limit observed for donor 5 at day 8 which disappeared again at day 10. These data confirm recent findings by Pfaender et al. showing effective inactivation of the African ZIKV strain MP-7051 and the Puerto Rican strain PRVABC59 in human breast milk under the same conditions [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and might be explained by the “cooling activation” of the lipases as already discussed [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Surprisingly, the incubation of the samples at −20 °C did not result in any loss of infectivity over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>d). This seems to be in contrast to the observations made above by mixing virus with milk that had been incubated before (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f003">Figure 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>). At −20 °C the integrity of micelles is damaged and the BSSL activated, resulting in lipases getting in contact to a large amount of lipids upon thawing. As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>c, long-term frozen milk inactivates ZIKV within 10–30 min. When performing experiments with milk that had been frozen up to 10 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>d) or long-term (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), this was the time frame of incubation with ZIKV before inoculation of cells. In the spiking setup (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>), ~2–3 log higher viral titers were mixed with milk, frozen for indicated time points, then thawed and immediately titrated and added to the cells, resulting in maximum concentrations of only 0.09% milk in cell culture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>d). Thus, the low milk concentration and short incubation time at temperatures higher than −20 °C might not have been sufficient to inactivate high titers of ZIKV. In future studies it would be interesting to clarify whether the antiviral factor is generated at −20 °C but exerts its antiviral activity at warmer temperatures. Such experiments might also help to confirm that the antiviral factor can be generated and be active at 4 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>c), and why this effect is not seen at 22 °C and only marginally at 37 °C.
