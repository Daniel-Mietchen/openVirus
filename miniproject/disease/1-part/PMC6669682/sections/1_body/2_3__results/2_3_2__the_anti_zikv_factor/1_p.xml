<p>To test whether milk acts on the virus or the cell, ZIKV was incubated with up to 20% of pooled breast milk for 10 min (“virion treatment”) and then added to cells, resulting in a 10-fold dilution of the inoculum, and final cell culture concentrations of up to 2% of milk. Simultaneously, Vero E6 cells were first incubated with breast milk at concentrations of up to 2% for 10 min, before ZIKV was added (“cell treatment”). Thus, in both treatments the final milk concentrations in cell culture are the same, however, due to virion pre-exposure with 10-fold higher concentrations different outcomes could arise if the antiviral factors target the virion. After 2 h, the supernatants were exchanged with fresh medium, and viral infection was quantified 2 days later. Under both conditions, milk inhibited ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). However, milk concentrations during virion treatment determined the magnitude of virus inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> virion: 0.27 ± 0.04%; IC
 <sub>50</sub> cell: 1.02 ± 0.09%), showing that the antiviral activity in milk is directed against the virus. We next analyzed whether milk may directly disrupt virion integrity, applying a protocol established for HCV [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In brief, virions were exposed to PBS, detergents SDS or Triton X-100, or pooled (stored) milk for one hour at 37 °C. Thereafter, a ribonuclease was added to degrade free genomic viral RNA released from destroyed virions. Next, ZIKV RNA (total and remaining) was quantified by RT-qPCR. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, comparable numbers of viral genome copies per mL (10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>9</sup>) were detected in all control samples, demonstrating that detergents or milk components do not interfere with RT-qPCR-based detection of viral genomes. RNase treatment, however, resulted in an almost entire loss of viral RNA when virions were exposed to breast milk (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Similarly, a more than 99% reduction in viral genome copies was determined upon detergent treatment. Next, we analyzed how fast ZIKV is inactivated by milk. We found that incubating ZIKV with 0.5% milk for only one minute did not reduce viral infectivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). However, infectivity decreased in a time-dependent manner and was lost entirely after 30 min of incubation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). These data show that the antiviral factor in breast milk interacts with Zika virions in a way that results in the rapid release of genomic RNA, which can only be achieved by physical destruction of the viral particles, explaining loss of infectivity.
