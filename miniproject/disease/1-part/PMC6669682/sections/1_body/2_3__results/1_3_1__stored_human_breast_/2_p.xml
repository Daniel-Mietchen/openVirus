<p>Initially, we used breast milk that was pooled from long-term frozen samples of four individual donors. Strikingly, thawed milk efficiently inhibited infection by the three ZIKV isolates with average IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of only 0.46 ± 0.03% milk during virion treatment (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00591">Figure S1</xref>a). The complete inhibition of ZIKV infectivity was achieved by only 1–2% of milk during virion exposure (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00591">Figure S1</xref>a), corresponding to final cell culture concentrations of 0.1–0.2% milk, which is far below the cytotoxic concentration (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00591">Figure S1</xref>b,c), concentrations of ≥0.5% of milk reduced the percentage of infected cells from 82% to below 1%. Similar results were obtained when analyzing the mean fluorescence intensities of the cultures (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). With little variation in the antiviral activity, all four samples completely inhibited viral infection at concentrations exceeding 0.3% during virion treatment (
