<p>Our finding that milk has potent anti-ZIKV activity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f003">Figure 3</xref>) was obtained with human breast milk that was stored and frozen at −20 °C for prolonged periods of time. To corroborate our results with fresh samples, milk was obtained from three nursing mothers and analyzed within 30 min after donation. Conversely, none of the fresh milk samples inhibited ZIKV, even at concentrations of up 50% during virion treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f004">Figure 4</xref>). We next studied whether storage of these fresh milk samples may result in a gain of anti-ZIKV activity. In fact, upon incubation at 37 °C for several hours, all milk samples reduced ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). We observed some donor variation, e.g., the milk of donor 1 and 2 became antivirally active already after 1–2 h whereas the milk of donor 3 inhibited ZIKV only when incubated for 8 hours or longer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). Similar results were obtained if milk was incubated at 22 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). We were then wondering how storage of milk at 4 °C would impact antiviral activity. Milk derived from donor 1 and 2 became slightly more antivirally active as compared to the 37 °C condition, however for donor 3 we observed an opposite effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). Finally, freezing milk at −20 °C resulted in slightly increased antiviral activities of donor 1, but not donor 2 and 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>d). Of note, none of the milk samples displayed cytotoxic effects at the concentrations and conditions tested, except for donor 2 at the highest dose upon 37 °C incubation for 8 h (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00591">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, fresh human milk does not affect ZIKV infection but its storage results in a donor- and time-dependent generation of factor(s) that inactivate ZIKV.
