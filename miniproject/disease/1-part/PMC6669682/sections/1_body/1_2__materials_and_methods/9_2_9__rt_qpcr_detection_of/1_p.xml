<p>To determine the amount of intact ZIKV virions and their destruction by breast milk or detergents, the total and virion-associated viral RNA was determined by qPCR, as previously described for HCV [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To this end, a ZIKV MR766 stock containing ~10
 <sup>10</sup> genomic RNA copies/mL was incubated with 90% PBS, 0.5% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, or 90% thawed breast milk for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, the free (and not virion protected) viral RNA of one aliquot of each sample was degraded by incubation with 10 U RNaseA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 1 h at 37 °C. As control (determining the total RNA), one aliquot was in parallel incubated with PBS. After treatment, the samples were analyzed for remaining RNA copy numbers. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using qScript™ XLT One-Step-RT-qPCR ToughMix
 <sup>®</sup> (Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, MA, USA). The final 20 µL RT-qPCR reaction mixture contained 5 µL RNA template, 10 pmol forward primer ZIKV-RKI-F (5’-ACGGCYCTYGCTGGAGC-3’, biomers.net, Ulm, Germany), 10 pmol reverse primer ZIKV-RKI-R (5’-GGAATATGACACRCCCTTCAAYCTAAG-3’; biomers.net, Ulm, Germany) and 3 pmol probe ZIKV-RKI-P (Fam-5’-AGGCTGAGATGGATGGTGCAAAGGG-3’-BMN-Q535; biomers.net, Ulm, Germany). The amplification was done under the following conditions, 10 min at 50 °C for RT reaction, 10 min at 95 °C for polymerase activation, followed by 40 cycles for 15 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 55 °C and 10 s at 72 °C.
