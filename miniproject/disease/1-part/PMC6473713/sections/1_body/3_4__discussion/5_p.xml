<p>One of the limitations of this study is the refusal of blood sample donation for diagnosis that has affected our sample size. Such refusal has been noted previously in the area [
 <xref rid="B31-tropicalmed-04-00043" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and requires public health campaigns to educate the local population about these infectious agents and encourage health care seeking behavioral change. Another limitation was our inability to run a full serotype analysis of DENV and investigating the co-infection possibility. In addition, this survey has been based on passive surveillance and only detected severe cases from healthcare centers. Further entomological, molecular, and phylogenetic investigations are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the risk factors influencing the emergence and outbreaks of dengue fever in the area. Furthermore, we highlight the need to improve the health and living conditions of people in refugee camps and the need for preventive measures against new and endemic arboviral diseases.
