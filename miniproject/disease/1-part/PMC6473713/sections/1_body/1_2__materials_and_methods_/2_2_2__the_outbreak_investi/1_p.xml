<p>An unusually high number of cases of non-malaria febrile illness were reported in the region in August 2015. Following a well-established case definition (Sudan Federal Ministry of Health) based on the clinical presentation, we identified suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever presenting to the health clinics of 29 refugee-camps in East, West, South, North, and Central Darfur states (

Blood samples were collected from patients as soon as they were identified as a suspected case and tested for the major arboviral infectious agents of dengue fever (DF), yellow fever (YF), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Crimean–Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Arboviral-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (IgM capture ELISA) were performed using commercially available kits and following manufacturer’s instructions (Panbio, Inverness Medical Innovations Australia Pty Ltd, Brisbane, Australia). Serologically positive samples were confirmed by using commercially available Real Time RT-PCR Kits (Shnaghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co.Ltd, Shanghai, China) following manufacturer’s guidelines. Due to limited blood samples and resources, using blood samples left from previous analyses, up to 5 DENV positive samples were pooled together for the DENV serotype analysis. All serological and molecular assays were done at the Sudan National Public Health Laboratory. This study has been done using clinical samples and data obtained during the outbreak and all personal identifiers have been excluded.
