<p>Human CMV is a highly prevalent β-herpes virus that establishes life-long latent infections. Around 40%–60% of young adults in developed countries are infected (

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Staras et al., 2006</xref>). CMV seroprevalence in developing countries is often higher, with 80%–90% of young adults seropositive (

Although inflationary T cells do not express classical exhaustion markers such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), they typically lose expression of costimulatory receptors CD27 and CD28 and gain expression of the inhibitory receptor killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) and the terminal differentiation marker CD57 (
