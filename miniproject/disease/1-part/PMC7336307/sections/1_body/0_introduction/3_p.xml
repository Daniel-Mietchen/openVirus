<p>Reduced vaccine responses are frequently observed in developing countries, with an increased burden of pathogen exposure thought to be one driving factor (

However, direct evidence of an association between pathogen exposure, altered immune phenotypes, and reduced vaccine responses is lacking. During the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, we conducted two Phase I clinical trials of the Ebola vaccine candidates chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 3 (ChAd3) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both expressing Zaire Ebola glycoprotein (EBO-Z;

 <sup>10</sup> viral particles of ChAd3–EBO-Z at day 0, boosted with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units of MVA–EBO-Z 1 wk later. This trial design provided a rare opportunity for direct comparison of vaccine immunogenicity in populations within a developed country and a developing country. We discovered a novel association between CMV-associated changes to the T cell repertoire and a reduction in Ebola vaccine responses in healthy young UK and Senegalese adults.
