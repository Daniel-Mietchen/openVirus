<p>The “cumulative pathogen exposure level” based on the number of seropositive results was increased in UK CMV

 <sup>−</sup> participants (median, 5;

 <sup>+</sup>KLRG1
 <sup>+</sup> CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells both had relatively low cumulative pathogen exposure levels (5 and 8) and relatively low titers of CMV IgG (18 and 21 standard units compared with the median of 26 standard units in the Senegalese cohort).
