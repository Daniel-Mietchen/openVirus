<p>As reported in the primary clinical trial results (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Venkatraman et al., 2018</xref>), vaccine-specific antibody responses were significantly lower in the Senegalese cohort than in the UK cohort at peak and late time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, when stratified by CMV serostatus, vaccine-specific antibody responses were significantly lower in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> than CMV
 <sup>−</sup> UK participants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>; P = 0.028). Senegalese participants, who were all CMV
 <sup>+</sup>, had vaccine-specific antibody responses that were comparable to those of UK CMV
 <sup>+</sup> participants (P = 0.52) but significantly lower than those of CMV
 <sup>−</sup> participants (P = 0.0032).
