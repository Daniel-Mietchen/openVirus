<p>Second, there is likely an effect of age (or length of CMV carriage). In contrast to studies in older adults, in which CMV has often been negatively associated with immune responses (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Derhovanessian et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), various studies in children and infants have demonstrated no effect or positive effects of CMV carriage (

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Holder et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">van den Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>), although CMV has also been associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis disease in infants (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Müller et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, the expansion of terminally differentiated CD57
 <sup>+</sup>CD27
 <sup>−</sup>CD28
 <sup>−</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> adults is not always apparent in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> infants, even when CD57
 <sup>−</sup>CD27
 <sup>−</sup>CD28
 <sup>−</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are expanded (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Miles et al., 2008</xref>). These cells are thought to accumulate with repeated antigen exposure and therefore expand over time in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> individuals (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Pourgheysari et al., 2007</xref>). These cells may play an active role in immunosuppression in an antigen-independent manner, as demonstrated recently (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Tovar-Salazar and Weinberg, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the T cell populations in our cohorts to determine if these cells were associated with the reduction in vaccine responses in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> individuals.
