<p>Chronic antigen stimulation in persistent viral infections can drive T cell exhaustion in addition to T cell senescence. These processes are distinct and are characterized by different sets of markers (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akbar and Henson, 2011</xref>). While exhausted T cells have a reduced proliferative potential, decreased cytotoxicity, and impaired cytokine secretion (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Wherry and Kurachi, 2015</xref>), senescent T cells are terminally differentiated with limited proliferative capacity but retain some (altered) functionality (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Strioga et al., 2011</xref>). CD57 and KLRG1 are commonly used markers of senescent T cells, while exhausted T cells generally express these at low levels (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Larbi and Fulop, 2014</xref>). Although T cells expanded in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> individuals have been shown to have low proliferative capacity and express senescence markers such as KLRG1 and CD57 (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Vieira Braga et al., 2015</xref>), they are not exhausted as they are still highly cytotoxic and produce Th1 cytokines in response to sporadic viral reactivation (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Klenerman and Oxenius, 2016</xref>). Although the expanded T cells in our cohorts express markers traditionally associated with senescence, it is unclear what the exact functional state of this subset is. Investigating the transcriptional profile of these cells could provide insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the association with reduced vaccine responses and would be a priority for future studies.
