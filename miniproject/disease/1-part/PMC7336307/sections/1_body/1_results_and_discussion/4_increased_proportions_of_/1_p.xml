<p>Expansions of such highly differentiated memory T cells have been associated with reduced vaccine responses in the elderly (

 <sup>+</sup> CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> young adults before MVA–EBO-Z vaccination was negatively associated with vaccine-specific antibody responses (Ebola GP–specific IgG at M+28) in both the UK and Senegalese cohorts (
