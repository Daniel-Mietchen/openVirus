<p>CMV-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are thought to play an important role in containing CMV infection, and in mouse models, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were abundant in infected peripheral tissues (

 <sup>+</sup> adults, which has also been reported in other studies (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2014</xref>), could be caused by a reduction in circulating CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells as they are recruited to peripheral sites of infection. As infected individuals age, multiple reactivation events over many decades cause a gradual expansion of CMV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which then become the prominent factor driving the CD4:CD8 ratio down (
