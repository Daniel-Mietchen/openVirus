<p>CMV has been linked to a decreased CD4:CD8 ratio and an associated reduction in responses to novel antigens in elderly populations (

 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>). This reversal of CD4:CD8 ratio appears to be predominantly driven by the expansion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells specific for CMV (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hadrup et al., 2006</xref>). However, in the younger adults in our study, CMV seropositivity was associated with a reduced frequency of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, while there was no significant difference in CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (

 <sup>+</sup> participants with low or inverted CD4:CD8 ratios (

 <sup>+</sup> participants had increased proportions of effector memory and TEMRA CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
