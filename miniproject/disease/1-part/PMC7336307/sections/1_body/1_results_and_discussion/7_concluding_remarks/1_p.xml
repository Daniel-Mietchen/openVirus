<p>These Ebola vaccine trials, run concurrently in healthy young UK and Senegalese adults, allowed for a direct comparison of vaccine immunogenicity in a developed country and a developing country. The results of this study suggest that high CMV seroprevalence may have a role in driving the reduced vaccine immunogenicity observed in some developing countries. This has important implications for future vaccine studies, particularly when comparing trial outcomes between populations with different CMV seropositivity rates. As is evident by recent epidemics of novel pathogens, including Ebola, it is of clear importance that young and older adults are able to mount an effective response to novel antigens. Therefore, our finding that CMV carriage was associated with a reduction in the response to a novel antigen in young adults implies that CMV might have a broader impact on public health than previously expected.</p>
