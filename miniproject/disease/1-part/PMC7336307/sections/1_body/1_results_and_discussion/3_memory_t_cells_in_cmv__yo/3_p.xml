<p>CMV
 <sup>+</sup> participants also had significantly increased frequencies of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells expressing both the terminal differentiation marker CD57 and the inhibitory receptor KLRG1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>; P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0029, respectively), which may further mark cells that have undergone a large number of divisions, have low proliferative potential, express senescence markers, and have reduced cytokine production capacity (

 <sup>−</sup>KLRG1

 <sup>+</sup>KLRG1

 <sup>+</sup> compared with CMV
 <sup>−</sup> participants (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the CMV
 <sup>+</sup> individuals (over 10% CD57
 <sup>+</sup>KLRG1
 <sup>+</sup> in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> compared with just 2.6% in CMV
 <sup>−</sup> individuals, although two individuals had an expansion of these cells despite being CMV
 <sup>−</sup>).
