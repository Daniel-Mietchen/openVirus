<p>Both CMV
 <sup>+</sup> UK and Senegalese participants had significantly increased frequencies (up to 10-fold higher) of total CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells lacking expression of CD27 and CD28 compared with CMV
 <sup>−</sup> participants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A–C</xref>). In some individuals, over 10% of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and 50% of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells did not express either CD27 or CD28. The frequency of CD27
 <sup>−</sup>CD28
 <sup>−</sup> T cells was also increased within effector memory T cell populations in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> individuals (
