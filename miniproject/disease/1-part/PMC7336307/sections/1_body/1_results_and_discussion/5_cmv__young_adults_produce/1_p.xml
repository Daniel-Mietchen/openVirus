<p>Analysis of antigen-specific T cell phenotype and function (by antigen-stimulated cytokine production or using peptide-MHC class I and II tetramers) is difficult in clinical trials due to the wide range of MHC haplotypes, specificity for different peptides and heterogeneous cytokine production by different T cell subsets. Therefore, an alternative assay measuring activation-induced markers (AIMs), was used to determine the frequency and phenotype of antigen-responsive cells samples from the UK cohort (
