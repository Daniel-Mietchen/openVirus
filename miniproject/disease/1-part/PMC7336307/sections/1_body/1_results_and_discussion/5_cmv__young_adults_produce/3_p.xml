<p>However, while the vaccine-specific T cell responses did not differ quantitatively between CMV
 <sup>−</sup> and CMV
 <sup>+</sup> individuals, there was a marked qualitative difference. In CMV
 <sup>+</sup> individuals, both the Ebola GP–specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells contained significantly higher proportions of CD57
 <sup>+</sup>KLRG1
 <sup>+</sup> cells than in CMV
 <sup>−</sup> participants. This was particularly pronounced in the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> subsets, in which 19% were CD57
 <sup>+</sup>KLRG1
 <sup>+</sup> in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> participants compared with 5% in CMV
 <sup>−</sup> participants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>; P = 0.029 for CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and P = 0.0003 for CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells). Additionally, the proportions of CD57
 <sup>+</sup>KLRG1
 <sup>+</sup> cells within both the Ebola GP–specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were negatively associated with IFN-γ and IL2 responses to GP (

 <sup>+</sup> individuals.
