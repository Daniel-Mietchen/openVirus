<p>The proportion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells expressing OX40 and CD25 in response to stimulation with vaccine antigen (Ebola GP) or CMV (pp65) was assessed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). Background levels of expression in unstimulated cells were low (median 0.123%; interquartile range [IQR], 0.069%–0.313% for CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and 0.031%; IQR, 0.017%–0.044% for CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells). Significant CMV-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses were detected in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> participants compared with CMV
 <sup>−</sup> participants, in whom the proportion of AIM
 <sup>+</sup> cells in the CMV pp65 stimulation was comparable to background. The frequency of Ebola GP–specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells 7 d after MVA boost was comparable in CMV
 <sup>+</sup> and CMV
 <sup>−</sup> individuals, although some CMV
 <sup>+</sup> individuals had lower GP-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses (CD4
 <sup>+</sup>: median 0.853% for CMV
 <sup>−</sup> and 0.870% for CMV
 <sup>+</sup>; CD8
 <sup>+</sup>: median 0.731% for CMV
 <sup>−</sup> and 0.329% for CMV
 <sup>+</sup>).
