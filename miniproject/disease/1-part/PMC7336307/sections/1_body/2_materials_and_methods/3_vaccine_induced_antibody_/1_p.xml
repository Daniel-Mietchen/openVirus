<p>Antibody responses to vaccination were assessed using a standardized ELISA for total IgG against trimeric Zaire Ebola GP as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Venkatraman et al., 2018</xref>). A reference pool of positive serum was used to form a standard curve. Arbitrary ELISA units were calculated for each sample using the OD values of the sample and the parameters of the standard curve. All ELISAs were conducted by the same operator at the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford.
