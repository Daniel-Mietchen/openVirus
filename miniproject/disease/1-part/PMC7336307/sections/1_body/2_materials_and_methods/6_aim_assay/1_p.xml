<p>The AIM assay was conducted in a similar way to previously published work (

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Bowyer et al., 2018</xref>). PBMCs were thawed as for the T cell phenotyping assay. PBMCs were stimulated overnight (20 h at 37°C) with 1–2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per well in a 96-well U-bottom plate. Cells were either stimulated with 0.5 µg/ml of a pool of CMV pp65 peptides (PM-PP65-1; Cambridge Bioscience) or 2 µg/ml of Zaire Ebola GP peptides (Neoscientific). An unstimulated well and a positive control well stimulated with 1 µg/ml staphylococcal enterotoxin B were included for each sample. After overnight stimulation, cells were washed twice in FACS buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1% NaN
 <sub>3</sub>) and then stained for 20 min at RT with 100 µl per well of the following fluorescently conjugated antibodies: αCD45RA-eV605 (HI100, 1/200; eBioscience), αCD14-eF506 (61D3, 1/200; eBioscience), αCD19-eF506 (HIB19, 1/200; eBioscience), αCD4-APC-eF780 (RPA-T4, 1/100; eBioscience), αCD3-AF700 (UCHT1, 1/133; eBioscience), αOX40-PE/Cy7 (Ber-ACT35, 1/100; Biolegend), αCD25-FITC (M-A251, 1/100; BioLegend), αCD57-PE (HNK-1, 1/200; BioLegend), αKLRG1-BV421 (14C2A07, 1/66; BioLegend), αCD8-BV711 (RPA-T8, 1/400; BioLegend), and Aqua Live/Dead stain (1/2000). Cells were washed twice as before, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4°C, washed twice again, resuspended in 100 µl FACS buffer, and acquired immediately on a BD LSRII. Data analysis was conducted in FlowJo version 10.
