<p>Data are presented as medians and IQRs. Mann–Whitney analysis was used to compare CMV
 <sup>−</sup> and CMV
 <sup>+</sup> groups, and Kruskal–Wallis analysis with Dunn’s post-test was used for comparison across multiple groups. Spearman’s rank was used for linear regression analyses. An α-level of 0.05 was considered significant for all P values, and all tests were two-tailed. Analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism version 7.
