<p>T cell phenotyping was conducted in Oxford for all 16 UK volunteers and 27 Senegalese volunteers for whom there were cryopreserved cells available. PBMCs were thawed and rested for 2 h at 37°C in 2.5 µl/ml Benzonase Endonuclease (E1014-25KU; Sigma-Aldrich). One to two million PBMCs for each individual were stained in 50 µl in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature (RT) with the Live/Dead Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) then surface stained at RT with CD14-eF506 (61D3, 1/50; eBioscience), CD19-eF506 (HIB19, 1/50; eBioscience), CD45RA-eV605 (HI100, 1/50; eBioscience), CD27-BV711 (O323, 3/50; BioLegend), CD28-BV421 (CD28.2, 1/50; BioLegend), CD4-APC (RPA-T4, 1/50; eBioscience), CD3-AF700 (UCHT1, 1/50; eBioscience), CD8-APC-AF780 (RPA-T8, 3/50; eBioscience), CCR7-FITC (G043H7, 1/50; BioLegend), CD57-PerCP-Cy5.5 (HNK-1, 1/50; BioLegend), and KLRG1-PE (14C2A07, 3/50; BioLegend). Cells were acquired immediately using a BD LSRII. Data analysis was conducted in FlowJo version 10.1 (Treestar Inc). Gating strategy is shown in
