<p>Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma from two Phase I clinical trials were used in this study. The UK cohort consisted of the 16 volunteers in group 2 from EBL04 (ClinicalTrials.gov registration ref: NCT02451891), and the Senegalese cohort consisted of all 40 volunteers in EBL06 (NCT02485912). The UK study was conducted in healthy adults aged 18–50 yr (average age, 33 yr) at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford, UK. The Senegalese study was conducted in healthy adults aged 18–50 yr (average age, 28 yr) at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire le Dantec, Dakar, Senegal. All volunteers received 3.6 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> viral particles of ChAd3–EBO-Z followed by 1.0 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units of MVA–EBO-Z 7 d later. Both vaccinations were delivered intramuscularly into the deltoid region of the arm. Further details of both studies can be found in the clinical trial paper (
