<p>Multiplex serology is a fluorescent bead-based high-throughput method allowing the simultaneous measurement of serum antibodies against a variety of pathogen-specific antigens (

 <italic>H. pylori, Chlamydia trachomatis, Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, human polyomaviruses BK, JC, and MC, HIV 1, and human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 were measured in the UK and Senegalese cohorts as previously described (

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and in situ purified on fluorescent beads. Individual bead sets are differentially colored and distinguishable using a Luminex 200 flow cytometer. Each antigen was loaded onto one glutathione casein–coated bead set. In addition, glutathione-S-transferase was loaded onto one bead set for background subtraction. Antigen-loaded bead sets were combined into one bead mix and incubated with serum (final serum dilution, 1:1,000). Immunocomplexes consisting of primary serum antibodies bound to a pathogen-specific antigen were detected using a biotinylated IgG/IgM/IgA secondary antibody and streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin as a reporter dye. Antibody reactivities were quantified using a Luminex 200 flow cytometer as median fluorescence intensities from at least 100 beads per bead set and serum.
