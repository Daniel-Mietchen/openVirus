   <sup>+</sup> and CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells were gated in the order shown. Gates for different memory populations based on expression of CCR7, CD45RA, KLRG1, CD57, CD27, or CD28 as shown were then applied to each of the subsets depending on the analysis being conducted. EM, effector memory; FSC-A, forward scatter area; FSC-H, forward scatter height; SSC-A, side scatter area.
