<p id="par0135">Demographic reconstruction of the viral effective population sizes (N
 <sub>e</sub>) of each genotype within E/SE Asia reveals strikingly similar patterns: two periods of epidemic growth interspersed with an approximately two-year period of stasis (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Peaks are apparent for both genotypes around 2011, whereas growth phases are observed from 2005 to 2007 and from 2009-2011. While improved sampling could underlie this sharp increase, it also coincides with the period in which several Asian countries experienced rubella epidemics (supplementary Fig. 1a). Broad concordance between peaks in total incidence and N
 <sub>e</sub> are observed, particularly for genotype 2B (
