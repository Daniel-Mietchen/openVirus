<p id="par0110">Few direct transitions between India and E/SE Asia are observed, suggesting that viral exchange is minimal; with the exception of the early Asia lineage (clade 5), all groups of E/SE Asian sequences evolved from an ancestor predicted to have existed outside of Asia. However, sparse sampling from more recent outbreaks in India could potentially bias this conclusion as the majority of sequences from India were sampled from 2004-2008. As a populous country with low vaccination coverage (
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Dewan and Gupta, 2012</xref>), the existence of a sustained epidemic trough post-2008 is unlikely. However, the presence of two Indian sequences from 2011 and 2013 which cluster with others from outside of E/SE Asia supports the conclusion of limited direct viral exchange.
