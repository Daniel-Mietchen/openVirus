<p id="par0105">The common ancestor of all sampled global lineages existed in India in the late 1990s (mean: 1999.3; HPDI 1998.33–2000.15) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). However, this could be biased if few locations were sampled during this period; according to the World Health Organization, reporting of rubella cases in many countries did not start until 2005 (supplementary Fig. 1). Genotype 2B circulates widely throughout the region, as evidenced by the large multi-national clade containing many E/SE Asian sequences from the 2011–2014 epidemics (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b, clade 1). Similar to the pan-Asia lineage of genotype 1E, sequences cluster by outbreak and country. Correspondingly, there is no evidence for long-term persistence of country-specific lineages. The existence of a distantly-related Asian clade predating the 2011–2014 epidemics (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b, clade 5), and the probable placement outside of Asia of the ancestor of all E/SE Asian sequences in clade 1 (posterior: 0.65) suggests that the recent outbreaks were caused by a lineage newly introduced from outside the region, rather than by an E/SE Asian lineage that persisted across inter-epidemic periods. In total, we identified five well-supported clades, all of which contain sequences from within and outside of Asia. Further, there is strong support for the progenitors of each of these clades to have existed outside of E/SE Asia, indicating that historic circulation of genotype 2B was maintained by introductions from outside the region.
