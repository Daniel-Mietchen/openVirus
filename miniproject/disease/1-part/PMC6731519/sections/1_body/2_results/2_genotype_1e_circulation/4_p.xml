<p id="par0095">Clade 2 contains sequences from multiple countries in and outside of Asia and is characterized by internal clusters with high posterior support (&gt;0.9) that are hierarchically organized by date and country; sequences from similar epidemic periods tend to cluster together and, within these clusters, group by country. This pattern is consistent with intermittent introductions over time. In contrast, finer subdivisions within the Chinese lineage (clade 1) are not well-supported, indicating continuous evolution and persistence of the Chinese 1E lineage throughout China. Clade 2 appears to have descended from an ancestor that originally circulated in China prior to late 2002 before spreading to Taiwan (mean: 2002.73; HPDI: 2001.52â€“2003.77). The lineage was detected continuously in Taiwan until around mid-2009, when it began to appear elsewhere in Asia.</p>
