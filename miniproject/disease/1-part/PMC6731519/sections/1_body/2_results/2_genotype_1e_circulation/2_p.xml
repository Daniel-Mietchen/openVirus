<p id="par0085">The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all lineages currently circulating in Asia can be traced back to a common ancestor that existed in China in the late 1990s (mean: 1999.02; highest posterior density interval (HPDI): 1997.77–2000.08) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a ). Two major, well-supported lineages containing sequences from Asia are evident: one that became dominant in China (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, clade 1) and one that spread to multiple countries after a period of prolonged circulation in Taiwan (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, clade 2). The remaining clades (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, clades 3–9) are composed exclusively of sequences from outside Asia and are geographically segregated (Russia/Eastern Europe, Africa/Middle East, France). Genotype 1E therefore appears to persist in Asia without continual introductions from outside the region; viral exchange between Asia and the outer world was limited to movement from Asia to other continents.
