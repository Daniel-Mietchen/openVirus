<p id="par0090">Clade 1, a large clade of primarily Chinese sequences, corresponds to the previously identified Chinese 1E lineage (
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). In line with previous estimates, we identified a divergence time of 2000.4 (HPDI: 1999.53â€“2001.04). Sequences from Japan, Taiwan, and outside Asia are interspersed throughout the clade but do not cluster together, signifying frequent but sporadic exports from China. The reconstructed ancestral location of four multi-national clusters lies in Taiwan.
