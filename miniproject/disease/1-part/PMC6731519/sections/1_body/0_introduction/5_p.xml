<p id="par0045">Rubella is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family. RNA viruses are often amenable to phylogenetic analysis, as their evolutionary dynamics occur on the same time scale as their ecological dynamics (
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Grenfell et al., 2004</xref>). Although only one serotype exists, the CDC has identified two groups of rubella viruses consisting of ten and three genotypes, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2013</xref>). These genotypes are immunologically identical in terms of both natural infection and vaccination. While the genome comprises approximately 10 kb, genotyping is based on a 739 base pair window of the E1 structural protein, which contains antigenic sites and other important functional domains necessary for cellular invasion (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Banatvala and Peckham, 2007</xref>). Intraspecific genotypic variation is approximately 5% across genotypes of group 1 and 8% for group 2; maximum variation between groups 1 and 2 is 8–10%. Such genotype classifications are an essential component of virological surveillance and are used primarily to determine whether outbreaks are due to endemic circulation or importation events. Of those genotypes that are currently active, 1E, 1 G, and 2B have achieved the broadest global distributions (
