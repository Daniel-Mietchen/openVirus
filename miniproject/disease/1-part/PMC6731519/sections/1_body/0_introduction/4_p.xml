 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Winter et al., 2018</xref>). Data from East and Southeast (E/SE) Asia are incomplete but suggest that a mixture of these patterns is observed (supplementary Fig. 1). From 2011–2014, multiple countries in E/SE Asia, including those reporting high vaccine coverage rates, were affected by a large outbreak, suggesting a degree of regional synchronization. Our understanding of rubella persistence will be strengthened by characterizing the extent to which dynamics within countries are mediated by epidemics occurring in neighboring countries as well as outside the region. Furthermore, the dynamics of susceptibility play an integral role, as outbreaks can only occur where sufficient numbers of susceptible individuals are present. Inferring susceptibility is complex for pathogens with waning immunity, or complex cross-immunity (e.g. influenza), but as rubella infection and vaccination are completely immunizing, estimation of the size of the susceptible population becomes relatively tractable (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Bjørnstad et al., 2002</xref>) with knowledge on the size of unvaccinated birth cohorts. Characterizing susceptible dynamics will improve our understanding of rubella persistence and may contribute to optimizing public health intervention measures.
