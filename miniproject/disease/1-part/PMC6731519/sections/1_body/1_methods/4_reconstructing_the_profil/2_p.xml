<p id="par0080">Susceptible populations in countries from which sequences were available were reconstructed using data on vaccination rates and birth rates to predict the size of the unvaccinated birth cohorts (see supplementary material). These were further depleted based on reported incidence using a previously developed framework for modelling natural infection (
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>). From this, we estimated the proportion of susceptible individuals within each country; this eases comparison of countries of such different sizes, but is also likely to be epidemiologically relevant as transmission of directly-transmitted childhood infections often scales in a frequency dependent fashion (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Bjørnstad et al., 2002</xref>). Estimated coverage achieved in rubella vaccination programs, timing and age range of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs; wide age-range campaigns that occur at intervals of 2–4 years), and time-series of rubella incidence are publicly available from the World Health Organization (
