<p id="par0055">Rubella virus sequences were downloaded from NCBI Genbank in September 2016 (
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2019</xref>). We limited our search to sequences from 2000 to 2016 for which a country and date of collection were available. We did not limit our search by demography, so adult, child and CRS cases were all potentially represented in the analysis; not all sequences could be classified demographically due to the limited information available from Genbank. Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program in Geneious v5.6.7 (
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Kearse, 2012</xref>), and those that did not map to the 739bp window used for rubella genotype identification (
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2005</xref>) were discarded. For the majority of sequences, Genbank provided additional information on either the province or city from which the sample was collected. Separate datasets were created for genotypes 1E and 2B, and each dataset was randomly down-sampled so that no city or province was represented by more than one sequence per year in countries with greater than 50 sequences available (supplementary Table 1). In total, we retained 491 sequences matching our criteria that mapped to the 739bp identification window for genotype 1E and 743 sequences for genotype 2B. In the subsampled datasets, we included 226 sequences from genotype 1E and 250 sequences from genotype 2B. We created and analyzed three versions of each dataset to ensure that our results were robust to differences introduced by the random sampling of sequences (supplementary Table 2). The phylogenies from each of the three subsampled datasets were qualitatively similar for each genotype (supplementary Figs. 2â€“3).
