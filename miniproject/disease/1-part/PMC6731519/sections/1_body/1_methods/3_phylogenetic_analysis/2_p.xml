 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2013</xref>) for spatial locations using the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) procedure (
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Lemey et al., 2009</xref>) to identify significant connections. For the BSSVS analysis, a 50% prior probability of identifying no well-supported connections is assumed. The expected numbers of transitions between location states and the timing of these events were calculated using a robust counting procedure (

 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). For each dataset, three MCMC chains were run for 100 million generations, subsampled every 10,000 steps, and the first 1000 trees were discarded as burn-in. Convergence was assessed using the program Tracer v1.6, to ensure that all estimated parameters had effective sample sizes (ESS) greater than 200. In the case of runs for which ESS values were between 150–200, multiple chains were combined using LogCombiner. Maximum clade credibility trees for each of the sample datasets were produced using TreeAnnotator v1.8.4.
