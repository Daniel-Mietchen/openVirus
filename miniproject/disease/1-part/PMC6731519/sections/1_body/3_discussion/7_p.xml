<p id="par0165">The observed simultaneous increases in the effective population size of both genotypes is striking given that rubella virus immunity is completely cross-protective. Previous work has shown that the interpretation of viral effective population size estimates drawn from Bayesian coalescent skyline techniques should focus on changes over time, as observed increases in N
 <sub>e</sub> correlate best with increases in incidence at the start of an epidemic (
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Frost and Volz, 2010</xref>). The synchronized phases of exponential viral population growth (2005–2007 and 2009–2011) that coincide with the two epidemic periods observed in the WHO case reports are evidence that both genotypes simultaneously circulated and contributed to epidemics in the region. This is surprising for a fully cross-immunizing infection, as it suggests that the entire E/SE Asia region is nearly in phase. While we would not expect two consecutive years of viral population growth during any single rubella epidemic in a given location, closely synchronized outbreaks across multiple countries could appear as consecutive years of growth when taken together. Two scenarios may be invoked as an explanation for epidemic synchronization across the region.
