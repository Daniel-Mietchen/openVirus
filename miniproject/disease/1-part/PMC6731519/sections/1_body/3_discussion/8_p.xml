<p id="par0170">First, a country or city might act as a major pulse driver, akin to that of London for pre-vaccination measles epidemics in the United Kingdom (
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Grenfell et al., 2001</xref>). However, this scenario would require that only one major location play a key role and that sink populations are only weakly connected such that rescue effects after epidemic extinction are rare. These conditions are unlikely, given that many cities are above the critical community size for maintaining persistent rubella circulation (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Metcalf et al., 2013</xref>) and that high international connectivity in E/SE Asia has been cited as a possible explanation for the persistence of other viruses (
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2008</xref>). However, we find strong evidence that China functions as a source population for genotype 1E. Given that we also did not find support for repeated introductions from outside Asia for this genotype, there is a possibility that epidemiological dynamics in China drive the regional spread of genotype 1E.
