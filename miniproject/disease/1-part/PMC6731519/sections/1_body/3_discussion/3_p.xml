<p id="par0145">While other studies have looked at global rubella circulation, our study focuses on regional spread in an area of endemic transmission. Our results suggest that metapopulation dynamics are integral to the persistence of the virus, as lineages tend to circulate continuously across the region without a strong signal of spatial isolation within countries between epidemics. Although clear source and sink populations were evident for genotype 1E and, to some extent, genotype 2B, we also identified widely distributed lineages that were introduced from outside Asia. However, we were not able to identify any strong predictors of viral diffusion throughout the region for either of the genotypes we studied. Although geographic proximity appeared to be weakly correlated with viral diffusion, this relationship was erratic among the two genotypes. This finding was likely spurious as distance is probably a poor measure for the connections that are relevant to rubella spread. Our finding that viral persistence is maintained through a complex, lineage-specific circulation network is similar to that described for other childhood diseases in the E/SE Asia region, notably enterovirus A71 (

Limited viral exchange occurred between India and E/SE Asia over the period of our study, an observation likely due to cultural differences across the Asian continent. Owing to historical events, India is more strongly connected through travel and immigration with countries in Europe, North America and, more recently, the Middle East (

As very few sequences are available from the Middle East and other countries in Western Asia and the Pacific where large populations of Indian immigrants reside, we cannot say at this time whether these connections are relevant to the spread of rubella. It presents an interesting avenue for future research, in particular because of observed differences in epidemic dynamics between India and the Asia-Pacific region for other infectious diseases (
