<p id="par0155">While China’s importance is easily explained by its large population size, relatively recent introduction of routine rubella vaccination, and prevalence of travel connections, our finding of Taiwan’s role as a significant disseminator of infection (also suggested previously (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Cloete, 2014</xref>)) is less obvious. Rubella is a notifiable disease in Taiwan and a subset of sequences collected from 2005 to 2013 have been well characterized epidemiologically. Many of these sequences were traced to importation events from Vietnam, and to a lesser extent Malaysia, Thailand and China, while other outbreaks that were untraceable in origin occurred within immigrant communities (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). Although our phylogenetic analysis identifies Taiwan as an ancestral location, an alternative explanation is that the high intensity of surveillance could lead to outbreaks being identified earlier here than in the countries from which they originated. Under this hypothesis and coupled with reported vaccination rates of greater than 90% since 2000, Taiwan is likely not an actual source of infection; instead, Taiwan probably acts as a sentinel for the rest of the region.
