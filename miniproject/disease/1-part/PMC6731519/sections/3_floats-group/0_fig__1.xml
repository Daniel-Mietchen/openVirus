 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees for a) genotype 1E and b) genotype 2B. Branch colors represent the most probable location state of the lineage at that time. Posterior support values indicated for each of the identified clades. X-axis represented in years. Branch widths sized according to posterior probability, where thicker branches indicate greater posterior support. Clades shaded in grey represent continuous transmission of a lineage outside of Asia. Interior nodes are colored based on their inferred geographic location and sized by the posterior support for this placement, where larger circles indicate greater posterior support.</p>
