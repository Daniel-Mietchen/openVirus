Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, rubella virus continues to circulate endemically in several regions of the world. This is particularly true in East and Southeast (E/SE) Asia, where control efforts vary widely among countries that are well connected through travel and immigration. It is therefore important to understand how the regional persistence of rubella is affected both by dynamics occurring across countries and susceptibility within countries. Here, we use genetic and epidemiological data from countries in E/SE Asia to explore the phylogeography of rubella virus in this region. Our results underline that metapopulation dynamics are key for rubella persistence and highlight the source-sink population structure of the region. We identify countries that contribute to the regional metapopulation network and link epidemic dynamics to susceptibility profiles within each country.

A safe and inexpensive vaccine that confers complete immunity has been available since the 1970s (<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Plotkin, 2006</xref>); it is currently part of the routine immunization program in 159 countries worldwide (<xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>) and has considerably restricted the previously global reach of this pathogen. However, although the virus has been eliminated from the Americas and burdens have been drastically reduced in many developed countries, the WHO still estimates that over 100,000 babies/year are born with congenital rubella syndrome worldwide (<xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">Vynnycky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>).

As global connectedness grows, it is increasingly apparent that an understanding of how human mobility drives the spread of infectious diseases is necessary to predict and control outbreaks of novel or reintroduced pathogens, especially in a context of growing but incomplete vaccination coverage. The identification of genotypes and/or serologically different viral strains with divergent geographic distributions can be used to distinguish new introductions from ongoing but unobserved circulation (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Icenogle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Rivailler et al., 2017</xref>). To our knowledge, just a single study has addressed global diffusion of rubella (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Cloete, 2014</xref>); findings indicated that infection tends to flow out from regions of low vaccination coverage, education index and income rather than necessarily between regions in close geographic proximity. While this result is expected at broad global scales, it is not clear that these patterns will hold at finer spatial resolutions, particularly in regions of Asia where geographically adjacent countries that are strongly connected through travel and immigration have highly variable levels of vaccination coverage.</p><p id="par0040">While countries such as Japan introduced the rubella vaccine to adolescent school girls as early as 1977 (<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Terada, 2003</xref>), populous countries like China and Vietnam only included it in their routine childhood immunization schedule in 2008 and 2015, respectively (<xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Gavi TVA, 2019</xref>). Theory (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Bauch and Earn, 2003</xref>) and observation indicate that, for rubella, peaks in incidence occurring annually (<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Metcalf et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Metcalf et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Metcalf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">Wesolowski et al., 2016</xref>) or every five years (<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Terada, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and May, 1991</xref>) are expected in the absence of vaccination, and that erratic transient outbreaks should occur following incomplete introduction of the vaccine (<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Lessler and Metcalf, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Winter et al., 2018</xref>). Data from East and Southeast (E/SE) Asia are incomplete but suggest that a mixture of these patterns is observed (supplementary Fig. 1). From 2011&#x02013;2014, multiple countries in E/SE Asia, including those reporting high vaccine coverage rates, were affected by a large outbreak, suggesting a degree of regional synchronization. Our understanding of rubella persistence will be strengthened by characterizing the extent to which dynamics within countries are mediated by epidemics occurring in neighboring countries as well as outside the region. Furthermore, the dynamics of susceptibility play an integral role, as outbreaks can only occur where sufficient numbers of susceptible individuals are present. Inferring susceptibility is complex for pathogens with waning immunity, or complex cross-immunity (e.g. influenza), but as rubella infection and vaccination are completely immunizing, estimation of the size of the susceptible population becomes relatively tractable (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Bj&#x000f8;rnstad et al., 2002</xref>) with knowledge on the size of unvaccinated birth cohorts. Characterizing susceptible dynamics will improve our understanding of rubella persistence and may contribute to optimizing public health intervention measures.</p><p id="par0045">Rubella is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family. RNA viruses are often amenable to phylogenetic analysis, as their evolutionary dynamics occur on the same time scale as their ecological dynamics (<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Grenfell et al., 2004</xref>). Although only one serotype exists, the CDC has identified two groups of rubella viruses consisting of ten and three genotypes, respectively (<xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2013</xref>). These genotypes are immunologically identical in terms of both natural infection and vaccination. While the genome comprises approximately 10&#x0202f;kb, genotyping is based on a 739 base pair window of the E1 structural protein, which contains antigenic sites and other important functional domains necessary for cellular invasion (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Banatvala and Peckham, 2007</xref>). Intraspecific genotypic variation is approximately 5% across genotypes of group 1 and 8% for group 2; maximum variation between groups 1 and 2 is 8&#x02013;10%. Such genotype classifications are an essential component of virological surveillance and are used primarily to determine whether outbreaks are due to endemic circulation or importation events. Of those genotypes that are currently active, 1E, 1&#x0202f;G, and 2B have achieved the broadest global distributions (<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Rivailler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Abernathy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Mulders et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="par0050">In this study, we aimed to assess the importance of metapopulation dynamics to rubella persistence in E/SE Asia. We used publicly available genetic sequences to map pathways of regional spread from 2000 to 2016 and identify countries that act as sources and sinks of viral diffusion. We compared the dynamics of the two most commonly sampled genotypes in Asia, 1E and 2B (<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Mulders et al., 2016</xref>), and found that, despite being immunologically identical, their circulation patterns differ. Our results suggest that there are identifiable sources and sinks for rubella, but that the directionality of spatial spread may be primarily governed by stochasticity and founder effects. We additionally estimated country-specific susceptibility profiles to link temporal trends in rubella incidence and susceptible population size with the timing of viral importation and exportation events. Finally, we discuss limitations arising from analyzing spatially and/or temporally biased samples, a common challenge with studies of this scope.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Sequence data</title><p id="par0055">Rubella virus sequences were downloaded from NCBI Genbank in September 2016 (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2019</xref>). We limited our search to sequences from 2000 to 2016 for which a country and date of collection were available. We did not limit our search by demography, so adult, child and CRS cases were all potentially represented in the analysis; not all sequences could be classified demographically due to the limited information available from Genbank. Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program in Geneious v5.6.7 (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Kearse, 2012</xref>), and those that did not map to the 739bp window used for rubella genotype identification (<xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2005</xref>) were discarded. For the majority of sequences, Genbank provided additional information on either the province or city from which the sample was collected. Separate datasets were created for genotypes 1E and 2B, and each dataset was randomly down-sampled so that no city or province was represented by more than one sequence per year in countries with greater than 50 sequences available (supplementary Table 1). In total, we retained 491 sequences matching our criteria that mapped to the 739bp identification window for genotype 1E and 743 sequences for genotype 2B. In the subsampled datasets, we included 226 sequences from genotype 1E and 250 sequences from genotype 2B. We created and analyzed three versions of each dataset to ensure that our results were robust to differences introduced by the random sampling of sequences (supplementary Table 2). The phylogenies from each of the three subsampled datasets were qualitatively similar for each genotype (supplementary Figs. 2&#x02013;3).</p><p id="par0060">Sequences collected from within Asia were geo-referenced by country, and sequences from outside Asia were collectively categorized as &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d;.

For the BSSVS analysis, a 50% prior probability of identifying no well-supported connections is assumed. The expected numbers of transitions between location states and the timing of these events were calculated using a robust counting procedure (<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Minin and Suchard, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). For each dataset, three MCMC chains were run for 100 million generations, subsampled every 10,000 steps, and the first 1000 trees were discarded as burn-in. Convergence was assessed using the program Tracer v1.6, to ensure that all estimated parameters had effective sample sizes (ESS) greater than 200. In the case of runs for which ESS values were between 150&#x02013;200, multiple chains were combined using LogCombiner. Maximum clade credibility trees for each of the sample datasets were produced using TreeAnnotator v1.8.4.</p><p id="par0070">In order to identify well-supported connections between countries, Bayes factors were calculated in the spreaD3 program (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Bielejec et al., 2016</xref>).

The phylogenetic GLM assesses support for various ecological and sampling factors predicted to influence epidemic diffusion patterns across the phylogeny. We selected 16 different variables encompassing geographic, ecological, demographic, environmental and epidemiological differences between countries to include in the model (see supplementary material). To determine whether the set of variables driving diffusion over the entire 16-year period differed from that responsible for viral spread during the most recent epidemics, we performed the analysis on the dataset of sequences from E/SE Asia collected from 2000 to 2016, as well as the subset of these sequences collected during the height of the regional epidemics, which, according to our dataset, occurred from 2011 to 2015.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Reconstructing the profile of susceptibility</title><p id="par0080">Susceptible populations in countries from which sequences were available were reconstructed using data on vaccination rates and birth rates to predict the size of the unvaccinated birth cohorts (see supplementary material).

This pattern is consistent with intermittent introductions over time. In contrast, finer subdivisions within the Chinese lineage (clade 1) are not well-supported, indicating continuous evolution and persistence of the Chinese 1E lineage throughout China. Clade 2 appears to have descended from an ancestor that originally circulated in China prior to late 2002 before spreading to Taiwan (mean: 2002.73; HPDI: 2001.52&#x02013;2003.77).

The existence of a distantly-related Asian clade predating the 2011&#x02013;2014 epidemics (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b, clade 5), and the probable placement outside of Asia of the ancestor of all E/SE Asian sequences in clade 1 (posterior: 0.65) suggests that the recent outbreaks were caused by a lineage newly introduced from outside the region, rather than by an E/SE Asian lineage that persisted across inter-epidemic periods. In total, we identified five well-supported clades, all of which contain sequences from within and outside of Asia. Further, there is strong support for the progenitors of each of these clades to have existed outside of E/SE Asia, indicating that historic circulation of genotype 2B was maintained by introductions from outside the region.</p><p id="par0110">Few direct transitions between India and E/SE Asia are observed, suggesting that viral exchange is minimal; with the exception of the early Asia lineage (clade 5), all groups of E/SE Asian sequences evolved from an ancestor predicted to have existed outside of Asia. However, sparse sampling from more recent outbreaks in India could potentially bias this conclusion as the majority of sequences from India were sampled from 2004-2008. As a populous country with low vaccination coverage (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Dewan and Gupta, 2012</xref>), the existence of a sustained epidemic trough post-2008 is unlikely. However, the presence of two Indian sequences from 2011 and 2013 which cluster with others from outside of E/SE Asia supports the conclusion of limited direct viral exchange.</p><p id="par0115">Phylogeographic analysis of the circulation patterns of genotype 2B again suggests an important regional role for Taiwan (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b, supplementary Fig. 13). We find decisive support (BF&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;100) for movement from Taiwan to both China and Southeast Asia. Additional analyses of datasets containing only sequences from recent cases in Taiwan (occurring from 2010 to 2015) show that exportations from Taiwan scale with the number of recent sequences included in the analysis, suggesting high genetic diversity among recently sampled Taiwan sequences rather than a collection of highly homogenous sequences sampled from a few related outbreaks (see supplementary material). Bidirectional exchange between China and Japan is also strongly supported (BF&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;10) although few movements between these countries occurred. Again, far more importations than exportations are observed for Japan (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d, supplementary Fig. 11), and significant movement from Thailand to Japan is apparent (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b, supplementary Fig. 14). Viral exchange between India and countries outside of Asia is strongly supported (BF&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;100), though we find no significant connections between India and E/SE Asia, suggesting that India does not play a role in the E/SE Asia metapopulation. None of the 16 predictors included in the phylogenetic GLM were significantly correlated with viral diffusion when considering the entire period from 2000 to 2016 (supplementary Fig. 8). When considering only sequences collected during the recent epidemics from 2011 to 2015, geographic distance and destination country sample size were marginally significant (supplementary Fig. 9).</p></sec><sec id="sec0045"><label>3.3</label><title>Viral demography in the context of epidemiological dynamics</title><p id="par0120">WHO case data indicates that incidence increased in most of the focal countries between 2010 and 2015 (supplementary Fig. 1a). With the exception of Vietnam, all focal countries report coverage of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV1) to be above 90% by 2012 (supplementary Fig. 1b), suggesting a level of susceptibility well below the theoretical threshold necessary for elimination based on previous estimates of R<sub>o</sub> ranging from 3 to 8 (<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Metcalf et al., 2011b</xref>) and a vaccination coverage threshold of 80% (1-1/R<sub>0</sub> for R<sub>0</sub>&#x002dc;5). That rubella continues to circulate in many of these countries suggests uncertainty in reporting of coverage (<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Lessler et al., 2011</xref>) and/or heterogeneity underlying national coverage rates (<xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="par0125">For each of the focal countries, accumulations of susceptible individual precede each peak in reported cases (supplementary Fig. 1c). Apart from Thailand and Taiwan, heightened susceptibility between 2009 and 2014 was apparent. Although total proportion susceptible in Taiwan was consistently low, estimated accumulations of susceptible individuals occur around 1999 and 2006. In Thailand, the estimated proportion susceptible remained stable and relatively low throughout the entire period.</p><p id="par0130">Rubella importation can only be successful if sufficient susceptible individuals are present. The timing of viral importation events into each country appear to precede epidemic peaks (supplementary Fig. 4) and tend to occur during local peaks in susceptible population size (supplementary Fig. 5). For example, imports of genotype 2B into China are observed around 2006 and 2009, the times during which susceptible population size peaked just prior to each major outbreak. As the epidemiological data suggests that the susceptible population size in China falls after 2005 (supplementary Fig. 1c), we might expect that there are fewer opportunities for the introduction of new strains. However, if erratic local dynamics cause extinctions in areas where not enough susceptibles are present, susceptibles throughout China will eventually accumulate enough to allow new introductions. In support, the phylogeny suggests that introductions continued to happen in China across the time course of this study. Further, the small spike in introductions to China in 2009 coincides with an accumulation of susceptibles following the epidemic in 2008 even though the overall proportion susceptible is consistently decreasing (supplementary Fig. 5). As only 1&#x02013;2 epidemics occurred during the time period of study in each of the focal countries, we were unable to statistically test this observation, but in the context of the previously described phylogenetic patterns it is suggestive of the importance of metapopulation processes in the epidemic dynamics of rubella in this region.</p><p id="par0135">Demographic reconstruction of the viral effective population sizes (N<sub>e</sub>) of each genotype within E/SE Asia reveals strikingly similar patterns: two periods of epidemic growth interspersed with an approximately two-year period of stasis (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Peaks are apparent for both genotypes around 2011, whereas growth phases are observed from 2005 to 2007 and from 2009-2011. While improved sampling could underlie this sharp increase, it also coincides with the period in which several Asian countries experienced rubella epidemics (supplementary Fig. 1a). Broad concordance between peaks in total incidence and N<sub>e</sub> are observed, particularly for genotype 2B (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).<fig id="fig0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Viral effective population sizes (N<sub>e</sub>).

Our analysis indicates that circulation patterns may differ between rubella virus genotypes 1E and 2B. As no evidence of a substantial competitive advantage for either subtype exists to date, these differences therefore suggest that the current distributions are likely a product of stochastic forces and founder effects stemming from the timing of their initial invasion. We confirmed the presence of a major lineage of genotype 1E evolving in China and found evidence for an additional 1E lineage circulating throughout Asia. Although some exchange with countries outside of the region was apparent, recent genotype 1E circulation in Asia appears isolated from the rest of the world. In contrast, we found evidence for multiple, recent introductions of genotype 2B from outside of Asia, suggesting continual global exchange. There was a clear increase in the effective population size of each genotype just prior to the 2011&#x02013;2014 epidemics in Asia, suggesting that simultaneous outbreaks of both occurred. While China serves as a regional source population, particularly for genotype 1E, Taiwan likely acts as an important indicator for regional rubella activity across East and Southeast Asia. In line with high reported levels of vaccination coverage, we find that Japan is a regional sink. Further, India does not have strong epidemiological links to E/SE Asia.</p><p id="par0145">While other studies have looked at global rubella circulation, our study focuses on regional spread in an area of endemic transmission. Our results suggest that metapopulation dynamics are integral to the persistence of the virus, as lineages tend to circulate continuously across the region without a strong signal of spatial isolation within countries between epidemics. Although clear source and sink populations were evident for genotype 1E and, to some extent, genotype 2B, we also identified widely distributed lineages that were introduced from outside Asia. However, we were not able to identify any strong predictors of viral diffusion throughout the region for either of the genotypes we studied. Although geographic proximity appeared to be weakly correlated with viral diffusion, this relationship was erratic among the two genotypes. This finding was likely spurious as distance is probably a poor measure for the connections that are relevant to rubella spread. Our finding that viral persistence is maintained through a complex, lineage-specific circulation network is similar to that described for other childhood diseases in the E/SE Asia region, notably enterovirus A71 (<xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">Thao et al., 2017</xref>). Limited viral exchange occurred between India and E/SE Asia over the period of our study, an observation likely due to cultural differences across the Asian continent. Owing to historical events, India is more strongly connected through travel and immigration with countries in Europe, North America and, more recently, the Middle East (<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Naujoks, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2016</xref>). As very few sequences are available from the Middle East and other countries in Western Asia and the Pacific where large populations of Indian immigrants reside, we cannot say at this time whether these connections are relevant to the spread of rubella. It presents an interesting avenue for future research, in particular because of observed differences in epidemic dynamics between India and the Asia-Pacific region for other infectious diseases (<xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Pons-salort et al., 2015</xref>). Characterizing patterns such as the limited relevance of imports from India for re-introduction of rubella in E/SE Asia will become increasingly important as the region approaches rubella elimination.</p><p id="par0150">Given the introduction of rubella-containing vaccine to all children in Japan in 1989, Japan&#x02019;s role as a sink for viral importation is unsurprising. The outbreaks represented in this study occurred primarily among adult men that were not vaccinated during childhood (<xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka-Taya et al., 2013</xref>), as initial vaccination campaigns in Japan starting in 1977 only targeted adolescent schoolgirls (<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Terada, 2003</xref>). Though outbreaks in Japan continue to occur, the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1989 and the policy switch towards the targeting of infants and young children has resulted in epidemics of decreased magnitude (<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Terada, 2003</xref>) with an increased average age of infection (<xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">Sugishita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita and Nishiura, 2016</xref>). This, coupled with an increasing share of foreign residents immigrating from Southeast Asia (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Green, 2017</xref>), make Japan a prime location for the importation of viral lineages, an observation which, paradoxically, is a metric indicating successful control. It remains to be seen how rubella dynamics throughout the region will affect Japan as it continues to near elimination.</p><p id="par0155">While China&#x02019;s importance is easily explained by its large population size, relatively recent introduction of routine rubella vaccination, and prevalence of travel connections, our finding of Taiwan&#x02019;s role as a significant disseminator of infection (also suggested previously (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Cloete, 2014</xref>)) is less obvious. Rubella is a notifiable disease in Taiwan and a subset of sequences collected from 2005 to 2013 have been well characterized epidemiologically. Many of these sequences were traced to importation events from Vietnam, and to a lesser extent Malaysia, Thailand and China, while other outbreaks that were untraceable in origin occurred within immigrant communities (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). Although our phylogenetic analysis identifies Taiwan as an ancestral location, an alternative explanation is that the high intensity of surveillance could lead to outbreaks being identified earlier here than in the countries from which they originated. Under this hypothesis and coupled with reported vaccination rates of greater than 90% since 2000, Taiwan is likely not an actual source of infection; instead, Taiwan probably acts as a sentinel for the rest of the region.</p><p id="par0160">Reinforcing this, in addition to its well-established surveillance system which facilitates viral detection and characterization, there are multiple factors that predispose Taiwan to rubella importations. Past serological studies show that seronegativity is higher among immigrant women (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) and until 2002, Taiwan did not require proof of rubella vaccination upon immigration (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, 2019</xref>). Further, an increasing proportion of immigrants now come from nations in Southeast Asia, where endemic rubella transmission is still widespread and vaccination has only recently been introduced (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">Tsay, 2015</xref>). In addition, from 2006 to 2010, 15&#x02013;28% of Taiwanese men were married to foreign-born women, primarily from Southeast Asia (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, Taiwan has recently experienced an increase in international air travel. In 2014, 9.9 and 11.8 million people, respectively, travelled in to and out of the country and an estimated 84&#x02013;88% of these travelers either visited or visited from countries in E/SE Asia (<xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2016</xref>). While these patterns are unlikely to outweigh high vaccination coverage and result in Taiwan contributing importantly to regional dynamics, such high rates of immigration and international travel, coupled with its strong geopolitical ties to China, a clear source of rubella infection, makes Taiwan an ideal sentinel for the identification of new lineages in the region.</p><p id="par0165">The observed simultaneous increases in the effective population size of both genotypes is striking given that rubella virus immunity is completely cross-protective. Previous work has shown that the interpretation of viral effective population size estimates drawn from Bayesian coalescent skyline techniques should focus on changes over time, as observed increases in N<sub>e</sub> correlate best with increases in incidence at the start of an epidemic (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Frost and Volz, 2010</xref>). The synchronized phases of exponential viral population growth (2005&#x02013;2007 and 2009&#x02013;2011) that coincide with the two epidemic periods observed in the WHO case reports are evidence that both genotypes simultaneously circulated and contributed to epidemics in the region. This is surprising for a fully cross-immunizing infection, as it suggests that the entire E/SE Asia region is nearly in phase. While we would not expect two consecutive years of viral population growth during any single rubella epidemic in a given location, closely synchronized outbreaks across multiple countries could appear as consecutive years of growth when taken together. Two scenarios may be invoked as an explanation for epidemic synchronization across the region.</p><p id="par0170">First, a country or city might act as a major pulse driver, akin to that of London for pre-vaccination measles epidemics in the United Kingdom (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Grenfell et al., 2001</xref>). However, this scenario would require that only one major location play a key role and that sink populations are only weakly connected such that rescue effects after epidemic extinction are rare. These conditions are unlikely, given that many cities are above the critical community size for maintaining persistent rubella circulation (<xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Metcalf et al., 2013</xref>) and that high international connectivity in E/SE Asia has been cited as a possible explanation for the persistence of other viruses (<xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2008</xref>). However, we find strong evidence that China functions as a source population for genotype 1E. Given that we also did not find support for repeated introductions from outside Asia for this genotype, there is a possibility that epidemiological dynamics in China drive the regional spread of genotype 1E.</p><p id="par0175">The second scenario we envision to explain synchronized phases of viral growth emerges from extremely high regional connectivity. If the existence of a connection, rather than the magnitude of movement across that connection, is the chief predictor of outbreak timing, we might expect that an epidemic arising in one location will immediately ignite outbreaks in all connected populations whose susceptible population size is above the threshold necessary for a sustained epidemic to occur. Comparable seasonal travel patterns across settings (e.g. driven by similar timing of school holidays (<xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">Wesolowski et al., 2017</xref>)) will reinforce this alignment of timing, creating a positive feedback loop to further synchronize dynamics. Sporadic introductions from weakly connected locations that are not part of the core circulation network would then reseed epidemics once the pool of susceptibles has again reached an appropriate size. This scenario is consistent with our study, in that (1) the magnitude of connectivity measured by travel flows was not predictive of viral diffusion, (2) extensive travel and immigration ties exist between countries throughout the region and (3) repeated introductions from outside E/SE Asia were observed for genotype 2B.</p><p id="par0180">An inherent limitation of using publicly available data is the inevitability of skewed and potentially biased sampling. Sequences sourced from Genbank originate from multiple studies with different methodologies and different motivations for collection. As a result, the quantity of data publicly available from any single location or time period varies. The number of available sequences from Japan, Taiwan and China, where surveillance is more extensive, far exceeds that from countries in Southeast and South Asia, where rubella is often not a notifiable disease. Further, even in the most well sampled locations, sampling biases exist over both space and time. Despite our efforts to correct for this, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional, unsampled lineages circulate, or have circulated, in Southeast Asia and India where sampling is sparse. Further, our analysis does not account for viral exchange with countries from which no samples are present. The possibility therefore remains that other countries may also act as sources. Broader sampling throughout Asia, both in terms of locations represented and the quantity of sequences available, as well across the globe, particularly from rubella-endemic countries that lack access to vaccination, will further refine our understanding of rubella circulation and persistence. Literature on the historical genotypic characterization of global rubella viruses indicates that many subtypes and lineages have gone extinct from 1960 through to the present (<xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2013</xref>) and it remains to be seen whether, for example, the introduction of genotype 2B into China will lead to local extinction of genotype 1E. However, as sampling is not consistent or complete across this region, it is difficult to say with any certainty whether lineages have actually gone extinct, are still present at low levels, or are circulating in countries with minimal available data. Our results suggest that rubella lineages are not confined to specific countries and therefore that surveillance and elimination efforts must take into account the epidemiology of the region as a whole and population movements between countries in order to be successful.</p></sec><sec id="sec0055"><title>Ethics</title><p id="par0185">All genetic data were publicly available and anonymized; thus, this study did not require approval by an ethics committee or institutional review board.</p></sec><sec id="sec0060"><title>Data, code and materials</title><p id="par0190">Genbank accession numbers for all sequences used in this study can be found in supplementary table 2.</p></sec><sec id="sec0065"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="par0195">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec0070"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="par0200">B.A.B and C.J.E.M. conceived the analysis.
