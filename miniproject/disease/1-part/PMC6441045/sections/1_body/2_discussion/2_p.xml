<p id="Par20">We were not able to rule out the possibility that sources were indirectly linked to recipients through unobserved individuals (i.e. intermediate partners) with deep-sequence phylogenetic analysis. One third (161/537) of phylogenetically highly supported linkages were between individuals of the same  gender, in line with incomplete sequence coverage. We also found two pairs with phylogenetic patterns previously considered strong enough to virtually exclude the possibility of common sources or recipients, but in whom both individuals were female. These findings have important implications for criminal prosecution of people living with HIV in at least 72 countries with laws penalizing HIV transmission

 </sup>: even with deep-sequencing, transmission of HIV-1 cannot be proven between two individuals. Thus, communicating the limitations of deep-sequencing data is essential to prevent its misuse in criminal prosecutions. For example, we opted to visually interrupt linkages in phylogenetic transmission networks (Fig.
