<p id="Par7">Between August 2011 and January 2015, 25,882 individuals aged 15–49 years were surveyed in 40 communities of the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) in Uganda (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The survey included the four largest fishing sites along Lake Victoria because of their high population-level HIV prevalence (~40%)

 </sup> and hypothesized role in epidemic spread. 5142 participants were HIV-positive. Reflecting previous guidelines on initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the observation period, 3878 (75.4%) infected study participants reported no ART use at time of survey. Self-reported ART use was previously validated as a proxy for actual ART use

 </sup>, and 90% of individuals who reported using ART also had suppressed virus titres below 1000 copies per millilitre plasma blood
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. This prompted us to focus on viral sequencing among individuals who did not report ART use. Deep-sequencing of the virus genomes was performed on 3758/3878 (96.9%) samples using the Gall et al. protocol
 <sup>

 </sup>, generating thousands of short viral sequence fragments (reads) per individual. Sequencing success was comparatively modest

 </sup>. We restricted our analysis to samples from 2652 individuals that satisfied minimum criteria on read length and depth for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent inferences (see Methods and Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Women and individuals of 35 years or more were under-represented in this data set when compared to infected participants, whereas individuals in fishing sites were over-represented. The overall sequence sampling fraction was high, 68.4% (2652/3878) among infected participants who did not report ART use (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and an estimated 65.6% (2652/4043) among infected participants with unsuppressed virus (see Methods). If we assume that individuals who were not present or did not participate at survey visits were infected with unsuppressed virus in proportion to the enrolled population, an additional 1837 individuals likely did not have suppressed viraemia, leading to an estimated sequence sampling fraction of 45.1% (2652/5880) among eligible, infected individuals with unsuppressed virus. Accounting for the previous finding that ~30% of individuals were infected by a person outside the cohort
 <sup>

 </sup>, we thus expect that in approximately three of ten cases (0.451 × 0.7), our data contain the transmitter of a sequenced individual.
