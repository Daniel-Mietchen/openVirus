<p id="Par13">We revisited this hypothesis in our data, and found 34 phylogenetically close pairs with intermingled subgraphs across the majority of the genome. In two instances, the phylogenetically linked individuals were female (Fig.

Based on this, the phylogenetic linkages in transmission networks that we inferred from our deep-sequence data may indicate—but cannot prove—direct transmission. The difference between the theoretical expectations of Romero-Severson et al.
