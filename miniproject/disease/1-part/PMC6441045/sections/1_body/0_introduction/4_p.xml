<p id="Par6">We report first that it is feasible to obtain population-based samples of HIV-1 deep-sequence data that represent a large proportion of infected individuals with unsuppressed virus in a local setting in Africa. Second, we demonstrate that deep-sequence phylogenetic analysis can be scaled from pairs in whom transmission has been suspected to population-based samples of HIV-1 epidemics. We reconstruct partial transmission networks in the absence of self-reported sexual contact information and identify pairs of individuals in whom transmission and the direction of transmission is phylogenetically inferred with high statistical support, which we call sourceâˆ’recipient pairs. Third, we assess the strength of deep-sequence phylogenetic inferences on direct transmission between two individuals (in short: linkage) in a large population-based sample, and the direction of transmission between two individuals via potentially unsampled intermediates. Our major finding is that the direction of transmission from a source case to a recipient could be frequently estimated with high statistical support, and that accuracy levels are sufficient for inferences into the drivers of epidemic spread at the population-level.</p>
