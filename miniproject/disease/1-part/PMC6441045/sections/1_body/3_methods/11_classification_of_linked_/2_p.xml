<p id="Par45">We simplified this criterion by choosing 
 <italic>c</italic> ∈ (0, 1) such that Eq. (3) holds for all 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>L</sub> &gt; 
 <italic>nc</italic> for a typical whole-genome analysis. For the Rakai analysis, read alignments had a length of 250 bp, resulting in 
 <italic>n</italic> = 35 non-overlapping alignments and deep-sequence phylogenies, and so with Eq. (2), we obtain 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.57 for 
 <italic>α</italic> = 80% and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.64 for 
 <italic>α</italic> = 95%. The thresholds were similar for analyses based on read alignments of length 350 bp, resulting in 
 <italic>n</italic> = 25 deep-sequence phylogenies, and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.59 for 
 <italic>α</italic> = 80% and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.67 for 
 <italic>α</italic> = 95%. This suggested choosing as default values 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.6 for 
 <italic>α</italic> = 80% and 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.66 for 
 <italic>α</italic> = 95%, with the present analysis based on 
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.6 for all linkage and direction classifications.
