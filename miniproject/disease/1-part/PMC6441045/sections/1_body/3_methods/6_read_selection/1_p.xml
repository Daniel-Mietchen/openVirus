 </sup> was used to merge paired-end reads, and only merged reads of at least 250 bp in length were retained for phylogeny reconstruction. Subsequent deep-sequence inferences were performed on individuals whose reads covered the HIV-1 genome at a depth of at least 30 reads for 750 bp or more. Individuals who did not have sequencing output meeting these criteria were excluded.
