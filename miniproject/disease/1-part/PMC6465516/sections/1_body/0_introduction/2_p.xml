<p>The geographically widespread epidemic of ZIKV emerged as a profoundly important public health concern when congenital microcephaly and other fetal/neonatal abnormalities were recorded in infected pregnant women (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Congenital microcephaly is a rarely occurring neurological birth defect, characterized by fetal head circumference (HC) at least 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean size of other fetuses/babies at the same gestational age (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), sex and ethnicity; and if HC is at least 3 SD smaller than it is considered severe (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Microcephaly may occur alone or with other congenital malformations, such as prognosis of intellectual and/or motor disabilities, including speech retardation, physical disability (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), behavioral issues, and poor neurocognitive outcomes (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Due to its complex mechanisms and multifaceted etiology still there is no universally accepted and uniform diagnostic standard of microcephaly (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The possible etiologies may include environmental or genetic factors during pregnancy, such as, perinatal brain injury, craniosynostosis, drugs, hypertensive disorders, intrauterine infections caused by West Nile virus (WNV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and other prenatal viral infections e.g., cytomegalovirus, syphilis, rubella, herpesvirus, and toxoplasmosis (TORCHES) (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Intriguingly, it was not included in the list of neurological infection causing microorganisms until 2015 (
