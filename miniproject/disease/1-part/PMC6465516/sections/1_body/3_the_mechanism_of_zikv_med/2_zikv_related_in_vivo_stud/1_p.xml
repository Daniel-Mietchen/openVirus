<p>Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) used a contemporary ZIKV strain on a mouse model to predict the ZIKV relationship with microcephaly. Their findings suggested that ZIKV effectively replicated in embryonic mouse brain and caused viral induced apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and inhibited neural progenitor cells. This study supports the link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly, as it closely mimicked the physiology of infected human fetus of smaller brain size, a thinner cortical plate, enlarged lateral ventricle and ventricular/subventricular zones in the infected mouse brains (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) on human neural Progenitor Stem cell (hNPCs) model establishes that ZIKV is a neurotropic virus that directly targets developing embryonic brain cells. ZIKV infection can increase cell death rate, it can further dysregulate cell-cycle progression and cause attenuated hNPC growth (
