<p>To mimic the ZIKV infection Rossi et al. (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) designed interferon (IFN) alpha receptors lacking mice models. They detected ZIKV in brain after 3 days post-infection and caused neurologic diseases after 6 days post-infection, indicating the neurotropic nature of ZIKV (
