<p>Laboratory testing,

 <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular systems are profoundly important to understand and explain the cellular and molecular basis of microcephaly development, level of selective neurotropism (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Recently conducted animal experiments have confirmed that ZIKV can cause fetal demise, hydropsfetalis (
