<p>A more recent study has illustrated that the teratogenic effect and spectrum of fetal brain malformation induced by ZIKV is very broad and difficult to detect in clinical settings. In a research on pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina) nonhuman primate model, it is demonstrated that ZIKV can potentially target and destroy fetal neural stem cells, even if the baby is not microcephalic (

Studies conducted on human astrocytes and glial cell lines support the previous research that ZIKV most likely infect neural stem cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, microglia and astrocytes, while neurons are less prone to get infected. Moreover, the macrolide antibiotic drug azithromycin can potentially protect brain cells from ZIKV infection by declining viral proliferation and its cytopathic effects in human astrocytes and glial cell lines (
