<p>Dang et al. (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) investigated the ZIKV and microcephaly relationship by using cerebral organoids derived human embryonic stem cells. Authors have demonstrated that ZIKV is capable to disturb cell fate and restrict organoids growth by disrupting the activation of innate immune receptor, Toll-like-Receptor 3 (TLR3). The activation of TLR3 pathway can alter genetic expression, disrupt neurogenetic pathways, affects apoptosis, and plays crucial role in microcephaly (
