<p>Above all, some important answers need to be explored in order to understand the emerging Zika virus (ZIKV), which remained obscure until the recent epidemic in French Polynesia (2013–2014) and in multiple countries of South America (2015–2016) (

Clinical isolates collected from the recent ZIKV epidemic in the Americas were hyper infectious in mosquitoes as compared to the FSS13025 strain, isolated in 2010 in Cambodia. Surprisingly, recently isolated strains have evolved to attain an instinctive mutation in its Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) amino acid, resulting in high expression of NS1 antigenaemia. Higher NS1 antigenaemia expression in infected hosts promotes ZIKV infectivity and prevalence in mosquitoes, which could have facilitated transmission during recent ZIKV epidemics (
