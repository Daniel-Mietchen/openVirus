<p>Despite the tremendous novel work is now underway to develop ZIKV vaccines, the important challenges still remain for the preclinical and early clinical studies. It is suggested that previous successful licensed viral vaccines experience of other flaviviruses (such as YFV, JEV, and DENV) (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), and use of currently available preclinical ZIKV vaccine data can pave road to develop effective ZIKV vaccine. ZIKV clinical vaccines development is efficient, focused and uniquely collaborative, while numerous phase 1 clinical trials have been initiated within the first year of ZIKV epidemic (

Specially, DNA and purified inactivated virus (PIV) vaccines are more attractive for ZIKV infection by keeping in view the theoretical safety benefit of non-replicating vaccines in women. Use of neutralizing antibodies is also supposed to play a pivotal role in vaccine development against ZIKV infection in future (
