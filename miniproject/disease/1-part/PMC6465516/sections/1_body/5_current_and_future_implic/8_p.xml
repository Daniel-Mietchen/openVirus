<p>The virological study of CHIKV can shed light on the isolated strains of ZIKV from Brazil, as the global epidemic and distribution of both viruses is similar. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the Brazilian strains of ZIKV have evolved in a mixed way. A study suggested that isolated strains were closely related to Cambodian strain in 2010 (
