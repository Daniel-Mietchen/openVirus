<p>Nanopharmaceutical represents any nanomaterial having therapeutic potential that can be used as a therapeutic agent for example, liposomes, dendrimers, micelles, and nanocapsules. Nanoparticles can have different chemical compositions and shapes, and it can be categorized according to characteristics of matrix or the method drug delivery (

However, one pharmaceutical company demonstrated clinical trials with nano-based antiviral drug have shown some potential against ZIKV. Basically, this drug (trade name: VivaGel
 <sup>®</sup>) is Lysine-based dendrimer with naphthalene disulfonic acid surface groups that can be potentially used against sexually transmitted herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and human papillomavirus (HPV); and is expected to show some antiviral activity against ZIKV in trials (

Different antiviral nano-medicines have different modes of action, thus there is a possibility to design and check the effectiveness of the similar antiviral nanomedicines against ZIKV in near future. For example, inactivated virosomal (liposome) and virosomal (liposome) vaccine is used for the treatment of influenza and hepatitis A virus (HAV) (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Moreover, for HIV, solid drug nanoparticle formulation is at clinical trials; basically, it is non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). In future there is a possibility of designing such kind of the antiviral nanomedicines with different mechanism of action which may show positive outcomes to treat ZIKV.
