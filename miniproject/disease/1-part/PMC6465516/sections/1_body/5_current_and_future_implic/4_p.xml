<p>It is essential to explore the association of ZIKV infection and microcephaly, especially keeping in view the 80% asymptomatic cases of ZIKV. Maternal clinical symptoms of ZIKV can validate the diagnosis, but fetal and maternal laboratory confirmation, fetal deformities, autopsies, and miscarriage products detection is prerequisite to provide solid evidence. Advance studies should be done to evaluate the persistence of ZIKV in asymptomatic men and prolonged genital shedding (

In pregnant women (symptomatic or asymptomatic), serum neutralizing antibody titers that are more than or equal to 4-fold higher than dengue neutralizing antibody can be a useful approach. Other arthritis causing infections causing such as, CHIKV, DENV, malaria, Rubella, Group A Streptococcus, Parvovirus, Leptospira, measles, and rickettsial infection should be eliminated (
