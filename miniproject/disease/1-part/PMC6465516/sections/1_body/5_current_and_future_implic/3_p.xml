<p>Is it possible that genetic alterations of the virus have affected the replication mechanism, toxicity and its persistence in different geographical regions? What is the reason behind prolonged survival time of the virus in blood, brain tissues, amniotic fluids, and other tissues? How often infection status of the patients should be evaluated to respond the virus in a better way? Why developing brains provide more feasible micro-environment for the ZIKV? It is crucial to explore the full spectrum of abnormalities caused by ZIKV and solid reason of neurotropism. Although evidences are supporting ZIKV relationship with microcephaly and other brain injuries, yet information about its epidemiology, pathology and mechanism is evolving. Thus, we still need to answer aforementioned questions to address and understand unpredictable and rapidly growing ZIKV infection. It requires serious attention toward advance research, vaccine development and joint effort and collaboration between public and private sectors to look for innovative ways of ZIKV treatment and prevention.</p>
