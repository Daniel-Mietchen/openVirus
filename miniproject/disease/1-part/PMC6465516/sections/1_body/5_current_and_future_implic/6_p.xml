<p>Already reported complicated epidemiological context of the concurrent circulating CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV co-infections cannot be ignored. In French Polynesia, ZIKV infection was associated with autoimmune and neurological complications in the presence of co-circulating DENV (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Further studies, genuine laboratory and clinical differential diagnostic tests among these infections is highly important to exclude the potential confounders, to unveil subsequent infections and co-infections by different arboviruses that can affect the course of the disease, their ways of transmission (vertical, perinatal, sexual) and the incidence of severe cases (
