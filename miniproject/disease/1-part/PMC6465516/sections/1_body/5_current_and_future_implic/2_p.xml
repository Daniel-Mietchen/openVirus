<p>Similarly, a single amino acid substitution at serine to asparagine (S139N) in the viral polyprotein significantly increased ZIKV infectivity in both mouse and human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), resulting in microcephaly in the mouse fetus, and higher mortality in neonatal mice. Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that the S139N substitution arose before the French Polynesia outbreak the 2013 (
