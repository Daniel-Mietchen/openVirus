<p>Apart West Nile virus (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>), thousands of congenital microcephaly cases, fetal brain tissue damage and neurological syndromes have been associated with ZIKV infection. Unfortunately, the epidemics of this mosquito born, and a relative stable virus is on a rise. Although congenital microcephaly is a rare disorder however, due to lack of standardized diagnostic test facilities, the incidence in the geographically widespread ZIKV epidemic regions is higher. Animals studies showed that ZIKV is a neurotropic virus. It directly targets the developing embryonic brain cells by inducing apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and dysregulate hNPCs. During pregnancy in mice, ZIKV inoculation resulted in stunted heads, restricted intrauterine growth, and ocular anomalies. Despite this, still, the information about its epidemiology, pathology and mechanism is not clear. Therefore, further studies are needed toward advance research and vaccine development for ZIKV treatment and prevention.
