<p>A retrospective review (March 2014â€“May 2015), was conducted to identify ZIKV related brain abnormalities in French Polynesian neonates. It was reported that 8 out of 19 identified cases had severe microcephaly with major brain lesions, five had visible malformations and cerebral dysfunction, while six had brain lesions without microcephaly. The imaging results showed acute neurological lesions (including septal and colossal disruption, abnormal neuronal migration, cerebellar hypoplasia), and brain calcifications (

Another coinciding report on laboratory-confirmed microcephalic infants and fetus autopsies had shown viral-induced, visible microscopic brain deformations including, degenerative changes in neuronal and glial cells, gliosis, necrosis, white matter, and axonal rarefaction decline, microcalcifications and viral-induced cytopathic effects (
