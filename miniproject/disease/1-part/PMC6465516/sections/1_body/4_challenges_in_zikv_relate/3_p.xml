<p>Ruling out other viral infections to confirm the ZIKV link with microcephaly is quite important (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), as during previous ZIKV epidemic in the Pacific Islands, no severe consequences during pregnancy were documented (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). ZIKV symptomatic mothers might be misdiagnosed as other viral diseases (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), for instance, West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis viruses, Dengue virus (DENV) and the yellow fever virus (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) that are genetically similar to ZIKV. ZIKV was not a reportable neurological disease until 2015, it was recently suspected to cause congenital disease in Brazil and no serological survey was done to confirm this link. Thus, a proportion can't be established on the basis of infected population in different geographical regions. Such information can only be used in predicting the course of a microcephaly outbreak (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). ZIKV epidemic in Cape Verde (2015â€“2016), probably caused by African strain mosquitoes, resulted in thousands of infection cases without causing any neurological disorder (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Calvet et al. report on ZIKV genomic RNA detection by next-generation sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR is not enough as it only confirms that ZIKV is a cause of congenital infection (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), while no recombination events were indicated in the ZIKV sequenced genome, as genetic mutations for phenotypic changes has been reported previously for other closely related flaviviruses (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).
