<p id="Par38">In conclusion, this report shows HMPV activity characterised by marked annual variation in occurrence, and in subgroup prevalence patterns (reflecting those in other locations globally,) gradual replacement of subgroups over time, and multiple circulating variants each epidemic varying year to year. This suggests, widescale and rapid circulation of HMPV subgroups, seasonal epidemics resulting from multiple introductions rather than single source, and possible evidence of herd immunity replacement at the subgroup and within-subgroup cluster level.</p>
