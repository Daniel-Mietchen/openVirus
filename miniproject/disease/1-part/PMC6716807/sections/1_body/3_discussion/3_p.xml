<p id="Par34">Temporal analysis revealed circulation of multiple subgroups within a single epidemic. Further analysis of the G glycoprotein encoding gene revealed circulation of multiple variants for a single subgroup within an epidemic. Multiple variants observed might be attributed to high rate of G gene evolution (substitutions/site/year) resulting in diversification in situ during a season. However, the level of variation observed within a subgroup within epidemics was greater that would be expected from in situ diversification, implying multiple variant introductions of a subgroup during single epidemic years.</p>
