<p id="Par37">Our analyses on HMPV epidemiology in Kilifi were limited to two viral genes only. Whole genome sequencing might give more insights into transmission, HMPV subgroup characterisation and molecular evolution. Our estimation and inference on the association between HMPV subgroup and disease severity was biased to in-patient surveillance data, and therefore future studies should include outpatient surveillance data. In addition, inpatient surveillance and sampling of HMPV infections might not be representative of the full variant population circulating in this community and not correctly reflect incidence and prevalence, as HMPV infections have also been reported in outpatient settings [
