<p id="Par36">The analysed Kilifi F and G protein encoding genes were generally determined to be under purifying selection pressure, which drives RNA virus evolution by purifying the deleterious mutations due to RNA replication errors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. However, for the B2 subgroup, a higher dN/dS ratio was observed in G gene sequences suggestive of diversifying selection within B2 viruses. The distinct diversifying selection and persistence of the B2 viruses observed requires further investigation. In this study, our F and G genes sequence analyses were based on partial gene lengths, 345 bp and 640 bp, respectively. Therefore, our results on the genetic distance estimates, evolutionary and selection pressure analysis should be interpreted with caution. The partial lengths may have reduced our potential to discriminate genetic clusters, a possible explanation for higher sequence similarity observed between and within the subgroups for F gene. Overall, although our sequence analyses were limited to partial lengths, the newly designed F and G genes primers allowed full length sequencing of the two genes for newly generated data. In addition, the newly designed G gene subtype specific primers allowed sequencing of all HMPV subtypes and significantly improved G PCR recovery by two-fold compared to previously reported assay. This improved the study power to characterise the different circulating HMPV variants. Overall, we successfully collected clinical samples from 74% (6756/9076) of the study enrolled participants and characterised 75% (205/274) of the HMPV viruses identified. In this study we failed to collect samples from 24% of the eligibles. We have previously reported similar results, which results from refusals and difficulty in collection of nasal specimens from children with very severe disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Hence, if some HMPV variants are associated with disease severity there may be bias in the prevalence and variant composition estimates. However, the proportion not collected shows no systematic change over time. In addition, the proportion of very severe pneumonia cases was high among sampled eligibles compared to unsampled eligibles. Therefore, it’s unlikely there was any bias in the prevalence estimates of HMPV groups or subgroups.
