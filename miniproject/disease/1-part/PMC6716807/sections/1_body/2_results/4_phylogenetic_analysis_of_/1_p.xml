<p id="Par28">Based on maximum likelihood phylogenies of F and G genes, sequences from consecutive epidemics largely clustered together. However, across multiple epidemics sequences from the earlier years clustered together away from those in recent years, Figs.

 <bold>.</bold> Further analysis of G gene sequences aligned temporally, revealed circulation of multiple variants of a single subgroup in a single epidemic year (see Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>)
 <bold>.</bold> Each variant differed by at least five nucleotides (Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) and clustered into separate clades, Fig.

 <bold>.</bold> In comparison to contemporaneous viruses (714 F gene sequences and 500 G gene sequences) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), viruses from Kilifi and those from other locations were highly similar, with an average nucleotide identity of 97.1 and 95.6% (in F gene), and 90.4 and 85.9% (in G gene) for groups A and B, respectively. In phylogenies of F and G, combining contemporaneous and Kilifi sequence data, the Kilifi sequences did not cluster separately from others but interspersed with sequences from Canada, Spain, Malaysia, Japan, USA, India and Croatia 
 <bold>(</bold>Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and similarly, those viruses collected from earlier years in Kilifi clustered away from those in recent years.
