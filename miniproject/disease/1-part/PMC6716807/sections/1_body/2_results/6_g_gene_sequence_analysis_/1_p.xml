<p id="Par30">G gene sequences were less conserved compared to F gene sequences with overall mean sequence identity of 73% (nt) and 56% (aa). However, within subgroups the sequences were highly conserved: the mean identities were estimated at 97% (nt) and 96% (aa) for clade A2c, 93% (nt) and 89% (aa) for clade A2b, 94% (nt) and 90% (aa) for B1, 92%(nt) and 87% for B2 subgroups. The deduced G gene amino acid sequences differed in lengths among subgroups: clade A2c (220aa), clade A2b (218 and 229aa), B2 (238aa) and B1 (232 and 242aa) long. The varying protein lengths for clade A2b and B1 subgroups were due to changes in stop codon positions. The evolutionary rates for the G gene were estimated at

Evolutionary rate estimates for subgroup B2 viruses were not determined, effective sample size (ESS) for all parameters failed to reach the cut-off (200) required for confirmation of convergence in BEAST analysis. Among all the subgroups, A2c exhibited significantly lower substitution rates within the G gene (95% HPD = 1.317× 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> to 5.518× 10
 <sup>− 3</sup>). The estimated times of the most common ancestor of the individual subgroups dated to recent origin in both F and G genes, i.e., 2009 (95% HPD = 2005–2011) for clade A2c sequences, 2008 (95% HPD = 2006–2009) for clade A2b, 2005 (95% HPD = 2002–2007) for B1 and 2001(95% HPD = 1997–2005) for B2 sequences. The estimated mean dN/dS ratio (ω) was &lt; 1 for A2b (ω = 0.57), A2c (ω = 0.38) and B1(ω = 0.78). For the subgroup B2, a higher average dN/dS ratio (ω = 1.21) was determined for G gene, indicating a signal of positive selection (Additional file
