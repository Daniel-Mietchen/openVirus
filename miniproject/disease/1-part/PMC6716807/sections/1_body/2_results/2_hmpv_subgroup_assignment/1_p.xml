<p id="Par24">Phylogenetic analysis (F and G gene) of Kilifi, global and the reference sequences showed clustering of HMPV viruses into subgroups A2, B1 and B2. Subgroup A1 was not observed. Subgroup A2 sequences further clustered into 3 clades, the two known clades A2a and A2b, and into the unique clade A2c supported by strong bootstrap values (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The recently identified unique HMPV A2 strain, which possess 180 duplication in G gene clustered within A2c clade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and was not observed in the Kilifi sequences. Based on F gene phylogeny constructed using full length coding regions, similar clades and sub-groups were also observed i.e. A2a, A2b, A2c, B1 and B2 (Additional file
