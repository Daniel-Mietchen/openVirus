<p id="Par29">Due to partial gene sequencing (345 bp) of the previously reported F gene Kilifi sequences retrieved from GenBank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], combined Kilifi sequences were trimmed to 345 bp. The F gene sequences were highly conserved both at the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) level with overall mean sequence identity of 89% (nt) and 97% (aa). Within the individual subgroups, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were more conserved: there was 100% aa sequence similarity within clades A2b, A2c and subgroup B1, and 99.9% within B2 subgroup, and the mean nucleotide identities were 98.2% within B1, 99.2% within A2c, 98.3% within both A2b and B2. The evolutionary rates for F gene were estimated at

 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Using M2a and M3 models, no codon sites were identified as positively selected among the four types (sub-lineage A2b, sub-lineage A2c, B1 and B2 subgroups). (Additional file
