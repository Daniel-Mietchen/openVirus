<p id="Par18">HMPV positive samples identified between 2007 and 2011 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 160) were partially sequenced in the F and G genes, 345 and 606 bp, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For HMPV positive samples identified between 2012 and 2016 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 114), we amplified full F and G encoding genes, approximately 1620 bp and 700 bp, respectively, using one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR and sequencing primers are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Thermocycling conditions for both genes were set at: 50 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 15 min, 38 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. HMPV A and B subtype specific primers were used to increase the sensitivity and the performance of G gene amplification. HMPV positive samples were sequenced in both forward and reverse directions using Big dye terminator v1.3 chemistry run on ABI 3130xl instrument [
