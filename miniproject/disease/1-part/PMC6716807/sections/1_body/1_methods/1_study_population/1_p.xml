<p id="Par16">The study was conducted at the Kilifi County Hospital (KCH) as part of long-term surveillance aimed at understanding the epidemiology and disease burden of RSV-associated pneumonia cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. KCH, located in coastal Kenya, is a referral hospital serving the population of around 260,000 (circa 2012) within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and beyond in the wider Kilifi County. The population is mainly rural-agrarian. Upon presentation of a child to the paediatric ward at KCH, a detailed medical review is undertaken by the clinician upon which the decision to admit is made. For this study, children (≤ 59 months of age) admitted to the paediatric ward between January 1st 2007 and December 31st 2016 were eligible if they presented with modified WHO defined syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. During the period between 2007 and 2009, only admissions arising from residents of Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) were eligible, whereas in later years, non-KHDSS residents were included. Following written informed consent from the parent or guardian, a nasopharyngeal flocked swab, nasal wash or combination of nasopharyngeal swab and oropharyngeal swab was collected from each child and transferred into viral transport medium for laboratory screening. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Kenya Medical Research Institute Scientific and Ethics Review Unit.
