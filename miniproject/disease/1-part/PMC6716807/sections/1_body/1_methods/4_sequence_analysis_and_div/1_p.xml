<p id="Par19">Sequence reads for the successfully amplified HMPV positives identified between 2012 to 2016 were edited and assembled using Sequencher v5.0.1 (Gene Codes Corporation). The newly assembled F and G genes sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MH482553 to MH482743. The accession numbers (MH482553 to MH482743) include additional 31 sequences that were detected by different rRT-PCR assay and therefore they were excluded in this analysis. The accession numbers for the excluded sequences (15 for F gene and 16 for G gene) are given in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. For subsequent analyses, previously sequenced data for HMPV positives identified between 2007 and 2011 i.e. F (

 <italic>n</italic> = 56) genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (accession numbers KT191299 to KT191484) was combined with the newly sequenced data, making a total of 210 sequences for F gene and 118 sequences for G gene used in subsequent analyses. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT v7.220 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Nucleotide and amino acid mean genetic distances within and between subgroups were determined using Kimura-2 parameter model in MEGA v7. 0.2.6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Further, to assess sequence diversity within epidemics, collated G gene sequences were aligned by epidemic sampling to show changes in the G gene within epidemics.
