<p id="Par20">Contemporaneous sequences (2007 to 2016) were obtained from GenBank for both F and G genes. Sequences had to have a complete overlap in their sequenced portion with the Kilifi sequence data. Duplicate sequences were dropped. A total of 714 F gene sequences and 500 G sequences were retrieved. For phylogenetic construction, sequences were filtered per country using an inhouse ruby script to obtain only unique sequences. Unique sequences were identified as sequences that differ by at least one nucleotide from any other sequence over the sequenced region. Combined global and Kilifi sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.220. Best fitting nucleotide substitution and site heterogeneity models were estimated in MEGA v7. 0.2.6 and phylogenetic trees inferred using Maximum Likelihood (ML) with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Reference sequences from GenBank (FJ168778 NL/94/01/B2, AY525843 HMPV NL/1/99/B1, AF371337 HMPV NL/1/00/A1, AB503857, AY530095 HMPV JP/240/03/A2b and GQ153651 HMPV CN/gz01/08/A2) were included [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A fragment length of 345 bp was analysed for F gene and at least 640 bp for G gene. Subgroups were confirmed if sequences clustered with the reference sequences within a major branch with &gt; 70% bootstrap support on the ML tree. Mean nucleotide genetic distances were also determined to assess sequence similarity between Kilifi and the global data set. To further assess the clustering of HMPV subgroups, ML tree was reconstructed using only full F (1593 bp) gene sequences.
