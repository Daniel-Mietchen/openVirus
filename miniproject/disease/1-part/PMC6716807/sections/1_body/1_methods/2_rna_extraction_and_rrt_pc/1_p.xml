 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In brief, for samples collected in 2007 RNA was extracted using Magnapure LC32 total nucleic acid extractor (Roche, Manheim, Germany) and virus screening conducted using the LightCycler Fast Start DNA MasterPLUS Hyb-Probe kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions. From 2008 to 2011, sample extraction was by MagNaPure LC32 Kit (Roche, Manheim, Germany) or QIAmp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, Germany) and virus detection carried out using a one-step in-house multiplex real time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) using a TaqMan probe-based system targeting the fusion (F) gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Samples with a rRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value &lt; 35 were considered HMPV positive. From 2012 to 2016 total RNA extraction was performed using Qiacube HT automated total nucleic acid extractor (Qiagen, Germany) and virus detection carried out using the same one-step in-house multiplex real time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) used for samples from 2008 to 11 [
