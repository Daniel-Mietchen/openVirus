   <p>Changes in G gene nucleotide sequences for sequences collected from Kilifi. Sequences were aligned by subgroup and by epidemic year for Clade A2b and A2c. Nucleotide differences were determined and indicated by vertical colored bars. Orange red represent Adenine (A), Crimson represent Thymine (T), Indigo represents Guanine (G) and slate blue represent Cytosine (C) nucleotide. (PDF 261 kb)</p>
