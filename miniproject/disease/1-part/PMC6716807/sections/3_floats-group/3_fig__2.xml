 <caption>
  <p>A ML phylogenetic tree of 563 unique F Gene sequences constructed using Kilifi sequences and sequences obtained from GenBank, collected from 2007 to 2016. Sequences were subtyped using references sequences retrieved from GenBank. Reference sequences colored in red. The numbers next to branches indicate the bootstrap values. Subgroups were confirmed if sequences clustered with the reference sequences within a major branch with &gt;â€‰70% bootstrap support. Taxa colored in blue represent sequences of previously reported unique sub-lineage of A2, retrieved from GenBank. Kilifi sequences are colored in brown</p>
