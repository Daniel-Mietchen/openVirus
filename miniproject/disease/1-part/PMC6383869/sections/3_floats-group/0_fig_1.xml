  <title>Map of Old World and New World hantavirus genotypes reported to be pathogenic for humans.</title>
  <p>Hantaviruses that have been shown to cause HFRS are shown in red, and those that cause HPS are shown in green. PUUV, which causes a milder form of HFRS (NE), is found in Europe. The described African hantavirus, Sangassou virus, was found in Guinea in 2016. In recent studies, THAIV is considered to act as an additional causative agent of HFRS. It should be noted that SEOV is harbored by 
   <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (brown rat) worldwide, but only those locations where reports of human infections with SEOV are shown. The map was created specifically for this manuscript and was generated by ArcGIS 9.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) based on World Countries (
