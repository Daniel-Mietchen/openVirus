<p>Vaccination programs against HFRS have been in practice for more than 20 years in China, where the incidence of HFRS has decreased with occasional small fluctuations. It has been reported that the age distribution of HFRS infections has clearly changed in recent years, ever since the Expanded Program of Immunization for regions with high HFRS incidence was implemented in 2008 [

The vaccination-induced reduction in susceptible human population gradually led to the reduction of human hantavirus infections and successfully averted further epidemics. The findings in China therefore highlight the necessity for a vaccination strategy and provide important insights for other countries.
