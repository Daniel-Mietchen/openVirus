<p>Studies have demonstrated positive correlations between relative population density of bank voles and prevalence of PUUV infection among rodent populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Bank vole density indices were also positively correlated with risk of HFRS in humans in northern Sweden, Finland, and Norway [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, the relationship between rodent demography and disease dynamics in China and North America is more complicated. In Central China, fluctuation in HFRS incidence is highly correlated with striped field mouse population density and the prevalence of HFRS infection in Shaanxi Province, an endemic area for HFRS due to HTNV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In northeastern China, HFRS cases are associated with a virus-carrying index, an indicator to describe the combined effects of rodent population density and prevalence of virus infection, with a one-month lag, in the SEOV endemic area of HFRS [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, in South China, the number of HFRS cases is not associated with rodent population density in Chenzhou and Changsha (the main species captured are

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In North America, different relationships have been found between deer mouse population density and SNV infection prevalence in the deer mouse population—positive correlations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], no linear correlation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and even negative correlations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. (It should also be noted that the different correlational relationship may be due to temporal issues; e.g., some studies take account of time lags when analyzing the data while others do not.) Because hantaviruses are horizontally transmitted, these inconsistent results may be due to two conflicting effects of population dynamics on prevalence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. During breeding seasons, rapid population growth of juveniles not yet infected may increase the proportion of uninfected rodents and potentially decrease hantavirus prevalence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], whereas the resulting higher population size may eventually increase contact between individuals and prevalence. Taken together, these studies point to several issues that could be of importance to understanding the relationship between reservoir population dynamics and pathogen transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Future demographic studies should aim to establish causal mechanisms linking behavior, demography, and virus prevalence dynamics.
