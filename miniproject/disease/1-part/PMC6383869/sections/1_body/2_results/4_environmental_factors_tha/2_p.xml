<p>It is becoming increasingly more apparent that climatic variations have profound impacts on infectious disease dynamics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], especially for climate-sensitive infectious diseases; e.g., human hantavirus diseases are considered climate-sensitive infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Understanding the influence of climatic drivers on hantavirus disease ecology can help in forecasting and prevention, which is even more urgently needed in this era of climate change. Recently, Tian and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] investigated the role extrinsic factors (climatic conditions) play in determining hantavirus disease dynamics in Central China. A unique data set from Central China covering half a century showed the existence of a climate-driven transmission mechanism for HTNV from the striped field mouse to humans [

Conversely, very few disease outbreaks occurred under conditions of high summer temperatures and drought (
