<p>Temperature could influence disease dynamics through its impact on the rodent reservoir population dynamics and pathogen survival in the external environment, subsequently influencing human–animal contact patterns. However, compared to precipitation, the effects of temperature have been less investigated, and contradictory findings make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. For example, in Central China, higher summer temperatures were followed by a lower incidence of HFRS in autumn (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]—this was presumably due to a reduced frequency of contacts between rodents and between rodents and humans, coupled with an unfavorable environment for virus survival [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]—whereas in Belgium, a higher summer temperature two years before led to higher NE incidence [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A potential explanation is that the higher temperature two years before might have stimulated bud formation that contributed to heavy masting one year before. Likewise, opposite associations between mean temperature and hantavirus infection incidence were found across China [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In South America, HPS caused by ANDV was also negatively associated with winter temperature [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Conversely, in North America, a positive relationship between hantavirus disease incidence and temperature was reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. There is a need for more studies to investigate the mechanisms behind these relationships.
