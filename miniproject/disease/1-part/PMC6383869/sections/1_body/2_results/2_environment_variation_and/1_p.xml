<p>A bottom-up trophic cascade hypothesis has been proposed to explain the chain reactions resulting from climatic conditions, primary productivity, and host demography [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A bottom-up trophic cascade suggests that a change in nutrient supply could lead to similar changes in equilibrium abundances at all trophic levels [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In rodent host-hantavirus systems, climatic conditions are one of the many factors that can affect rodent population dynamics and, consequently, the prevalence of virus infection in rodent reservoirs and risk of virus exposure in humans [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006901.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A review of the available longitudinal studies of rodent communities supports the hypothesis that hantavirus reservoir populations in both the Old World and New World are significantly influenced by climate, either directly (via winter survival) or indirectly (through food limitation).
