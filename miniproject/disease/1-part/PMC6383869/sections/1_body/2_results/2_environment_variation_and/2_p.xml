<p>In Central China, an environmentally induced cascading effect on the population dynamics of the striped field mouse (
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>agrarius</italic>, the main reservoir host for HTNV) was found by combining 30 years of field surveillance and satellite images. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value for farmland, and precipitation two months previously, were important in determining striped field mouse survival and recruitment rates, respectively [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. An extreme drought-induced food shortage is thought to increase mortality in striped field mouse populations, as they are a species that relies on farm crops [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, winter temperature was found to exert complex effects on overwinter survival, thereby affecting the population growth rate in the following year [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In South China, the population density of the main reservoir host for SEOV, the brown rat (
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>), is correlated with temperature, precipitation, and the NDVI value for farmland [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In northeastern China, in Huludao City, an endemic area for HFRS due to SEOV, climate is considered to affect HFRS epidemics mainly through its effect on the population density of the brown rat (the most abundant rodent species present, accounting for more than 80% of the total rodent population) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Outbreaks of nephropathia epidemica (NE; a mild form of HFRS caused by PUUV infection) are hypothesized to have an ecological causal connection with the staple food source for the main carrier of PUUV, the bank vole, in mast years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Population densities of bank voles were found to be associated with summer temperature and autumn temperature, both of which favor seed development [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A higher average winter temperature is believed to reduce winter survival of bank voles in Scandinavia because of a shorter period of protective snow cover against predators. On the contrary, increasing winter temperatures are found to provide a survival benefit to increasing populations of striped field mouse in the spring in Central China; subsequently, a large population of rodents might be accompanied by intraspecific competition due to food or space limitation, resulting in a negative-feedback effect of population density [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In North America, the HPS outbreak in 1993 in the Four Corners region of the southwestern US was considered to be driven by increased precipitation induced by an El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. The HPS outbreaks in 1997 in the same region were also preceded by an ENSO event, which brought increased precipitation, favoring deer mouse host populations [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. NDVI is also used to identify locations that can be monitored for the abundance of deer mouse and presence of SNV by examining the seasonal dynamics of vegetative patterns [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In central Montana, US, the survival and recruitment rates of the deer mouse were found to be associated with precipitation and temperature, implying a complex relationship between climate and population dynamics [
