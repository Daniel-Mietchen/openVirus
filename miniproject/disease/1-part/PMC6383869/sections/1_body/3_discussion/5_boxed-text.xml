  <p>With this review we have demonstrated the following:</p>

    <p>The complex seasonality and interannual cycles of hantavirus disease dynamics are a direct result of the (nonlinear) interaction between the population dynamics of the rodent host, environmental forcing, and humanâ€“wildlife contact patterns.</p>

   <list-item>
    <p>Specific environmental conditions can trigger hantavirus disease outbreaks, but the outcomes may differ among strains or areas mediated by the underlying mechanisms of hantavirus transmission. For example, in Weihe Plain of Central China, higher summer temperatures were followed by a lower incidence of HFRS in autumn; conversely, in North America, a positive relationship between hantavirus disease incidence and temperature was reported, indicating the complexity across different systems.</p>

   <list-item>
    <p>Current efforts to curb hantavirus transmission focus on avoiding contact between humans and host rodents as there is no WHO-licensed vaccine against hantavirus infections available (except Hantavax, which is licensed for human use only in the Republic of Korea). Hence, a broader appreciation for the epidemiological links among human beings, animals, and environment can result in more effective control of disease outbreak.</p>
