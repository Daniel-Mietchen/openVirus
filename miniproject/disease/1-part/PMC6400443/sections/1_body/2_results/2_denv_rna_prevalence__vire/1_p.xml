<p>Serotyping RT-qPCR was performed to estimate the prevalence of DENV RNA in the samples. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, of the 133 serum samples, 69 (51.88%) were positive for reverse-transcribed DENV DNA. In Xishuangbanna, eight samples (14.04%) from the isolates were typed as DENV-1 and 36 (63.16%) of them as DENV-2. There were 13 instances (22.80%) of mixed infections with two serotypes (DENV-1 and -2). In contrast, in Guangzhou, all 12 strains were DENV-1. RT-qPCR was used to estimate the viral titer corresponding to the day of fever when the DENV RNA was isolated from each patient. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, the viremia levels in the patients infected with DENV-2 were significantly higher than those from the patients infected with DENV-1 on days 1 to 3 (p&lt;0.05) after onset of fever. Then, the viremia levels were demonstrated a declining trend of both serotypes with no significant difference.
