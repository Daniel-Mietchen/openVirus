<p>The serological characteristics of the serum samples were also examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g003">Fig 3</xref>, recent DENV infection rates in Xishuangbanna (84.4%) and Guangzhou (76.2%) detected by DENV IgM were much higher than past DENV infection rates in these two study areas [Xishuangbanna (34.10%) and Guangzhou (38.1%)] detected by DENV-IgG. The viremia levels were significantly higher in the DENV IgM seronegative samples than those for the DENV IgM positive sera samples (p &lt;0.01) (
