<p>The DENV genome comprises a single strand of positive-sense RNA encoding three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. DENV is divided into four serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4), each of which can be sub-divided into several genotypes based on the envelope gene, which confers partial cross-protective immunity against the other serotypes in humans [
