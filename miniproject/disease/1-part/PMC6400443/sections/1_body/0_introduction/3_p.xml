<p>The geographic distribution of DENV infection on mainland China based on a number of large dengue outbreaks with serious consequences have been reported shows that the epidemic was caused by an imported virus, because this virus has not yet been confirmed to be endemic in this country [
 <xref rid="pone.0213353.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The first outbreak of dengue after World War II in China occurred in Guangdong Province in 1978 [
 <xref rid="pone.0213353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thereafter, the two most severe outbreaks were in 1980 and 1986 in Hainan Province, and resulted in more than 600,000 cases and 475 deaths [
 <xref rid="pone.0213353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since then, dengue epidemics have been recorded sequentially in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and the relatively northern and western regions of China including Zhejiang and Yunnan Provinces, with shorter epidemic intervals [

 <xref rid="pone.0213353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In recent years, Guangdong and Yunnan Provinces have experienced the highest incidence of dengue epidemics, with cases being reported every year since 1997 [

 <xref rid="pone.0213353.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The characteristics of the temporal distribution in mainland China indicate that the disease occurs sporadically from January to May, whereas June to December is recognized as being the prevalent period [
