<p>The selected study sites were Guangzhou in Guandong Province and Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province where dengue epidemics occurred in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Their locations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Yunnan Province in Southwest China has both tropical and subtropical regions and shares borders with South Asian countries (Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar) that are dengue endemic areas. Guangzhou is one of largest city with the highest population density in the world. It is the capital city of Guangdong Province in southern China and has a humid subtropical climate influenced by the Asian monsoon season. Patients were recruited from two hospitals in Xishuangbanna (Jinghong Farm Staff Hospital and Xishuangbanna Mental Health Center) and one hospital in Guangzhou (The Third Affiliated Hospital of SUN YAT-SEN University). During the DENV outbreaks, 105 whole blood specimens collected in Xishuangbanna (November 2015) and 28 collected in Guangzhou (October 2014) who presented with suspected dengue virus infection were screened for evidence of DENV infections from 1 to 14 days after presentation at the hospital. After the serum was separated from each peripheral blood specimen the samples were stored at –20°C until processing. Patients suspected of a having dengue infection, as determined by a fever greater than 38°C taken at axillary accompanied by at least one clinical sign or symptom of dengue fever such as headache, rash, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, malaise, signs of dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome were enrolled. A case of dengue was confirmed when a patient suspected of having the disease tested positive by at least one of the following diagnostic tests: NS1 antigen (Panbio Dengue Early ELISA kit), anti-dengue immunoglobulin M (IgM) (Panbio Dengue IgM Capture ELISA kit) or reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The clinical features were obtained from the medical records of the patients. The laboratory tests, which included the white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and transaminase levels, were analyzed chronologically from the onset of the clinical signs and symptoms for each patient.
