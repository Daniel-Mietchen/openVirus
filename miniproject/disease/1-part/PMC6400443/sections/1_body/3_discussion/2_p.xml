<p>In the present study, we found that DENV-1 was the dominant serotype in Guangzhou, and DENV-2 was the dominant serotype in Xishuangbanna during the dengue outbreaks in 2014–2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The DENV-1 viruses circulating during the Guangzhou outbreak were homologous, sharing similar gene sequences not only with the strains previously isolated in Guangdong but also with the Indian strains from the 2009–2011, which suggests that this outbreak was imported (

The DENV-1 circulating in Xishuangbanna differs from that in Guangdong but shares similarities with Vietnamese strains, which suggests that this strain was imported from a Southeast Asian country, a finding consistent with the results from a previous study [
