<p>In conclusion, during the DENV outbreaks in Guangdong Province and Yunnan in 2014â€“2015, the dominant serotypes were DENV-1 genotype V and DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype, respectively. DENV-2 is particularly associated with severe dengue infections providing new data to better understanding the pathogenic potential of distinct DENV serotypes in human populations. Therefore, elucidating the immune responses to dengue fever and the pathogenic mechanisms used by DENV are important scientific endeavors. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that during the outbreaks in the two Chinese regions the DENV serotypes we detected shared high homology with the isolates previously reported in Guangdong and Yunnan Province and in Southeast Asian countries, indicating the possibility of dengue fever becoming endemic in China, although most research has attributed the presence of dengue fever in China to imported cases [

However, dengue infection is not a passing problem in China, and controlling it will require the establishment of a rapid detection system, an improved laboratory-based national surveillance system, a better long-term vector control strategy, and development of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics to combat it.
