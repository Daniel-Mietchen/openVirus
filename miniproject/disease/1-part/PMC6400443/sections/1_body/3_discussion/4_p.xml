<p>In terms of the clinical manifestations of dengue fever in the study participants, some clinical signs and symptoms were specifically associated with the DENV-2 serotype, such as high rates of headache, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and general debilitation (
 <xref rid="pone.0213353.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Higher rising rates of alanine and aspartate transaminases were also observed among those infected with DENV-2 and mixed serotype infections containing DENV-2, indicating the possibility of higher inflammatory reaction rates for these infections. This suggests that DENV-2 infections may cause more serious clinical issues than infections with other serotypes. Although previous reports demonstrated different clinical signs and symptoms with serotype-1 and -2 [

 <xref rid="pone.0213353.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], this inconsistency may be attributed to different genetic backgrounds. However, no obvious associations among the clinical signs and symptoms of the disease and primary or secondary infections were evident (

It is possible that our study did not contain enough patients with specific infection types to be able to draw conclusions about whether the clinical presentations of the disease are associated with a specific infection type. However, the result of one study indicated that some primary infections are associated with severe DENV cases [
