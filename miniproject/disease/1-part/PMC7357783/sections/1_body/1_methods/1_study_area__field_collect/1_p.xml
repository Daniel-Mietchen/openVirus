<p>Based on the important agricultural, husbandry, business, and industrial activities, three provinces were selected for mosquito collections: North Khorasan, Mazandaran, and Fars. North Khorasan province with a moderate highland climate in general (covering an area of 28,434 km
 <sup>2</sup>), is surrounded by Republic of Turkmenistan on the north, Razavi Khorasan province on the east and south, Golestan province on the west and Semnan province on the south western part; the capital of the province is Bojnord. Mazandaran province with a moderate subtropical climate (covering an area of 23,842 km
 <sup>2</sup>), is located along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and is bordered by Russia across the sea, Golestan, Semnan, Tehran, Alborz, Qazvin, and Guilan provinces. The diverse nature of the province mostly features rice fields, prairies, forests and rainforest; Sari is the capital of the province. Fars Province with an area of 122,400 km
 <sup>2</sup> is located in southwest Iran, and Shiraz with a population of 1,869,000 is its administrative center. The climate of Shiraz has distinct seasons, and is overall classed as a hot semi-arid climate. Adults were collected during July-September 2018 corresponding to the season of high risk of transmission with high mosquito densities and presence of vertebrate hosts such as migratory birds. Night-biting mosquitoes were caught using CDC light traps (two repetitions; traps were not baited with CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and were placed in front of houses and barns from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM) and day-biting mosquitoes were sampled using aspirators to capture adults when landing on human and animal baits. Human landing catches were conducted in sites where there were no reports of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-vectored disease cases during the period of mosquito collections. The duration of collection was 2 hrs in each collection site and mosquito morphological identification was based on the key of Azari-Hamidian and Harbach [

Abdomens were grouped by species, location and pools of 10, and RPB were stored individually. If a virus was detected in a pool, screening of corresponding individual RBPs was performed to define mosquito infection rates. Regarding North Khorasan province, sampling was conducted in six districts within four counties: Kalateh Shiro, Golian, Haseh Gah, Yeke Sud, Qazi, and Bojnord. For Mazandaran province, samples were collected in five districts within three counties: Baleyran, Nour, Mohammadabad, Boondeh, and Mahmoudabad. Regarding Fars province, sampling was provided only from Shiraz, the capital city (
