<p>Total RNA was extracted from pools of abdomens with the Nucleospin RNA extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France) and retro-transcribed using the qScript cDNA Supermix kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, USA). Obtained cDNAs were pre-amplified with the Perfecta Preamp Supermix (Quanta Biosciences, MA, USA) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, all primers were pooled to 200 nM final each. The reaction was performed in a final volume of 5 μL containing 1 μL Perfecta Preamp 5X, 1.25 μL pooled primers, 1.5 μL distilled water and 1.25 μL cDNA, with one cycle at 95°C for 2 min, 14 cycles at 95°C for 10 sec and 3 min at 60°C. At the end of the cycling program, the reactions were 1:5 diluted. cDNAs were tested in the chip based on the BioMark Dynamic arrays system (Fluidigm Corporation); it allows high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR amplifications in one experiment using 96 PCR mixes and 96 samples [

Amplifications were performed using 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)- and black hole quencher (BHQ1)-labeled TaqMan probes with TaqMan Gene expression master mix (Applied Biosystems, France). Thermal cycling conditions were: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 2-step amplification of 15 sec at 95°C, and 1 min at 60°C. Data was acquired on the BioMark Real-Time PCR System and analyzed using the Fluidigm Real-time PCR Analysis software to obtain crossing point values. One negative water control was included per chip. To determine if inhibitors present in the sample can inhibit the real-time PCR, a strain of

 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Primers and probes were tested and only few cross reactions were observed between serotypes and/or genotypes of targeted viruses (i.e. cross reactions between dengue serotypes, between Usutu virus and WNV). Once the virus was detected in pools of mosquito abdomens, a screening of corresponding individual RBPs was performed to define mosquito infection rates. The virus genotype was defined by RT-PCR and virus isolation was attempted on insect C6/36 cells.
