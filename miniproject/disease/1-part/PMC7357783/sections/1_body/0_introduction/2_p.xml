<p>WNV is the most prevalent

 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] are common vertebrate hosts. Migratory birds play a critical role in introducing WNV; 15% were found serologically WNV-positive and among them, 54% concerned 
 <italic>Fulica atra</italic> birds suggesting the potential role of common coots in WNV ecology in Iran [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Chinikar et al., in 2012 and 2013, found that three patients developing encephalitis were positive for WNV by RT-qPCR assay [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and detected serologically positive sera in 1.3% of humans and 2.8% of equines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. WNV was also detected in mosquitoes: 
 <italic>Aedes caspius</italic> in the Northwest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> in the North [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the South [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Besides, the most critical mosquito-borne virus in the world is DENV mainly transmitted between humans by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Most human cases in Iran were reported in the southeast of the country near the border with Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], though local transmission has not been confirmed yet [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, circulation of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was suspected in Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], possibly due to the global expansion of CHIKV since 2005 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Then, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of other mosquito-borne viruses like Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and CHIKV in Iran. Early detection of arboviruses in mosquitoes is a pre-requisite for designing and implementing adapted control measures. To improve the surveillance of arboviruses circulating in humans and animals, new molecular tools are required to screen a wider panel of arboviruses. A novel high-throughput epidemiological surveillance method developed by [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] has been designed using a microfluidic system (BioMark dynamic array system, Fluidigm) capable of performing parallel real-time PCRs using 96.96 chips resulting in 9,216 individual reactions; the original design concerned 149 primers/probe sets able to detect 59 viruses (different genotypes/serotypes) which was validated on experimentally infected mosquitoes and tested using field-collected mosquitoes. Our study aims at identifying arboviruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> families in mosquitoes collected in Iran using this newly developed tool.
