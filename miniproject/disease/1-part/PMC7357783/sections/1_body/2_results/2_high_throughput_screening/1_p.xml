<p>Viral detections using the BioMark microfluidic system, able to screen 37 viral species including 95 genotypes/serotypes (detail of viruses targeted presented in the legend of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008135.g003">Fig 3</xref>), showed the presence of CHIKV in six pools collected from North Khorasan (5) and Mazadaran (1) provinces (

 <italic>longiareolata</italic> mosquitoes should be considered carefully as the pools contained engorged mosquitoes (i.e. having ingested a blood meal potentially infected). 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>maculipennis</italic> s.l. were detected positive with primers designed for the CHIKV Asian genotype. Attempts to isolate the virus failed and whole genome sequencing was not performed.
