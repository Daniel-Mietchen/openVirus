<p>Reports of CHIKV epidemics are recurrently made in countries neighboring Iran: Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Qatar [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], Yemen [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Iraq [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Saudi Arabia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>][
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], posing the threat of an emergence of CHIKV in Iran. CHIKV disseminates through displacements of viremic people and can extend locally through spreading of infected mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, other vertebrates such as monkeys [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], rodents, and birds can serve as viral reservoirs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The main CHIKV vectors are 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In Iran, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> has not been reported for more than 60 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is only present in the southeastern regions at the border with Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This latter is experimentally competent to 26 arboviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] including CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Against all expectations, this species has been involved in local transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and even Zika in Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus, even though 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is present at low densities and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is still absent, the fear of an active circulation of these arboviruses is not negligible [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Besides, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>annulirostris</italic>, 
 <italic>Mansonia uniformis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes have also been occasionally incriminated [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our screening method has detected CHIKV RNA in three species, 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>maculipennis</italic> s.l., 
 <italic>Cs. longiareolata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CHIKV infection in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>maculipennis</italic> s.l. mosquitoes. 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>maculipennis</italic> s.l. have a wide zoogeographical distribution in Iran [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>maculipennis</italic> s.l. is responsible to transmit human malaria parasites in the country [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This vector has also been reported to be infected with WNV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tritaeniorhynchus</italic> is susceptible to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and was found to be infected with RVFV in Saudi Arabia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This vector has also been incriminated in Japanese encephalitis transmission cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Both species could be infected following a blood meal on viremic travelers coming from Pakistan where CHIKV has been circulating since 2016 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The circulating CHIKV belonged to the Asian genotype, as we have detected. Extending our study to southern regions at borders with DENV- and CHIKV-epidemic countries will help in tracking 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted arboviruses and implement appropriate measures to limit arboviral introductions in Iran. Our high-throughput screening method by targeting a large range of arboviruses has succeeded in detecting unexpected viruses. This method allows performing 9,216 real-time PCRs in a single run within four hours. The cost is quite low, around $10 per reaction (from RNA extraction to virus detection) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, the instrument is still costly. However, this screening method can be adapted to different biological material (human and/or animal blood or organs) and include other arboviruses (e.g. tick-borne viruses). It can then be suggested with confidence in detecting arboviruses detrimental for human/animal health, especially in situations of viral emergences.
