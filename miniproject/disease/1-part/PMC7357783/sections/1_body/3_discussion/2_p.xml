<p>We used a newly developed high-throughput virus-detection assay based on microfluidic PCRs able to detect 64 mosquito-borne viruses in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008135.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Among 149 primers/probe sets, only four primer sets showed cross-reactivity with viruses from the same genus or serotype. This tool has been validated on field-collected mosquitoes in a large epidemiological survey in six countries/territories during the last Zika pandemic; with 17,958 mosquitoes collected, three human infecting arboviruses, ZIKV, YFV, and CHIKV, and one rare arbovirus, Trivittatus virus, were detected. In our study, we used 95 primers/probe sets targeting the different genotypes/serotypes of 37 viruses to screen 1,212 collected mosquitoes. We were able to detect CHIKV in six pools and confirmed the result by classical RT-PCR in six individual head/thorax. We failed to isolate the virus and to perform whole genome sequencing. The infection rate of 0.5% in mosquitoes we have obtained is lower than what could be estimated during an epidemic [

However this screening method can be used as a passive surveillance system alerting of any increase in infection rates in mosquitoes, sign of an imminent epidemic. In our study, we used CDC light traps and aspirators to collect night-biting and day-biting mosquitoes respectively, and were able to capture 1,212 adult females. We suggest using complementary collection tools (such as BG-sentinel traps and gravid female traps) covering more collection sites to get more chance to detect arboviruses in collected samples including
