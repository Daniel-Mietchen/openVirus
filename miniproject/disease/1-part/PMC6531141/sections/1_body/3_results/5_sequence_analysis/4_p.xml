<p>Compared with NA1 and GA2 genotypes, there are some significant amino-acid substitutions, parts of which have been found in Lanzhou and some not. Amino acid positions 215 and 230 are highly variable compared with reference strain GA2. However, this variation either in NA1 or ON1 genotypes was never shown, and the amino-acid substitutions L215P and S230P were conservatively replaced. What have been confirmed in our study is that there are 3 amino acid substitutions, that is, ON1 (232G, 253K, 290L) and NA1 (232E, 253T, 290P) viruses. Importantly, G gene in ON1 genotypes lacks 2 N-glycosylation sites due to the mutations of 2 amino acids T253K and N273Y, which has also been found in our study. Notably, compared with the ON1 prototype, because of the mutations of 2 amino acids P274S and S299N, new N-glycosylation sites occurred within the 23aa duplication and 24aa insertion of the ON1 viruses in our study, which had not been previously described.</p>
