<p>Between G genome of NA1 genotype in Lanzhou and the reference NA1 genotype, the homology of the nucleotide level is 93.5% to 97.6% and the amino acid level is 88.9% to 99.1%. However, these 2 ratios dropped respectively to 74.6% and 73.8%, showing they are different (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) despite the fact that ON1 genotype stem from NA1 genotype. Among the new RSV-A ON1 genotype, there are 3 unique substitutions of amino acid, and they are E232G, T253K, and P314L. Compared with the reference strain, there are 7 amino acids substitutions among G protein of ON1 genotype in Lanzhou as E232G, K209â€ŠM, L208P, E204G/K, I243T, L248F, and T249I. Six N-glycosylation sites, 2 ON1 genotypes (codons 237 and 318), and 4 NA1 genotypes (237, 251, 273, and 294) were identified in RSV-G gene sequences in Lanzhou. Notably in NA1 genotype, N- glycosylation sites 237 and 273 were mutually excluded. Only 1 of the 2 occurred and with a high ratio. But in ON1 genotype, the 273-glycosylation site completely disappeared and the 237 site was a stable glycosylation site. Notably for 5 ON1 strains in the 2016/2017 seasons, among two ones, a new N-glycosylation site 275 was found in 261 to 283 duplication, which was never shown before. In Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the gray areas represent N-glycosylation sites.
