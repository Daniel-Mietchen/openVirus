<p>RSV is a nonsegmented virus in the Paramyxoviridae family of Pneumovirus with a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome of 15222-nucleotide length, coding for 11 proteins.

 </sup> Among the 11 proteins encoded by the RSV genome, the attachment glycoprotein (G) is the most variable protein and has been shown to be able to accumulate amino acid changes over time. In this transmembrane glycoprotein, the first 37 amino acids of N-terminal are cytoplasmic tail, and the amino acids from 38 to 66 belong to transmembrane domain, and the ones from 67 to the end of C-terminal are extracellular region, which further divides into the first hypervariable region (HVR1, amino acids from 67 to 163) and the secondary hypervariable region (HVR2, the 187th amino acids to the end of C-terminal).

 </sup> Most molecular epidemiological studies have analyzed the G gene's hypervariable C-terminal domain, and more importantly, some studies

 </sup> also reveal that the C-terminal part of the G gene reflects the evolutionary patterns and clades of the RSV genome. Based on reactions with specific antibodies against the glycoproteins G and the distinction of RSV genome, RSV has been divided into subtypes A and B. RSV-A and RSV-B can be further classified into various genomes, for instance, RSV-A has fallen into GA1-GA7, SAA1, NA1-NA4, CB-A, and the recent ON1; and RSV-B includes GB1-GB13, SAB1-SAB4, URU1-URU2, and BA.

 </sup> It has been found in the studies that multiple genotypes can co-circulate during successive epidemic seasons. The fact that antigenic diversity and variability in the virus, especially in the second hypervariable region of the G protein, are more possible to lead to the increasing cases of RSV reinfection and the difficulty in developing a vaccine.
