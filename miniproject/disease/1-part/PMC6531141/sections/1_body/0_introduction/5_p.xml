<p>In China, there is no ongoing national surveillance published about circulating RSV, and only one study has investigated the genetic diversity of RSV-A in different seasons, till 2014,

 </sup> In this study, we have analyzed sequence data of the G gene of RSV-A strains circulating during 2010 to 2017 (7 RSV epidemics seasons) in Lanzhou. Unexpectedly, in August 2012, we detected ON1, the new RSV-A variant of the GA2 genotype identified in Ontario (Canada) in 2010,

 </sup> which demonstrated its rapid spread in the following year. Therefore, we performed an in-depth analysis of the RSV-A genotype ON1 epidemiology in Lanzhou, northwestern China. Analysis of case distribution and clinical patient data showed differences between infections with the ON1 genotype and those with previously circulating RSV-A strains. In our study, the change of ON1 was observed in a large time range from 2010 (ON1 emerged abroad) to 2017 (recently), to collect data for the development of an RSV vaccine in China and internationally. Which is of public health interest is whether increased fitness is associated with increased severity and immune evasion (with potential vaccine modality implications).
