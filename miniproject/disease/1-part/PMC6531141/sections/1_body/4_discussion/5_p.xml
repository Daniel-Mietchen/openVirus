<p>The ON1 genotype was first detected in Ontario in the winter of 2010/2011 (November 2010).
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]
 </sup> To the best of our knowledge, the earliest ON1 sequence from a non-Canadian isolate was detected in Malaysia in November 2011.
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]
 </sup> In the ensuing years, the ON1 genotype has been found in South Africa,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]
 </sup> Italy, Germany,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]
 </sup> and South Korea,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]
 </sup> indicating its rapid global dissemination during the 2012/2013 epidemic season. In China, the ON1 genotype was first reported in Beijing in 2013 (detected in November 2012),
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]
 </sup> and then in 2014, cities such as Chongqing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and other places also reported appearance of the novel genotype.
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
  <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]
 </sup> It can be inferred that Lanzhou, reported in our report, may be the earliest region of the emerging ON1 genotype in China (detected in August 2012 and spreading quickly in 2014/2015). Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that ON1 appeared and erupted 2 years later than abroad. These data demonstrate that ON1 was introduced into China from abroad, and in China's northwest, ON1 is spreading fast and completely replacing the previously genotypes, which may be the current situation of ON1 in China and worldwide.
