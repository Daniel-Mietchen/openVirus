<p>HRSV is one of the most common pathogens causing severe ARTIs, accounting for 15% to 40% of pneumonia/bronchiolitis cases in children. RSV has been detected for 61 years, but a vaccine has not yet been developed due to constant changes in RSV antigens. The biggest change reported is a 20-aa insertion in the G protein in RSV-B BA strains detected in Buenos Aires in 1999,
