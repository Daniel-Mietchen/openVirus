<p>The prevalence of ON1 varies from place to place. Among some countries such as China,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]
 </sup> Germany,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]
 </sup> and Ontario of Canada where ON1 was first detected, its prevalence remains &lt;20%
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]
 </sup>. However, in Italy,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]
 </sup> the United States, and South Korea,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]
 </sup> the prevalence of ON1 was reported between 20% and 70%. There is also study claiming that ON1 was the only RSVA genotype in Argentina, in 2014.
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]
 </sup> These data show the different prevalence of ON1 in different places and the increasing rate over time. In our study, it can be seen ON1 has strong transmission dynamics: in Lanzhou, the prevalence of ON1 reached 100% in 2 successive years. In the past, GA2 replaced GA5 as dominant genotype for 7 years, and for 5 years with BA genotype to replace RSV-B non-BA genotype, but it only took &lt;2 years for ON1 to completely replace RSV-A. Therefore, it is concluded that the strong transmission of BA genotype would be likely to be repeated by ON1 and even stronger, and ON1 would become the sole epidemic genotype of RSV-A in the next 10 years or more.
