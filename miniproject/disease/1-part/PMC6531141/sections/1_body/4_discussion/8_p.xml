<p>In our study, ON1-infected cases have the following characteristics: predominantly male young and more severe clinical symptoms such as more wheezing. However, studies in other countries report different results. According to Duvvuri's study,

 </sup> the upper respiratory infection caused by RSV-ON1 was closely related to clinically severe manifestations such as wheezing, tachypnea, and difficulty in breathing, according to Yoshihara's reports. There is report in Germany that it is more common for ON1 infectors to admit into PICU than cases caused by other RSV-A strains. But researchers suggest that it is possibly related to the epidemic peak resulted from the sudden diffusion of ON1 due to genetic differences. Moreover, it is also reported that there are no differences among clinical symptoms from different RSV-A genotypes. But it is clear that differences in results may be resulted from differences in analyses, study designs, inadequate sample sizes, differences between viruses in different locations, host/environmental differences, or even different viral characteristics all could lead to different results. In our study, the clinical symptoms of ON1 infection in children are more severe; the infection-lasting time is longer but PICU admission rate is lower and the prognosis was good. But there is another possibility that ON1 is more easily combined with other pathogens, which lead to severe symptoms, rather than ON1. However, in our study, there are no evidences of mixed infection. Therefore, a more comprehensive and standardized research is needed for further investigation of clinical features of ON1.
