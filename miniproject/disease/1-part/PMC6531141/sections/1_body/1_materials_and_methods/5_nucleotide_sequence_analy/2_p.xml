<p>All positive PCR products were sequenced by the Beijing Tianyi-Huiyuan Gene Company, purified and sequenced in the forward and the reverse directions. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the group A were edited using Bioedit v7.1.3 and aligned with reference sequences available from the GenBank database using CLUSTAL W (version 1.81). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA software 7.0.
