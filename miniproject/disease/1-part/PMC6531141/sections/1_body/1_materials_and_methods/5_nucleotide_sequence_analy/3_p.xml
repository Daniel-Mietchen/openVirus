<p>The statistical significance of the tree topology was tested by bootstrapping (1000 replicates). The nucleotide sequences of a fragment which contain the C-terminal second hypervariable region of the G gene encoding the G protein (452-nt, corresponding to codon positions 144â€“298) from RSV-A isolates in our study were determined in our study and compared with those of reference strains representing different RSV-A genotypes deposited in GenBank. The viruses detected were designated by city/group/year of isolation/isolate number.</p>
