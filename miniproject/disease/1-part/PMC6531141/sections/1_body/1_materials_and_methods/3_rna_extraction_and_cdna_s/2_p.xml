<p>Total RNA was extracted with the QIAamp extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) from a starting clinical specimen volume of 200 μL and final elution volume of 80 μL. RNA was stored at −80°C until use. For viral detection, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using random hexamer primers with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).</p>
