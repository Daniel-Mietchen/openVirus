<p>According to the statistics of the US National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS), only 26 sporadic cases of EV-D68 were reported from 1970 to 2005 [

Despite the fact that EV-D68-associated infection was previously considered infrequent, since 2005 it has undergone a worldwide burst of growth in the USA, Asia, and Europe, with an ever-increasing incidence over the past decade and a half [

As a non-polio enterovirus, EV-D68 was found to have a temporal association with a polio-like neurological disorder known as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), with symptoms such as dysneuria and muscle weakness, and a causal link is being investigated by researchers [
