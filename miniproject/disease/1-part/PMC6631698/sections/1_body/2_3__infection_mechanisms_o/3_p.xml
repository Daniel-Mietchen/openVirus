<p>In 2016, for the first time, our research team reported a protein receptor for EV-D68, the intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM5/telencephalin) [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. ICAM 5, with its nine extracellular lg domains, is the largest member of the ICAM subgroup identified so far. ICAM 5 is much more complex than other ICAMs, and its expression is enriched in the mammalian telencephalon of the central nervous system, whereas other ICAMs are mainly distributed in the immune and blood systems, such as in lymphocytes (ICAM-1 and -3), endothelial cells (ICAM-1 and -2), epithelial cells (ICAM-1), and erythrocytes (ICAM-4). As a somatodendrite-specific adhesion molecule, ICAM-5 not only participates in the interactions between the immune and nervous systems but also contributes to neuronal activity, dendrite targeting signals, and cognition [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We found that EV-D68 specifically binds to ICAM-5 and depends on it to invade host cells. EV-D68 replication and infection are clearly attenuated when ICAM5 is silenced or soluble ICAM-5 protein fragments are added. In contrast, EV-D68 replication can occur when ICAM5 is exogenously expressed in EV-D68-non-permissive Vero cells.
