<p>In the case of the sialic acid-independent strains US/MO/14-18947 (MO) and US/KY/14-18953(KY), ICAM5 is still required as a cellular receptor, and Asn54-linked glycan has proven to be critical to this process [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The identification of ICAM5 as an entry receptor for EV-D68 provides a new way to better understand EV-D68 pathogenesis, and ICAM-5-Fc has potential as a novel therapeutic application for viral intervention against disease caused by EV-D68.
