<p>In recent years, infections with the once rarely reported enterovirus D68 have increased remarkably worldwide, accompanied by severe respiratory illness and neurological complications. Infection cases are mainly diagnosed in children and young adults and have raised widespread concern. Discovery of the cellular receptors, sialic acid, and neuron-specific receptor ICAM-5, has proven essential for uncovering the mechanisms of EV-D68 pathogenesis. Meanwhile, studies of the effects of non-structural proteins on virusâ€“host interactions have revealed that the virus can promote replication by altering the cell cycle and escaping innate immunity. Thus, it appears that the development of targeted therapeutic interventions to treat EV-D68 infection that involve inhibitors of the non-structural proteins 2C, 3C, and 2A will prove worthwhile. In addition, investigation of the association between EV-D68 and AFM is important for further elucidating the clinical features of EV-D68 and revealing its virologic characteristics. However, much is still unknown about EV-D68: Its nosogenesis, the role of many viral proteins in the replication cycle of the virus, a more comprehensive, detailed picture of the interplay between EV-D68 and host immunity, genetic variation in EV-D68, and the potential for antiviral therapeutics all await further investigation.</p>
