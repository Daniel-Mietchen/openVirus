<p>The expression of cyclins and CDKs is regulated by EV-D68 to manipulate the cell cycle: On the one hand, cyclin D, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E1, and CDK2 are downregulated after EV-D68 infection to inhibit the transition from the G0/G1 to S phase; on the other hand, cyclin B1 and CDK1 are downregulated by EV-D68, promoting the transition from the G2/M to G0/G1 phase. All these effects establish favorable conditions for virus production. Furthermore, EV-D68 exerts its host cell cycle regulatory function via its non-structural proteins 3C and 3D. 3C stimulates host cells to leave the G2/M phase by decreasing the expression of CDK1 and cyclin B1; furthermore, 3D increases the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase by downregulating cyclin D, CDK4, and cyclin E1. Thus, non-structural proteins 3C and 3D function coordinately to promote viral production and infection [
