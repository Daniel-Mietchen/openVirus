<p>Studies indicate that it is difficult to discover any pathogens, including EV-D68, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AFM patients. This lack of direct evidence for a central nervous system etiology presents a major obstacle to further investigating the relationship between AFM pathogenesis and EV-D68 infection. Since 2014, EV-D68 has been detected in the spinal fluid of 4 AFM cases out of 558 confirmed cases in the USA, according to CDC [

Moreover, the autopsy of an individual who died of meningomyeloencephalitis and severe acute mixed pneumonia, with symptoms of myalgia and progressive arm weakness showed EV-D68 infection of the CSF and a characteristic histopathological pattern of enteroviral central nervous system infection [

Genomic analysis of the nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and CSF material from a cluster of 11 pediatric suspected cases of AFM in Phoenix, Arizona in September 2016 also revealed that EV-D68 was present in NP swabs of 3 of 4 confirmed cases. However, no EV-D68 was detected in the CSF samples from these patients. [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This evidence further strengthens the likelihood that EV-D68 is the etiologic agent of AFM in these cases and providing reliable biological evidence for further study of this association.
