<p>Recombination and mutations caused by the error-prone polymerase, human immune response, and population polymorphism have been recognized as the main mechanisms for enterovirus evolution [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It has been reported that the US EV-D68 outbreak in 2014 was caused by a novel clade [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; researchers detected six kinds of gene mutation, M291T, V341A, T860N, D297N, S1108G, and R2005K in a distinct clade B1 of EV-D68 strains, which were associated with the neurovirulence of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in American strains [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, through comparative analyses of EV-D68 2014 outbreak isolate sequences, Zhang et al. also identified that AFM/AFP-associated isolates belong to a single phylogenetic subclade, B1, with 12 substitutions that carry the same residues observed at equivalent positions in paralysis-causing enterovirus such as poliovirus, EV-D71, and EV-A71 [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, subclade B3, now the most prevalent EV-D68, is also reported to be associated with AFM [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Later, Huang et al. discovered three variants (C187T, C3277A, and A4020G) that differ from those previously identified through comparative genomic analysis. C3277A and A4020G cause amino acid substitutions T860N and S1108G, respectively, which are cleavage sites for the viral proteases 2A and 3C. The mutation of these sites alters the cleavage efficiency, leading to an increased rate of viral transmission and replication [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, there have been cases of infection by EV-D68 strains with neurovirulence-related mutations that have only shown non-neurologic symptoms such as respiratory illness [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This result suggests that viral gene polymorphism is necessary to cause nervous system symptoms such as AFM, but other factors also need to be considered. Nevertheless, only one case was reported in China in 2011 in which the individual was infected by the mutant strain that had the six substitutions mentioned above. In 2014, a unique R220A mutation was detected in the EV-D68 strain prevalent in China [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which might also result in changes in virulence. As in other enteroviruses, the loop sequences of the X and Y domains in the 3’-UTR of EV-D68 are complementary, but Xiang et al. found that the X loop sequences of the US 2014 outbreak EV-D68 strains were not complementary but instead identical to loop sequences of the Y domain, indicating that the structure of the 3’-UTR of the viral genome can affect viral replication. Meanwhile, all the epidemic EV-D68 American strains have C-U, C-A mutations in the 3’-UTR, a finding that may influence the phenotypes of the virus [
