<p>EV-D68 is mainly divided into four subtypes and many branches, including the original classical subtypes and recent epidemic-related branches: Clade A, Clade B, Clade C, and Clade D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00490-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The location and corresponding year of specimen collection of EV-D68 VP1 sequences have revealed that EV-D68 subtype Clade A, Clade B, and Clade C are prevalent in multiple regions of American, Europe, and Asia. Several viral subtypes have often co-circulated, but Clade C is the least common of the subtypes. The major 2014 outbreak and currently prevalent strains in the United States are represented by Clade A1, Clade B1, Clade B4, and Clade B5 subtypes, whereas, also in 2014, European countries, such as Italy and the Netherlands, found confirmed cases of Clade A1, Clade A2(which has been reclassified to Clade D since 2016), Clade B1, and Clade B2 infection. In Canada, the major prevalent strain has been Clade B2. In Asian countries such as Thailand and Japan, the detection of Clade B and Clade C have been reported, whereas the main subtypes in China have been Clade A2 (which has been reclassified to Clade D since 2016) and Clade B2 [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that genogroup replacement has occurred in China since 2006. Before August 2011, Clade A was predominant in EV-D68-infected cases in China, and other strains were only scattered. Clade B emerged in October 2011 and co-circulated with Clade A until November 2013. However, in 2014, the circulating strains shifted from Clade A to B [
