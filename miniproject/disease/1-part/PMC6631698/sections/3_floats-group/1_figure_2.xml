  <p>Phylogenetic tree of EV-D68 including acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)-related strains. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of EV-D68 strains based on nearly complete polyprotein gene (1-6388 nt of coding sequences) was constructed using the bootstrap method with 1000 replications based on the Tamura–Nei model in MEGA X. The representative circulated EV-D68 strains during past years were collected in NCBI’s GenBank sequence database (
   <italic>n</italic> = 76). AFM-related EV-D68 strains are marked in red. AFM-associated stains are mostly in subclade B1 and B3. Branch lengths are drawn proportionally to the number of nucleotide substitutions per position.
