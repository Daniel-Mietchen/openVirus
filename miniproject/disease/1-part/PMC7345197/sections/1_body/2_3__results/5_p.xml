<p>We found a small number of SNPs per sample, varying from 17 in the CHIKV to 30 in the MAYV genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-05-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>). For CHIKV, six SNPs found were non-synonymous and 11 were synonymous. For MAYV, seven SNPs found were non-synonymous and 22 were synonymous. Moreover, we found several specific mutations restricted to the genomes sequenced in this study: CHIKV presented four new amino acid mutations, two in nonstructural proteins (nsP2-T31I and nsP3-A388V) and two in an envelope protein (E3 T20I and H57R); MAYV presented two, both in the E1 protein (I425S and V427A) (
