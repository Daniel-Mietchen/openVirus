<p>We detected two previously reported CHIKV amino acid mutations in structural proteins: E2-G60D, which contributes to the increased CHIKV fitness in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and E1-T98A, which may increase the CHIKV infectivity for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the presence of E1-A226V substitution [
 <xref rid="B49-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Five amino acid mutations, that were previously described to be under positive selection and to delineate the genotype L strains on vector infection, were revealed of MAYV. We also found nsP1-L518A, nsP3-A298P, nsP3-V386T, nsP4-A249K and E1-L300T [
 <xref rid="B50-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].
