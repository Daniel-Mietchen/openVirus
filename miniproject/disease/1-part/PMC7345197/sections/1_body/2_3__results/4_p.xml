<p>The maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction of the obtained MAYV genome and a few other available MAYV genomes showed that the Sinop strain clustered within the L genotype and was closely related to the MAYV strains detected from mosquitoes in the 1960s in Par√° state (PA) in the northern region of Brazil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-05-00105-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b), showing a high aLRT SH-like support of 1.0. Meanwhile, the CHIKV genome was placed in a polytomy within a previously described Brazilian subclade that is an offshoot of the East/Central/South African lineage [
 <xref rid="B21-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which also had a high aLRT SH-like support of 1.0 (
