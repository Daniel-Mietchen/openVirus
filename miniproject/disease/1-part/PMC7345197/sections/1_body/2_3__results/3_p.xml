<p>The cycle thresholds (CTs) for the positive samples were 6.12 and 23.19 for the MAYV and CHIKV samples, respectively. We obtained 2,813,153 reads for the MAYV sample, in which 84.48% mapped to the reference genome, reaching an average coverage depth of 15,453.99; from the CHIKV positive sample, we obtained 1,123,424 reads, in which 96.47% mapped to the reference genome, reaching an average coverage depth of 7133.15 (
