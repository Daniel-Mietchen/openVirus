<p>Epidemiological surveillance based on genome-scale sequencing of the circulating viral strains is valuable for the prompt detection of adaptive mutations, which is essential for understanding transmission patterns, assessing the risk of emergence and intervening in vector control strategies [

In this study, we found new mutations in the strains of MAYV and CHIKV and observed that these strains clustered with genomes from geographically distant Brazilian states, suggesting that their spread occurred through infected patients that traveled between states. Further studies are encouraged in order to follow the spread of these viruses within the Southern Amazon region, in order to further understand the importance of mutations in the maintenance and spread of MAYV and CHIKV. This need is reinforced by the large outbreaks of CHIKV in Brazil and the underreporting of MAYV infections [
