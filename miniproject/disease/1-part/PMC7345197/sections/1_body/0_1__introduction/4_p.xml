<p>Chikungunya virus and MAYV circulate between an invertebrate vector and a vertebrate host [
 <xref rid="B13-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], involving non-human primates and arboreal 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (for CHIKV) and 
 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> (for MAYV) mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B25-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Both the Asian/Caribbean and the ECSA lineages of CHIKV can circulate in urban cycles between humans and their main vectors 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Contrastingly, the WA lineage has never switched to an urban cycle and is maintained in a sylvatic cycle, including non-human primates and sylvatic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, which are not anthropophilic but have caused sporadic human cases by biting humans in rural areas [
 <xref rid="B13-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, MAYV causes disease after spillover transmission to nearby human populations inferred as incidental or dead-end hosts [
 <xref rid="B26-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, new evidence suggests that a sustained urban transmission is also possible since 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been shown to transmit MAYV in laboratory conditions [

 <xref rid="B28-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the MAYV genome has been detected in naturally infected 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> specimens [
 <xref rid="B29-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The high prevalence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the urban environment in Brazil and other South American countries where Mayaro fever is endemic suggests that an urban cycle could be established [
 <xref rid="B25-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Based on the vector species’ habitat suitability and current knowledge about these viruses’ distribution, it is possible that both alphaviruses spread and co-circulate, causing human outbreaks [
