 <xref rid="B22-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thereafter, a surge of human cases occurred; more than 500,000 cases have been reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health [

However, studies have shown that 495 MAYV-infection cases have been detected in Brazil so far—more than half of all 901 cases reported in Latin America and the Caribbean [
 <xref rid="B17-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These data show that the two viruses are constantly infecting the human population, with dramatically different dynamics but, until now, no studies have identified their co-circulation.
