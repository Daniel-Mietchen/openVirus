<p>Most known human-infecting arboviruses belong to the families Flaviviridae, Togaviridae and Peribunyaviridae [

 <xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Viruses from the Togaviridae family are zoonotic and epizootic pathogens that cause recurrent epidemics in both human and animal populations [

 <xref rid="B12-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], such as the mosquito-borne alphaviruses chikungunya virus (CHIKV), O’nyong’nyong virus (ONNV), Ross River virus (RRV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV), and the viruses of the Western (WEEV), Eastern (EEEV) and Venezuelan (VEEV) equine encephalitides [

 <xref rid="B13-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The arthritogenic alphaviruses MAYV and CHIKV were first isolated in the 1950s [

 <xref rid="B15-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since then, MAYV has been considered endemic and enzootic in South America and the Caribbean [

 <xref rid="B17-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while CHIKV emerged in Africa but spread globally, showing a much more complex evolutionary history. Phylogenomic analyses of CHIKV have revealed three distinct genotypes: West African (WA), East/Central/South African (ECSA) and Asian/Caribbean [
 <xref rid="B18-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In Africa, both the WA and ECSA genotypes were circulating mainly enzootically among non-human primates, with occasional spillover to humans, while some ECSA lineages, such as the Indian Ocean lineage (IOL), expanded their range and have now been causing large outbreaks in the Asian continent. The Asian/Caribbean genotype is predominantly endemic/epidemic among human populations [
