<p>The whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates during epidemics and interepidemic periods can be used to uncover the pathogenâ€™s natural history and spread pattern, providing background information to guide monitoring and prevention strategies, foster vaccine development and improve diagnostics and treatment [
