<p>Viral RNA was extracted directly from the samples or cells’ supernatant using a QIamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), followed by a reverse transcription using 1 μL of random hexamers (Promega, Madison, MI, USA), 1 μL of Go Script Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and 8 μL of RNA, for a 20 μL reaction, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. A duplex-PCR was made using the genus-specific primers for alphaviruses (targeting nsP1 region) and flaviviruses (targeting NS5 region), followed by multiplex-semi-nested RT-PCR assays for species-specific identification [
