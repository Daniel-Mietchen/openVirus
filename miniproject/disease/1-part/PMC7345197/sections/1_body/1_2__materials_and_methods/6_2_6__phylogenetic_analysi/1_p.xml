Coding regions corresponding to the complete genomes from Sinop were aligned with all published and available near-complete: CHIKV genomes (&gt;8000 nucleotides), belonging to the WA, ECSA and Asian/Caribbean genotypes, totalizing 930 genomes; and MAYV genomes (&gt;8000 nucleotides), belonging to the L, D and N genotypes, totalizing 66 genomes. We also performed phylogenetic analysis using only Brazilian genomes belonging to the CHIKV ECSA genotype, totalizing 79 genomes. All genomes and data were collected from ViPR [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-tropicalmed-05-00105">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The ML phylogenies were reconstructed by using the best-fit general time-reversible (GTR) model with invariant sites (+I) (GTR + I) for MAYV, and 4 gamma substitution rate categories (+G) (GTR + G + I) for CHIKV, all suggested as the most likely models to represent the data by the Smart Model Selection implemented in version 3.0 of PhyML online [
 <xref rid="B46-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For the tree search operation, we used SPR, and statistical support for the phylogenetic nodes was evaluated by an SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test. Tree visualization and figure generation were performed with FigTree v1.4.4 [
