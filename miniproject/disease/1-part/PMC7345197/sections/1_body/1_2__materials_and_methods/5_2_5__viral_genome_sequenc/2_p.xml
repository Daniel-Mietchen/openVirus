<p>Single strand cDNA from the CHIKV positive serum sample was submitted to whole genome amplification using multiplex-PCR [
 <xref rid="B37-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], while single-strand cDNA from the MAYV sample was submitted to whole genome amplification by using multiplex RT-PCR, with primers designed using Primal Scheme [
 <xref rid="B38-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Primer design was performed with two complete genomes of MAYV belonging to the L and N genotypes (GenBank accession number KY618127 and KP842812, respectively), both detected in South America (primers can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-tropicalmed-05-00105">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Sequencing libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), using 2 ng of input cDNA derived from the CHIKV and MAYV multiplex PCRs, following the manufacturer’s instructions. A MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 of 150 cycles (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used, employing a paired-end strategy, resulting in 75 bp reads separated by 350 bp. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform at the Technological Platform Core at the Aggeu Magalhães Institute (IAM).
