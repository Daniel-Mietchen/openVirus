<p>Two PCR positive samples (one for CHIKV and one for MAYV) were assessed by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), employing the established protocols for CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B36-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and adding the MAYV primers used in the conventional PCR, in order to obtain Ct values to guide the genome sequencing strategy. Total RNA was extracted directly from the serum of the CHIKV positive sample and from the supernatant of the MAYV first passage in C6/36 cells, in order to perform the single-strand cDNA synthesis used for viral genomic amplification. RT-PCR reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 μL using Random Hexamers (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), following the manufacturers’ instructions.
