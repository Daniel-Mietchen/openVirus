<p>Trimmomatic v. 0.36 [
 <xref rid="B39-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] was employed to remove low-quality reads, adapter sequences and primers. FastQC was used to assess the quality of the Illumina raw reads. These were subsequently mapped against the MAYV BeH473130/1988 (KY618133) and CHIKV BHI3734/H804698 (KP164568) reference genomes, using Bowtie 2 with the default parameters [
 <xref rid="B40-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Consensus sequences of viral genomes were obtained through the Integrated Genome Viewer software [
 <xref rid="B41-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the sequences were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers: MH513597 and MT349960. The raw sequenced reads may be found in the European Nucleotide Archive under the project number PRJEB38124.
