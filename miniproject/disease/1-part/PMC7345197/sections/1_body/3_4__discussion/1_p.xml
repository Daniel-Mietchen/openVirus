<p>Arboviruses are widespread and diverse in Brazil and impose a large public health burden on the human population due to the abundance of sylvatic and urban vector species associated with poor sanitation and living conditions. As expected in such tropical environments, the simultaneous circulation and human co-infection of these viruses is common [
 <xref rid="B51-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], imposing a great socioeconomic impact. Most people recover from arbovirus infection with no major sequelae, although life-threatening conditions can be identified such as hemorrhagic fever, Guillainâ€“Barre syndrome and encephalitis [

Among a dozen arboviruses that currently circulate in Brazil and infect humans, dengue virus (DENV) has largely predominated, causing several thousand infections every year in the country. In 2019 alone, around 1.5 million cases were reported, and at least 782 people died from DENV infection [
