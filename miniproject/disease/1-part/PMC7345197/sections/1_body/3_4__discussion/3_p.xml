<p>Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of MAYV confirmed the circulation of the L genotype in Sinop city, as previously demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B9-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The obtained genome clustered with a genome from an isolate from the state of Pará (PA). Genotype D (widely dispersed) currently covers a broad geographic area from Trinidad and Tobago to Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Haiti and French Guiana, with several available full-genome sequences (51 genomes). On the other hand, genotype L (limited) has only a limited number of complete genomes available, consisting of ten isolates obtained over the years 1955 to 1991 from PA and two recent isolates: one from Haiti and another from the State of São Paulo, imported from PA [

Due to the limited data, it is not possible to precisely determine the L genotype’s dispersion throughout the Amazonian region and its borders. Other studies have also detected fragments of L and D genotypes in other municipalities in MT [
