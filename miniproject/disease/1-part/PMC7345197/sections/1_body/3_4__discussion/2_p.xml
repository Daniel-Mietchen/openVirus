<p>Most of the arboviral diagnoses in developing countries are based on clinical and epidemiological criteria, which leads to biased estimates of infection and produces underreports of less prevalent arboviruses that are not investigated in the molecular diagnostic routine. Such sub-notification can be clearly observed in Sinop from 2015 to 2019, where 7341 cases of DENV, 1324 of ZIKV and 15 of CHIKV were confirmed by laboratory tests, whereas the majority of the negative samples, around 44% of the cases investigated, were not tested for other arboviruses [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-tropicalmed-05-00105">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). The confirmation of chikungunya diagnosis by Mato Grosso State Department of Health has been based on MAC-ELISA, while MAYV infection has not been investigated routinely yet. Meanwhile, molecular studies using human samples in Sinop have described the silent circulation of SLEV in 2011 and 2015 [

 <xref rid="B9-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Adding up to this scenario of simultaneous arbovirus circulation, here, we confirm the circulation of CHIKV and MAYV in human samples through molecular testing and genome sequencing.
