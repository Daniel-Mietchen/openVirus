<p>Our CHIKV isolate belonged to the ECSA lineage, sharing 99.8% of its nucleotide identity with isolates from Bahia, a state in Northeast Brazil. The CHIKV genome from Sinop did not cluster with other genomes from MT [
 <xref rid="B65-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The distinct evolutionary divergence from the monophyletic MT clade suggests that CHIKV was introduced into MT by at least two independent CHIKV ECSA variants, which are likely co-circulating in the state [
 <xref rid="B66-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. With the current data, the circulation of CHIKV genotypes other than ECSA in MT cannot be ruled out, especially in light of the circulation of the Asian/Caribbean genotype in the Amazon region (states of Pará, Roraima and Amapá), highlighting the need for continuous molecular surveillance in the region.
