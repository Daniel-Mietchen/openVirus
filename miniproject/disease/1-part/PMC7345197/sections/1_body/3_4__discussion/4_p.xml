<p>We detected two non-synonymous amino acid substitutions I425S and V427A in the MAYV E1 protein, but whether these substitutions played any role in the cell entry capacity and viral persistence is unknown. Alphavirus glycoproteins E1/E2 mediate host recognition and entry into the cell [

 <xref rid="B62-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, the constant humoral immune pressure creates amino acid variations in these proteins that may lead to viral evasion, influence cross-neutralization activity and allow host-switching [

Continued genome-based molecular investigation of MAYV is recommended in order to understand the spread and maintenance of MAYV in the Southern Amazon region and assess antigenic variations that might impact cross-immunity between alphaviruses and affect the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on protein binding (immunoassays) [
