<p>As previously discussed, MAYV is endemic in the Southern Amazon region, where many outbreaks have been reported in the last decade [
 <xref rid="B9-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Considering that alphavirus antibody cross-immunity has already been reported [
 <xref rid="B72-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], people living in the Southern Amazon region may have alphavirus cross-immunity due to a previous infection by MAYV. In fact, it has been suggested that infection by CHIKV may confer cross-protection from MAYV, following the use of sera from CHIKV-exposed patients to cross-neutralize MAYV in vitro [
 <xref rid="B73-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Such cross-immunity could be the reason why CHIKV only emerged in Sinop in 2018 and has not caused large outbreaks since then. Likewise, the restricted spread of CHIKV in other MAYV endemic areas of the Amazon has been pointed out [
 <xref rid="B74-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, a comprehensive serological investigation based on neutralization assays or new diagnostic tools must be performed in order to assess the role of alphavirus cross-immunity in such areas.
