<p>Genome analysis revealed mutations E1-T98A and E2-G60D in the glycoprotein of the CHIKV strain from Sinop. The E2-G60D amino acid change was reported to contribute to CHIKV’s fitness increase in both 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and is currently detected in all the Asian/Caribbean and ECSA lineage genomes that are available. Meanwhile, the E1-T98A amino acid change has been found in all available ECSA genomes and may increase CHIKV infectivity for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the presence of E1-A226V substitution [
 <xref rid="B49-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We did not detect other amino acid changes in the E1 glycoprotein previously associated with CHIKV fitness-enhancing in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (E1-A226V, E1-K211E and E2-V264A) [
 <xref rid="B67-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (E1-A226V, E2-I211T) [
 <xref rid="B68-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], suggesting that the CHIKV lineage circulating in Sinop likely does not have a higher fitness compared to other CHIKV lineages circulating in Brazil. However, the ECSA genotype is currently spreading all over South America and infecting an abundant and diverse 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population. Since the E1-T98A amino acid substitution is fixed in all ECSA strains from Brazil, including the one sequenced in this study, if the E1-A226V change occurs, CHIKV’s lineage would likely gain increased fitness in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. In this scenario, transmission of this virus could be exacerbated throughout Brazilian and South American territories, as 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is already spread over the entire continent [
 <xref rid="B70-tropicalmed-05-00105" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Finally, other sample specific mutations were also detected in the Sinop CHIKV genome, but further genetic studies are required to understand their importance in the virus’ fitness, if any.
