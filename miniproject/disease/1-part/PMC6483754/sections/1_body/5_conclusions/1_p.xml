<p>In conclusion, the NCC epidemic is dominated by subtype B viruses linked primarily to other NCC sequences. However, the largest subtype B cluster, which retained links to the earliest North American subtype B strains, contained large numbers of links to persons in other parts of the United States, Asia, and Europe. Several sequences belonged to well characterized international clusters responsible for rapidly expanding regional epidemics. However, despite their rapid regional spread, these viruses do not appear to have made significant inroads into the NCC, suggesting that HIV-1 transmission is influenced more by human behavioral factors than intrinsic viral factors. Continued monitoring of local epidemics in the context of global sequences will advance a better understanding the past, present, and potentially future courses of regional epidemics and support public health measures to optimally target prevention efforts.</p>
