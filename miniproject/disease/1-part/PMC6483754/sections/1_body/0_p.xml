<p>Several phylogeographic studies indicate that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 subtype B was introduced into the United States from the Caribbean approximately 1970 [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the years since the epidemic was recognized, the subtype B HIV-1 lineage that initiated the US epidemic spread to many other countries [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Concurrently, non-subtype-B variants gradually increased in prevalence in the United States [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>] and other predominantly subtype-B countries [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–10</xref>]. By the early 1980s, large numbers of persons suffering from HIV-related illnesses were reported from the New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco metropolitan areas. These regions, frequent destinations for both immigration and travel, were points of origin for the global spread of the subtype B viruses.
