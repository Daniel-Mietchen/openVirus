<p>Several additional examples of how the inclusion of published sequences provides insight into transmission dynamics are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>. For example, a cluster of just 2 CRF24_BG NCC sequences was expanded to a cluster of 33 sequences involving 2 additional countries (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>). Two NCC subtype C sequences that were disconnected in the NCC-only network became hubs in a cluster of 50 sequences from 7 additional countries (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>). A cluster of 2 NCC subtype B sequences and an unconnected subtype B NCC sequence were linked to a cluster of LANL isolates from the United States and Canada (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7C</xref>), and a cluster of 4 NCC sequences was augmented with a LANL US isolate and bridged to an older cluster of LANL sequences (
