<p>Of the 1151 sequences in the 264 NCC-LANL clusters, 791 (68.7%) were directly linked to a LANL sequence, whereas 360 (31.3%) were directly linked only to other NCC sequences. Of the 791 NCC sequences directly linked to an LANL sequence, 425 (53.7%) linked solely to 1 or more US sequences, 156 (19.7%) linked solely to 1 or more non-US sequences, and 210 (26.5%) linked to both US and non-US sequences. The intricate web of interconnectivity between the NCC and LANL sequences is illustrated in
