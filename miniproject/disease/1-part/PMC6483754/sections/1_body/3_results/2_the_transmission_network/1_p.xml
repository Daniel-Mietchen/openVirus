<p>The inferred transmission network contained 679 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 3502 sequences including 415 clusters containing just NCC sequences and 264 clusters containing both NCC and LANL sequences. The 415 NCC-only clusters comprised 1240 NCC sequences (27.2% of all NCC sequences). The 264 NCC-LANL clusters included 1151 NCC sequences (25.3% of all NCC sequences) and 11 735 LANL sequences (8.4% of all LANL database sequences). Overall, 2391 of 4553 NCC sequences (52.5%) were in a cluster, and 1944 (81.3%) of those were directly linked to other NCC sequences. The majority (95.4%) of clusters contained 2 to 13 sequences, with 31 large clusters containing 14 or more sequences. Of the 28 largest clusters with both NCC and LANL sequences, 9 contained non-B viruses (
