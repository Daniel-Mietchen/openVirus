<p>Approximately 1% of NCC sequences shared 1 or more established DRMs with a previously published sequence. The vast majority were subtype B sequences from other persons in the United States, consistent with the high prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in the United States. However, the proportion of NCC TDR sequences linked to TDR sequences outside of the NCC was much lower than the 37% of NCC TDR sequences previously reported to link to 1 or more other NCC TDR sequences [
