<p>Subtype B accounted for 95.5% of the NCC sequences. The largest subtype B cluster contained many NCC sequences consistent with the fact that this lineage traces its origin to the United States [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although most of the other large subtype B clusters were dominated by US sequences, the second largest subtype B cluster, which contained 2 NCC sequences, traced its origin to Japan.
