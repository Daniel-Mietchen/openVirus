<p>Including the totality of publicly available sequences in our analysis had several measurable and important benefits. First, by comparing NCC with previously published sequences, an additional 429 NCC sequences (9.4% of the total) were brought into the network, increasing the total number of clustered NCC sequences to 2391 or 52.5% of the total. This rate is similar to the rate of 52.3% reported for a smaller and intensively sampled cohort from San Diego [

 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, the placement of individual sequences in the clusters was altered by the inclusion of previously published sequences, with NCC sequences becoming peripheral both in the large non-subtype B clusters displaying patterns of exponential growth and in many of the smaller clusters. Because HIV transmission dynamics can be strongly influenced by central nodes in transmission networks (and that there are relatively few of them), being able to more accurately identify such nodes is also important [
