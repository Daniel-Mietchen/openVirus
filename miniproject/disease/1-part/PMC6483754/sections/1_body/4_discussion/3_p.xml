<p>Non-B subtypes accounted for 4.5% of the NCC sequences, and, unsurprisingly, these were more likely to cluster with a non-US sequence. The CRF07_BC cluster, which originated in East Asia, contained 3 NCC sequences, each of which appeared to represent a separate NCC introduction. The subtype A6 cluster, which originated in countries of the former Soviet Union, contained 4 NCC sequences, each of which also appeared to represent separate NCC introductions. In contrast, the largest CRF01_AE cluster, which was dominated by sequences from East and Southeast Asia, contained 13 NCC sequences, including 2 lineages, each containing 3 sequences, consistent with instances of ongoing local transmission. Although 2 of the 3 NCC individuals in the CRF07_BC cluster and 8 of the 13 NCC individuals in the largest CRF01_AE cluster were of Asian ethnicity, the countries of origin of NCC individuals were not available. The absence of data on country of origin is a limitation of our study that makes it impossible to distinguish between immigration and local dissemination as a cause of non-subtype B diversity in our cohort.</p>
