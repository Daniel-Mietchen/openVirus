<p>Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses were performed to characterize the phylogenetic structure and transmission characteristics of several of the largest clusters. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were constructed in IQ-TREE version 1.6.5 using the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model according to Bayesian information criterion [

 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Evidence in support of the use of a molecular clock model was assessed in TempEst version 1.5.1 using linear regression of the relationship of root-to-tip genetic divergence from the best-fitting root within the maximum likelihood tree of each taxon with sampling time [
