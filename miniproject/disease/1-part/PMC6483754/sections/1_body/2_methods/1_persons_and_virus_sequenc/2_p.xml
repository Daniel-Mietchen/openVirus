<p>We searched the Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL) HIV Sequence Database, which contains all published HIV-1 sequences, to identify sequences encompassing PR and at least the first 200 amino acids of RT (HXB2 nucleotides 2253â€“3151) [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When more than 1 sequence from an individual is available, the representative sequence was selected at random per LANL protocols. When more than 1 sequence was available for persons in the NCC, we selected the earliest sequence. All LANL sequences from individuals also in the NCC were excluded from the LANL dataset. Sequences annotated as problematic by LANL were also excluded: synthetic sequences and those with high non-ACTG content, hypermutation, and potential contamination [

 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
