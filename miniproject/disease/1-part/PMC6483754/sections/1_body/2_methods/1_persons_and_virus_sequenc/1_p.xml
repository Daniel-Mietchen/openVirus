<p>We analyzed protease (PR) and reverse-transcriptase (RT) sequences from a cohort of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive persons from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program-Northern California (KPNC) undergoing genotypic resistance testing at Stanford University between 1998 and 2016 (Northern California cohort [NCC]). The KPNC is estimated to provide care to approximately 30% of the insured population in Northern California. Genotypic resistance testing for ART-naive individuals became routine in 2003 [
