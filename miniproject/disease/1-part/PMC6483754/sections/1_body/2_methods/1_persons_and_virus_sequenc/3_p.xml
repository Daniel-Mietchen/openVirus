<p>The LANL reference dataset, generated July 1, 2018, included 139 060 HIV-1 group M sequences. The LANL and NCC sequences were annotated with subtype, country, sample year, and surveillance drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The NCC sequences were subtyped using the COMET program [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The NCC sequences were also annotated with age, gender, race, and HIV acquisition risk factor. Within the NCC, a generalized binomial logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between sample year and proportion of persons with a non-B subtype.
