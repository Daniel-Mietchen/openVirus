<p>We read Souty et al's
 <xref rid="irv12636-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> paper on the declining size of influenza epidemics in France during 1984‐2017 with interest. The authors acknowledge that similar trends have been observed in other countries as well, both in Europe (eg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and in outside (New Zealand), and discuss what factor(s) could have driven the observed trend. We agree with the authors' opinion that the increased vaccination coverage is unlikely to have played a major role. In fact, vaccine uptake is low in France (as elsewhere in Europe) in the age groups that experience the highest incidence rates, that is, children, adolescents, and young adults. Consistent with this point, Sprujit et al
 <xref rid="irv12636-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> failed to find a convincing association between influenza vaccination coverage and influenza‐like illness in fourteen European countries.
