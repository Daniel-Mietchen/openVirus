  <p>Genetic evolution and spatial spread of the genogroup A hMPV lineages. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Bayesian Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree of G gene from genogroup A hMPV viruses. sequences reported in this study from Guangzhou are highlighted by orange bars. Branch colours represent the most probable ancestral locations of each branch. Four major lineages of hMPV are observed, denoted A1, A2a, A2b, and A2c. Black circles indicate posterior support &gt;0.95 at the root node of each lineage. The clusters containing major circulating strains in Guangzhou are marked with box. These clusters are enlarged and names of strains are included in (
   <bold>b</bold>,
   <bold>c</bold>). (
   <bold>b</bold>) The cluster of hMPV including the 180-nt duplication novel variant (marked with light blue bars) and 110-nt duplication variants (marked with an orange bars). Guangzhou hMPV sequences are also highlighted by red bars in (
   <bold>b</bold>,
   <bold>c</bold>). (
   <bold>d</bold>) Heatmap of nucleotide identity matrix of hMPV strains. G genes are grouped by genetic lineages and arranged according to the isolation time.
