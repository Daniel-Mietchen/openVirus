  <p>Genetic evolution and spatial spread of the genogroup B hMPV lineages. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Bayesian Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree of G gene from genogroup B hMPV viruses. sequences reported in this study from Guangzhou are highlighted by red bars. Branch colours represent the most probable ancestral locations of each branch. Four major lineages of hMPV are observed, denoted B1 and B2. Black circles indicate posterior support &gt;0.95 at the root node of each lineage. The clusters containing major circulating strains in Guangzhou are marked with box. These clusters are enlarged and names of strains are included in (
   <bold>b</bold>,
   <bold>c</bold>).
