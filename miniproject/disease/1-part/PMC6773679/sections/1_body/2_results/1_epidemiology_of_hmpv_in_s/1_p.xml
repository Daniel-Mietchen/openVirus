<p id="Par11">A total of 1,460 ARI patients (927 males and 533 females) were enrolled in Guangzhou from January 2013 to December 2017 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). HMPV was detected in 76 samples (5.2%), including 50 males and 26 females (1.92:1). No significant gender difference was observed (p = 0.669). The age of enrolled patients ranged from 1 month to 88 years, with the majority (82.7%) being children no more than 5 years (median age: 11 months, IQR, 0.3–3 years). HMPV positive cases were aged from 1 month to 81 years (median age: 1 year, IQR, 0.4–2.5 years). Half (52.6%) of infected individuals were children no more than 1 year. The distribution of HMPV prevalence among age groups was significantly different (P = 0.016), and children aged 1 to 2 years had the highest prevalence (9.1%, 15/164). The clinical presentations of hMPV infected cases included fever (69, 90.8%), cough (69, 90.8%), sore throat (38, 50.0%), expectoration (16, 90.8%), shortness of breath (10, 13.2%) and nasal discharge (6, 7.9%). The seasonal distribution showed that hMPV circulated predominantly in the period from December of the first year to May of the next (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the years 2013–2015, the hMPV detection rate was approximately even, ranging from 3.7% to 5.1%, similar with the rate detected in central and eastern China. An apparent low frequency of circulation of hMPV in the year 2016 was observed, with a low positive rate of 1.1%. However, in the year 2017, hMPV showed a remarkable increase, viruses being detected in 31 ARI cases (11.9%).
