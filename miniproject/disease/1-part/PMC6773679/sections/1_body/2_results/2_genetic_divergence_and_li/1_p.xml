<p id="Par12">To understand the lineage distribution and the cause(s) for the increase of the hMPV epidemic in 2017, 32 G genes and 51 F genes from 2013 through 2017 were sequenced. The evolution of hMPV at the global level was investigated by integrating all other publicly available G gene and F gene sequences (Materials and Methods). Due to the great genetic distance observed between two genogroups of hMPV (nucleotide identity of G gene between A and B groups is less than 57%), sequences from A and B genogroups were analyzed separately (Figs
