<p id="Par14">The phylogeographic analysis of the G gene showed a spatial pattern of hMPV lineages. Strains near the root of genogroup A primarily circulated in America (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Although an American origin for the genogroup A of hMPV seems the most probable (posterior probability = 1.0), this might also be caused by sampling biases. Between 1990 and 2005, hMPV infections began to be detected in other continents. Notably, regional clusters of hMPV were observed in lineages A1 and A2a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), suggesting the local circulation of these hMPV viruses. However, these circulations were always temporal as the regional phylogenetic clusters in A1 and A2a lineages were only persistent during 2–3 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).
