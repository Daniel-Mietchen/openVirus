<p id="Par3">HMPV is a single stranded, negative sense and enveloped RNA virus. The viral RNA is approximately 13 kb in length, containing eight genes coding for nine proteins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. The fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins are two major hMPV surface glycoproteins that have played important roles in viral replication and host immune response
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup> and have been largely used to study hMPV genetic variation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Based on the genetic variability of the F and G genes, hMPV is classified into two main genetic groups, A and B, which are further divided into five lineages known as A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. There may no direct association between the genotypes and the clinical courses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. However, antigenic variance is observed among different genetic lineages of hMPV in animal models and human infection cases
