 </sup>. The great genetic distance between two genogroups (A and B) of hMPV indicates the origin of hMPV should be much earlier. To date, the molecular evolution, spatial distribution, and transmission of hMPV have not been adequately studied. Molecular surveillance will also be helpful to understand the transmission pathways and to confirm the source of infection, when it is analyzed in conjunction with standard epidemiological investigation. In this study, we performed molecular surveillance on hMPV in Guangzhou, China in 2013â€“2017. By integrating all publicly available data, we described the spatial dynamics of different hMPV lineages. The establishments of hMPV were identified in Asian countries after 2005. Moreover, frequent transmissions of hMPV strains and the seeding of novel variants were observed in China and Japan, highlighting the risk of an hMPV epidemic in these regions.
