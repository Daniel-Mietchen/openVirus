<p id="Par10">Compared to the F gene, more hMPV G gene sequences from different regions were available in the public database. Therefore, we performed the phylogeographic analysis on genogroup-A and genogroup-B G gene sequences separately to provide an outline of hMPV distribution and transmission. As previously described

A subset of 1,000 trees was randomly drawn from the combined posterior distribution of trees and used as an empirical distribution for subsequent phylogeographic analysis
