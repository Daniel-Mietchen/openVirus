<p id="Par8">For hMPV positive samples, the viral RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a SuperScript™ IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA). Then the full length of F and G genes was amplified using traditional nested PCR with primers newly designed in this study. Primers used for G gene amplification were: hMPV-G-F: 5′-GAGAACATTCGRRCRATWGAYATG -3′, hMPV-G-R1:5′-AGATARACATTRACAGTRGAYTCA-3′, and hMPV-G-R2:5′-C AAYAACAGGGTTTTCYAYAGCA-3′. The primer sets for F gene were: outer primers set hMPV-F-F1-5′-CAATGCAGGTATAACACCAGCAATATC-3′ and hMPV -F-R1 5′-GCAACAATTGAACTGATCTTCAGGAAAC-3′, and inner primers set hMPV-F-F2-5′-ACATGCCAACATCTGCAGGACAAATAAAAC-3′ and hMPV-F- R2 5′- ACATGCTGTTCACCTTCAACTTTGC-3′. The PCR products were purified and sequenced using an ABI3730xl DNA Analyzer at IGE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). In total, 51 and 32 samples (out of the total 160 RT-PCR positive samples) F and G genes were sent for sequencing, respectively. Sequences generated in this study have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers MK450165-MK450246).</p>
