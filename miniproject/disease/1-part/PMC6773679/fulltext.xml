Fundamental questions concerning the dynamics of viral evolution and transmission at both regional and global scales remain unanswered. In this study, we obtained 32&#x02009;G gene and 51&#x02009;F gene sequences of hMPV in Guangzhou, China in 2013&#x02013;2017. Temporal and spatial phylogenetic analyses were undertaken by incorporating publicly available hMPV G gene (978) and F gene (767) sequences. The phylogenetic results show different global distribution patterns of hMPV before 1990, 1990&#x02013;2005, and 2006&#x02013;2017. A sharply increasing hMPV positive rate (11%) was detected in Guangzhou 2017, mainly caused by the B1 lineage of hMPV. A close phylogenetic relation was observed between hMPV strains from China and Japan, suggesting frequent hMPV transmissions between these regions. These results provide new insights into hMPV evolution, transmission, and spatial distribution and highlight Asia as a new epicenter for viral transmission and novel variant seeding after the year 2005. Conducting molecular surveillance of hMPV in Asian countries is critical for understanding the global circulation of hMPV and future vaccine design.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>Viral genetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2018A030313205)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong (2018B020207006), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou (201804010030).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), first identified in 2001, is a major viral respiratory pathogen that worldwide reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Retrospective serologic studies demonstrated 100% seroprevalence of hMPV antibodies among children &#x02264;5 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, reinfection can occur throughout life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, further contributing to the prevalence of hMPV. Clinical features of HMPV infection are similar to those associated with human respiratory syncytial virus infection, ranging from mild respiratory illnesses to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Children under five years, aged adults, and patients with underlying diseases are more likely to develop severe diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">HMPV is a single stranded, negative sense and enveloped RNA virus. The viral RNA is approximately 13&#x02009;kb in length, containing eight genes coding for nine proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins are two major hMPV surface glycoproteins that have played important roles in viral replication and host immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and have been largely used to study hMPV genetic variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Based on the genetic variability of the F and G genes, hMPV is classified into two main genetic groups, A and B, which are further divided into five lineages known as A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. There may no direct association between the genotypes and the clinical courses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Strains near the root of genogroup A primarily circulated in America (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Although an American origin for the genogroup A of hMPV seems the most probable (posterior probability&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0), this might also be caused by sampling biases. Between 1990 and 2005, hMPV infections began to be detected in other continents. Notably, regional clusters of hMPV were observed in lineages A1 and A2a (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), suggesting the local circulation of these hMPV viruses. However, these circulations were always temporal as the regional phylogenetic clusters in A1 and A2a lineages were only persistent during 2&#x02013;3 years (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">In contrast, a cluster in A2b, early detected in America, dominantly circulated in Asian countries after 2005 when the hMPV surveillances started in these regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This cluster was persistent in Asia for more than 10 years, and the transmissions of this cluster of strains from Asia to other continents were observed. More obviously, the young lineage A2c most likely originated around 2001 (1997&#x02013;2003, 95%HPD) and was well established in Asian countries. Current surveillance data showed A2c was now the major epidemic lineage in genogroup A. A similar pattern was observed for the F gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The A2c lineage of hMPV was endemic in Asia as the F gene phylogeny and introductions of A2c strains from Asia into other continents were observed after 2010 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In genogroup B, the sequences near the root of the phylogenetic tree were also mainly from America (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Lineages B1 and B2 of hMPV were established in Asian countries after 2010, and thereafter hMPV transmissions between Asia and Europe were frequently observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Continental distribution of hMPV genetic lineages in year 1980&#x02013;2005 and 2006&#x02013;2017.

Then, the next intriguing question became how hMPV circulated at a country level. In particular, the increasing epidemic of hMPV in Guangzhou in 2017 was caused by the local strains circulating in previous seasons or the strains being imported from another region. The phylogenetic analyses of hMPV strains isolated in Guangzhou 2013&#x02013;2017 showed the predominant lineage was varied in different years (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Based on the phylogeny of F genes, 26, 1, 15, and 10 strains were classified into A2c, A2b, B1, and B2 lineages, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In 2017, we identified one HMPV A2c strain with 111nt-dup in the G gene (P17072_GD-CHN_110ntDup_2017, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). This strain is closely related with the 111nt-dup hMPV novel variant most recently identified in Japan in 2017<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Notably, all these novel variants were scattered in a cluster of A2c lineage, indicating these variants were likely the result of multiple incidences of mutations rather than having evolved from a single mutation strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). In this scenario, the mutation leading to a duplication fragment in the G gene may easily have occurred for hMPV. In Guangzhou, hMPV infections were mainly caused by A2c, B1, and B2 lineage strains and none of the A1 and A2a lineage strains were identified in hMPV infection cases (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Notably, in 2017, B1 lineage strains replaced the A2c and were likely the major causative strains leading to the increasing epidemiology of hMPV infections in Guangzhou (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). To trace the transmission of hMPV, we reconstructed the potential origins of Guangdong hMPV strains based on the phylogeny of the G gene. The hMPV strains isolated in Guangzhou in different years were always closely related (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref>). However, the contemporary strains from Japan were always clustered together with strains of Guangzhou, highlighting the frequent transmissions among cities in China and Japan. The B1 strains causing the increasing hMPV epidemic in Guangzhou 2017 were more likely imported from Japan since closely related sequences were not found in Guangzhou but in Japan in the previous season (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par17">Despite the first isolation in 2001, serological data suggested hMPV has been circulating globally for more than 50 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The great genetic distance between two genogroups (A and B) of hMPV indicates the origin of hMPV should be much earlier. To date, the molecular evolution, spatial distribution, and transmission of hMPV have not been adequately studied. Molecular surveillance will also be helpful to understand the transmission pathways and to confirm the source of infection, when it is analyzed in conjunction with standard epidemiological investigation. In this study, we performed molecular surveillance on hMPV in Guangzhou, China in 2013&#x02013;2017. By integrating all publicly available data, we described the spatial dynamics of different hMPV lineages. The establishments of hMPV were identified in Asian countries after 2005. Moreover, frequent transmissions of hMPV strains and the seeding of novel variants were observed in China and Japan, highlighting the risk of an hMPV epidemic in these regions.</p><p id="Par18">The spatial transmission pattern of a virus is very important for epidemic control and potential vaccine design. Viruses like H3N2 seasonal influenza virus are highly transmissible, and a new adaptive variant can rapidly spread globally after its emergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Thus, in the phylogeny of H3N2, it is rare to have a genetic cluster that is persistent and limited in a specific region. A sink-source model of H3N2 viral ecology is suggested in which new variants are seeded from the tropics (mainly East and Southeast Asia) to sink populations in temperate regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In contrast, viruses like enterovirus A 71 (EVA71) are more endemic, and different genetic subtypes circulate and persist in different regions. For instance, the C4a sub-genotype of EVA71 mainly circulates in mainland China, while the C5 genotype of EVA71 is mainly detected in Vietnam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The establishment and prevalence of the specific sub-genotype of a viral species could be determined by environment factors, population immunity, and/or the genetic background of hosts in this region. Here, we trace the global as well as local hMPV distribution and transmission by integrating publicly available sequences and newly generated sequences. We find that hMPV was endemic in America before 1990, indicating the possible origin of currently circulating hMPV lineages. Notably, this could be the case because hMPV was limited to circulating in America or could be caused by sampling bias as there were few samplings on other continents before 1990 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Further retrospective study of hMPV in other continents would improve our understanding of the origin of hMPV. Between 1990 and 2000, transmissions from America to other continents were observed. However, most of these introductions were transient since the local phylogenetic clusters of hMPV were not sustained in the phylogeny, indicating hMPV was still not well established in the regions. After 2005, clusters of hMPV mainly composed by strains in A2b and A2c lineages became dominant in Asian countries. Thereafter, transmissions from Asia to other continents were frequently identified through the phylogenetic trees (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). These results suggest the establishment of A2b and A2c lineages in Asia after 2005, and more Asian countries became epicenters for hMPV. In this scenario, it is reasonable to have novel variants of hMPV first identified in Asian regions. The 180-nt and 111-nt duplicates of hMPV in the G gene were first reported in Japan in 2016 and 2017, and these newly emerged variants caused an increasing epidemic in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In Guangzhou, the duplicate variant was also detected and closely related with the strains identified in Japan with nucleotide identity at 99.3% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). A2c was the predominant lineage identified in hMPV epidemics in Guangzhou, China 2013&#x02013;2015. However, the increasing epidemic of hMPV infection in Guangzhou in 2017 was mainly caused by the B1 strains which were closely related viruses circulating in Japan in 2016 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results suggest the predominant hMPV lineage is varied among Asian countries in the same epidemic season, and rotation of these predominant lineages may be observed among these countries due to frequent viral transmissions.</p><p id="Par19">Infections of hMPV were recently investigated in multiple regions of China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Different seasonal patterns were observed in different climatic zones. In central China, hMPV is predominantly detected in winter and spring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In northwest China, the annual peak of hMPV infection is observed in September through October<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, in Guangzhou in southern China, the seasonal peaks of hMPV were detected mainly in March through May (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although the temporal distribution and clinical symptoms of hMPV have been reported, the representative genetic sequences of hMPV in different regions of China are rarely investigated. Therefore, the geographic distributions and the transmission dynamics of hMPV lineages among different regions of China are still little understood. Our genetic description and analysis of hMPV viruses in southern China provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology of this emerging virus in China.</p><p id="Par20">In summary, our genetic and epidemiological analyses show that hMPV displayed different distribution and transmission patterns before 1990, 1990&#x02013;2005, and 2006&#x02013;2017. The firm establishment and continuous evolution of hMPV is observed in Asian countries after 2005, leading to the emergence of novel variants and the global transmission of these variants. In addition, close relations are observed among hMPV strains from China and Japan through the whole phylogenies. Therefore, careful monitoring of hMPV should be conducted throughout Asian countries to illustrate virus circulation in the area and sound an alarm for global hMPV surveillance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
