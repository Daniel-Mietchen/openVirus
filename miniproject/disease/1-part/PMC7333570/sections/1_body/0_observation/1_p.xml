<p>Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), a single positive-strand RNA virus, is a member of the 
 <italic>Picornavirus</italic> family and 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus. This virus is the main pathogen for hand, foot, and mouth disease, which is associated with severe neurological manifestations, and it has many times been associated with outbreaks and epidemics over the world (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, the pathogenic mechanism of EV-A71-caused severe diseases is poorly defined due to the lack of simple and proper animal models. It is very difficult to use nonhuman primates as animal models because of the ethical and cost problem. Previous studies established infection models by mouse-adapted viruses which were generated after serial passages of the parental EV-A71 strain in mice or in mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells and increased the virulence of the EV-A71 clinical isolates in mice (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, the generation of mouse-adapted viruses is elaborate and could increase artificial mutations. Alternatively, clinical isolates would not need adaptation to transgenic mice or immunodeficient mice. However, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infection with these special mice is limited to study the pathogenesis of EV-A71 infection in some respects.
