<p>The sEVs are now considered new extracellular functional carriers which could transport protein, nucleic acids, and lipids, etc., to neighboring cells. They also play an important role in viral spread (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Viruses could transmit the infection and evade the immune system by EVs cloaking viral proteins and viral genomes (
