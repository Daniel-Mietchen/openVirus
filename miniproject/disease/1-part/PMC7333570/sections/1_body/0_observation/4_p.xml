<p>In consideration that sEVs could transfer their cargo across the blood-brain barrier (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), it may be related to EV-A71 infection in the CNS. We separated the sEVs from EV-A71 clinical isolate-infected cells by using differential ultracentrifugation with further isopycnic gradient centrifugation and identified the sEVs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blotting (WB). These sEVs containing viral RNA are infectious

Compared with the EV-A71 clinical isolate, these infectious sEVs showed greater neurovirulence and more fatality in the mouse model with intraperitoneal injection. This present model could be generated easily by isolated sEVs and is useful for studying the pathogenesis of enterovirus-associated diseases.
