<p>To study the permeability of sEVs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we established the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> static BBB model by coculturing brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) and astrocytes from neonatal mice in the transwell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). To compare permeabilities between EV-A71 and sEVs, EV-A71 and sEVs with the same quantity of EV-A71 RNA were added in the BMEC of the upper side of the BBB model, respectively, and then the level of EV-A71 RNA of the bottom side was measured by qRT-PCR after 3 h. The ratio of upper/bottom viral RNA quantity was calculated as a measure of permeability. Obviously, sEVs crossed the BBB more efficiently than EV-A71 (
