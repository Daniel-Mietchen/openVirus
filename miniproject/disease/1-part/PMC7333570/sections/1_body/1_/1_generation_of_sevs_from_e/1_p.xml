<p>In order to separate sEVs with high specificity, we used differential ultracentrifugation with further isopycnic gradient centrifugation to isolate sEVs from the cells infected by the clinical EV-A71 isolate. The sEVs floating at 1.09 to 1.14 g cm
 <sup>−3</sup> were collected and identified. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed mostly empty sEVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and a few sEVs containing virus-like particles which were 27- to 30-nm compact particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) showed sEVs concentrated on the size of 118.1 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The positive markers and negative markers of EVs were verified by immunoblotting, and the viral capsid protein VP1 was in the sEVs (
