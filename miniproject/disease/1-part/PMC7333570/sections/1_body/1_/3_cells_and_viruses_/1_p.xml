<p>NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Cells were infected with EV-A71 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Then, cells were rinsed and further incubated with prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS which had been ultracentrifuged to remove EVs. The cells were collected, cracked by three freeze-thawing cycles, and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Infectious virus titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay as described elsewhere (
