<p>In our study, we increased EV-A71 susceptibility in mice by the sEVs released from EV-A71-infected NIH/3T3 cells which originated from mice. According to guidelines (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), sEVs were separated from the culture of EV-A71-infected cells by ultracentrifugation and isopycnic gradient centrifugation with high specificity. We inoculated EV-A71 in mice by intraperitoneal injection and monitored their clinical symptoms. The results showed sEVs could cause a higher rate of death and more severe CNS infection in neonatal mice, and the level of EV-A71 RNA replication in brain and gut of mice was higher than for EV-A71 virus. EV-A71 could only attach or/and enter the cells via binding EV-A71 receptors on the surface of the infected cells, while the sEVs could transport the cargo without any receptor. In consideration that sEVs could cross the blood-brain barrier by transcytosis (
