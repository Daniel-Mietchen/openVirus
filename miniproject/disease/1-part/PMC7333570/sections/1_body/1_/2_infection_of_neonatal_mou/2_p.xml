<p>At 3 days postinfection (dpi), the mice infected with sEVs lost weight obviously whereas the mice infected with EV-A71 did not lose weight apparently (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">B</xref>). Within 7 days, the mortality rate of mice infected with sEVs was 86.7% whereas the mortality rate of mice infected with EV-A71 was only 46.7% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). To validate viral replication in tissues of infected mice, we collected the main infected tissues, the brain and gut, after the mice died by infection or euthanasia at 7 dpi and quantified the viral RNA. The viral RNA levels in brain and gut tissues in the sEV-infected group were significantly higher than those in the EV-A71-infected group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). At the same time, histological examination was performed on the brain; consistent with the previous results, numerous histopathological changes were observed in the sEV-infected group: some nerve cells had fatty or vesicular degeneration and the number of inflammatory cells was increased obviously. However, the EV-A71-infected group exhibited mild neuropil vacuolation and neuronal loss in brainstem reticular formation (
