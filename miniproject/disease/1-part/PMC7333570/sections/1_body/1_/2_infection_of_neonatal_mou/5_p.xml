<p>The majority of studies tried to adapt EV-A71 in mice or mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells because EV-A71 which was isolated from human samples failed to infect mice efficiently. The results showed this was an effective method; however, virus replication may be affected by the mouse immune system during this long process, and the disease in EV-A71-infected mice was readily attenuated by anti-EV-A71 antibody (
