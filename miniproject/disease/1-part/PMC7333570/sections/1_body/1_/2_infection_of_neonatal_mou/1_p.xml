<p>To explore whether sEVs released from EV-A71 clinical isolate-infected cells could effectively infect the neonatal mice, we respectively inoculated sEVs and the EV-A71 clinical isolate at a dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mouse by intraperitoneal injection. Compared with intracranial injection, intraperitoneal injection could avoid the influence of challenge methods on the brain and simulate the pathogenesis of EV-A71 factually.
