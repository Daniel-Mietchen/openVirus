<p>The size and concentration of sEVs derived from EV-A71-infected cells were analyzed using the ZetaView PMX 110 (Particle Metrix, Meerbusch, Germany) and configured with a scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera and blue 488-nm laser. For ZetaView analysis, sEVs were diluted in 2â€‰ml PBS, collected, and analyzed by the ZetaView 8.04.02 SP2.</p>
