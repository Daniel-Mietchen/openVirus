<p>For all experiments, 1-day-old ICR mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Centre of Jiangsu University. They were housed together in an environment of 50% humidity at 22°C under a 12-h light/dark cycle and kept with their mothers to provide food (

 <sub>50</sub>, 20 μl per mouse), respectively, by intraperitoneal injection. One group was administered PBS (20 μl per mice) as a control. The mice were monitored for 5 days for clinical symptoms and were sacrificed if the mice met the following criteria: lethargy, hind limb paralysis, hypothermia of &lt;33.5°C, or death. Brain tissues were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After being embedded in paraffin and sliced, the brain sections (10 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for morphological examination. Ten sections of brain were observed per mouse in a blind manner.
