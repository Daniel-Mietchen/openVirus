  <p>sEVs showed stronger neurovirulence than EV-A71 in the mouse model. (A and B) Size (A) and weight (B) differences of mice in different treatment groups at 3 dpi. (C) Survival curve of mice after injection. (D) Absolute quantification of EV-A71 RNA in gut and brain was performed by qRT-PCR. The virus RNA copies for various tissues of each infected mouse were shown as mean for three independent experiments. The viral RNA loads of different treatment groups were compared. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U test. (E) Representative H&amp;E images of brain damage. The EV-A71-infected group exhibited mild neuropil vacuolation and neuronal loss (arrows), and the sEV-infected group exhibited numerous inflammatory cells and vesicular degeneration (arrows). A representative result is shown. In all panels: *, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05; **,
