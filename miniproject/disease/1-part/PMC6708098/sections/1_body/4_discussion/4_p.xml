<p> The overall prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B) (8.7%) in our study was lower than that found in the previous works (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We believe that the rate of respiratory syncytial virus in our study could be even higher since infection with respiratory syncytial virus in a significant proportion of patients is asymptomatic. In accordance with our findings, some studies also found that although both subtypes are infectious and circulate annually, but subtype A is the main cause of respiratory syncytial virus infection which can cause more severe complications (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, and fever were most frequently symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus infection in our investigated population. It was interesting that the majority of dyspnea cases (n=5; 62.5%) was seen in respiratory syncytial virus infection in compared with other viral infections.
