<p> Our study revealed that influenza viruses (particularly influenza B) also have an important role in causing respiratory viral infection along with respiratory syncytial virus with prevalence rate of 9.7% among military trainees. Interestingly, despite the lack of adenovirus vaccination program in Iranian military health system, we reported a low rate of adenovirus (n=6; 1.5%) in military trainees. It may be explained by the fact that influenza infection tends to occur in the winter, while adenovirus infection is more likely to occur in the spring, summer, and fall seasons. In fact, seasons can be used to help the in differential diagnosis of FRI among military trainees. It should be noted that our investigation was only performed during the winter months. </p>
