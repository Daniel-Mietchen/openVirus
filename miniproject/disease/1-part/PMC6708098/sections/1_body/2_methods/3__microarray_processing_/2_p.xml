<p> This system was based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for amplifying a specific 120â€“330 bp target of the viral genome. RT-PCR was performed in two different ready-to-use amplification tubes. Amplified products were labeled with biotin in the course of the process. After the amplification, biotin-labeled products were hybridized with their respective specific probes immobilized at different sites in the array. Next, the samples were incubated with the streptavidin-peroxidase to generate insoluble products which precipitate at the hybridization sites in the array. Hybridization happened in a low-density microarray containing triplicate probes specific to viruses. </p>
