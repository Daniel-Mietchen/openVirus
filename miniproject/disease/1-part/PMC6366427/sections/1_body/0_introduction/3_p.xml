Majority of populations infected with arboviruses have mild disease and recover rapidly, except dengue and Rift Valley fever differ in severity; based on several studies in different locations in Sudan such as northern Khartoum and New Halfa Hospital in eastern region [

 <xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]. The clinical characteristics and symptoms of most of arboviruses are divided into two subgroups: neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive.
