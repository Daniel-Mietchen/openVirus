  <p>IAV replication is abrogated in dKO cells. (a to c) Control (black), AKO (red), BKO (blue), and dKO (purple) cells were infected with H3N2 Victoria 6:2 reassortant virus with PR8 hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes, H5N1 A/Tky/50-92 (PB2-627K) 5:3 reassortant virus with PR8 HA, neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein (M) genes, or pH1N1 England 195, respectively (MOI = 0.005) and incubated at 37°C in the presence of 1 μg/ml trypsin to allow multicycle replication. Supernatants were harvested at the indicated number of days postinfection (dpi) and PFU · ml
   <sup>−1</sup>, established by plaque assay on MDCK cells. (d) dKO cells were transfected with equimolar amount of ANP32A and ANP32B expression plasmids 6 h prior to infection with H1N1 PR8 virus (MOI = 0.005). Cells were incubated at 37°C in the presence of 1 μg/ml trypsin, and supernatants were collected at indicated time points. Data shown are mean PFU · ml
   <sup>−1</sup> measured by plaque assay on MDCK cells. LOD (dotted line) denotes the limit of detection based on the dilution factor in plaque assays. All infection experiments were repeated at least twice. Graphs shown are of one representative triplicate assay. Statistical significance was calculated per time point by Student’s
