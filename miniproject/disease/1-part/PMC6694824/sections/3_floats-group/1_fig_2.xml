  <p>Exogenous ANP32 expression recovers polymerase activity in dKO cells. (a to d) Minigenome assays in eHAP1 dKO cells with coexpressed Empty vector (Empty), FLAG-tagged ANP32A, ANP32B, or ANP32A and ANP32B expression plasmids. Accompanying Western blots show expression of FLAG-tagged ANP32 constructs alongside respective vRNP components (representative of one minigenome assay). Data shown are firefly activity normalized to 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> plotted as mean (SD) obtained by one-way ANOVA from one representative repeat (
   <italic>n</italic> &gt; 3). Ns, not significant; **, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ****, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001. (e) Expression from IAV minigenome encoding NLS-tagged BFP in eHAP1 dKO cells exogenously reconstituted with mCherry-tagged ANP32A or ANP32B. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding 50-92 PB1, PB2 627K, and PA-GFP, as well as NP, and either mCherry-tagged ANP32A or ANP32B and a blue fluorescent protein (BFP-NLS) minigenome reporter.
