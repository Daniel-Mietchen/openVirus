<p>Influenza virus requires the host cell machinery to support replication of its genome and production of new virions. The influenza genome is made up of eight segments of single-stranded negative-sense RNA (vRNA). Each segment is packaged in a double helical loop structure bound by nucleoprotein (NP) along its length, except for the pseudocomplementary 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions that comprise the promoter (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These termini instead associate with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by the virus (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This key enzyme, a heterotrimer of polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA), functions as both a transcriptase and a replicase (reviewed by te Velthuis and Fodor [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A viral complex containing RNA, NP, and RdRp is termed a ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which, depending on the sense of the RNA, is either a vRNP or a cRNP.
