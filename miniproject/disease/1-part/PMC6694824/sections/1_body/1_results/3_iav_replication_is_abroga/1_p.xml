<p>To investigate the consequence of absence of ANP32A or ANP32B proteins on infectious IAV replication in human cells, control, single-knockout, and double-knockout cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005 with three different viruses whose genetic content corresponded to the polymerase constellations tested in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, i.e., from Vic/75, Tky/50-92 (E627K), or Eng195. While virus replicated to high titers in control and single-knockout (KO) cells, replication in dKO cells was completely abrogated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>). This suggests that viral proteins such as NEP and NS1 (expressed during viral infection but not provided in the minigenome assay) cannot overcome the block in replication imposed by the absence of ANP32 proteins. Replication of the H1N1 laboratory-adapted strain A/PR/8/34 was also abrogated in dKO cells (data not shown). Reconstitution of dKO cells with both ANP32A and ANP32B proteins by transient transfection prior to infection restored PR8 virus replication (
