<p>We identified a single amino acid in LRR 5 at position 130 that was the same in human ANP32A or ANP32B and MusB (aspartic acid, D) but which differed in MusA (alanine, A) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">f</xref>). Introduction of a D130A single-point mutation in human ANP32A significantly reduced its ability to support Vic75 polymerase activity, and conversely, introduction of A130D to MusA produced a small but significant increase in its ability to support viral polymerase (
