<p>In order to measure influenza virus polymerase activity, pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding PB1 (0.04 μg), PB2 (0.04 μg), PA (0.02 μg), and NP (0.08 μg) from each virus [H3N2 Victoria, H5N1 (PB2-627K) 50-92, pH1N1 England 195, or IBV Florida 06] were transfected into 200,000 eHAP1 or A549 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) at ratios of 2 μl P3000 reagent per μg plasmid DNA and 3 μl Lipofectamine 3000 reagent per μg plasmid DNA. As reporter constructs, we transfected 0.04 μg PolI-luc, which encodes a minigenome containing a firefly reporter flanked by either influenza A or B promoter sequences, or, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, PolI-BFP. pCAGGS-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (0.04 μg) was transfected as a transfection and toxicity control. For exogenous expression, 0.1 μg pCAGGS plasmid encoding either the relevant FLAG-tagged 
 <italic>Anp32</italic> gene or Empty pCAGGS was coexpressed with the RNP components. The ratio of transfected plasmids was constant at all times, namely 2:2:1:4:2:2:5 PB1:PB2:PA:NP:PolI reporter:
 <italic>Renilla</italic>:ANP32/Empty (if present). At least 20 h posttransfection, cells were lysed in 100 μl passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) was used to measure bioluminescence on a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). In the case of a PolI-BFP reporter, please refer to the “Fluorescence microscopy” paragraph below. All minigenome assays were repeated in triplicate at least twice.
