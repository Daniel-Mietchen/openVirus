<p>Total RNA from 200,000 to 250,000 PR8-infected eHAP1 cells was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), with 30 min of on-column DNase I treatment (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were established by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop; Thermo Scientific), and equal amounts (500 ng) were subjected to cDNA synthesis using RevertAid reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific). PR8 segment 6 (neuraminidase [NA]) RNA species (vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA) were isolated using 5′-tagged primers (

 <underline>CCAGATCGTTCGAGTCGT</underline>TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGAACAGACTAC, respectively (tags underlined). Unique fragments of the NA gene were then amplified by real-time quantitative PCR using Fast SYBR green master mix (Thermo Scientific), using the following primers: GGCCGTCATGGTGGCGAAT and CCTTCCCCTTTTCGATCTTG (vRNA,148 bp), CTTTTTGTGGCGTGAATAGTG and GCTAGCTTCAGCTAGGCATC (cRNA, 108 bp), or CTTTTTGTGGCGTGAATAGTG and CCAGATCGTTCGAGTCGT (mRNA, 87 bp) Quantitative PCR analysis was carried out on a Viia 7 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher). Gene expression was calculated by normalizing target gene expression to threshold cycle (
