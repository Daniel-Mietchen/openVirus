<p>At least 250,000 cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with a cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) and prepared in Laemmli 2× buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) after protein concentration had been established by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop; Thermo Fisher). Equal amounts of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE using Mini Protean TGX precast gels 4% to 20% (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting by semidry transfer (Bio-Rad Trans-Blot SD semidry transfer cell) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Protran Premium 0.2-μm NC; GE Healthcare) was carried out using the following primary antibodies: rabbit α-vinculin (catalog number ab129002, 1/1,000; Abcam), rabbit α-ANP32A (catalog number ab51013, 1/500; Abcam), mouse α-ANP32B (66160-1-Ig, 1/1,000; Proteintech) or rabbit α-ANP32B (10843-1-AP, 1/1,000; Proteintech), mouse α-IAV NP (catalog number ab128193, 1/1,000; Abcam), mouse α-IBV NP (catalog number ab20711, 1/1,000; Abcam), mouse α-FLAG (catalog number F1804, 1/500; Sigma-Aldrich), and rabbit α-IAV PB2 (catalog number GTX125926, 1/4,000; GeneTex). The following secondary antibodies were used: sheep α-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (catalog numberAP510P, 1/10,000; Merck) and goat α-mouse HRP (STAR117P, 1/5,000; AbD Serotec). Protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagent; GE Healthcare) using a Fusion-FX imaging system (Vilber Lourmat). Western blots in
