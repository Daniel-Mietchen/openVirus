<p>At least 200,000 cells were cultured on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected or infected as described. Cells transfected with plasmids encoding fluorescent proteins (BFP, GFP, or mCherry) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then visualized. Cells transfected with plasmids encoding (FLAG-tagged) nonfluorescent proteins were fixed and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-FLAG F7425 (Sigma) or mouse anti-IAV NP (Abcam 128193). Secondary antibodies were goat α-rabbit Alexa Fluor-594 (catalog number ab150080, Invitrogen) and goat α-mouse Alexa Fluor-568 (catalog number A11031; Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium (H-1000-10; Vector Laboratories). Cells were imaged with a Zeiss Cell Observer widefield microscope with ZEN Blue software, using a Plan-Apochromat ×100 1.40-numerical aperture oil objective (Zeiss), an Orca-Flash 4.0 complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera (frame, 2,048 × 2,048 pixels; Hamamatsu), giving a pixel size of 65 nm, and a Colibri 7 light source (Zeiss). Channels acquired and filters for excitation and emission were 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (excitation [ex], 365/12 nm, emission [em] 447/60 nm), GFP (ex 470/40 nm, em 525/50 nm), and TexasRed (ex 562/40 nm, em 624/40 nm). All images were analyzed and prepared with Fiji software (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). For images in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and Fig. S5b, the detection limit was adjusted individually for each channel (taking care to remain well above control background level), while in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, where we are comparing relative levels of NP expression, the lower detection limit in the TexasRed channel was set equal to that of the DAPI channel.
