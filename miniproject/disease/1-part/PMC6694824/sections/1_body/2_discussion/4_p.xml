<p>Current anti-influenza therapeutics, as well as drugs in development such as adamantanes (M2 ion channel inhibitors), neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) such as oseltamivir, and RdRp-targeting molecules (including the nucleoside analogue favipiravir and small molecules such as baloxavir), are all aimed at proteins encoded by the virus. A recurring issue with such drugs is the ease with which influenza virus evolves resistance to them, be it in a laboratory setting (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) or in the field (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). An alternative approach would be to target specific interactions of virus proteins with essential host factors, such that small-molecule inhibitors may temporarily block the interacting surface on the host protein without compromising its cellular functions. As influenza virus replication is completely abrogated in their absence, ANP32 proteins suggest themselves as potential candidates for such an approach.
