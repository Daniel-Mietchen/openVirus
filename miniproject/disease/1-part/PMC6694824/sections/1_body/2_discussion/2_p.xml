<p>Two observations imply preference of certain polymerase constellations for human ANP32B over ANP32A. First, specific polymerases were more efficiently enhanced by ANP32B when provided exogenously. Second, the absence of ANP32A in the cell enhances virus polymerase activity in some cases, where the opposite might be expected and has previously been observed in knockdown experiments (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The latter observation might be explained if ANP32B is held in heterodimers or larger protein complexes with ANP32A, thus absence of ANP32A might liberate the preferred ANP32B for recruitment by influenza virus RdRp. Alternatively, ANP32A and ANP32B, being very similar structurally, might compete for polymerase binding, and loss of ANP32A would then favor binding and more efficient activity mediated by ANP32B. Taken together, the observations point to ANP32B being functionally superior in humans to ANP32A for supporting influenza polymerase. However, these differences were not so readily apparent in the context of virus infection where replication continued largely unabated in single ANP32A or ANP32B knockout cells.
