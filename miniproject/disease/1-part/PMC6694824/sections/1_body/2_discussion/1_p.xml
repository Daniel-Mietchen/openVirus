<p>Here, we show that human ANP32A and ANP32B are functionally redundant in their support for influenza virus polymerase in human cells and that the RdRp does not carry out RNA replication in the absence of both family members. Our findings corroborate those of Zhang et al. (2019) who used a similar CRISPR approach (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) We further show that IBV polymerase is also dependent on human ANP32 proteins and can also utilize either orthologue to support activity. Our demonstration of redundancy in use of these essential host factors illuminates a deficiency in RNA interference (RNAi) or CRISPR screens where host genes are knocked down one at a time. Functionally redundant pairs or larger groups of host factors that can be used by a virus will escape detection, as have ANP32A and ANP32B individually in previous screens (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).
