<p id="Par13">There have been four additional published studies with short-term and long-term immunogenicity for children receiving a full dose of YF vaccine (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The published studies contain cohorts of children who received YF vaccination at 9–23 months of age. Of the two studies published evaluating the seroconversion rate following YF vaccination in children, the rates are highly variable within one of the studies and between the studies

 </sup>. In a study of 595 children living in Colombia and Peru who received YF vaccine alone or with a tetravalent dengue vaccine on a YF vaccine backbone, the rate of seroconversion was noted to be 99.8–100% when measured by PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> and titer ≥10
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>
 </sup>. These rates were similar though slightly higher than the rates seen in Mali (95–98%) among children who received a meningococcal A (Men A) vaccine either concurrently or serially with YF vaccine
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>. However, in the same Men A vaccine study, children in Ghana only achieved 68–79% seroconversion rates following YF vaccination. This same trend in lower rates of detectable antibodies between the two populations in the Men A study was seen when the cohorts were followed up at 2–6 years post-vaccination

 </sup>. Seropositivity rates as low as 28% were reported for children in Ghana at 2.3 years post-vaccination, though the rate increased at 6 years post-vaccination to 43%, compared to 50% seropositivity among the children in Mali at 4.5 years post-vaccination

 </sup>. When demographic (age of vaccination, sex), vaccination and exposure history (season of vaccination and pre-vaccination titers), and nutritional status were compared between the children in Mali and Ghana, no significant differences were identified to explain the different rates of seropositivity between these two populations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. In the second study evaluating longer-term immunity in different cohorts of children in Brazil up to 10 years post-vaccination, a substantial decline was noted in the seropositivity rates over time
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. Using a titer ≥10 with PRNT
 <sub>50</sub>, 54% of children were not seropositive at 7 years post-vaccination. Although the rates of seropositivity increased when using a lower titer cut-off (PRNT ≥ 5), 36% of children at 7 years post-vaccination lacked detectable neutralizing antibodies.
