<p>According to our survey, plants belonging to the 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Malvaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> families are the most widely distributed in all sampled areas. The HTS analysis revealed that signatures corresponding to TYLCV, SiMSiV, and RhGMV were present in all five NGS libraries, whereas the RhGMSV-signature was detected only in two out of five NGS libraries, suggesting that these species of begomovirus are predominant. Initially, the presence of these four viruses was confirmed by using sequence-specific primers for each viral species (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00594">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), testing an individual plant of the corresponding family for viral presence. To obtain the full-length viral genome of detected viruses, total DNA of 
 <italic>Nicotiana glauca</italic> from Sinaloa (TYLCV PCR-positive); of 
 <italic>Sida acuta</italic> from Colima (SiMSiV PCR-positive), and two 
 <italic>Rhynchosia minima</italic> both from Sinaloa (PCR-positive for RhGMV/RhGMSV), were used for RCA amplification and cloning. Sequence analysis of obtained clones is summarized in
