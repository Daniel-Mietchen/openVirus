<p id="Par3">The viral set-point has been suggested to be 10â€“28 fold lower in HIV-2, with lower levels of viraemia persisting into clinical stages of disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As a consequence, HIV-2 infection is characterized by lower transmission rates at both the horizontal and vertical levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, AIDS seem to occur at a relatively lower viral load level in HIV-2 compared with HIV-1 infection, although the CD4 count is often higher in HIV-2-infected subjects when AIDS-defining illnesses develop [
