<p id="Par4">Several reports have indicated that only approximately 15–25% of HIV-2 infected individuals will progress to AIDS if following a natural course of disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, these assumptions were based on data from HIV-2 infected individuals without information on infection date. On the one hand, lack of infection date will inevitably select for individuals with a slower disease progression rate than the average. On the other hand, such population will also enter the study at a more advanced stage. These biases will create a contradiction that will be difficult to adjust for when estimating true disease progression rates. In 2018, data from individuals with an estimated date of infection showed that the disease trajectory was almost identical between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections, albeit at approximately half the rate among HIV-2 infected individuals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Importantly, this showed that AIDS will develop among the majority of HIV-2 infected individuals without antiretroviral treatment (ART). Nevertheless, although no such indication was seen in the study, the existence of a subset of HIV-2-infected subjects who maintain long-term viral control and have a normal life expectancy cannot be entirely excluded since this would require a complete follow-up to the end-stage (AIDS or death) of all study participants [

However, in such subgroup, the time to AIDS would be longer than the predicted human lifespan, meaning that the age at HIV-2 infection would be a determining factor for the size of the group. In fact, the median age at infection was 38 years in the HIV-2 infected group [
