<p id="Par2">HIV-2 was first discovered in 1986 in West Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although HIV-2 has been found in other parts of Africa, Europe, India and the United States; West Africa has consistently had the largest HIV-2 prevalence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 1994, the first studies of HIV-2 reported a reduced rate of disease progression compared with HIV-1 among female sex workers in Senegal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In 1997, it was reported that HIV-2 infected individuals had twice as high mortality compared with HIV negative individuals in Guinea-Bissau [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This was confirmed in later studies that showed mortality rates two to fivefold higher in HIV-2 infected individuals compared with HIV-negative individuals in Guinea-Bissau [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Other studies, from The Gambia and France, compared HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection and reported a generally slower CD4+ T-cell decline in HIV-2 infected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. HIV-2 infected individuals therefore exhibit longer asymptomatic stages than HIV-1 infected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, in individuals reaching AIDS, HIV-1 and HIV-2 share a similar clinical spectrum, with the exception of a lower incidence of Kaposi’s sarcoma in HIV-2 infected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, studies have also reported that similar baseline viral load and CD4+ T-cell levels predict similar prognosis for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This could indicate that disease prognosis is determined during the early stages of both types of HIV infections.
