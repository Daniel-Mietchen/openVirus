<p id="Par13">Finally, animal models for HIV analysis of virus transmission and AIDS development are rare, and chimpanzees are the only non-human primates that are susceptible to HIV-1 infection. However, due to ethics, risk of extinction, and an infection that rarely results in progressive disease, these animals are not used as an infection model for HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Experimental HIV-2 infection models have instead been established using rhesus and pigtail macaques. Still, these infections mainly result in low or non-pathogenic infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In contrast, serial in vivo passages of HIV-2 in baboons have resulted in the development of an AIDS-like disease model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. It has also been reported that HIV-2 infection of humanized mice results in persistent viraemia and CD4+ T-cell loss [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. These could therefore represent alternative models for testing efficacy of antiretroviral and latency reversal strategies. As for in vitro models, competition assays between HIV-1 and HIV-2 have demonstrated that the replication fitness of most HIV-2 isolates was lower and outcompeted by HIV-1 isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and others have shown that HIV-2 isolates from aviraemic individuals have reduced in vitro replication capacity compared to HIV-2 isolated during viraemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].
