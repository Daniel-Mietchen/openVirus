<p id="Par10">Explanations for lower virus loads and reduced pathogenicity in HIV-2 compared with HIV-1 infections have also been attributed to different types of virus-controlling immune responses. Robust, broadly cross-reactive and polyfunctional virus-specific responses of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells have been shown to distinguish HIV-2 from HIV-1 infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In particular, HIV-2 Gag-specific T-cell responses have been shown to correlate with virus control [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Similarly, CD8+ T-cells co-expressing CD28 have been associated with controlled HIV-2 infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Strikingly, when subjects from the “Caió cohort” with high and undetectable viral loads were compared, the main distinguishing feature was CD8+ T-cell responses to Gag, which were absent in 52% of viraemic participants (the “Caió cohort” was a large community-based cohort from the small rural village Caió, Guinea-Bissau) [

Gag-specific responses in HIV-2-infected subjects often show unusually high functional avidity, with the capacity to respond to picomolar quantities of antigen, and are at an earlier stage of differentiation than HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells, presumably retaining their ability to proliferate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In line with these observations, HIV-2-specific T-cells from LTNPs in the French cohort showed potent suppression of viral replication, in many cases exceeding the suppressive abilities of HIV-1-specific T-cells from elite controllers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Given that high potency HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) without features of exhaustion and broad cross-reactivity seem to be required for killing of the latent reservoir, there are good arguments to suggest that CTL from HIV-2 infected viral controllers would meet these requirements [
