<p id="Par12">Both potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies have been detected at different disease stages in HIV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Moreover, although susceptibility of HIV-2 to neutralizing antibodies seem to vary according to the infecting virus strain, it is in general significantly elevated compared to HIV-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Furthermore, mutants escaping from neutralizing antibodies seem to emerge less frequently in HIV-2 infection and do not reach fixation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Fc-mediated effector functions, such as the effect of complement on antibody antiviral activity, have also been reported to be potent in HIV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In addition, antibodies with a broad ability to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and even cross-react with HIV-1, are found in HIV-2 infected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Thus, despite low-level viraemia, strong antibody responses in HIV-2 infection are sustained during both asymptomatic and progressive HIV-2 infections and do not distinguish between patient groups in different disease stages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The impact of antibodies on disease progression during HIV-2 chronic infection is, therefore, not entirely clear.
