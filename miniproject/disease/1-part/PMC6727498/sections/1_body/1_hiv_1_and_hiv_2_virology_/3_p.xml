<p id="Par7">It has been suggested that untreated HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected individuals with similar CD4+ T-cell levels have similar levels of 
 <italic>gag</italic> mRNA transcripts, indicating that substantial viral transcription occurs in HIV-2 infected individuals despite the generally lower viral loads [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, the 
 <italic>tat</italic>/
 <italic>gag</italic> ratio between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections has been shown to differ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Altogether, these studies suggest that 
 <italic>tat</italic> mRNA levels are reduced compared with 
 <italic>gag</italic> mRNA levels in cells from untreated HIV-2 infected individuals, whereas 
 <italic>tat</italic> mRNA levels are more abundant than 
 <italic>gag</italic> mRNA levels in cells from HIV-1 infected individuals. Since 
 <italic>tat</italic> mRNA represents early transcripts, these results could reflect a reduced rate of recent cell infections in HIV-2 infection. It is also possible that post-transcriptional control of viral production could be involved in differences in HIV-1 and HIV-2 pathogenesis [
