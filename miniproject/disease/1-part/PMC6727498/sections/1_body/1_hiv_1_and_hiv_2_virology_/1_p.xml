<p id="Par5">The HIV-1 and HIV-2 epidemics constitute multiple different introductions of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) into the human population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. HIV-1 has its origin from SIV of the chimpanzee, whereas HIV-2 originated from the SIV of the sooty mangabey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Due to the parallel evolution of SIV and HIV in simian and human populations there is a distinct genetic diversity between HIV-1 and HIV-2. To date, a large number of groups, subtypes, subsubtypes and circulating recombinant forms have been described for HIV-1, and at least nine groups of HIV-2 have been described (termed Aâ€“I) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Group A and B are most common in HIV-2 infection, although intergroup recombinants between group A and B has been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, and despite their different origins, HIV-1 and HIV-2 are related retroviruses and show approximately 55% similarity in Gag and Pol, and 35% similarity in Env on the protein level (the overall similarity level is approximately 55% on the nucleotide level) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although the virus types share transmission routes and target cells, contrasting results in terms of replicative fitness and cytopathicity have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].
