<p id="Par11">The cellular involvement in modulation of HIV-2 infections within West African populations also comes from HLA associations with viral control (HLA-B*58:01, HLA-DPB1*10:01 and HLA-DRB1*11:01) or disease progression (HLA-B*15:03 and HLA-B*35) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Furthermore, the function of natural killer (NK) cells appears more well-preserved during asymptomatic HIV-2 compared with HIV-1 infection, whereas the functionality of these cells seem to drop to levels found during HIV-1 infection with declining CD4+ T-cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Elevated frequencies of T-cells expressing markers of activation and exhaustion appear to distinguish HIV-2 infected individuals that progress despite no or low level viraemia, which could be the consequence of long infection duration and/or virus replication not mirrored by plasma RNA levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Although these findings could suggest that aviraemic HIV-2 infected individuals should be offered ART, there remains a group of aviraemic individuals with HIV-2 infection without evidence of immune activation who may not necessarily benefit from therapy [
