<p id="Par8">Lower virus production in HIV-2 compared with HIV-1 infection may also reflect a lower activation state in infected cells, or that HIV-2 is less responsive to activation. The long terminal repeat (LTR) of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 regulates the expression of the virus in response to cellular transcription signals. The HIV-2 LTR differs from HIV-1 in numbers and type of transcription binding elements and enhancers, leading to reduced responsiveness to transcription factors present in activated T-cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. There could also be differences in activation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected cells. In contrast to HIV-1, the HIV-2 envelope glycoprotein was found to stimulate production of higher levels of gamma interferon and interleukin 16 (both inhibit viral replication), and lower levels of interleukin 4 (stimulates viral replication) [
