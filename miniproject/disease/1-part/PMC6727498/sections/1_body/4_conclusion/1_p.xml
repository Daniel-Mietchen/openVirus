<p id="Par19">HIV-2 is a less pathogenic virus than HIV-1, disease progression is slower and the proportions of controllers and slow progressors are higher. Both cellular and humoral immune responses, particularly HIV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, are likely to play a role in controlling the rate of disease progression in individuals with dual-infection. A main immunological correlate for the substantial proportion of the aviraemic slow progressors seen in HIV-2 infection is the presence of highly avid, early-differentiated polyfunctional Gag-specific CTL (potentially more effective at targeting reactivated latent virus than HIV-1-specific T-cells). Therefore, there are important lessons to be learned from HIV-2 pathogenesis, and HIV-2 may represent a model to study relapse-free remission in HIV-1 infection (Fig.Â

Understanding the key differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections, and the cross-reactive effects in HIV-1/HIV-2 dual-infection could provide novel insights in developing functional HIV cures and vaccines. There is a clear need to conduct studies on remission-strategies among HIV-2 infected individuals as these studies would provide valuable insights for achieving HIV cure.
