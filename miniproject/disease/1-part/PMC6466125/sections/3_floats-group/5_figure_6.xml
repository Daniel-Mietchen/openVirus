  <p>Pseudo atomic structure of MNV complexed with neutralizing antibody 2D3. Panel A shows the structure of MNV complexed with Fab fragments of 2D3 and panel B shows the same structure as a slice along the midsection. The surfaces are colored according to the distance from the center of the particle. As noted, the shell domain is orange, the P domain is yellow, the Fab variable domain is cyan, and the constant domain is blue. Note the large gap between the shell and P domain and that the Fab binds to the very top of the P domain. Panel C is a stereo diagram of the pseudo atomic model of the 2D3/MNV complex. The open and closed conformations of the P domain is shown in red and blue, respectively. The heavy chain variable and the light variable domains are shown in yellow and brown, respectively. Note that the CDR3 loop of the heavy chain fits into the cleft between the A’-B’ and E’-F’ loops in the open conformation but completely overlaps the E’-F’ loop in the closed conformation, making it unlikely that 2D3 can bind to the closed conformation.
