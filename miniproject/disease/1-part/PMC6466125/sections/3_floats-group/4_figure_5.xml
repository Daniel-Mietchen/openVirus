  <p>Possible roles for the conformational flexibility of the P domains with respect to the shell. The biological role for the compressed/expanded state transition is unknown. This figure shows some possibilities. In the expanded state, the P domain lifts off the shell by at least 16Å and rotates by nearly 90°. This change in orientation and flexibility might favor cell surface binding of one state versus the other. This marked flexibility might expose antigenic sites observed in the expanded state but not the compressed state [
   <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], making some antibodies non-neutralizing [
   <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The flexibility of the linker may make it more susceptible to proteolysis, thereby creating a “smoke screen” or exposure of non-neutralizing epitopes.
