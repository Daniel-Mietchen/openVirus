<p>As will be discussed below, there are very recent results that show that flexibility within the P domain may help human noroviruses bind to the histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Susceptibility of an individual to NV infection is related to the expression of particular carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. NV VLPs bind to the H, Lewis, and A HBGAs; the variation in which is determined by the individual’s expression of various glycotransferase enzymes (for a review, see [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). The highest levels of expression on the small intestinal villi lie at the outermost tip. Mutagenesis studies using the structural model for NV has further articulated the virus/carbohydrate interactions [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These researchers have proposed that there is a pocket in the P2 domain that contains an RGD/K motif that binds the histo-blood group antigens. Other noroviruses display different ABH and Lewis carbohydrate specificities [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These results suggest that natural resistance and the occasional lack of correlation between an antibody response and protection is likely due to genetically determined expression of particular carbohydrate moieties [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, the importance of blood group carbohydrates in infection with human noroviruses is clear but whether these carbohydrates represent a viral receptor, or are sufficient for infection is not clear since there is no cell culture system for human noroviruses. It should be noted that a very small proportion (4–6%) of specifically bound VLPs is internalized in various cells [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While this interaction may be sufficient for infection, it is lower than the level of internalization of positive control viruses such as rotaviruses.
