<p>In the initial crystal structure of the MNV P domain [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the outer two loops (A’–B’ and E’–F’) displayed two discreet conformations; a closed structure where the two loops are tightly associated and an open structure where the loops are splayed apart. This conformational difference is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f006">Figure 6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f007">Figure 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f008">Figure 8</xref>. This “open” and “closed” designation will be used in the following discussion.
