<p>To address how the 2D3 escape mutants, that are distal to antibody contact and buried beneath the surface, can block 2D3 binding, dynamic simulations were performed on the P domain where the V339I mutation was modeled into both the open and closed conformations [

The results for the three simulations indicate that FabD/MNV bound complex is sensitive to the flexibility of P domain dimer interfacial interactions, in particular the salt bridge network that undergoes rearrangements necessary to accommodate the antibody binding. The buried dimer interface salt bridge network is complex and dynamic allowing the dimer to adopt more than one conformation. For the V339I mutation, a mutation in neither the A’–B’ or E’–F’ binding loops changes the salt bridge network and restricts the molecular liberation of the interfacial region and thus the conformational flexibility. Side chain interactions in folding differ from those found at interfaces where association accommodates minor conformational adjustments, usually in side chains, not in the folded state of the protein units. The salt bridge and hydrogen bonding network at these buried interfaces, void of mediating solvent molecules, are specific and complementary. Salt bridges are able to contribute to conformational specificity and contribute to molecular recognition and catalysis. Thus, as discussed by DeGrado et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] salt bridges are difficult to predict because of the cost of formation, dehydration of a basic residue and carboxylate and the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions, but they may be viable designable interactions.
