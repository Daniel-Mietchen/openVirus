<p>To understand the difference between these two antibodies, the cryo-EM structure of the 2D3 bound to MNV was determined [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Like A6.2, 2D3 appears to bind to the open but not the closed conformation of the P domain. While mAb 2D3 contacts the E’-F’ loop of the P domain similar to mAb A6.2, mAb 2D3 appears to bind slightly deeper in the crevice between the A’-B’ and the E’-F’ loops. Surprisingly, neither of the natural escape mutants to 2D3 (D348E and V339I) are actually in contact with the bound antibody. It is highly unusual that none of the possible mutations at the paratope/epitope interface produced viable virus. Just as odd is the fact that even though some of the escape mutations to A6.2 are in contact with 2D3, none of them can escape 2D3 neutralization. What is so special about the 2D3 contact area that severely restricts the repertoire of possible mutations so that only “allosteric” escape mutants were isolated?
