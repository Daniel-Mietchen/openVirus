<p>To understand how noroviruses escape antibody neutralization, we determined the cryo-EM structure of MNV complexed with the Fab fragment from a neutralizing A6.2 [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was clear that A6.2 bound to the outermost tip of the P2 domain, right where the A’B’ and E’F’ loops lie. However, without the atomic structure of A6.2, it was not clear whether it was binding to open or closed conformations, or both. To better understand the interaction of mAb A6.2 with the P domain, the structure of the A6.2 Fab was determined to ~2.5 Å [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Interestingly, this loop in A6.2 is strongly hydrophobic with the sequence “YFYALDYW”. When the structures of A6.2 and the P domain dimer was placed into the cryo-EM density and refined using COLLAGE in the SITUS package [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], it was evident that A6.2 fit better onto the open conformation than the closed, with the hydrophobic CDR3 loop extending into the hydrophobic interface between the A’-B’ and E’-F’ loops. Those hydrophobic residues in the P domain are deeply buried under the tips of the A’B’ and E’F’ loops in the closed conformation and not accessible to mAb A6.2. In addition, the CDR3 loop of A6.2 completely overlaps the E’-F’ loops in the closed conformation, making it impossible for A6.2 to bind. Taken together, the modeling strongly suggested that mAb A6.2 prefers the open conformation both in terms of structural and hydrophobic complementarity.
