<p>Together, these results strongly support the contention that the P domain is in a dynamic structural equilibrium where the crystallographically observed open and closed states represent two possibilities of a montage of conformations. The site directed escape mutations to A6.2 and the naturally occurring escape mutations to 2D3 suggest that the virus can block antibody binding by shifting this equilibrium towards the closed state. If true, then it necessarily follows that the closed state is the viable and infectious form of the virus. Further, it is not at all clear why the 2D3 contacts on the P domain are so immutable and suggest important roles in this particular region of P domain such as receptor binding.</p>
