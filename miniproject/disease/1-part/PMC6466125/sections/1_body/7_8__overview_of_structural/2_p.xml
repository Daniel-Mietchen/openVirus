 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). The CD300lf contact site is near the top of the P2 domain, between the A’–B’ and D’–E’ loops. Interestingly, this contact surface includes some of the amino acids involved in the binding of the neutralizing antibody, A6.2. From structural analysis, they also found that that that GCDCA (tan spheres) and lithocholic acid (LCA) bind in two deep pockets in the P domain dimer interface, distant from receptor and antibody binding sites [
