<p>Interestingly, the conformation of the A’–B’ and E’–F’ loops in the receptor complex is nearly identical to that of the closed conformation. The major difference is in the C’–D’ loop that is “turned up” compared to the P domain alone. This affords enough space for the bile salt, GCDCA (tan spheres), to bind. It may be that the structural equilibrium in solution is shifted by GCDCA binding to the closed form, which may be preferred by CD300lf. In this way, the bile salts may enhance receptor binding, indirectly, by altering the dynamics and structural equilibrium of the P domain. What is particularly interesting is that one of the two escape mutants to the neutralizing antibody, 2D3, is the buried residue V339 (black spheres) that lies immediately adjacent to the bile salt binding site. As with the bile salts, we had proposed that the V339I mutation shifted the equilibrium towards the closed conformation that does not favor antibody binding [

It is rather exciting to consider that the V339I escape mutant and bile salts drive the P domain conformation towards the closed conformation that favors receptor binding and at the same time away from the open conformation favored by antibody binding.
