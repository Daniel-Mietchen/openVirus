<p>In the expanded state, several events might occur. The flexible tether between the shell and the P domains could be sensitive to proteases. This could release soluble P domains that might act as a “smoke screen” for the immune system and present antigenic sites not normally exposed on the viral surface. Similarly, the marked flexibility of the P domains in the expanded state might expose these antigenic sites without having to be cleaved from the shell. In either case, if any of these normally buried sites are immunodominant, then the immune response might focus on producing antibodies that bind poorly or not at all to the compressed capsid. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that the immune response to MNV included antibodies to the buried shell domain [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and GII.4 [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] where antibodies were found to bind to portions of the P domain that are buried in the compressed conformation. In essence, the highly flexible nature of the P domain could be a moving target for the immune response.
