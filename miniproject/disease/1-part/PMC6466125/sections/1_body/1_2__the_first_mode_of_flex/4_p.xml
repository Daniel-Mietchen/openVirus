<p>There is also recent evidence that this flexibility of the P domain likely plays a critical role in receptor interaction in MNV [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, the atomic structure of the isolated MNV P domain/CD300lf receptor was modeled into the pseudo-atomic cryo-EM structure of the intact MNV-1 capsid. CD300lf is a member of the immunoglobin superfamily and is found on myeloid cells. This cell membrane protein has an extracellular domain of ~170 amino acids of which ~100 residues are represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The C-termini of the CD300lf N-terminal fragment is noted as white circles on some of the copies of the receptor on the viral surface. As shown in the model of the expanded form, the C-termini of the CD300lf form trimers in the icosahedron. There is clearly not enough room for all of the P domains to be saturated with receptor. This In contrast, using the position of the P domain in NV as a guide, there is a great deal of space around each of the P domains for at least a higher degree of saturation with receptor. Interestingly, the P domains around the A subunits around the 5-fold axes are oriented such that there is clearly room for saturation. While there are currently no published reports that the Caliciviruses exist in both compressed and expanded conformations, the conservation of the flexible linker, the multiple reports of antibodies recognizing buried epitopes, and unpublished results (Sherman and Smith) all point to the existance of such a transition in all Caliciviruses. Finally, this figure shows just two conformations but it is more than likely that the flexibility of the linker allows for a wide array of conformations between these two extremes. This is likely why the P domains have extremely weak density in all of the genotypes shown in
