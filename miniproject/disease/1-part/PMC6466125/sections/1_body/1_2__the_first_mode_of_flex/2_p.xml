<p>Since this unusual “floating P domain” conformation (“expanded state”) was so different than the crystal structure of NV (“compressed state”), the structure of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) VLP was also determined [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The structure of RHDV is somewhat between what was observed for MNV-1 and NV. Similar to MNV-1, the P domains are lifted off the surface of the shell, but similar to NV, the P domains are not rotated. This orientation places the bottom edge of the A subunit P1 domain in close proximity to the S domain near the 5-fold axes, causing false connectivity at lower contouring. In addition, the P domain dimers of NV and RHDV have a more arch like shape than MNV-1. Similar to MNV-1, the electron density of the shell is defined, while the density of the P domains is diffuse, suggesting a high degree of flexibility. Unlike MNV-1, the electron density of the C/C dimers in RHDV are far more diffuse than that observed with the A/B dimers. It is notable that, unlike the RHDV A/B dimers, the RHDV C/C dimers do not make a close contact between the P1 domains and the S domain. It perhaps because of this, that the C/C dimers are apparently more mobile than the A/B dimers, and hence the diffuse density. Unlike MNV-1, the connector between the S and P1 domains is not clear. There is a slight bump in the S domain electron density where the connector should be extending from the shell and there are some islands of density in the appropriate region at lower contouring. Nevertheless, it is clear that this genotype is more like MNV with highly flexible P domains that do not contact the shell surface.
