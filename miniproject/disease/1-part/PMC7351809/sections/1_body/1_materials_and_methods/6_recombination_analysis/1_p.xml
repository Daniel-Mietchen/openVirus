The following 12 DENV-2 strains were selected based on the phylogenetic analysis and isolation location for recombination analysis: Korean strains (43,248, 43,253, 43,254, and KBPV-VR29), KY474309 (Ecuador, American/Asian), GQ868542 (Thailand, Asian 1), HQ891023 (Taiwan, Asian 2), M29095 (Papua New Guinea, Asian 2), MF156242 (China, Cosmopolitan), MH822954 (India, Cosmopolitan), MK513444 (Singapore, Cosmopolitan), EU056811 (Peru, American), and FJ467493 (Malaysia, Sylvatic).
