<p id="Par6">Three DENV-2 strains were provided from the National Culture Collection for Pathogens (Cheongju, Korea). These viruses were isolated from serum samples from Korean patients travelling to Singapore, India, and Thailand in 2015. The viruses were passaged twice in VERO-E6 cells, and the cell culture supernatant was stored at -80 °C until processing. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at -80 °C until use.
