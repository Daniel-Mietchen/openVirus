<p id="Par12">B-cell epitopes within each ORF of isolates DENV 2SS, 43,248, 43,253, 43,254, and KBPV-VR29 were predicted using the BCPreds prediction tool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The putative epitopes were further evaluated using the VaxiJen server (antigenicity prediction server). Regions with BCPreds scores of &gt; 0.8 and VaxiJen scores of &gt; 0.6 were identified as probable B-cell epitopes.
