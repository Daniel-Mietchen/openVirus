<p id="Par9">To estimate the nucleotide substitution rates and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), a total of 100 nucleotide sequences from the E region of DENV-2 strains with known isolation dates and locations were retrieved from the GenBank database. Sequences with low quality, high similarity (99% identity), and recombinants were excluded from the evolutionary analysis. DENV datasets were analyzed using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in the BEAST 2 package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The best-fit substitution models were selected based on the values of the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion using modeling test software in CLC Genomics Workbench. The dataset was evaluated using a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock with a Bayesian skyline coalescent prior [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Procedures were run twice for 60,000,000 generations, and the parameter values were sampled after each 6,000 steps. The final log and tree files were combined using LogCombiner version 2.5.2, excluding 10% burn-in from each run. The combined results of the log files with an effective sample size (ESS) greater than 200 were analyzed and viewed using Tracer version 1.7.1 (
