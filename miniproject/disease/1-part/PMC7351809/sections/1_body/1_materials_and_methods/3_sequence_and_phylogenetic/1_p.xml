<p id="Par8">The nucleotide sequences of three DENVs were manipulated using BioEdit software, version 7.0.5.3, assembled in CLC Genomics Workbench 12.0 (QIAGEN, CA, USA), and aligned with DENV reference genes using the CLUSTAL W method. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete coding region and the region encoding the envelope (E) protein of 122 DENVs, including the four Korean isolates from this study, was performed by the maximum-likelihood method, using the Tamura Nei model of gamma-distribution rates (TN93 + G + I model) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA, version 7.0.26) [

Sequence similarities among DENV-2 isolates were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench 12.0. Amino acid substitutions and mutation rates of viruses were compared to those of a DENV 2SS strains (M29095) and the most similar DENV strains (KY921905, MH822954, KY672952, and JQ686088) identified by the NCBI BLAST programs.
