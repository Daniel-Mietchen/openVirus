<p id="Par10">Selection pressure was evaluated for 122 DENV sequences by four different methods, using the Datamonkey web server of the HyPhy package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Sequences with ambiguous results and high similarity (&gt; 99%) were excluded from this analysis. The ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions (ω ratio) was calculated using the parameters single-likelihood ancestor, fixed effects likelihood, mixed effects model of evolution, and fast, unconstrained Bayesian approximation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Selection pressure analysis was performed for the structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and the non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Sites under positive or negative selection were identified based on statistical significance (
 <italic>p-</italic>value &lt; 0.1 or posterior probability &lt; 0.9) using at least two methods.
