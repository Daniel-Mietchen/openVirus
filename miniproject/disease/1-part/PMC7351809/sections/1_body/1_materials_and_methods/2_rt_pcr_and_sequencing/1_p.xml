<p id="Par7">Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed for the amplification of the full coding region of each DENV isolate using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, CA, USA). The primers were described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and their sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: one cycle of reverse transcription (45℃ for 30 min), one cycle of initial denaturation (95℃ for 15 min), 40 cycles of amplification (94℃ for 10 s, 46℃ for 30 s, and 68℃ for 3 min), and final elongation (68℃ for 10 min). The PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain Dye (Invitrogen, USA) and visualized by UV transillumination. Amplicons of the expected size were excised and purified using an Expin Gel SV Kit (GeneAll, Seoul, Korea). The nucleotide sequences were determined by direct sequencing using an ABI 3730XL sequencer (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea).
