<p id="Par21">The four DENV-2 strains exhibited similarities to epidemic strains from other countries. The discovery that the 43,253 strain clustered with endemic DENV-2 strains was taken as a warning sign for in New Delhi, India, which has faced continued dengue outbreaks every 3–4 years [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The strains were prevalent in this area and caused more than 1,000 cases of dengue during the second half of 2015. These viruses seemed to have evolved from DENV strains from India in 2011 and 2012 (Fig.
