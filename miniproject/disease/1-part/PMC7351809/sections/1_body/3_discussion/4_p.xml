<p id="Par22">Severe dengue is a life-threatening clinical form of dengue infection. The factors affecting dengue severity include the ADE phenomenon, the virulence of the genotype, and replication capacity of the virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, B-cell epitopes and the motifs related to viral replication and pathogenicity were compared among the strains. High titers of DENV have been shown to be related to severe dengue infection in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The DENV isolates described in this report possessed variable motifs and showed evidence of recombination in the NS5 region, which encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and therefore could affect replication capacity (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Three motifs in the E protein were differentiated among the Korean isolates (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Two of them were located in domain III of the E protein, which is important for determining host range, tissue tropism, and virulence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Therefore, the DENV isolates from this study are expected to differ in their virulence and replication capacity, especially the KBPV-VR29 strain.
