<p id="Par20">The DENV-2 strains were classified into six distinct genotypes including Asian 1, Asian 2, Cosmopolitan, American, Asian/American, and sylvatic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In phylogenetic analysis, three viruses (43,248, 43,253, and 43,254) were classified as the Cosmopolitan genotype, and one strain (KBPV-VR29) was classified as the American genotype. Three viruses of the Cosmopolitan genotype were further divided into two sublineages, namely sublineage 1 and sublineage 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The nucleotide sequences within the same sublineage were more than 95.2% identical, but those of members of different sublineages were only 93.0%–96.4% identical. In previous reports, genotypes of DENV were distinguished based on 6–8% nucleotide sequence divergence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, a new genotype classification should be considered for the Cosmopolitan genotype.
