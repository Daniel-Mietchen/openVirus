<p id="Par23">The ADE phenomenon is known to play a role in severe dengue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Antibodies with low affinity and titer can promote the entry of DENV into immune cells expressing the 
 <italic>Fc</italic> gamma receptor, such as myeloid and mast cells, causing increased virus replication and severe dengue infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Amino acid sequence differences within B-cell epitopes of DENVs might be more directly involved in ADE than other genomic regions. In this study, we found amino acid differences in all predicted B-cell epitopes between the viral proteins of members of the Cosmopolitan and American genotypes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Therefore, severe dengue could be manifested in Koreans by serial infection with imported DENVs.
