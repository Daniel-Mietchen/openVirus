<p id="Par24">The nucleotide substitution rate in the E protein was found in this study to be 5.32 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>, which is within the 95% HPD intervals of the rates given in a previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The substitution rates per sites range from 10
 <sup>–8</sup> to 10
 <sup>–6</sup> in DNA viruses and from 10
 <sup>–6</sup> to 10
 <sup>–4</sup> in RNA viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. DENV has an especially high substitution rate among RNA viruses. The estimated TMRCAs of the isolates 43,248, 43,253, and 43,254 were 10, 4, and 7 years, respectively. DENV has evolved within 10 years and has caused outbreaks in various regions of the world. Evidence of negative selection pressure was found in all of the proteins of DENV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Positive pressure was not found in the E protein, which contains important epitopes for neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Viruses can escape host immunity by altering their viral proteins for survival in the host. These mutations are primarily caused by immune pressure in natural infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Thus, sites under positive selection are mainly found in and near epitopes of HA proteins of influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, positive selection was found in non-structural proteins of DENV, including NS2A, NS3, and NS5 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). These proteins appear to have been subjected to immune pressure in the host.
