<p id="Par4">Severe dengue seems to result from the complex interactions between the virus and the host immune system. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known mechanism leading to severe dengue infection. High titers of dengue antibody initially confer protection against heterogenous DENV serotypes, but after the titer decreases, the DENV antibody complexes exhibit enhanced virus binding to Fc gamma receptors of monocytes, leading to increased virus replication and virulence in the host [

The clinical severity differs according to the interactions that occur between the virus and the host immune system. DENV-2NI-1 induces severe dengue in children with immunity to the DENV-1 serotype, but DENV-2NI-2B is virulent in children previously infected with the DENV-3 serotype [
