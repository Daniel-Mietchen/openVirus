<p id="Par5">DENV has been imported into Korea with increasing frequency by travelers coming from dengue-endemic countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, DENV carried by global travelers has the possibility of triggering dengue endemics in Korea. However, limited genome sequence information is available about DENV strains in Korea. In this report, we determined the full coding sequences of three DENV-2 viruses and performed molecular and evolutionary analysis.
