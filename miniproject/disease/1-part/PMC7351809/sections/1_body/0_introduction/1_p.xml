<p id="Par2">Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most prevalent pathogens in tropical and subtropical countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Recently, the incidence and severity of this disease has dramatically increased worldwide. Before the 1970s, dengue outbreaks were reported in only nine countries. Recently, DENV epidemics have been observed in more than 100 countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A total of 3.6 billion people live in areas at risk for epidemic transmission, and nearly 400 million people suffer from DENV infection annually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For this reason, dengue infection is one of the 17 diseases prioritized by the World Health Organization. This increased incidence has been caused by three factors: rapid urbanization, increased global travel, and global warming [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The virus can be transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the species 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Global warming has widened the growth habitats of these mosquito species and increased the distribution of dengue outbreaks worldwide [
