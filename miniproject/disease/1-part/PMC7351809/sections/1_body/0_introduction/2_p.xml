<p id="Par3">DENV is a single-stranded, positive-sense arthropod RNA virus belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The viral genome encodes three structural proteins (capsid [C], pre-membrane [prM], and envelope [E]) and seven non-structural proteins (non-structural [NS] 1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. DENV isolates are classified into four serotypes (DENV 1, 2, 3, and 4) and further divided into distinct genotypes based on 6–8% nucleotide and 3% amino acid sequence differences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. DENVs within the same serotype generally share 65–70% nucleotide sequence identity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. DENV infections result in a wide spectrum of clinical signs, ranging from unapparent infection to severe dengue. Dengue fever is observed in most human cases and is characterized by a self-limiting fever. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) can occur in severe dengue cases and are characterized by thrombocytopenia, increased vascular permeability, and hypovolemic shock [
