<p id="Par18">Two putative recombination events were identified using five methods (Table S2). The recombination breakpoints were within the NS5 gene. The nucleotide positions of the sequences from the minor parents (M29095 and unknown) were 8892 to 9278 and 8765 to 8840, respectively. A recombinant strain (MF156242) was composed of a major parent (43,254) and a minor parent (M29095) (Fig.Â
