<p id="Par14">The whole genomes of three DENV isolates were successfully sequenced, and they were confirmed to be DENV-2 by nucleotide BLAST analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of 122 DENV-2 strains based on the full coding sequence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and the E regions (Fig. S1) showed that three Korean isolates (43,248, 43,253, and 43,254) belonged to the Cosmopolitan genotype, and one strain in Korea (KBPV-VR29) belonged to the American genotype. Three viruses of the Cosmopolitan genotype were further divided into two sublineages: sublineage 1 (43,253 and 43,254) and sublineage 2 (43,248). The nucleotide sequence identity values of DENVs within the Cosmopolitan genotype were 95.2–99.9% within sublineage 1, 95.2–99.8% within sublineage 2, and 93.0–96.4% between the two sublineages. The most similar strains to the Korean isolates were Singapore 2015 (KY921905, 99.86%) to 43,248, India 2015 (MH822954, 99.9%) to 43,253, China 2015 (KY672952, 99.87%) to 43,254, and Brazil JHA-1 (JG686088, 99.78%) to KBPV-VR29. All sequence files are available in the GenBank database (accession numbers MK629884-MK629886).
