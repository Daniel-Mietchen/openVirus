<p id="Par16">For the 100 E genes of DENV-2 strains, the rate of nucleotide substitution and TMRCA with over 200 ESS values were obtained (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The rate of nucleotide substitutions was 5.32 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup> (95% high probability density [HPD] interval, 4.11 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup> to 6.69 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup>). The TMRCA of the Cosmopolitan genotype was found to be 70 years with a 95% HPD interval between 51 to 90 years (1945 [1925–1964]). The TMRCAs of sublineages 1 and 2 within the Cosmopolitan genotype were calculated to be 40 and 59 years, with 95% HPD intervals between 29 to 52 years (1975 [1963–1986]) and 46 to 75 years (1956 [1940–1969]), individually. The TMRCA of the American genotype was evaluated to be 133 years with a 95% HPD interval between 101 to 172 years (1882 [1843–1914]). The mean TMRCAs of the epidemic strains 43,248, 43,253, and 43,254 were 10, 4, and 7 years, respectively.
