<p id="Par17">The results of selection pressure analysis for each viral protein of the 122 DENV-2 strains are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Positive selection pressure was only identified in the three non-structural proteins NS2A, NS3, and NS5 proteins. The highest rates of negative selection pressure were identified in the NS3. Inversely, there was a significantly lower value of the C protein in DENVs compared to those of the other nine proteins.
