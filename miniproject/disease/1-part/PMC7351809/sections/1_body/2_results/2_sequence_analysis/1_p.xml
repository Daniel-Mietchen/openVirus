<p id="Par15">The amino acid sequence encoded by each ORF of the four Korean DENV isolates (43,248, 43,253, 43,254, and KBPV-VR29) were compared to the most similar strains of each virus and the DENV 2SS strain (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The most variable regions of DENV isolates of in the Cosmopolitan genotype compared to DENV 2SS were identified in the prM protein, but the KBPV-VR29 strain in the American genotype exhibited the lowest sequence similarity in the C protein. The E proteins commonly showed sequence identity values of over 97%. The results of nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons of E proteins between the Korean isolates and DENV 2SS are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. In general, the amino acid sequence identity values were higher than the nucleotide sequence identity values.
