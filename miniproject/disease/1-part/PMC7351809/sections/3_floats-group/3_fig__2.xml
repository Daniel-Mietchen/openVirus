  <p>Bayesian evolutionary analysis of dengue viruses in Korea. The model was evaluated using a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock with a prior Bayesian skyline coalescent. Yellow shaded strains indicate dengue virus type 2 isolated in Korea. Four genotypes including American/Asian, Asian 1, Asian 2, and Sylvatic were compressed and expressed as the triangle shape. The nodes indicate the node heights</p>
