 <p id="Par1">In Korea, dengue infection has been frequently reported in travelers to tropical and subtropical countries. Global warming increases the probability of autochthonous dengue outbreaks in Korea. In this report, the molecular and evolutionary properties of four dengue virus (DENV) type 2 isolates from Korean overseas travelers were examined. Three of these isolates were classified as Cosmopolitan genotypes and further divided into sublineages 1 (43,253, 43,254) and 2 (43,248), while the other isolate (KBPV-VR29) was related to American genotypes. The variable amino acid motifs related to virulence and replication were identified in the structural and non-structural proteins. A negative selection mechanism was clearly verified in all of the DENV proteins. Potential recombination events were identified in the NS5 protein of the XSBN10 strain. The substitution rate (5.32 × 10
  <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site) and the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for each evolutionary group were determined by the Bayesian skyline coalescent method. This study shows that DENV type 2 strains with distinct phylogenetic, evolutionary, and virulence characteristics have been introduced into Korea by overseas travelers and have the potential to trigger autochthonous dengue outbreaks.
