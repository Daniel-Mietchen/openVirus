  <p>Performance of the Pathogen ID v3.0 resequencing microarray to detect and identify hantavirus sequences. A plasmid encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the PUUV prototype strain Sotkamo was used to evaluate the range of detection of the Pathogen ID v3.0 resequencing microarray. This figure compares the calculated sequence identity (%) between the tested sequence (PUUV Sotkamo) and each PUUV sequences tiled on the microarray with the respective Call Rate (CR, i.e. % of determined nucleotides) obtained after hybridization. Colours, values and arrows outline a window of sequence identity (%) for BLASTN results obtained from each output sequence following hybridization: from no detection/identification (blue), to general PUUV characterization (Sotkamo + others, orange) to precise and exclusive characterization (Sotkamo, red). Complementary information is described in Table
