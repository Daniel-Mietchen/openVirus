<p id="Par23">Amplified products were hybridized overnight at 45 °C on the microarray PathogenID v3.0 after fragmentation and labeling using GeneChip Resequencing Reagent Kit (Affymetrix). Chips were then subjected to washing, fluorescence detection and scanning using the Affymetrix equipment (Wash Control, Scan Control). Resequencing analysis was performed using the software GSEQ. 4.1 (Affymetrix). For each of the 52 hantavirus sequences fixed on the chip (positions seq222 to seq273), an output sequence was obtained in a .txt format, with determined (A, G, T or C) or non-determined (N) positions (example in Supplement 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Significant sequences obtained were used for Call Rate calculation and BLASTN analysis.
