<p id="Par9">Upon sequence selection, PathogenID v3.0 was manufactured by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, California) according to their high density resequencing approach, based on the use of stepwise overlapping 25 nt long probes, the first covering position 1–25 of the tiled sequence, the second position 2–26, etc.: each probe comprises a set of 4 different alleles differing in the central 13th position (e.g. A, C, G or T)
