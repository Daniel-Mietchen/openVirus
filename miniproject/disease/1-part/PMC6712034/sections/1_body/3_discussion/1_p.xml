<p id="Par38">Hantaviruses are zoonotic agents distributed world-wide. In Europe, rodent-borne hantaviruses are regularly provoking episodes of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS). Tools to survey hantavirus circulation, geographical distribution and genetic features in the animal reservoir are essential to a better understanding and prevention of hantavirus infection in humans. Resequencing microarray has been shown powerful to precisely identify new genetic variants of emerging viruses
