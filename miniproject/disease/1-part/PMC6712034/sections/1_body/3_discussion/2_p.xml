<p id="Par39">The present work represents a significant improvement of the resequencing microarray PathogenID developed through a collaborative study for detection and identification of orthohantaviruses circulating in Europe. The 1
 <sup>st</sup> and 2
 <sup>nd</sup> generations of PathogenID allowed to detect different viruses associated with hemorrhagic fevers, including hantaviruses; however they also showed their limits for the detection of PUUV
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup> which is the most common and widespread European hantavirus causing a mild form of HFRS, Nephropatia Emidemica (NE)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, we have switched the strategy for the design of the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> generation PathogenID v3.0 used in this study. Tiled sequences did not target anymore the most conserved region of the genome, the L segment
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>, but the S segment encoding the N protein, which present two advantages: it is more efficient to discriminate variants within a species; more sequences are present in GenBank. After a critical analysis of the taxonomy, 52 representative hantavirus sequences were selected among those available at the time of the conception of the chip (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The resequencing methodology (Supplement 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) allowed to recognize both known viruses and previously unknown geographical variants.
