<p id="Par4">PathogenID is a collaborative effort of teams of Institut Pasteur that combined expertise to develop 3 generations of resequencing microarrays for the detection of different emerging pathogens, bacteria and viruses, during public health urgencies and for research studies. The 1
 <sup>st</sup> and 2
 <sup>nd</sup> generations of the microarray contained only a limited number of viral sequences, 46 (PathogenID v1.0) and 126 (PathogenID v2.0), respectively. In particular, only sequences of six prototype orthohantaviruses, mainly associated with human diseases, were included: PUUV, DOBV, SEOV,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. The targeted sequence corresponded to part of the large (L) segment coding for the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), reputed to be the most conserved region of the genome

 </sup>. While PathogenID v2.0 has been validated for detection of DOBV, SEOV, HTNV, ANDV and SNV in infected Vero E6 cells, it was not for PUUV, yet the most commonly circulating orthohantavirus in Europe
