<p id="Par30">It clearly appeared that the CR values were proportional to the sequence similarity between the tested sequence and the tiled ones (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). From 100% (seq225, Sotkamo itself) to 91.5% (seq231) of identity, the CR was very high (97.7% to 75%, resp.) and the BLASTN identified the Sotkamo strain without ambiguity. Down to 82.2% of sequence identity (seq230), the CR remained above 34%, still designing Sotkamo in priority by BLASTN, although some tiled sequences already hesitated in precise identification (seq232) or even failed in identification (seq226). Down to 82% of homology, the CR decreased dramatically and the tested sample failed to be identified in some cases. Plotting of the sequence identity to the CR confirmed these observations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>): below 80.7% of identity between the tested and the tiled sequences the microarray becomes inefficient for specific detection; the window between 80.7% and 83.2% of identity is critical and versatile between no detection, detection with unspecific determination, and precise genetic characterization of the tested sequence; higher than 83.2% of identity, the microarray identifies precisely the tiled sequence.
