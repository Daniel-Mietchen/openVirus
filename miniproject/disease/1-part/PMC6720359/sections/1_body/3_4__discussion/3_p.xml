<p>The 2017-2018 influenza season was characterised by an IBV lineage mismatch with the WHO-recommended TIV IBV component (B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus, Victoria-lineage) [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All the IBVs characterised in Apulia belonged to the Yamagata lineage, although in the rest of Italy a few sporadic cases of B/Victoria were also reported [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Almost all of the vaccinated patients with IBV infections had received TIV or aTIV, suggesting that the lineage mismatch contributed to the severe impact of the influenza epidemic. Notably, all of the characterised B/Yamagata strains belonged to clade 3, as did B/Phuket/3073/2013, which was contained in the QIV, but not in the TIV or aTIV [
