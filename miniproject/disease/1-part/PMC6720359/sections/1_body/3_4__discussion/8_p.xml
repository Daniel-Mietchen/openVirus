<p>This study may have some limitations. First, a bias could have occurred because the strains selected for the sequence analyses were mostly from patients with SARI and ICU-ARDS and may not have been fully representative of the circulating strains in Apulia. Second, we have no data on the possible circulation of strains that were resistant to antiviral therapy, because the NA gene was not sequenced.</p>
