<p>Five A/H1N1pdm09 strains identified in Apulia had D222N or D222G substitutions, and four of these strains were from individuals with ICU-ARDS. These variants, which have been present in Italy since 2009 [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], are associated with clinical severity because of enhancement of the binding affinity for the alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptor (avian-like) in the lower respiratory tract, compared with the affinity for the alpha-2,6 sialic acid receptor that is present at higher density in the upper respiratory tract [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Binding to the alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptor enables these strains to replicate at high levels in lung tissue, resulting in severe disease [
