<p>The phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene of the A/H1N1pdm09 virus showed that all the Apulian strains belonged to the subclade 6B.1, as did the 2017-2018 vaccine strain. Replacement of the A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09-like 2016–2017 vaccine strain with the A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1)pdm09 strain in the 2017-2018 formulation increased vaccine effectiveness against A/H1N1pdm09 in Europe to 55–68% [
