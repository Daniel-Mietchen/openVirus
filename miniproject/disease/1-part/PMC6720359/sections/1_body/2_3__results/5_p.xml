<p>The comparison of the proportions of IBV cases by age groups showed that IBV infection was significantly more frequent in patients with severe influenza (ICU-ARDS and SARI cases) compared to sentinel patients (ILI cases) for the 0–4-year age group (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and &gt;74-year age group (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.002). For the 5–14, the 15–49, and the 50–64-year age groups, IBV infection was significantly more frequent in ILI cases compared to patients with severe influenza (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), whereas no significant difference was found for the 65–74-year age group. A/H1N1pdm09 was significantly more frequent in all ICU-ARDS and SARI cases compared to ILI cases (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), except for the 15–49-year age group (
 <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05).
