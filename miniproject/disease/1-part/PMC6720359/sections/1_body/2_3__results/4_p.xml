<p>ICU-ARDS occurred in 50 individuals, 8 of whom were vaccinated for the 2017-2018 influenza season, and all but 3 of whom had comorbidities. Death occurred in 23 of these individuals (46.0%). The age group with the highest proportion of ICU-ARDS was the &gt;74-year age group, in which 12 of the 50 individuals with influenza (24.0%) had ICU-ARDS, whereas no children &lt;15 years old were affected. Viruses identified in ICU-ARDS were A/H1N1pdm09 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25), A/H3N2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), and IBV (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24), notably B/Yamagata (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3</xref> shows the distribution of the number of cases of influenza by age group and type of virus identified for the ICU-ARDS, SARI, and ILI cases. ICU-ARDS in the 15–49-year and 50–64-year age groups was mostly associated with influenza A/H1N1pdm09 infection, whereas among the 65–74-year and &gt;74-year age groups, most of the ICU-ARDS infections were with IBV. In the &gt;64-year age group, 14 of 18 IBV infections (77.8%) involved B/Yamagata virus. SARI were more frequent in children aged less than 5 years, with the majority of cases associated with IAV, and, in particular, 51.3% were caused by A/H1N1pdm09. In ILI cases, the 15-49-year age group was the most represented and 83.6% were due to B virus.
