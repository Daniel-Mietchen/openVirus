<p>A total of 2,175 patients was tested for influenza viruses, and 565 (26.0%) were positive. IBV strains were identified in 401 of the positive samples (71.0%), with IAV strains in 164 samples (29.0%). At first, most samples contained IBV, but after week 5/2018, identification of A/H1N1pdm09 became predominant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Among the 164 identifications of IAV, 149 (90.8%) were A/H1N1pdm09, 7 (4.3%) were H3N2, and 8 (4.9%) were not subtyped. Four coinfections with A/H1N1pdm09 and IBV were identified. Of the 401 IBV identifications, 269 (67.0%) were characterised and belonged to the Yamagata lineage. The lineage of the other 33.0% of the B viruses was not determined.
