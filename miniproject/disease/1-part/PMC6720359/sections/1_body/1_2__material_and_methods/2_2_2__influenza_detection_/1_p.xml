<p>Respiratory samples were subjected to nucleic acid extraction by MagNA Pure, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Influenza viruses were detected with a commercial real-time PCR assay (Anyplex RV16 Detection; Seegene, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Subtyping of influenza A virus (IAV) was performed with a commercial real-time PCR assay (FTD Flu differentiation; Fast Track Diagnostics, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg). Specimens that were positive for IBV were subtyped with a reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay targeting the specific HA genes of IBV Victoria and Yamagata lineages. The assay was performed with primers and conditions previously reported by the WHO [
