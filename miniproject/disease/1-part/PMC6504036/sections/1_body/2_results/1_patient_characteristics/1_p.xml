 <xref rid="pone.0216308.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Median length of stay in the emergency department was 5h 20min (Interquartile range (IQR): 4h 43minâ€“ 7h 39min). Four tests were used to calibrate the cobas Liat system. Nine tests (5%) were performed in duplicate: four because a computer network failure led to the loss of results, two because of RT-PCR failure and three for unknown reasons. Thus 200 tests were analyzed for 187 patients.
