<p>It must be remembered that identification of the virus is only a part of the clinical diagnosis and management. Although the results of this study are important, further studies are necessary to assess the clinical impact of influenza RT-PCR assay at triage in order to evaluate its effects on decision-making and the prescription of complementary examinations. Point of care testing is only useful if it has an impact on treatment. Some studies have shown a positive impact on medical costs [

Interestingly, one study demonstrated a change in clinical prescribing practices when using a point-of-care RT-PCR test compared with a rapid antigen detection, suggesting that clinicians had greater confidence in those tests.[

For example, it could prevent the unnecessary prescription of drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), which are recommended for patients with severe respiratory symptoms and limit contagion, however they have also been found to lead to drug resistance.[
