<p>Only a few studies that evaluated RT-PCR assays respected the constraints related to use in an emergency department. Two studies compared assays from the cobas Liat system performed in the emergency department to Cepheid“s GeneXpert Xpert Flu assays (rapid central testing) during the 2017–2018 flu season. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The sensitivity and specificity of the cobas Liat system ranged from 0.85 to 0.99 and 0.96 to 0.99, respectively. The study that reported the lower sensitivity might have been subject to bias because only negative results were systematically centrally controlled, thus increasing the likelihood of false positives. Only one study investigated the performance of RT-PCR assay at triage [
 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and found a sensitivity and specificity of respectively 1.00 and 0.95. However, this result is based on only 38 specimens obtained during a normal working day. Furthermore the samples used were only incidentally assayed using the rapid RT-PCR as well as the laboratory RT-PCR test, and thus results were at risk of being biased because it was not clear why they were selected to be tested twice.
