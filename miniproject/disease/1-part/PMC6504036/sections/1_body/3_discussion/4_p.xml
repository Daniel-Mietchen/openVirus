<p>The ease of performing rapid RT-PCR assays at the triage point of care and the accuracy of the results meant that the early viral identification facilitated appropriate treatment more quickly than if laboratory viral analysis had been used. In previous studies which failed to show an effect, or showed a minor effect, of nucleic acid testing on clinical decision-making in patients with respiratory symptoms it is notable that many clinical decisions, especially involving antibiotic prescriptions, were made before the viral identification test results were received.[

In the present study, very few tests failed, despite the fact 49% were performed at night or weekends when staffing levels are routinely lower. Even though the majority of RT-PCR assays were performed during the busiest hours for the emergency department, results were available within a median of 46 minutes from a patientâ€™s entry into triage. Such a quick result would allow prompt decisions.[
