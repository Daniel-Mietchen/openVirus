<p>Several other studies evaluated the accuracy of RT-PCR assay in the emergency department. One study, that used the cobas Liat system in four emergency departments and eight outpatient clinics, reported a sensitivity and specificity above 0.97.[

 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The Alere Influenza A&amp;B (now ID NOW) has also been tested in an emergency department setting, and showed good specificity (0.98) but low sensitivity (0.64).[

 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Direct comparison of rapid molecular tests for the detection of influenza was carried out under laboratory conditions using samples from patients admitted to an emergency department. In those conditions, the sensitivities of the Abbott, Roche, and Cepheid tests were 0.91, 0.96, and 0.97 respectively and the overall specificities were 0.99, 0.98, and 0.98 respectively.[

Furthermore, it is unclear whether tests were all performed in the ED or in laboratory of virology. Only large emergency centers can afford to employ a laboratory assistant [
