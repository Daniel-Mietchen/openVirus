<p>This study demonstrated that the detection of influenza A/B virus using rapid RT-PCR assay at triage performed by nurses 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week was both feasible and reliable. The sensitivity and specificity of the cobas Liat system for the detection of influenza A/B was higher than 0.98, even when performed by a trained professional (in this case a triage nurse) without direct laboratory supervision. Less than five percent of tests failed.</p>
