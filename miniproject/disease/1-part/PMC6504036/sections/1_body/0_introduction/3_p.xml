<p>The current gold-standard for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses is nucleic acid testing.[
 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, this analysis is normally performed in a virology laboratory and results are only available after several hours. New, rapid nucleic acid tests have been developed for use at point-of-care; they can be conducted at the bedside and yield results in less than 30 minutes. Laboratory studies have shown that these tests have very high sensitivity and specificity.[

 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Rapid nucleic acid testing is simple to use and thus can be performed as soon as the patient arrives in the emergency department, allowing rapid viral identification. At the time of writing, however, data are unavailable on the diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid testing when performed by non-specialized personnel in busy, real-world point-of-care conditions. The accuracy of such assays could be reduced by inappropriate sampling and/or incorrect use of the device. In addition, the usefulness of these assays could be questioned by operational aspects related to patient flow. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid RT-PCR assay for influenza A/B by nurses at a triage point of care.
