<p>During influenza epidemics, the management of patients attending the emergency department for influenza-like illness is organized around three priorities. [
 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The first priority is to assess the severity of the symptoms in order to determine the most appropriate clinical pathway for the patient: discharged home, admission to a general ward or admission to an intensive care unit. The second priority is assessment of the need for antiviral treatment; this is based on factors like co-morbidities and respiratory symptom severity. Thirdly, the patient is isolated to prevent aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses.[

 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Viral identification is also necessary to ensure selection of appropriate anti-viral treatments and to avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics; this is particularly important in certain patient groups, such as those at risk of bacterial colonization.[

 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Evaluation of the patientâ€™s viral-status is important to determine if the patient requires isolation or not, and thus to ensure the smooth running of the emergency department and hospitalization units.[
