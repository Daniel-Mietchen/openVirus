<p>Based on the estimation that 45% of samples would be positive to influenza A or B, a sample size of 173 patients was required.[
 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In this case, a specificity and sensitivity of 99% could be estimated with an accuracy of 2%.[
 <xref rid="pone.0216308.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] We included at least 185 patients in order to account for possible assay failures. The performance parameter results are expressed as 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the alpha risk was set at 5%. 95% CI for sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to the score method corrected for continuity.[
