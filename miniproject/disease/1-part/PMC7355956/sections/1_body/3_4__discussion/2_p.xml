<p>Several of the participants noticed an improvement in their medication regimen since starting on ART medications a few decades ago. While some of the participants described a decrease in the number of ART medications taken daily, others mentioned a reduction in the tablet size, or even the side effect profile. However, the large tablet size or the pill burden did not prevent any of the participants from taking the prescribed medications. Earlier research conducted with African-born HIV-positive women living in London described the process of taking ART medications as “invasive, disturbing, and disgusting.” [

These findings are contrary to ours, in which none of the narratives describe the act of taking ART medications as aggressive or revolting. Furthermore, the authors suggested further studies to ask the study participants about their “feelings around the physical futures of the tablets.” [

Our current study asked each participant about the physical characteristics of the tablets, and most of the participants did not comment. One possible interpretation of these findings was answered by one of the participants who compared her ART regimen in Africa to that in the U.S. According to her statement, “the tablets are tiny and easy to swallow in the U.S.”
