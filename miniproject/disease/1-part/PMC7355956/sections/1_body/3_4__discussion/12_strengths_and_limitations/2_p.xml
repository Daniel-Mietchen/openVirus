<p>These study results should be considered in light of some limitations. As mentioned above, all of the participants in this study reported themselves as adherent to the ART medications. The perceived high adherence rate in this study could not be checked against data claims or medical records. Nevertheless, even within this sample, all of the participants had a form of insurance at the time of the interview. Finding non-adherent or non-insured participants was challenging because recruitment occurred via fliers through pharmacies and HIV clinics. Consequently, this sample might not be representative of the full spectrum of the African-born PLWH in Minnesota, and may limit the generalization of the findings to the wider population of African- born PLWH in Minnesota.</p>
