<p>This study uncovered unique findings by presenting detailed stories of African-born participants’ experiences with ART medications. The narrative interviewing methodology enabled us to capture these stories and interpret results in context. Additionally, the participants in this study represented seven countries in Africa, and their medication experiences may vary within their own country and culture. Therefore, this cultural diversity among our participants enhances our understanding of how cultures shape African-born PLWH’s medication experiences.</p>
