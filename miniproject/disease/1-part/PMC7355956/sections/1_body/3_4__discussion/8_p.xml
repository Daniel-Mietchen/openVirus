<p>Although previous studies have shown the role of religion in the lives of PLWH, a novel finding of this study is the role played by a monotheistic religion in all the participantsâ€™ lives, regardless of their country of origin and their faith. The two major religions that predominate on the continent of Africa are Christianity and Islam. These religions are monotheistic; thus, they pray to only one God. The participants in this study explained that their belief in God provided them the power and strength to endure the difficult moments in their lives. Consequently, our present study identified common factors, such as the power of prayer and the role of God, across seven different African countries.</p>
