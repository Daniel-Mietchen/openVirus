  <italic>“My driving force is that I’m a Christian. We believe in life after, and in our church also we teach health… We support people with HIV but some people there’s still stigma… We understand that when your day comes to die, is when God has decided that day for you... All this I’ve gone through; God has been there with me. I’m still walking with Him and I will live my full life until when He said I’ll die is when I’ll die…”</italic>
