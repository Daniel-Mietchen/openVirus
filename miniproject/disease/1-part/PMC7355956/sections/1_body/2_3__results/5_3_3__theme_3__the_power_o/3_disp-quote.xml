  <italic>“Do you know I stayed 10 years without taking {ART} medicine? From 1994 I come to take medicine 2004. The whole time is faith, when I get sick, I would call my pastor, we would pray and I think yeah, the belief, only the faith, that faith just to believe, it helped me so much, even today. That is how I don’t think medicine only, the medicine also I have with God.”</italic>
