<p>Some of the participants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) described religious activities they were taking part in, such as attending Mass, engaging in church events, or studying the Bible together. The participants did not want the religious community to know about their HIV positive status, because the disease is stigmatized. Even though some of the participants belonged to a religious community, they would be very careful about to whom they disclosed their HIV positive status. Furthermore, if they shared their HIV status in the religious community, it would be with a person they trusted, and in most cases, they shared the diagnosis with another HIV positive person, who could understand and would not judge them.
