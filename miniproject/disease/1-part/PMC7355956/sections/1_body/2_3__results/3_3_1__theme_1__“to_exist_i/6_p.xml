<p>Several participants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) were started on ART medications at least a decade ago. Some of them noticed the differences between the size of the tablets or even the “pill burden.” For Participant 10, the current regimen is much more appealing to take, since the medications are smaller in size compared to the previous ones, that were much larger and more difficult to swallow. The participant uses the term “tiny” repetitively, suggesting an emotional reaction to the regimen.
