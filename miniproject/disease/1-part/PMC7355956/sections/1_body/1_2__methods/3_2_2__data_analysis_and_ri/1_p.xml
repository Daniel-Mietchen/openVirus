 <xref rid="B29-pharmacy-08-00108" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This method has been described in qualitative analysis as inductive coding [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmacy-08-00108" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The inductive codes were combined, based on the similarities, into categories that led to the emergence of themes [
