<p>Rigor in the study was achieved by using the framework proposed by Lincoln and Guba [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmacy-08-00108" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For example, confirmability was obtained by using a three-member research team who reviewed the codes. One researcher reviewed the codes of two transcripts, while the other researcher coded four interviews independently. Then the team met several times to discuss the codes, and consensus was achieved. Credibility and dependability were obtained throughout the data collection and data analysis. In addition to the analytical memos, the principal investigator wrote summaries that captured non-verbal communication that might be relevant to the data analysis. These summaries also included the principal investigatorâ€™s thoughts on the interview questions that might need to be rephrased, and areas for further questioning when interviewing other participants. Transferability was addressed by providing dense descriptions in the findings that reflect the lives of PLWH.
