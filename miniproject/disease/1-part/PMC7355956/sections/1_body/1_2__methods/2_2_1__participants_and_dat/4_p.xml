<p>Semi-structured, in-person interviews were conducted with the recruited participants at the time and location selected by the participant. The interview questions were developed by the principal investigator based on extensive review of the literature (See 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmacy-08-00108">Appendix A</xref>). To ensure that the instrument aligned with the scope of this research, the principal investigator consulted with her team comprised of experienced researchers and health professionals (pharmacists and physicians), who specialize in HIV/AIDS. In the fall of 2017, a pilot interview was conducted with an African-born participant who was not HIV positive. The interview was not audio recorded. Additionally, the questions were tested on three participants who were African-born and for whom English was not their mother tongue. The interview questions pertinent to these objectives are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmacy-08-00108">Appendix A</xref>. A more detailed description of this methodology has been published [
