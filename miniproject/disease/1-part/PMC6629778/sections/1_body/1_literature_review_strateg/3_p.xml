<p>The search yielded 949 results in PubMed. Article titles, authors, keywords, and abstracts were imported into Sysrev.us (Insilica LLC) and each abstract was reviewed and labeled independently by two individuals. Abstract labels included the following: flavivirus (yes or no), flavivirus type (DENV, WNV, ZIKV, or other), study type (
 <italic>in vivo, in vitro</italic>, or 
 <italic>in silico</italic>), model species (human, mouse, primate, or other), organ model (brain, biological barrier, immune system, or other), study objective (antiviral therapy development, vaccine development, human pathogenesis, transmission dynamics, vector control, virus characterization, and mosquito-virus interactions), and overall include or exclude along with the option to add notes with a reason for excluding the article (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Articles were excluded from the review for the following reasons: article is unavailable, article is not original research (review, opinion, editorial, letter, or comment), article is not in English, study does not pertain to DENV, WNV, or ZIKV, study exclusively uses 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> methods (animal or human), or study is focused on diagnostics or detection methods or the economic burden of disease. After each abstract was labeled by at least two individuals, article information with associated labels was exported as a CSV file from SysRev.us (Insilica LLC). Overall, 318 of papers were excluded from the review. Of the remaining included articles, most (378) were 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studie followed by 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies (219) with less (34) studies which combine 
 <italic>in silico</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).
