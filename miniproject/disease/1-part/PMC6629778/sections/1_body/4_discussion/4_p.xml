<p>Thus, far, both 
 <italic>in silico</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods have primarily been developed to generate preliminary data that would typically be followed by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> testing to validate findings. This significantly reduces the amount of animal testing required for MBF research but does not completely replace animal testing. In the long-term, it would be advantageous to further develop 
 <italic>in silico</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods with the goal of replacement in mind, because often, preclinical success in animal models does not translate to efficacy in human clinical trials, and failure in an animal model does not necessarily indicate a lack of human efficacy. Logically, the failure of certain drugs or vaccines when moving from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to pre-clinical 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> or from pre-clinical animal models to humans is often a function of specific pharmacological properties of potential drugs, and replacing animal models will require additional novel 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches that can accurately predict bioavailability and stability of drug candidates. However, a combination of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods have the potential to bridge this translational gap between preclinical and clinical research, and more integrated approaches combining or linking different studies and methods are essential to better understand the mechanism of MBF infection and resulting diseases and improve the drug development process.
