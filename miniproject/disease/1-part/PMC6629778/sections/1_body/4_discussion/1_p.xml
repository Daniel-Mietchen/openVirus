<p>MBF infection is considered a major public health concern, and DENV, ZIKV and WNV, in particular, present a high burden of associated neurological disease. Neuropathogenesis associated with MBF infection is often human-specific, and thus, it has been difficult to find adequate models to study treatments and prevention strategies. Understanding the advantages and limitations of models used in MBF reserch is important in obtaining good quality data (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There is a need for additional scientific interest and funding to increase the rate of post-mortem studies that emphasize pathophysiology. There is also a lack of prospective studies that follow individuals infected with MBFs. Such studies could provide insight into the progression of signs and symptoms alongside molecular and serology studies. Moreover, studies on naturally infected patients could aid in the investigation of biological samples other than blood that could be used to diagnose MBF infection and elucidate MBF reservoirs (e.g., urine in ZIKV infection).
