<p>Mouse models are a more cost-effective and practical alternative to NHP models. The use of mouse models has resulted in a robust body of knowledge in MBF research, and this has been reviewed elsewhere (Clark et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, two main factors are recognized to influence the susceptibility of mice to MBF infection that limit applicability to humans: (1) immunocompetent wild-type mouse strains have been demonstrated to favor resistance to disease after peripheral inoculation with DENV and ZIKV (Clark et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zompi and Harris, 
 <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), so immunocompromised mice (Dhole et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Oh et al., 
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Kuszpit et al., 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), humanized mice (An et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), and mouse-adapted viral strains (Amorim et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Daniels et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) are used and (2) in mice, MBF infection via mosquito biting, the natural route of infection in humans, results in a lack of severe clinical manifestations (Styer et al., 
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Cox et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zompi and Harris, 
 <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Moser et al., 
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), so alternative routes of infection, such as subcutaneous (Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), intraocular (van den Pol et al., 
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), intraperitoneal, intravenous (Xavier-Neto et al., 
 <xref rid="B236" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and mucosal (Yockey et al., 
 <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), have been used. Among those routes, intracranial inoculation has been used most, but it does not elicit the early peripheral immune response that occurs in humans (Kimura et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Shao et al., 
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For more information about animal models, see
