<p>There is a call to reduce the global burden of neurological disease caused by flavivirus. DENV continues its steady expansion and constitutes the most common mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. WNV is the most widespread flavivirus causing neurological disease in the world and exemplifies the potential transmission of flaviviruses outside tropical regions. ZIKV recently caused an unpredicted epidemic in the Americas is responsible for thousands of cases of microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Different strategies have been studied to limit the exposure to these infections and eradicate the occurrence of neurological involvement. Vector control has been explored with limited results. Therefore, vaccination is the mainstay intervention to prevent flavivirus infection.</p>
