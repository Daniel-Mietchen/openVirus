<p>Though an efficient WNV vaccine for humans is not available, vaccination of equine population has been a successful strategy to immunize control human transmission (Ng et al., 
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; El Garch et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This is possible because WNV primary reservoirs are birds and horses, while humans are dead-end hosts for the virus. WNV live attenuated vaccines are the most advanced and had efficiently passed phase II clinical trials (Biedenbender et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Subunit and DNA vaccines encoding E and prM proteins are also being developed. DNA vaccines have passed phase I clinical trials, showing safety and immunogenicity (Martin et al.,
