<p>The most recent clinical trial published in 2017, demonstrated safety of vaccination in individuals previously exposed to flavivirus. The TV003 vaccine was not associated with severe disease in this group (Whitehead et al.,

In 2015, the re-derived, live attenuated, tetravalent dengue virus (TDEN) vaccine also demonstrated to be safety and immunogenic for in individual ranging from 1 to 50 years of age independently of a prior exposure to the infection in Puerto Rico (Bauer et al.,

 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In 2015, the live attenuated tetravalent vaccine TDV demonstrated to be safe and induce anti-DENV neutralizing antibodies in flavivirus-naïve adults in the United States (George et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In 2016, the WHO recommended the use of Dengvaxia, a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine, in regions with 70% of DENV seroprevalence. To date Dengvaxia is licensed in 11 countries for people age 9–45 years.
