<p>The development of a DENV vaccine has been a complex task to accomplish for different reasons. First, there is no an adequate animal model that recapitulates human DENV infection. Second, DENV has four antigenically different serotypes, each with intrinsic genetic variation. The natural infection with one serotype confers long term immunity against the infecting serotype, but the humoral response fails to neutralize the other serotypes. Third, DENV heterotypic infections have been associated with an increased likelihood of severe clinical manifestations possibly attributed to an immune enhancement of the infection driven by cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies (Collins and Metz,

Due to these concerns the development of a DENV tetravalent vaccine has been the focus over the 21st century; this vaccine should elicit a rise long-lasting protective immunity against all the serotypes. Several phase I and II clinical trials have been completed using monovalent or tetravalent live attenuated (Edelman et al.,
