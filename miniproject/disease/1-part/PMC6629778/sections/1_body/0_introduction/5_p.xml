 <italic>In vitro</italic> human cell-based and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models have emerged as useful tools in MBF research with the goal of clarifying viral neurotropism and neuropathogenesis, accelerating the process of antiviral drug and vaccine development, and understanding transmission patterns. Besides, there are other flaviviruses able to cause neurological diseases (such as Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis virus), and due to the size of the review search, we have focused this review on 3 of the main flavivirus with neurological pathology as an example of the flavivirus research. This review aims to summarize the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> research on DENV, WNV, and ZIKV and to define a roadmap for 21st century biomedical research on MBF neuropathogenesis, prevention, and treatment.
