<p>WNV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients with neurological symptoms (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Carteaux et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) but the mechanism by which these viruses elicit a neurological effect remains unclear. Studies on the tropism of MBF and the associated histopathological changes following natural human infection have been reported. However, published results from human studies are limited and highly descriptive because they do not reflect the evolving dynamic between the host and the pathogen, which is crucial to understand the pathophysiology of these infections (Bearcroft, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>; Armah et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Because of the limited number of preclinical 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrating efficacy, clinical trials for MBF drug candidates are scarce. Several candidates of a human WNV vaccine have undergone pre-clinical testing mainly in mice, horses, and NHPs (Amanna and Slifka, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), but none has been licensed for use in humans. Clinical trials for ZIKV vaccines are still in the early stages. Only one MBF vaccine, CYD-TDV or “Dengvaxia,” a recombinant, chimeric, live attenuated tetravalent vaccine for DENV has been licensed. The manufacturing and licensing of antiviral drugs has also been challenging due to a lack of suitable models to evaluate novel agents. Supportive treatment is the current standard of care and most prevention strategies are focused on decreasing the exposure to the arthropod vectors responsible for the transmission of MBFs. The development of experimental models of neuropathogenesis following WNF and ZIKV infection has thus been a central focus in preclinical vaccine research and antiviral drug development of this virus (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, neuropathgogenesis of DENV is generally less well studies and not a focus of vaccine or anti-viral research.
