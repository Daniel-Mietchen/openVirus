<p>ZIKV presented a limited bibliography, with only one paper for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB models. In this study, HBMECs were grown in a rotating bioreactor to develop a human 3D cell-based model of the BBB microvascular endothelium characterized as a sphere of endothelial cells with a cavity inside (Bramley et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Infection studies using this model demonstrated that ZIKV did not easily infect the HBMEC model, but that exposure to TNF-Î± could enhance infection (Bramley et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). ZIKV has also been studied using models of other biological barriers, such as the blood-testis barrier (Siemann et al., 
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and the umbilical barrier (Jacobs and Levin, 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Raekiansyah et al., 
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
