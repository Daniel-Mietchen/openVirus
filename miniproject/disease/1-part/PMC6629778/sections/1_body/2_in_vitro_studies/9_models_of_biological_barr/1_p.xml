<p>Brain endothelial cells are the most important barrier to prevent viral invasion and spread from the blood to the cerebral parenchyma. MBF infection frequently produces encephalitis, which requires crossing this blood-brain barrier (BBB). Two main types of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB models have been developed: static (multilayer cultures, multicompartment cultures) and dynamic models (employing microfluidics) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Static models typically use 3D extracellular matrix platforms (Geltrex, Matrigel) and transwell plates, while dynamic models include a hollow fiber-based apparatus and/or microfluidic devices (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> models of the BBB are not frequently used in the study of MBFs (seven studies on WNV, six studies on DENV, and only one study on ZIKV were retrieved in this literature review). Although the current volume of publications is low, BBB 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models are tremendously important to understanding MBF neuroinvasion. All the models identified in this literature review were static BBB models, but many other models that have recently been developed could be applied to MBF research (Brown et al.,
