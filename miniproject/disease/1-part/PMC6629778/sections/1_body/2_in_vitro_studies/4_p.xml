<p>Several cell lines have been used to study MBFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The most common cell lines used to study MBFs 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero cells, 106/412 studies), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, 94/412 studies), and mosquito Aedes albopictus clone C6/36 cells (86/412 studies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is because these three lines are often used to replicate viruses but not always to study pathogenesis, and often after replication, other cell systems or animal models are used (Azeredo et al.,
