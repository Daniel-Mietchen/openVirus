<p>The majority (270/412 studies) of reviewed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies focused on DENV, followed by WNV (111/412 studies) and ZIKV (73/412 studies) (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> literature. There were fewer studies on ZIKV, which is understandable, because ZIKV outbreaks have only raised concern in recent years.
