<p>Many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were focused on pathogenesis research (201/412 studies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models have been used to study the effects of MBF on early stages of embryonic differentiation (Liang et al., 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), viral receptors (Tsai et al., 
 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Qian et al., 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Dang et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), the interactions of different cell types during pathogenesis (Diniz et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Verma et al., 
 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bramley et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and the mechanism by which the blood brain barrier (BBB) becomes compromised (Roe et al., 
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> methods have also proven useful in drug screening (Allen et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Astashkina et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and have potential to aid in the selection of drug candidates for future phases of drug development (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Recently, a high-content screening platform to study possible antiviral candidates for ZIKV was developed, in which human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were treated, following ZIKV infection, with over 1,000 US FDA approved drugs and drug candidates (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Treatments were validated with more complex systems, such as human fetal-like forebrain organoid models and animal studies (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), which demonstrates that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods can aid in selection of drug candidates prior to the use of more complex methods, saving resources and time.
