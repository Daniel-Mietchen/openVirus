<p>Immune system models found in this literature review were mainly used to study DENV, with fewer studies found for WNV or ZIKV. Most 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on MBF infection and the immune system were focused on viral molecular mechanisms. However, a few papers were focused on neuroinflammation. For example, human macrophages were used to study the role of Sema7, a membrane-associated/secreted protein that plays an essential role in connecting the vertebrate neuronal and immune systems in WNV pathogenesis (Sultana et al., 
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The majority of papers studying neuroinflammation are 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. There is therefore an urgent need to generate better 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models that represent the complex relationships between the brain and immune system and that can more accurately model neuroimmune responses. The development of new 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> brain models incorporating microglia have the potential to become an important tool to study neuroinflammation following MBF infection. For example, recently microglia have been incorporate into a 3D iPSC derived model in order to study inflammation after ZIKV infection (Abreu et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, integrating the wider, peripheral immune system with the brain remains one of the major challenges for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> technologies.
