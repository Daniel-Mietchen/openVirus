<p>Stem cell-based models comprised only about 6% of the studies retrieved in this review (24/412 studies, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has increased in recent years, and it is expected that this will be reflected in MBF research soon. Many of the studies that used iPSC cells were developed to study ZIKV in 3D 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models of the brain, such as brain organoids, spheroids, or other organotypic cultures (Dang et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Such models have emerged in response to new epidemics of ZIKV in the Americas and around the world as well as in response to the need for novel tools to study virus pathogenesis and identify potential drug candidates with more human-relevant systems to study MBF infection.
