<p>Advantages and disadvantages of 3D cultures have been summarized elsewhere (Alepee et al.,

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Majolo et al., 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In summary, 3D models have shown to better reproduce the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> situation than 2D cultures. This is achived via the spatial conformation of 3D models allowing higher differentiation, survival and interaction between cells. In the case of brain models, 3D models allow growing neurons to interact with other cells for a longer period, which in 2D cultures is not possible, since these cells cultures tend to detach. Moreover, more complex models have been generated, but this complexity leads to other issues, such as lower reproducibility and higher researcher skill demands.
