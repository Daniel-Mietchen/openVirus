<p>Over the last few years, we have seen an increase in the use of organotypic cell cultures (Pamies and Hartung, 
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and specific models of the brain (Lancaster et al., 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Quadrato and Arlotta, 
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Sloan et al., 
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The recent outbreak of ZIKV has also generated an increase in the number of publications focused on brain models as a platform to study ZIKV (Cugola et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Dang et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Nowakowski et al., 
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Garcez et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These models include neurospheres, brain organoids, 3D multilayer cultures of brain cell types, and brains-on-a-chip, among others. These 3D models can be generated through cell aggregation, by plating cells into an artificial or animal-derived extracellular matrix (ECM), such as a matrigel, or using a combination of methods. Cell aggregation can be accomplished with gravity (e.g., hanging drops and aggrewells) (Beauchamp et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), spinning using bioreactors (Qian et al., 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), or gyratory shaking (Pamies et al., 
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) (
