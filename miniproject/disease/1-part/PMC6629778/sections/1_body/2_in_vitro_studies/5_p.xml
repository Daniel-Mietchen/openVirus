<p>The other cell lines which were prominent in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> literature were primary cultures (mainly from mouse and human tissue, 82/412 studies) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs, 55/412 studies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Human PBMCs are a convenient source of human primary cells, because they can be obtained from both healthy volunteers and infected patients of all ages. These cells can also be used to study innate aspects of infection as well as the adaptive response to viral infection (Gunther et al., 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Correa et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Rattanamahaphoom et al., 
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In addition, dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells can be derived from PBMCs for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of the human immune response and host-pathogen interactions (Libraty et al., 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Reis et al., 
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gandini et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the future, blood isolated cell cultures could be use for personalized medicine. For example, monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) isolated from cryopreserved PBMC have been used to study the activation of pDC after DENV infection and their potential antiviral role (Gandini et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, one of the problems with PBMCs is the high genetic variability in the subjects. For instance, interferon responses (which are important for MBF research) vary depending on the individual, genre, and even populations (Whitney et al.,
