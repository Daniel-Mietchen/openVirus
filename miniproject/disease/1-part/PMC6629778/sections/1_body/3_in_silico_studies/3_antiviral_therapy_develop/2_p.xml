<p>A number of studies focused on

 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Stephen et al., 
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) or the RNA dependent RNA polymerase domain of DENV (Anusuya et al.,

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Manvar et al., 
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), both of which play key roles in viral replication within host cells. In addition, many 
 <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking studies have been instrumental in screening compounds that target either the NS3 helicase domain that unwinds the viral RNA for genome replication, or the protease domain that cleaves viral precursor proteins (Pambudi et al.,

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Shiryaev et al., 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). There have also been studies which focus on screening a particular class of drug candidate for potential binding to and neutralizing of many key viral enzymes, such as the recent study in which phytochemicals were screened for their binding affinity to the structures of the ZIKV protease, helicase, methyltransferase, and polymerase (Byler et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
