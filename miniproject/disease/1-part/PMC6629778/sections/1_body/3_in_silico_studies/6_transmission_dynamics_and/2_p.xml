 <italic>In silico</italic> transmission dynamics studies have incorporated non-traditional data sources into epidemic prediction models, such as Google search trends or other web-based data sources for epidemics of DENV (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B239" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and ZIKV (Majumder et al., 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; McGough et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Teng et al., 
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). 
 <italic>In silico</italic> studies such as these allow for an understanding of the timing and magnitude of MBF epidemics, as well as the environmental factors which can influence transmission. Many studies also incorporated potential vaccination strategies for DENV, to evaluate potential effectiveness of various vaccine scenarios given transmission dynamics typical to an endemic region and justify vaccination programs (Thavara et al., 
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Knipl and Moghadas, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Hladish et al., 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
