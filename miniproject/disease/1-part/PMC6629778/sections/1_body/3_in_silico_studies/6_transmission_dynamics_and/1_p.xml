<p>Much of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> MBF research focuses on modeling transmission and outbreak dynamics to predict epidemics and model prevention and mitigation strategies. In this review, over one-third of the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies were labeled as transmission dynamics studies. Many studies have utilized climate- or meteorological-based simulations of transmission by birds and mosquitoes along with other epidemiological and vector life cycle model inputs to predict transmission of WNV (Bouden et al.,
