<p>In addition to studies focused on ZIKV-associated microcephaly, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> tools have also been used to explore the mechanism by which DENV infects and replicates within host cells (Anglero-Rodriguez et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and to predict human protein interactions with DENV (Doolittle and Gomez, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Computational methods have also been used to identify patterns in inter-individual variation in DENV viral load following infection (Ben-Shachar et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Also, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models can use protein sequence information to predict intrinsic disorder within the viral proteome, indicating where proteins lack a fixed 3D structure and display functional diversity and structural plasticity. Computer-based prediction of the intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) in DENV revealed a positive correlation between the level of IDP in DENV and WNV capsid and membrane proteins and virulence (Goh et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Observations that the most disordered proteins are associated with the most virulent viruses are crucial for designing novel drug targets and in enabling a greater understanding of virus attenuation needed for vaccine development.
