<p>Efficient clinical translation of basic research findings is of paramount importance to protecting public health with regard to outbreaks of MBF infections. However, the traditional approach to development and testing of new biomedical products using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies in the early stages of pre-clinical drug development can be time consuming and prohibitively expensive. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> methods allow researchers to interpret large amounts of biological data efficiently, reduce costs, and speed up the early stages of drug development. The use of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> modeling tools in MBF research has already aided in the identification of disease transmission patterns, allowed researchers to predict risk factors associated with the spread of MBF infection, and molecular modeling has advanced the mechanistic understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level as well as allowed researchers to identify potential vaccine candidates and therapeutic strategies. Such studies represent promising advancements in the field of MBF research and indicate great potential for an efficient, inexpensive, comprehensive, and mechanistically-driven drug candidate identification process.
