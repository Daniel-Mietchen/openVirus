<p>In this literature review, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> modeling and other computational techniques were shown to be valuable to MBF research and a promising direction for the field moving forward. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> studies retrieved in the literature review were categorized by applicability to MBF type (DENV, ZIKV, WNV) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The majority of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies were focused on DENV (180/253 studies), followed by WNV (75/253 studies), and ZIKV (66/253 studies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). There were also studies labeled with more than one MBF type because many of the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models (39/253 studies) were found to have general applicability to all or many types of flaviviruses (e.g., studies based on models of a shared protein structure or transmission dynamics modeling of a vector host species which carries more than one type of MBF). The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> literature was also sorted by study objective into the following categories: vector control, vaccine development, transmission dynamics, antiviral therapy development, mosquito-virus interactions, or human pathogenesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Most studies were labeled as either antiviral therapy development studies (99/253 studies) or transmission dynamics studies (91/253 studies), followed by vaccine development studies (24/253), vector control studies (23/253 studies), human pathogenesis research (22/253 studies), and mosquito-virus interaction studies (4/253 studies) (
