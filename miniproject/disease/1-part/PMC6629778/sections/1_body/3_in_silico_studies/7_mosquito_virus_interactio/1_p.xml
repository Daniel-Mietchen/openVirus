<p>The study of mosquito-virus interactions, which was represented in very few 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies that were reviewed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), is fundamental for MBF research because these viruses must replicate in mosquito cells in order to continue their transmission cycle. The studies in this category focused on assembling genomic and gene expression databases or computational analysis tools that allow the study of interactions between the viral and vector genome (Dissanayake et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Dudchenko et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Others focused on the protein-protein interactions that occur when an MBF infects one of its mosquito host species (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Doolittle and Gomez, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Leveraging computational databases and tools such as these can aid in the development of novel vector control strategies, such as genetic modification.
