<p>Vaccine development is a relatively new application of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods within MBF research. Recently, computational tools and immunoinformatics approaches have been developed for virtual screening of antigen sequences to predict epitopes that can act as vaccine targets. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations have been conducted as a first step in the design of epitope-based peptide vaccines for DENV (Lund et al., 
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Jones et al., 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), WNV (Larsen et al., 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and ZIKV (Alam et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Dikhit et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Ali et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In addition, bioinformatics software and neural networks were used in a recent study to evaluate a tetravalent protein subunit vaccine for all four serotypes of DENV (Fahimi et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A mathematical model that simulates many of the cellular and protein dynamics involved in the host immune response was also recently developed as a tool to model vaccination effects (Bonin et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and could become a useful strategy for vaccine development in combination with other pre-screening methods.
