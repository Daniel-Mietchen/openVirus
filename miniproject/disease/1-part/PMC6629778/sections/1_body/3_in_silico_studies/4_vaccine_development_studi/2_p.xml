<p>Immunoinformatics and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> screening approaches such as these have potential to reduce the amount of time and resources needed for epitope identification compared to traditional peptide screening methods, and have demonstrated their usefulness in the initial stages of vaccine design, such as in pre-screening of potential vaccine candidates. Such prediction models could allow vaccine candidates with greater immunological relevance against emerging infections to be identified at a rapid rate in order to speed up the process of vaccine development for emerging MBF infections.
