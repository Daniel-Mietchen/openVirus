<p>Following an infected mosquito bite, CHIKV is introduced into the human skin and into the bloodstream, causing high viremia, and when it reaches the target organs, it gives rise to pathological signs. Infection in humans usually manifests as fever, myalgia, and arthralgia, and in a small percentage of individuals, it gives rise to a range of so called “atypical signs” (defined as symptoms other than fever, myalgia, and arthralgia). The virus also replicates in lymphoid organs either before (axillary lymph nodes) and/or after the passage in the blood stream (lymph nodes and spleen). Moreover, non-arthropod-borne routes of transmission have been described (vertical transmission) or suspected (sexual transmission).</p>
