<p>IFN-I and IFN stimulated genes are key factors of the innate antiviral immunity [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], and the role of IFN-I response in the context of CHIKV infection is evidenced by the full susceptibility to severe CHIKV infection of IFN-type-I receptors deficient (IFNAR -/-), in contrast to adult wild-type (wt) mice [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In vitro, CHIKV does not directly stimulate IFN-I production in immune cells. In contrast, infected non-hematopoietic cells (fibroblasts) sense viral RNA in a Cardif-dependent manner, and participate in the control of infection through the production of IFN-I [
