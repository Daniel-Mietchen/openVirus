<p>Bone loss is another hallmark of CHIKV arthritis, and osteoblasts are a site of CHIKV replication and persistence [

 <xref rid="B165-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Ex vivo infection of human osteoblasts induced the secretion of IL6 and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL), and a concomitant decrease in the osteoproteogerin (OPG) content in culture supernatants. This perturbation in the RANKL/OPG ratio has been evidenced in infected murine joints and in patientsâ€™ sera [
