<p>Together with joint inflammation, cartilage degradation also takes place in CHIKV infected individuals. In humans, the presence of elevated levels of cartilage bioproducts in urine (i.e., proline, hydroxyproline, and mucopolysaccarides) [

 <xref rid="B122-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], are indicative of connective tissue alteration and cartilage damage. In mouse models of CHIKV-induced arthritis, the destruction of cartilage and the formation of large areas of collagenosis and fibrosis were observed [
