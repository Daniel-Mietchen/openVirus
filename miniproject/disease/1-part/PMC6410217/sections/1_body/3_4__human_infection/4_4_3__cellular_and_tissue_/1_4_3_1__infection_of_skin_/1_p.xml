<p>In human skin, the first human organs supporting viral replication upon a mosquito bite, the dermal fibroblasts, constitute the main site of viral amplification, as demonstrated in vitro [

 <xref rid="B142-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. In these cells, CHIKV infection determines a strong antiviral IFN-type-I (IFN-I) response, alongside the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The induction of many antiviral genes (e.g., viral sensors, IFN-I receptors, and IFN stimulated genes (ISGs)) is however contrasted by components of
