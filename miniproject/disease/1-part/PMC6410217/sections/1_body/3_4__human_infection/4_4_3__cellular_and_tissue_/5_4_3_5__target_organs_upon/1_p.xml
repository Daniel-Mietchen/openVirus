<p>Cases of mother to child CHIKV transmission have been reported, and a recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the risk of this secondary route of viral spread [
 <xref rid="B196-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. Across the cohorts examined in this review, the overall risk for mother to child transmission was 15.5% (206/1331), with risk for symptomatic neonatal disease as 50.0% among intrapartum, and 0% among antepartum/peripartum maternal infections. Symptomatic newborns develop a wide range of clinical signs, including fever; arthralgia; irritability; poor feeding; rashes; and, occasionally, multiple organ involvement, meningoencephalitis, and long term neurodevelopmental delays [
 <xref rid="B196-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. In a cohort study, delivery via caesarean section appeared to have no influence on the transmission risk, supporting the notion of the trans-placental transmission of CHIKV, rather than exposure in the birth canal [
 <xref rid="B197-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Notably, three cases of early maternal–fetal transmission (&lt;16 weeks’ gestational age) occurred during the outbreak in Reunion Island, which reportedly described the presence of viral RNA in the amniotic fluid (three fetuses), in the placentas (two fetuses), and in the brains (two fetuses) of aborted fetuses [

 <xref rid="B199-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>], and a fatal Brazilian fetal case of the Zika virus and CHIKV co-infection presented with CHIV RNA in the placenta [
