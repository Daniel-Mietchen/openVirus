<p>CHIKV RNA and proteins have been identified in the synovial tissues and fluids during acute and persistent arthralgia [

 <xref rid="B158-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>], and both synovial fibroblasts and macrophages are susceptible to CHIKV [

The histological analysis of a chronic patient’s biopsy showed the active replication of CHIKV in joint macrophages’ infiltration of activated NK cells and T cells (mainly CD4), and extensive apoptosis, while the analysis of the protein content of the synovial fluid revealed high levels of matrix metalloproteinase MMP2 (involved in tissue remodeling), CCL2, IL8 (monocytes and neutrophils chemo-attractive cytokines), and IL6 (multifunctional cytokine involved in inflammation) [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. These data show that CHIKV-infected macrophages are a preferential site of viral persistence, in which the active replication of the virus take place and contributes to chronic symptoms.
