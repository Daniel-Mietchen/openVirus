<p>Viral replication in human blood was first suggested by strong viremia (the blood viral load can reach up to 10
 <sup>9</sup> RNA copies/ml) [
 <xref rid="B149-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>], but one pioneering study showed that the only in vitro infected lymphoid cells producing viral particles were primary monocyte-derived-macrophages [
 <xref rid="B140-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Since then, CHIKV tropism for blood cells has been more extensively studied, and the active infection of human blood monocytes and, to a lesser extent, of B lymphocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), was demonstrated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from acutely infected patients, and upon in vitro infection [

 <xref rid="B151-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Viral replication was accompanied by upregulated levels of immune mediators (e.g., IFNα, IL-6, MCP1 (CCL2), IP-10 (CXCL10), MIP-1β (CCL4), and IL1Rα, MIG (CXCL9), IL1β, and TNFα) [
 <xref rid="B150-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] and high levels of inflammatory cytokines (such as IFNα, IL-6, MCP1 (CCL2), IP-10 (CXCL10), MIG (CXCL9), IL1β, and TNFα) in the plasma of acutely infected CHIKV patients was found to correlate with high viral titers or disease severity [
