<p>A relevant model of infection showing viremia and clinical signs similar to those seen in humans was developed by Labadie and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B166-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>], who inoculated a CHIKV IOL isolate into 15 cynomolgus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>). High titers of viral RNA were measured in lymphoid organs as well as in the liver, where viral antigens localized in macrophages, DCs, and endothelial cells. The acute phase was also characterized by strong mononuclear cellsâ€™ infiltrations in the spleen and lymph nodes [

 <xref rid="B190-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>], and viral RNA has been detected in the liver of a human fatal case [
