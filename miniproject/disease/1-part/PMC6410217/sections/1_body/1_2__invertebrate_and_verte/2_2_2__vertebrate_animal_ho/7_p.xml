<p>Two trials of experimental viral inoculation, using two ECSA strains (one isolated from a patient in South Africa in the 1970s, the other from Comoros Island mosquitoes in 2005), have been recently performed to identify potentially competent hosts among domestic and wild animals common to North America [

 <xref rid="B81-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The authors tested nine avian, twelve mammalian, three amphibian, and seven reptilian species in order to assess the onset of viremia and seroconversion upon CHIKV infection. The animals with detectable CHIKV viremia were some mammals (i.e., hamsters, C57BL/6 mice, and big brown bats), amphibians (Leopard frog and Texas toad), and reptiles (Ball python, Burmese python, Garter snake, Green iguana, Red-eared slider), and seroconversion occurred in all of the viremic reptiles, in Texas toads, and in bats. Moreover, a neutralizing antibody titer was measured in some of the non-viremic species, including domestic/farm/wild mammals (dog, pig, horse, calf, goat, armadillo, and raccoon), and a small proportion of birds. None of the tested animals developed clinical signs [
