<p>This is in contrast to Asia, where the virus principally cycles between the two main vectors (i.e.,

The role of vertebrate animals of new endemic regions (i.e., the Americas and the Pacific) and Europe in the amplification and survival of CHIKV has been poorly investigated to date. Indeed, the majority of studies evaluating the natural infection of non-human-vertebrate hosts have been realized in Africa (12 studies) (reviewed in [
