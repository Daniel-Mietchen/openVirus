<p>Before 2004, CHIKV caused small outbreaks in confined regions within Africa and Asia. Then, the virus started to cause large outbreaks, and spread to novel areas, including Europe, the Americas, and the Pacific Islands. Notably, no specific antiviral treatment is available yet, and the case management of CHIKD patients is based on supportive care.</p>
