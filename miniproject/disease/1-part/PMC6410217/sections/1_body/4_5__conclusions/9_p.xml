<p>Global vigilance and vector control measures are needed, taking into account that a large range of mosquitoes are or may become competent for viral transmission. So, those actions specifically targeting the two main vectors (i.e., 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic>), would not be sufficient, and could even favor the expansion and gain of competence of other species.
