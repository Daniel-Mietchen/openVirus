<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family, has caused over 70 epidemics between 1952 and 2018. It was first identified in 1952 in present day Tanzania (East Africa), and was isolated from infected patientsâ€™ sera, and from 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes in 1953 [
