<p>The first molecule indicated as a CHIKV receptor in 2012 was Prohibitin 1 (PHB1), a multifunctional membrane protein expressed by numerous cell types [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In microglial cells, PHB1 was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the CHIKV E2 protein, and the number of infected cells was significantly lowered when using anti-PHB1 blocking antibodies (a reduction of 20% to 40% compared with the untreated control) or upon PHB1 silencing (reduction of approximately 30%). In the presence of blocking antibodies, the viral production was also significantly reduced [

The same group later confirmed the role of PHB1 in viral entry by pre-incubating HEK-293T cells with flavaglines (prohubitin ligands) before CHIKV infection. This pre-treatment reduced both the percentage of infected cells (20% to 40% reduction) and the viral production (approximately 40% reduction) [

In 2018, Michael Diamond and colleagues, through a genome-wide screening for the cellular factors required for CHIKV entry, identified the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8. They demonstrated that blocking this molecule prior to CHIKV infection significantly reduced the number of human primary synovial fibroblasts (50% reduction .ca), skeletal muscle cells (70% reduction .ca), osteoblasts (70% reduction .ca), and chondrocytes (70% reduction .ca) [

 <xref rid="B86-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Nevertheless, the lack of Mxra8 on the membranes of some CHIKV target cells (e.g., keratinocytes) indicates that this factor can be dispensable.
