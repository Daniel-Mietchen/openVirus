<p id="Par11">Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute viral infection occurring mostly in infants and children. Its name is derived from the typical presence of oval vesicular lesions on the hands and feet, and painful oral mucosal ulcerations. The major etiological agents of HFMD are Human Enterovirus A (HEVA), most commonly, Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), although several other viruses such as EV-D68 and CVA6 have also been implicated [

Severe cases are exceedingly rare in teenagers &gt; 14 years and adults. EV71 has been associated with severe and sometimes fatal neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, encephalitis, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. There are very limited reports of neurological manifestations in an adult with EV71 infection. In this study, we report a 16-year-old teenage boy with HFMD due to EV71 infection with severe neurological complications.
