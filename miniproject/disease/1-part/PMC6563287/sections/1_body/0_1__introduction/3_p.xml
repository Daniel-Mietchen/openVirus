<p>Both HA and NA interact with sialic acid (SA), which usually links to glycoproteins and glycolipids at the cell surface [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HA binds to SA moieties presented by cellular receptors, triggering virus entry by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, although other endocytic routes, including micropinocytosis and raft-dependent endocytosis, may also be used [
