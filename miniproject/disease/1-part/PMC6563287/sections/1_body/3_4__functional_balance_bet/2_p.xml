<p>There is no straightforward method to determine the HA/NA balance of IAVs, and the most frequent method is to study each glycoprotein (HA or NA) separately. For example, the HA affinity against different substrates (α-2,3 or α-2,6 SA) can be estimated by glycan binding assay, and the NA activity can be assessed by different methods including chemiluminescence, fluorescence and glycan array assay [

However, not only the relative HA binding affinity and NA enzymatic activity to SA, but also several other critical factors comprehensively contribute to HA/NA balance, and the virus fitness is tuned in a much more complicated and finer way.
