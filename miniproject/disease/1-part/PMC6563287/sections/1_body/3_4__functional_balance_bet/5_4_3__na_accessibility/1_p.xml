<p>The ability of NA to access the cell surface SAs is also essential for the functional HA/NA balance. Variable lengths of the NA stalk region can have a significant impact on the accessibility, although the mechanism is yet to be fully understood. Using reverse genetic techniques, a series of NA mutations differing only in the stalk length were generated, and studies showed that altered stalk length did not interfere with NA activity to cleave fetuin or a small substrate in vitro, but the increased stalk length enhanced virus replication accordingly [

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. It is commonly accepted that reduced stalk length results in a diminished height of NA, and the towering HA may thus block the shorter NA from gaining access to the receptor SAs [

It has been reported that NA stalk truncation has arisen from an evolutionary adaptation of avian IAVs from wild aquatic birds to domestic poultry [

 <xref rid="B110-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The 2009 pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm09 with truncated NA stalk showed greater lethality in mice and virulence in ferrets compared to the untruncated counterpart [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. It is possible that in these situations, the reduced NA accessibility might reflect the reduced HA binding affinity or enhanced NA activity.
