<p>The relative HA binding affinity and NA activity are the foremost determinants for virus infection into a cell. In addition, a number of physical characteristics of the virus that can influence the HA/NA balance are also important. For example, the ratio of HA-to-NA is one critical factor. On average, ~300–400 HA spikes and ~40–50 NA spikes are present on the surface of a virion, and the excess of HA over NA may compensate to the weak affinity of HA for SAs by forming more connections to form a stable interaction, and vice versa [
