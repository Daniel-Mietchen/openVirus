<p>The complementary and antagonistic effects of HA and NA on SA interaction suggest that HA and NA competitively cooperate with each other, instead of a simplistic view that HA is responsible for virus entry while NA is involved in viral particle release, in the viral life cycle. However, the effect of the functional HA/NA balance is still poorly understood. Current antiviral therapies mainly target NA, while recent approaches to new influenza therapy include monoclonal antibodies targeting the HA [

 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Caution should be exercised in these approaches since it is possible that HA binding inhibitors may re-balance HA to reduce NA activity mediated by NA inhibitors, and compensating mutations in the NA may allow escape from HA inhibition and vice versa. Thus further studies to investigate the interactive roles of HA and NA in the viral entry of influenza viruses have implications in the basic biology of influenza replication and pathogenesis and in the development of therapeutics and vaccines.
