<p>The NAs of human H3N2 strains acquired an SA binding property [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, in contrast to the SRBS, the receptor binding function of these N2 NAs resides in the same site with the catalytic site; mutations at threonine 148, histidine 150 or aspartate 151 near the catalytic site of these NAs contributes to the acquisition of receptor binding, and the NA mediated agglutination could be inhibited by NA inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Yet the catalytic and receptor binding sites seem not to be identical since the relative sensitivity of the two functions to NA inhibitors varies [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The biological role of the NA catalytic site-associated receptor binding function for these H3N2 isolates remains unclear, but the fact that entry of MDCK cells with viruses having D151G substitution can be blocked by NA inhibitors suggests that it is an important function [
