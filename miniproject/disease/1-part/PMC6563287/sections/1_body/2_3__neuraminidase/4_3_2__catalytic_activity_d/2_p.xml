<p>When it comes to infection of target cells, not every binding attempt results in success infection. Most SA associated molecules bind to HA but could not mediate endocytosis of IAV. The infection of IAV, however, is initiated by HA binding to specific IAV entry receptor proteins, such as the killer-activating proteins NKp44 and NKp46 in natural killer cells, the epidermal growth factor receptor in lung epithelial cells, and the recently identified voltage-dependent Ca
