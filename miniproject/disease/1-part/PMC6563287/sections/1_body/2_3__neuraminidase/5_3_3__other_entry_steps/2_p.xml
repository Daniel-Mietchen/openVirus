<p>When the NA genes from influenza H9N2, H5N1 or A(H1N1) pdm09 virus was respectively expressed on a PR8 background, the replication kinetics, both in vitro and in vivo, were not affected, but different effects on infection initiation, virus release and fusion of infected cells were observed, implicating a role for NA during the early stage of infection [

Quantitative proteomics analysis further demonstrated that many proteins postulated to be involved in cell-cell fusion were up-regulated in the cells infected with rPR8-H5N1NA or rPR8-H9N2NA viruses than the cells infected with wild-type virus, although the full mechanism remains to be explored [
