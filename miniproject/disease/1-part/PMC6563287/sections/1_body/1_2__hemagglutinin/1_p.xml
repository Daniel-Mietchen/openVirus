<p>HA is translated as an uncleaved HA0 precursor protein, assembled as a homotrimer in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the plasma membrane via the secretory pathway. HA0 is further cleaved into an HA1-HA2 complex by a host protease. The mature HA1-HA2 complex consists of two domains: the membrane-proximal helix-rich stalk domain, primarily composed of HA2 with some HA1 residues, and the membrane-distal globular domain (also known as the “head”) comprised of HA1, containing a SA binding pocket [
