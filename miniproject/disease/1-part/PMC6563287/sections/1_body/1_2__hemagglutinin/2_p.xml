<p>Infection of IAV is initiated when HA binds SAs on the host cell surface and triggers internalization by endocytosis. The low pH condition of the maturing endosome triggers a series of pH-induced conformational changes in HA that ultimately result in the fusion of the viral and host endosomal membranes [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The linkage of terminal SA to the penultimate galactose occurs via carbon 3 or carbon 6, generating two isomers α-2,3 and α-2,6 SA, respectively [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The SA of α-2,3 isomer predominates in the avian gut, where influenza virus replicates in avian hosts, while the α-2,6 conformer is abundant in the human upper respiratory tract, the primary site of virus replication in the human host [

This receptor specificity, which is partly directed by the structural features of the HA receptor binding pocket, is one of the most important determinants that influence host tropism, including interspecies adaptation and transmissibility [
