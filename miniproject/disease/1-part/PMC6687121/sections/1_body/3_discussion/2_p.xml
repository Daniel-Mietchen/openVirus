<p>Because the outbreak occurred in multiple areas at the county level, we evaluated the spatial correlation. According to the semivariogram, the semivariance was relatively low in the short range and gradually grew to the maximum. This means that the closer the counties are located geographically, the more similar the number of the dengue cases were and the stronger the regional impact the disease was. The ratio of the partial sill to the sill is the key indicator, which represents the extent of variation due to spatial autocorrelation. In the study, this ratio was 83.67%, which suggested that the spatial autocorrelation was relatively strong in general and that the variation due to the spatial autocorrelation was the main contribution to the observed difference. The result of global autocorrelation analysis also presented a similar conclusion. The cases affected each other across the counties by importing the disease from one area to another. For this reason, we considered all cases in different counties as one cluster.</p>
