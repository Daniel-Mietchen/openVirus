<p>Another important finding is that the number of inapparent cases was far higher than the number of symptomatic infections. This high I:S ratio is almost the same as the research conducted in Huangpu town, China[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, similar results were identified in previous studies of dengue outbreaks conducted in Cuba, Colombia, Singapore and Taiwan [
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The inapparent rates were 78% to 94%. The inapparent rate was affected by many potential factors[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In our study, this high I:S ratio may be due to the type of vector and host immunity[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this outbreak, only 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> were identified, and only the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> pool was positive for dengue virus[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is thought to transmit the virus at low titers, which is associated with low levels of viremia in patients and would result in less clinically overt or severe disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Another possible explanation is that since this is the first DF outbreak in Hangzhou on record, most of the patients were the primary infection who had poor immunity and resistance against the disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When compared to secondary infections, the I:S ratio for primary infection is significantly higher[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A similar discovery was found in a cohort study in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, human and viral genetics may play an important role in the outcome of infection, and some candidate genes were found to be related to the variation in the symptoms [
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Nevertheless, the mechanism and the crucial element that affected the outcome of infection need to be determined more clearly in future studies. Overall, the inapparent cases play an important role in transmitting the disease during the outbreak that occurred in Hangzhou. Due to the large number and asymptomatic of the inapparent cases, new approaches to vector control are needed. One important measure is the adaptation of the endosymbiotic bacterium 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, which has both life-shortening effects on the mosquito and direct transmission-blocking effects on dengue virus[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Another is the release of the genetically modified 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> carrying a dominant lethal gene[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of these measures to control the 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> should be tested.
