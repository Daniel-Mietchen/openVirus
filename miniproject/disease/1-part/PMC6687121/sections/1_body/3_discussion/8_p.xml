<p>The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the change in the value of the density-independent death rate for mosquitoes would affect the epidemic magnitude to a large extent. The possible reason was the wide range (8â€“42 days) of survival time of mosquitoes. The infected mosquitoes could transmit the virus to more people as its survival time is prolonged. Otherwise, there is less opportunity for mosquitoes to transmit the virus as its survival time shortens because the minimum time from the exposed state to the infectious state for mosquitoes requires at least 7 days.</p>
