<p>A similar result was obtained for the impulse vector control measures with the daily reduction in mosquito density set to 5%. When implementing the vector control every day, every other day and every three days, 1400, 2050 and 3874 indigenous dengue cases were reported by the end of November 2 (

Surprisingly, even when vector control was implemented every three days, the magnitude of the epidemic would still decrease by 36.39% compared to the estimated incidence without intervention. Furthermore, the effectiveness of implementing vector control for ten days, twenty days and one month was estimated (

Interestingly, the effectiveness of implementing the vector control for a month is similar to that of implementing vector control every day. The total number of cases by the end of November 2 was 1574 with a month constant measure, which is slightly higher than the cases implementing the vector control every day (n = 1400). The indigenous dengue infections were 2937 and 1931 by the end of November 2 when vector control was employed for ten days and twenty days, respectively. It seems that the effectiveness of implementing the vector control with a 5% reduction in mosquito density for more than twenty days is satisfactory. The continuous vector control for more than twenty days is better than implementing the control measures every few days (
