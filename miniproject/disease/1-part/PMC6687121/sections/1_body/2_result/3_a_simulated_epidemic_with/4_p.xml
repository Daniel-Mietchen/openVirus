<p>Despite the fact that dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease and the inapparent infection can also transmit it, we still estimated the effectiveness of isolation for symptomatic cases to examine whether this control measure is necessary. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220391.g004">Fig 4</xref> indicates that the case isolation was not satisfactory for controlling the development of the epidemic. There were a total of 3770, 5031 and 5261 indigenous dengue cases by the end of November 2 for starting time on July 22, August 22, and August 29, respectively. The epidemic was only reduced by 38.10% in contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention, even if case isolation began seven days after the onset of the first case. Better results are shown from the implementation of vector control for ten days (or starting at September 8 with a 5% daily reduction in mosquito) in comparison to that of isolating the symptomatic case (
