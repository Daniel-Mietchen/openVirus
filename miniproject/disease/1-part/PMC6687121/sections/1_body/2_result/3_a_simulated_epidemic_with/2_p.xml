<p>Next, we estimated the effectiveness of different initial times of implementing vector control, setting the daily reduction in mosquito density at 5%. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220391.g003">Fig 3B</xref> indicates that earlier vector control could drastically reduce the number of human infections and shorten the epidemic period. By the end of November 2, indigenous dengue infections were 509, 1400, and 2279 for starting times of August 14, August 29, and September 8, respectively. The duration of the epidemic was 95, 114 and 125 days, respectively. The number of cases at different initial times, in contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention, was reduced by 91.64%, 77.01% and 62.58%, respectively.
