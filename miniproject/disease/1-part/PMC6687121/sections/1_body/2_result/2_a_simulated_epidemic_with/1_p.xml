<p>After the unknown model parameters were estimated, the epidemic without any intervention was fitted by these parameters as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220391.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows that the estimated accumulative incidence was significantly higher than the reported accumulative incidence. The results show that the MAPE of the modeling performance was 30.72%. The minimum MAPE was 0.46%. The estimated value and the actual data were moderately matched (
