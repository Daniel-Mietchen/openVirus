<p>Dengue is an arthropod-borne viral disease that results in a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from mild fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which can lead to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death [
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dengue has become a major public health problem since its incidence has increased &gt;30-fold in recent decades [
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent estimates of dengue disease burden have indicated that there are 390 million dengue infections and 96 million symptomatic infections in the world per year, of which 2 million are severe cases and 21,000 result in death[

 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There have been a number of DF outbreaks in Zhejiang since 2004 (83 cases in Cixi County, 196 cases in Yiwu County and 1138 cases in Hangzhou)[

 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During those outbreaks, control measures were always implemented, including enhancing leadership, conducting risk assessment, monitoring adult mosquito density and the Breteau Index, eradicating the vector, and accelerating the process of dengue case diagnosis, reporting and treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether these intensified control measures were effective and how they affected the development of dengue epidemics.
