The theoretical range of each parameter was split into 1,000 values based on the epidemiological characteristics of dengue. The changing rate of humans from the exposed state to the symptomatic state, the changing rate of mosquitoes from the exposed state to the infectious state, the recovery rate of humans from the symptomatic state to the recovered state and the density-independent death rate for mosquitoes were 0.14–0.25 (4–7 days), 0.07–0.14 (7–14 days), 0.08–0.25 (4–12 days) and 0.02–0.13 (8–42 days), respectively[
