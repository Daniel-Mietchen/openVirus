Complications and hospitalizations are more frequent in childhood. This study describes and analyses the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children hospitalized due to confirmed influenza in influenza surveillance sentinel hospitals in Catalonia. Retrospective descriptive study conducted in six influenza seasons (2010&#x02013;2011 to 2015&#x02013;2016) in persons aged 0&#x02013;17 years diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza requiring hospitalization. 291 cases were notified to the health authorities: 79.4% were due to the influenza A virus and 20.6% to the B virus. The most common subtype was H1N1 with 57.6% of cases: 52.6% were male, 56.7% were aged &#x0003c;2 years, and 24.4% were aged &#x0003c;1 year. 62.2% of cases had pneumonia, 26.8% acute respiratory distress syndrome and 11.7% bacterial pneumonia. 5.8% of cases were vaccinated and 21.3% required intensive care unit admission, of whom 54.8% were aged &#x0003c;2 years. There were 3 deaths, all with influenza A infection. Influenza A cases were younger than influenza B cases (OR 3.22; 95% CI: 1.73&#x02013;6.00). Conclusion: Children aged &#x0003c;2 years are especially vulnerable to the A H1N1 virus, including those without pre-existing chronic disease. These results are relevant for the planning of vaccination programs to improve maternal and child health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Influenza virus</kwd><kwd>Paediatrics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Program 2, Prevention, Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (PREVICET), CIBER Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Carlos III Institute of Health and the Catalan Agency supported this study for the Management of Grants for University Research (AGAUR Grant number 2017 SGR 1342).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Influenza, an acute viral infectious disease that primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, is caused by the influenza virus, which belongs to the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. There are three types of influenza viruses, which commonly infect humans: A, B and C. The first two are responsible for annual seasonal epidemics. Type A influenza viruses are divided into subtypes depending on the composition of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), two proteins on the virus surface. There are several subtypes of influenza A but, currently, the viruses that circulate and affect humans are subtypes A (H3N2) and A (H1N1). Subtype A (H1N1) pdm09 was first identified in 2009, in the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, and since then has circulated along with other seasonal viruses in the post-pandemic period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Influenza produces annual epidemics that affect between 5 and 15% of the world population. It is estimated that between 3 and 5 million people have serious influenza with complications and hospital admission annually and approximately 250,000&#x02013;500,000 people die annually due to influenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Influenza symptoms vary widely from mild to lower respiratory tract infection such as bronchitis or complicated pneumonia, leading to respiratory and multiorgan failure and death. Influenza may affect people of any age, but complications and hospitalizations are more frequent in childhood, especially in children aged &#x0003c;5 years, people with chronic disease and people aged &#x02265;65 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that children and people with chronic underlying disease are more susceptible to bacterial superinfection secondary to influenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Some reports suggest that children may more easily introduce and transmit influenza in the community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">A surveillance program of influenza and other acute respiratory infections (PIDIRAC) was initiated in Catalonia in the 1999&#x02013;2000 season, based on a network of sentinel primary care physicians (general practitioners and paediatricians) who report influenza-like activity detected in their reference population daily. The aim is to study the behaviour of influenza, detect the beginning of epidemics and characterize the circulating viruses in a representative sample of the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Since the 2005&#x02013;2006 season, the PIDIRAC has formed part of the Spanish influenza surveillance sentinel system, coordinated by the National Center for Epidemiology and the National Center for Microbiology, both of the Carlos III Health Institute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and which, since 2008 is part of the European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN) coordinated by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) which is responsible for influenza surveillance in Europe. As a result of the 2009 pandemic, in the 2010&#x02013;2011 season, the surveillance of severe hospitalized cases of confirmed influenza was introduced, using a sentinel hospital system that at that time included 12 hospitals geographically distributed throughout all Catalan health care regions. In Catalonia influenza vaccination is not recommended in childhood except if they have chronic disease that increases the risk of complications. The aim is to determine the activity of influenza viruses and the severity of hospitalized cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Various studies have analysed the distribution of influenza in the general population, vaccine effectiveness and hygienic preventive measures in our setting, but the characteristics and distribution of severe disease in children are not known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The main objective of this study was to describe and analyse the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children hospitalized due to confirmed influenza A or B virus infection in the sentinel hospitals in the six post-pandemic seasons in Catalonia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par4">We carried out a retrospective descriptive study in six influenza seasons (2010&#x02013;2011 to 2015&#x02013;2016) in children and adolescents aged 0&#x02013;17 years hospitalized due to severe acute influenza virus infection.</p><p id="Par5">The surveillance system of severe hospitalized influenza in Catalonia, a region in the northeast of Spain with 7.5 million inhabitants, included 12 hospitals covering a total population of 4,644,543 during the study period (62% of the Catalan population)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Following a standardised regional protocol with a formal case definition, the clinician made the decision on who was a case.

Four-fifths of cases were infected by influenza A and 20% by influenza B.</p><p id="Par22">Although not significant, hospitalization due to influenza was more frequent in males than in females, as reported by other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. There are few studies and no firm conclusions can be drawn, but there are suggestions that differences in sex and morbidity and mortality due to influenza may be related to endocrine-immunological interactions and behavioural and genetic aspects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">More than half the children hospitalized were aged &#x0003c;2 years, in line with other studies that found a higher risk of hospitalization in younger children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Age was also a significant differential factor when we analysed virus subtypes. The influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 subtype was more frequent and aggressive in children aged &#x0003c;2 years (63.1%), while influenza B was more frequent in children aged 3&#x02013;11 years (58.3%).</p><p id="Par24">One in five children had chronic disease. Although not significant, 24.6% of cases of influenza B had pre-existing chronic disease compared with 14.8% of cases of influenza A. This is in line with other studies, such as that by Mancinelli <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> who found that children with cancer were more susceptible to influenza B, and the study by Acar <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> which found influenza B infection is more frequent in children with pulmonary, cardiac or immune system disorders.</p><p id="Par25">Around 20% of children required ICU admission. Of these, more than three-quarters were infected with the influenza A virus, with the H1N1 pdm09&#x000a0;subtype being found in more than half the cases. The higher frequency of type A and, specifically, the H1N1 subtype, among cases admitted to the ICU, is in line with other published studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This suggests disease severity is associated with influenza A infection, as in our study, in which the three deaths were caused by influenza A, and two by subtype H1N1 pdm09.</p><p id="Par26">The percentage of cases requiring ICU admission were similar in influenza A and influenza B cases (21.7% and 19.7%, respectively). The study by Tran <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> obtained similar percentages between influenza A and influenza B cases (12.7% and 12.6%, respectively); however, these percentages were lower than those obtained in the present study but, in the study by Tran <italic>et al</italic>. all hospitalized children were included and in our study severe hospitalized children were included.</p><p id="Par27">Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome were the most frequent complications, as observed in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. A small percentage of hospitalized cases were vaccinated against seasonal influenza and only one in four children with pre-existing chronic disease were vaccinated. Jules <italic>et al</italic>. described a vaccination coverage of &#x0003c;50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, even though influenza vaccination is included in the routine vaccination schedule: before the vaccine was included in the schedule, the vaccination coverage was &#x0003c;6% in children.</p><p id="Par28">Children have a higher incidence of influenza and a higher hospitalization rate than adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and are an important reservoir in its transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, generating a high socio-economic impact due to school and work absenteeism, and to greater pharmaceutical expenditure and use of health resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. For these reasons, recommendations on the inclusion of routine childhood vaccines in vaccination programs, especially in young children, are gaining weight. European countries such as Austria, Finland, Latvia and Slovakia have introduced routine influenza vaccination for all children from 6&#x02013;7 months, while in the United Kingdom it is administered systematically from 2 years of age and before this in children at risk of influenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The United States, Canada and Japan have also included influenza vaccination from 6 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Sugaya <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the inclusion of influenza vaccination in the 2013&#x02013;2016 seasons in children aged 6 months-15 years in Japan and found a vaccine effectiveness (VE) in disease prevention of 51% for influenza A and 32% for influenza B; the VE in preventing hospitalizations was 52% for influenza A and 28% for influenza B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Currently, vaccination of people aged &#x0003c;60 years with a high risk of complications from influenza is recommended in Catalonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, but this does not include children without chronic disease, especially those aged &#x0003c;2 years, who are more vulnerable. It is important to follow up on these data in the future and analyze this aspect in more depth. Influenza vaccination as a preventive measure for all children from 6 months of age and, especially, for the youngest children, is a key measure that may benefit individuals and the whole population and has been shown to be a strategy with a good cost-effectiveness ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Currently, there seem to be no studies supporting the administration of influenza vaccine or antiviral treatment in children aged &#x0003c;6 months, due to poor immunogenicity. Therefore, in these cases, to avoid maternal disease, women should be vaccinated during pregnancy, since this may transmit antibodies that protect newborns during the first months of life. Thus, it is essential to increase vaccination coverages in this group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">This study, like all descriptive studies, had strengths and limitations. The results provide a detailed summary of characteristics of children hospitalized with severe infection. The main limitation is that it is a retrospective study and it was not possible to collect more specific information about the clinical cases, such as fever, cough, wheezing, runny nose, odynophagia, malaise, vomiting and diarrhoea.</p><p id="Par31">In conclusion, this is the first study to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of children hospitalized due to influenza in Catalonia, and the differences observed according to the viral types and subtypes. The results show that children aged &#x0003c;2 years are especially vulnerable to the A H1N1pdm09 virus, even though they have no pre-existing chronic disease. These results should be taken into account in vaccination programs and in planning for and making improvements in maternal and child health.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The members of the Surveillance of Hospitalized Cases of Severe Influenza in Catalonia (PIDIRAC) working group are: Ana Mart&#x000ed;nez, Anna Vilella, Angeles Marcos, Maria del Mar Mosquera, Delia Garcia, Elena Espejo, Fernando Barcenilla, Gemma Navarro, Joaquim Ferr&#x000e0;s, Irene Barrabeig, Jordi Pou, Josep &#x000c1;lvarez, Josep Rebull, Llu&#x000ed;s Force, Maria Rosa Sala, Montserrat Riera, Neus Camps, N&#x000fa;ria Freixas, N&#x000fa;ria Torner, Pere Godoy, Pilar Gorrindo, Cristina Rius, Rafael P&#x000e9;rez, Encarna Maraver, Dolors Mas, M&#x000f2;nica Carol, Roser Torra, Gloria Sol&#x000e0;, Sofia Minguell, Graciano Garcia, Montserrat Olona, Ana Alvarez, Josep Maria Ramon Torrel, Cristina Masuet, Josep Maria M&#x000f2;dol, Tom&#x000e0;s Pumarola, Andr&#x000e9;s Ant&#x000f3;n, Magda Campins.
