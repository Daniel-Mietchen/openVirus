<p id="Par19">Of the 62 children admitted to the ICU, 61.3%, 41.9%, 17.7% and 6.4% had pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bacterial coinfection or multiorgan failure, respectively: 81.6% of cases of pneumonia, 90.9% of bacterial pneumonia and 84.6% of acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in influenza A cases. In more than half of all influenza A cases, the cause was the H1N1 subtype. All cases presenting multiorgan failure had influenza A and, of these, 75% were due to subtype A (H1N1) pdm09. The mean ICU stay for influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 and B were longer (12.3 days (±SD 9.7) and 15.1 days (±SD 15.6), respectively) than for influenza A (H3N2) (8.3 days ± SD 2.4), although the differences were not significant.</p>
