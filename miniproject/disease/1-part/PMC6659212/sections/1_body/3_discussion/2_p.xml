 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> from PAEA (French Polynesia), selected as a positive control, was able to transmit the Suriname strain (Asian lineage). Suriname ZIKV infection, dissemination and transmission were observed at 14 and 21 dpe. These results are in agreement with other experiments reported on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> vector competence for ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, the MR766 strain (African I lineage; the historical strain isolated in 1947 in Uganda [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) was unable to disseminate and be transmitted in this mosquito species. This ZIKV strain is an old strain that has suffered several passages in mice and cells from various laboratory sources that we assume may have influenced the vector competence assays in both assayed mosquito species. Furthermore, the inefficient dissemination and transmission in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (PAEA strain) exposed to the MR766 ZIKV strain were in agreement with previous results reported by Diagne et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The differences observed between our results and other vector competence experiments in which dissemination and transmission of the MR766 ZIKV strain were reported for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], could be explained by the genetic variability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations as mentioned by Diagne et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, it is known that temperature can influence vector competence as described for several mosquito species infected with other arboviruses (e.g. dengue virus (DENV), CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] or WNV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]). A recent study showed that temperature may directly affect vector competence for ZIKV rendering the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population tested at low temperature (18 °C) unable to transmit the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, the environmental conditions used in the present study could have also influenced our results; in earlier studies where higher dissemination and transmission were observed in the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-MR766 ZIKV pairing, the assays were performed at a temperature of 28 °C in contrast to the 26/22 °C (day/night) used in our experiment (which we used to mimic summer environmental conditions in the area where the 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> population was captured).
