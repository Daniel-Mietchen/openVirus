 <sub>50</sub>/ml of both Suriname and MR766 strains and 20 females of each species were exposed to non-infectious blood. For blood-meal preparation, rabbit blood was washed and mixed with adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) (5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> M) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and virus (infectious) or cell culture medium (DMEM) (non-infectious). Females were exposed to a Hemotek
 <sup>®</sup> artificial feeding system (Discovery Workshop, Accrington, UK) at 37.5 ± 0.5 °C for 30 min. After exposure, females were anesthetized with CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Fully engorged females were selected and maintained in groups of ten in cardboard cages (Watkins &amp; Doncaster, Leominster, UK) under the same rearing environmental conditions. Throughout the experiment, the mosquitoes were maintained with permanent access to 10% sucrose solution in cotton pledges. After a period of 7, 14 and 21 days post-exposure (dpe) to infectious blood, females were anesthetized with CO
 <sub>2</sub>, legs and wings were dissected and saliva was extracted using the capillary technique as previously described [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Body, leg and wing samples were stored in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Lonza Group AG, Basel, Switzerland) and the saliva samples in 0.190 ml of DMEM at − 80 °C until ZIKV detection. Infection (IR), disseminated infection (DIR) and transmission rates (TR) were estimated to evaluate the vector competence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The IR represents virus replication in the midgut epithelial cells. The DIR shows that the virus was able to cross the midgut barrier and reach the hemocoel. The TR shows that the virus was able to cross the salivary glands barrier. We also measured the transmission efficiency (TE), which refers to the rate of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among the total mosquitoes assayed. The experimental infection was performed at IRTA, CReSA BLS3 facilities.
