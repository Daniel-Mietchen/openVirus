<p id="Par18">Suriname and African MR766 ZIKV strains provided by the European EVAg project were used in the present work. The Suriname ZIKV strain (EVAg no. 011V-01621; Asian lineage) was isolated from a placental material of a patient in Netherlands in 2016 who came from Suriname during the ZIKV epidemic [

 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) in 1947 in Uganda [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These strains were propagated and titrated to obtain the 50% tissue culture infective dose per ml (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml) in African green monkey kidney (VERO) cells.
