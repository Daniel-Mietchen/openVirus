<p id="Par21">Prior to viral RNA extraction, the samples were homogenized using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) at 30 Hz for 1 min. Viral RNA was extracted from the samples using NucleoSpin
 <sup>®</sup> RNA Virus (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Zika RNA was detected by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using the primers ZIKA 1086 and ZIKA 1162c defined previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The nucleic acids were detected with a Real-Time PCR 7500 Fast System (Applied Biosystems) with the following amplification protocol: 45 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 10 min; then 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 45 s. The RT-qPCR sensibility was 0.451 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/reaction for detection of MR766 and 0.035 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/reaction for Suriname ZIKV strains.
