<p id="Par23">For the 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> population, ZIKV was detected by RT-qPCR only in body samples for both virus strains used in the present study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As detailed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the infection rate (IR) in 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> for the Suriname ZIKV strain was 3.33% and 10% at 14 and 21 days post-exposure (dpe), respectively. For the MR766 ZIKV strain, the IR was only 3.33% at 7 dpe. In addition, both ZIKV strains were unable to induce a disseminated infection and transmission in 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic>.
