<p id="Par16">Due to the ZIKV epidemics in the American continent, some viraemic travellers coming from endemic countries have been reported in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], especially during the summer months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], raising important alarms for human health. In this context, more in-depth knowledge is required about the susceptibility of autochthonous mosquito species such as 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> for ZIKV to improve arbovirus surveillance and control programmes. For this reason, in the present study we evaluated the vector competence of an 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> mosquito population from El Prat de Llobregat (Catalonia, Spain) for two ZIKV lineages, Suriname (Asian lineage) and MR766 (African I lineage) to measure its potential role in ZIKV transmission.
