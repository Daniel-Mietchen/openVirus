 <italic>Aedes caspius</italic> (Pallas, 1771) is a floodwater mosquito species widely distributed in the Western Palaearctic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This mosquito species is tolerant to varying levels of salinity in larval breeding places [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and so is present in different habitats, including coastlands, irrigation channels, swamps and rice fields. 
 <italic>Aedes caspius</italic> is an anthropophilic species and a crepuscular feeder and is known to bite during the day and night [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These mosquitoes usually feed aggressively on humans and animals, both indoors and outdoors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus its role as an arbovirus vector may be the key for the knowledge of transmission cycle of certain diseases in Europe, especially given its anthropophilic behavior. The vector competence of some 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> populations exposed to different arboviruses has been tested in previous studies. 
 <italic>Aedes caspius</italic> populations from the Camargue (France) were experimentally found to be potential vectors of arboviruses such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> from Camargue and from Andalusia (Spain) were unable to transmit West Nile virus (WNV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and Zika virus (ZIKV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], respectively.
