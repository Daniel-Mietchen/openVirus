<p id="Par15">The ZIKV is an arthropod-borne virus belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>). The virus is primarily transmitted in a zoonotic cycle between mosquitoes and non-human primates in Africa, although sexual [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and perinatal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] ZIKV transmission have also been confirmed in humans. The virus has been associated with severe clinical manifestations and congenital malformations including microcephaly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and Guillain-Barré syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. ZIKV was isolated for the first time from a rhesus macaque monkey in the Zika forest (Uganda) in 1947 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The virus was subsequently found in Asia in the 1960s. In 2007 there was an outbreak of ZIKV in Yap Island, Micronesia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which spread to Pacific islands in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] before reaching Latin America in 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Nowadays, all isolated ZIKVs are grouped into three lineages: Asian; African I; and West African II [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. ZIKV has been isolated from numerous African mosquito species in field [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is considered to be the main vector of ZIKV in urban areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, several 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species from all continents have been observed to transmit the virus experimentally: e.g. 
 <italic>Aedes vittatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], 
 <italic>Aedes polynesiensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].
