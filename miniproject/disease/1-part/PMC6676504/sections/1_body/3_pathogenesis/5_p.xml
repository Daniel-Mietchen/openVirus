<p>As described, DVPS is a rare outcome of a second heterotypic DENV infection. Identifying those at risk and understanding why they develop overt versus silent infections continue to be focuses of research. In a long-standing children’s cohort in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from children prior to their experiencing second heterotypic DENV infections, whether overt or silent. Cultured pre-infection PBMCs were stimulated with DENV1–4 antigens. Of 30 cytokines or chemokines studied, six had elevated responses in children who experienced silent second DENV infections and three had elevated responses in children who developed symptoms during a subsequent DENV infection. Significant differences were found in cytokine production based on both the type of DENV used for stimulation and the occurrence of clinical illness. Secretion of interleukin 15 (IL-15) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) was significantly higher by PBMCs of subjects who later developed symptomatic DENV infection. These studies are beginning to show how genetic and metabolic phenomena differing between individuals may control infectious processes and host responses
