<p>Dengue viruses (DENVs) are relatively new pathogens. Transmission of virus from human to human by the bite of the mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> began around three centuries ago

 </sup>. Establishing an urban cycle required three separate emergence events: (a) evolution of a West African tree hole-breeding ancestor into 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, an anthropophilic domestic-breeding sub-species, and transportation of this mosquito (b) to tropical America via the slave trade and (c) in reverse direction to Europe and Asia where each of the four DENVs were introduced into the urban transmission cycle

 </sup>. These emergence events in all likelihood were preceded by the circulation of a parental virus in sub-human primates throughout greater Southeast Asia during the Quaternary ice age

 </sup>. Oceans rose to isolate populations of dengue-infected sub-human primates on mainland Asia and on the islands of Indonesia and the Philippines
