<p>The four DENVs are genetically related and biologically similar. Dengue is not the only human viral pathogen to circulate in biologically or genetically related groups. Many enteroviruses and respiratory viruses exist in groups of closely related pathogens. Although some degree of cross-protection may accompany sequential infections with members of these groups, most such outcomes are not well studied or understood. Dengue differs for researchers, a clear-eyed view of the observed complexity of dengue 1, 2, 3, and 4 (DENV) interactions with humans is crucial. For details of dengue disease features and pathogenesis, see my previous F1000 report

Infection with a single virus is followed by up to three outcomes: (1) durable protection against infection with a strain of the same DENV, (2) brief protection against infection or disease with a different dengue serotype, and (3) a breakthrough infection with a different dengue serotype that may result in severe disease
