<p>Intuitively, infection should result in a dengue clinical outcome. This is far from being the case. Age and viral type have an impact. In young children, primary dengue 1–4 infections are frequently inapparent

 </sup>. As children age, disease response, particularly after puberty, becomes more adult-like. The infecting dengue type interacting with age also controls disease severity. In adults, primary dengue 1 and 3 infections result in high rates of classic dengue fever but dengue 2 and 4 infections cause milder disease and are often inapparent
