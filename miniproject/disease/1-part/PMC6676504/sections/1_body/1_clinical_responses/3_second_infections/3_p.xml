<p>A literature describing unusual clinical features or outcomes of dengue infections continues to grow at a record pace fueled by the hundreds of thousands of dengue cases that present yearly to sophisticated health-care systems. It is often difficult to place these cases into a pathogenic context because of missing viral, immunological, or epidemiological details (see above). Needed are virus type, age and sex of patients, and infection parity (for example, IgM/IgG ratio) and, if there is a second heterotypic infection, evidence concerning the interval between first and second infections and the identity of first infecting DENV type.</p>
