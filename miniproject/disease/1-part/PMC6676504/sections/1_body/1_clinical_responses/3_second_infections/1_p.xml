<p>Second heterotypic dengue disease has been observed in 12 sequences 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
 </sup>. In children, overt disease is recognized clinically in perhaps 20 to 30% of second heterotypic dengue infections and severe disease in about 2%

  <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 </sup>. A high incidence of severe disease has been reported for infection sequences with DENV1–2, 3–2, 4–2, 1–3, and 2–1

 </sup>. The severity of second heterotypic dengue infections is controlled by age at the time of infection and the interval between first and second infections. Owing to their intrinsic risk of severe vascular permeability, young children are at higher risk of fatal outcome with heterotypic DENV infections 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
 </sup>. Exposure to DENV at intervals of less than 2 years may inhibit infection and suppress disease severity 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
 </sup>. Short-term protection and ultimately enhanced second heterotypic DENV infection outcome may be controlled by natural declines or changes in heterotypic antibodies (or both) following a first DENV infection 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
 </sup>. An increase in disease severity was observed when the interval between first and second infections was 20 years as opposed to 4 years 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 </sup>. As an explanation, it was observed that severe disease at a long interval was correlated with an observed steady decrease in heterotypic antibody titers over a long period 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
 </sup>. During secondary dengue infections, adults are at greater risk than children of bleeding whereas children are at greater risk than adults of vascular permeability 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
 </sup>. Human genetic inhomogeneity, particularly across ethnic groups, affects disease expression in a variety of ways 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>– 
  <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
 </sup>. The most notable genetic effect is the suppression of severe disease accompanying a second heterotypic dengue infection that has been observed in black patients in sub-Saharan Africa and is linked to a gene that regulates cellular dengue infection via lipid metabolism 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
 </sup>. A final pathophysiological constraint during secondary dengue infection is the fact that the onset of vascular permeability is correlated with defervescence. Mechanisms controlling these constraints are not well understood.
