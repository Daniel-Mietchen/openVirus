<p>A mystery in the global dengue pandemic is why, in the mid-20th century, severe dengue was highly endemic in Southeast but not South Asia

 </sup>. A remarkable nationwide survey of vector mosquitoes, dengue antibodies, and clinical disease, conducted in Bangladesh, may provide an answer. Out of 97,162 total communities, 70 were randomly selected for visits in 2014 and 2016, and one sixth of households, including 5,866 individuals, were interviewed

 </sup>. Many areas of rural Bangladesh were found to be devoid of dengue disease with low prevalence of dengue antibodies and low or no populations of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Residents of Dhaka and Chittagong, where a number of recent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya have occurred, had a high prevalence of dengue antibodies, abundant vector mosquitoes, and disease. A cluster of smaller cities and villages in the Southwestern corner of the country had modest dengue endemicity. The epidemiology of dengue in India may have been similar to that in Bangladesh today but suffered a steady invasion of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> throughout the country and into rural areas. This epidemiological evolution may explain the recent emergence of epidemic severe dengue throughout India.
