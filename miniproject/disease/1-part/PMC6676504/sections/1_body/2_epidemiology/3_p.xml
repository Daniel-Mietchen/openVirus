<p>There is now better understanding of how DENVs successfully maintain transmission when only 20 to 30% of infected persons develop a disease. Studies indicate that silent infections may contribute as much as 84% of total DENV transmission. In persons who do develop dengue disease, most infections of mosquitoes occur prior to the onset of symptoms and only 1% of mosquito infections occur after symptoms have begun
