<p>Why did Dengvaxia fail to protect seronegative children? When vaccinated children developed dengue disease despite circulating tetravalent DENV neutralizing antibodies, this provided solid evidence that conventionally measured human neutralizing antibodies were not protective

 </sup>. New observations suggest that it may be necessary to redefine the design of classic neutralization tests. When live DENV1 virus recovered from humans during the acute phase of a dengue infection was used to measure neutralization by antibodies, this virus was neutralized only by homotypic antibodies. By contrast, DENV1 grown in C6/36 or Vero tissue cultures was highly neutralized by homotypic and heterotypic dengue antibodies. Why? DENV1 grown in humans was found to be fully mature and 50- to 700-fold more infectious in cell culture than virus harvested after one passage in C6/36 or Vero cells. Human plasma and cell culture–derived DENV1 virions had identical genome sequences, indicating that differences in the neutralization of virus were attributable to the maturation state

 </sup>. Might DENV maturation status affect biological outcomes of DENV–antibody interactions, such as heterotypic protection or ADE?
