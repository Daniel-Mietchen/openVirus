<p>Another issue is that T-cell immunity may be crucial to durable protection. Studies on dengue-immune humans in Sri Lanka found that multifunctional CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were correlated with protection from DENV disease 
 <sup>

 </sup>. Functional CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were directed at a distinct pattern of non-structural protein antigens 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>
 </sup>. There is growing evidence that human T-cell responses directed at epitopes on non-structural proteins contribute importantly to homotypic and heterotypic DENV protective immunity

  <xref rid="ref-119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>
 </sup>. These observations were extended to human CD4 
 <sup>+</sup> T cells that are primed by DENV capsid, NS3 and NS5 antigens

  <xref rid="ref-121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>
 </sup>. CD4 
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T cells raised after a single dose of a tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine were directed to the same repertoire of non-structural protein antigens as T cells from naturally infected humans

 </sup>. A high frequency of CD107a 
 <sup>+</sup> IFN-Î³ 
 <sup>+</sup> CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T cells raised in A 129 mice immunized with DENV2 PDK53 live-attenuated vaccine mediated efficient viral clearance and superior protection against wild-type DENV challenge

 </sup>. Dengvaxia does not present non-structural DENV proteins to the immune system. Might this absence contribute to the ineffective vaccine protection of seronegatives?
