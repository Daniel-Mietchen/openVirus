  <title>Posterior estimate comparison based on changes to the the case detection probability.</title>
  <p>Dashed line indicates what the posterior estimates would be like if they matched the baseline posterior risk estimates. Colored points identify posterior estimates for different case detection probabilities. Yellow points are for a scenario where the probability for detecting cases was halved, and the purple points indicate estimates for when the probability was doubled.</p>
