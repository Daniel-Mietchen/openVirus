  <title>Comparison between analytical likelihood predictions and simulations.</title>
  <p>We compare the probability mass functions for the outbreak sizes for our simulations (bars) with the analytical expectation (red dots). Rows demonstrate four different transmission risk scenarios (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub>), and columns describe three different scenarios: (1) where every case within a transmission chain is detected (Perfect), (2) where all cases are detected independently with a specific reporting rate (Imperfect), and (3) where all cases are detected independently with a specific reporting rate except for the index case which is always detected (Imperfect Import). The Imperfect Import probability mass function is the one used for all analyses in this article. All simulations are completed with a reporting probability of 0.0574, and 
   <italic>k</italic> = 0.12.
