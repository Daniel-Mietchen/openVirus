<p>Prior to making importation-based updates, our initial median estimates of

 <sub>0</sub> across Texas’ 254 counties in 2016 range from approximately 0 to 1.5 throughout the year with July and August having the highest transmission risk (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Given the potential implications for determining the epidemic potential of a county, throughout the manuscript, we conduct a one-sided test at a 1% significance level of the resultant probability distributions. We thus take a conservative approach and only consider counties whose probability distribution’s 99th percentile (upper bound) is above one to be at risk for an epidemic (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1). Simply put, we only classify counties as no epidemic risk if there is less than a 1% chance of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1. Initial upper bound estimates reach as high as three, and 119 (47%) of Texas counties are expected to be at risk of a local epidemic in at least one month of the year (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). Case importations peaked in July, August, and September of 2016, with 164 (55%) of the 298 total 2016 importations arriving then (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007395.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The few detected autochthonous cases occurred in November and December, when expected risk was relatively low but not negligible.
