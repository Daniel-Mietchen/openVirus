<p>Interestingly, based on the

 <sub>0</sub> estimates, we would have predicted local transmission to occur during the summer when importations and transmission risk were high. In fact, these initial expectations for transmission were lowered even further prior to the detected locally acquired case in November. Since we estimated the posterior distributions for transmission risk and the statewide scaling factor jointly, we were able to compare the prior and posterior estimates to understand if specific counties were downgraded more or less than expected by the statewide average. We find that the ratio between prior and posterior estimates tends to average near the statewide scaling factor of 0.19, except for counties that experienced many reported importations during the year (

While the timing of the autochthonous transmission may not have been predicted using our initial risk estimates, the transmission events both occurred in the southern tip of Texas (Cameron county), which was predicted to be the highest risk county during those months.
