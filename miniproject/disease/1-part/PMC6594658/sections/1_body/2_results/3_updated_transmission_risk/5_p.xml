<p>The temporal mismatch between the model predictions and the observed ZIKV local transmission in November and December might stem from the a priori transmission risk model, which constrains posterior estimates. Specifically, the model does not account for potential time lags between ZIKV environmental suitability and eventual emergence of locally acquired cases. Environmental determinants of mosquito population growth may take several weeks or months to impact arbovirus risk. Furthermore, the timing of case reports following infection will depend on the timing and severity of symptoms, healthcare seeking behavior and clinical reporting. To assess how this effect might alter results, we incorporated a two month lag in our

 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In essence we shifted transmission risk estimates two months later than our baseline predictions suggested. For example importations occurring in November are matched with baseline transmission risk estimates from September. The resulting model yielded estimates that are more consistent with the observed ZIKV local transmission, although posterior risk estimates were remarkably consistent with our baseline results, with the highest risk period shifted by two months (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s015">S14</xref> Figs). In comparing our baseline model with the lagged one, we calculate a BIC of 2.9 in favor of the lagged model, suggesting a moderate improvement to model fit.
