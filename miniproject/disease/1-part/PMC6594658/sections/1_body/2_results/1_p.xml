<p>In the face of a novel emerging infectious disease threat, public health officials must borrow information from related diseases and/or from epidemics in geographically distinct regions. Adapting these models to new regions necessarily increases the uncertainty in risk estimates, but can prove invaluable for data-driven public health decision-making. Here we present a rational framework for updating these initially uncertain estimates with real-time case data from the emergence of Zika in Texas. The results are structured as such: we first present data from Texasâ€™ baseline importation and transmission risk estimates, we then update those estimates with importation and local transmission data, and finally present findings from validating those estimates using out of sample data.</p>
