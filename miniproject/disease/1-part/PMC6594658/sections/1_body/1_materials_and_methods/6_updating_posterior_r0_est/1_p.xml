<p>Given our set of prior distributions for county-month transmission risk, we set out to estimate the statewide scaling factor, 
 <italic>α</italic>, as a means to update our 
 <italic>a priori</italic> transmission risk estimates. We estimate the posterior distribution for this scaling factor for each day with a new importation between January 2016 and January 2017 (our method also explicitly updates county-month 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimates for county-month combinations with imported cases). Importantly, this doesn’t indicate that 
 <italic>α</italic> is changing through time, but rather that we refine our estimate for it as more data accumulate. We assumed a uniform prior for 
 <italic>α</italic> of 
 <italic>U</italic> ∼ (0, 2), and used a blocked Gibbs sampling algorithm of MCMC. For each MCMC step we provide the detected imported cases to date and propose each county-month 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, a single 
 <italic>α</italic>, and a probability of case detection, 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub>. County-month 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> proposals were normally distributed around the previous sample with standard deviation of 0.1, 
 <italic>α</italic> proposals were distributed 
 <italic>U</italic> ∼ (0, 2). We used a previously estimated distribution for 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub> as a strong, informative prior, 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub> ∼ 
 <italic>N</italic>(5.74%, 
 <italic>sd</italic> = 1.49%), as there are identifiability issues given its relationship with 
 <italic>α</italic>, and assumed it to not vary spatiotemporally [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s006">S5 Fig</xref>. We used the Metropolis-Hastings probability to accept or reject proposals. Our chains consisted of 200,000 samples with a burn-in duration of 100,000, thinning every 10 steps. We ran a single chain for each parameter set, and assessed convergence through visual inspection of the trace plots (
