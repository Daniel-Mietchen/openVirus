<p>The ratio of mosquitoes to people, 
 <italic>m</italic>, makes use of two spatially varying inputs: 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> occurrence probability and an index of economic purchasing power. The first of these was based on a global collection of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> occurrence records used to inform an occurrence probability model that made use of a number of environmental variables, including a temperature suitability index, precipitation, enhanced vegetation index, and urbanicity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The second of these features spatial estimates of purchasing power parity (PPP) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which offers a relative spatial index of economic wealth that other work [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] has shown can serve as a useful proxy for spatial variation in economic factors affecting mosquito-human contact. Here, we used gridded estimates of those two spatially variable inputs for Texas, but otherwise followed the methodology of Perkins 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] for translating them into a gridded surface of 
 <italic>m</italic>. In brief, this involved transforming mosquito occurrence probability into a proxy for mosquito abundance and multiplying it by a shape-constrained additive model of PPP, which resulted in a convex, monotonically decreasing relationship between PPP and 
 <italic>m</italic>. We do not consider the near-term effects of precipitation on local ZIKV transmission risk, but one could be included in future iterations, given a validated 
 <italic>a priori</italic> model describing the relationship.
