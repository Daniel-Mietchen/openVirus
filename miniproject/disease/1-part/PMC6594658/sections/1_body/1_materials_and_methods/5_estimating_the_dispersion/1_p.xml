<p>The negative binomial dispersion parameter governs the variability in secondary cases following each importation, with values near zero meaning that most importations yield few or no cases while a few “superspreaders” produce many. Superspreading dynamics are known to occur with mosquito-borne diseases like ZIKV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We assume that ZIKV secondary case distributions are the same as that of dengue virus (DENV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], though these estimates should be updated as ZIKV-specific secondary case distributions are identified. Padmanabha et al. describe the relationship between regional 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the percentage of DENV imported cases that generate over 20 secondary infections (
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>20</sub>), as 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 0.63 × 100 × 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>20</sub> + 0.58. As we require 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>20</sub> &gt; 0 for all values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, we set 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>20</sub> to an arbitrarily low, but non-zero value (
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>20</sub> = 1 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup>) for values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 0.58. We then found the dispersion parameter for every value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> that lead to the expected 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>20</sub> value from that previously estimated relationship. The result was that a single dispersion parameter captured the relationship well for all 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values and thus we set the dispersion parameter, 
 <italic>k</italic> = 0.12, for all analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). The highly dispersed nature of the secondary case distribution suggests that most importations will not lead to epidemics, even if 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1. For example, even with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.5, we would only expect to see an epidemic stemming from ∼8% of imported cases.
