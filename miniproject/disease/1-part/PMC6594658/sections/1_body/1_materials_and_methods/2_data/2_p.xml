 <sub>0</sub> estimates, we analyzed 2016 data where two autochthonous cases were detected in Cameron County from passive surveillanceâ€“one in November and one in December 2016; we excluded four nearby cases discovered during the November follow-up investigation, because our model does not incorporate active surveillance. As sensitivity analyses, we re-estimated

Accounting for this worst-case scenario lead to increased estimates for risk across the state, but expected risk still remained well below epidemic potential. For validating our estimates, we analyzed 2017 data and considered only one of the two reported autochthonous cases, as the second case occurred outside the timeline of our 2017 importation data.
