<p>Our estimation method relies on several simplifying assumptions, which we divide into those concerning this ZIKV test case of the updating procedure, and those concerning the updating procedure itself. For this specific implementation, we assumed that the shape of the secondary case distribution resembles that of dengue. Although we have no evidence to the contrary, this should be updated as ZIKV-specific estimates become available [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We also assumed that transmission is equally likely from imported and locally acquired cases. Imported cases may be less infectious than locally acquired cases for two reasons, leading us to underestimate local transmission risks. First, they may be more likely to receive care that limits transmission, although most ZIKV cases are inapparent or mild and do not require medical care [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and second their local infectious periods may be shorter than those of autochthonous cases. This assumption could be relaxed in cases where data are available on the relative detection rates. In this case, we also do not consider the possibility of sexual transmission of ZIKV. While sexual transmission has occurred and may be important for specific populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], we assumed that mosquito-borne transmission is the dominant mode of infection. Our current iteration of the model makes several simplifying assumptions related to how we handle the temporal dynamics of both the 
 <italic>a priori</italic> risk estimation and the updating procedure. Our baseline transmission risk model does not take any outside events that could modulate future risk into consideration (e.g. rainfall in the previous month causing upticks in mosquito populations), and future model development will be necessary to account for these important temporal dynamics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For example, approaches that account for variability in the serial interval between successive cases and distributed lagged effects of environmental variables on transmission potential may hold promise for addressing this limitation [
