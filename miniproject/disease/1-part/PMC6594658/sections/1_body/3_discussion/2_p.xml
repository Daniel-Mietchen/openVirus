<p>Using previously validated ecological suitability estimates as a starting point, we applied the method to update ZIKV

 <sub>0</sub> estimates for each of the 254 counties in Texas, and found that only six counties have non-negligible probabilities of sustained local transmission, though an additional 77 counties may also be at low risk if our assumptions about local case data are too liberal. This is a substantial downgrade in expected risk, given that 43% of the 254 counties were previously thought to be vulnerable to ZIKV outbreaks, and even counties still at risk for epidemics on average had

Based on these estimates and the number of importations that occurred in the state, our refined model suggests that there should have been between zero and one detected case of locally acquired ZIKV between January and September of 2017, which corresponds to the single transmission event actually detected in Cameron County in July 2017. Interestingly, a model that incorporates the possibility of many more missed imported cases into the state of Texas fits the data better, with an expected number of cases close to one (
