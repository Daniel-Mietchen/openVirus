<p>Critically, we can conclude neither that all initial ecological risk assessments for ZIKV will overestimate risk, although this seems to be the case for ZIKV in Texas and elsewhere in the US [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], nor that public health preparations and interventions for ZIKV are no longer necessary in Texas or the southern US. Rather, our results suggest that sustained ZIKV outbreaks are unlikely, but not impossible (3% of the state remains at low epidemic risk), and provide more robust and localized estimates of ZIKV risk that can inform more targeted surveillance and reactions to future ZIKV importations. While our method provides an avenue to improve imperfect 
 <italic>a priori</italic> risk estimates using real-time data, future predictions and estimates could be improved with advances to our mechanistic understanding of transmission risk (e.g., incorporating rainfall or improved understanding of mosquito-human contact patterns) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These estimates should also only be taken as the baseline level of risk for the state. Climate change, anomalous weather events, or unforeseen circumstances that alter mosquito populations or mosquito-human interactions could raise or lower the Zika risk in Texas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
