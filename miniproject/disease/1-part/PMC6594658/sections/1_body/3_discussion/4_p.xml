<p>The factors driving county transmission risk were primarily temperature and mosquito population numbers (occurrence probability). Remaining uncertainty in county risk stems from a lack of detected imported cases, as imported cases primarily helped to downgrade Zika risk in the absence of local transmission. This provides the counterintuitive explanation for why our model suggests low epidemic risk for Harris county (containing the city of Houston) even though it was by far the county with the most imported cases. Given comparable importation and local case data, this approach could readily update ZIKV transmission risk estimates for any county in the continental US.</p>
