<p>There is a discrepancy between our model predictions and the ZIKV case data: our final model predicts the highest local transmission risk to be in the summer across the state, but most cases of local ZIKV transmission occurred in the winter (6 out of 7). While these case numbers are low and may simply reflect random variation, the most recent dengue outbreak in South Texas peaked in November, concurrent with a large dengue epidemic in Northern Mexico, suggesting that fall may be a higher risk season for arbovirus transmission than our final predictions indicate [

Our model does not incorporate a time lag between case importation, local transmission, and case detection, which has been previously estimated around two months [

Importantly our simplistic lagging procedure does not properly encapsulate the mechanistic intricacies determining the relationship between environmental suitability, mosquito population growth, case importation, local transmission, and subsequent detection that account for the lags outlined in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results support these time lags as a crucial element for predicting ZIKV risk, and highlight the need for future research into the mechanistic underpinnings to reduce bias and improve model fit and predictive accuracy even further.
