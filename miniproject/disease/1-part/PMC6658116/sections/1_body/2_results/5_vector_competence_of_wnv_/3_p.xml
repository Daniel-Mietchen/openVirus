<p>No disseminated infections (&lt;LOD) in the three bodies positive for NYP were observed. There were no significant differences (p&gt;0.05) in dissemination rates between any of the viruses for which dissemination was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Disseminated infections were not observed for both Aâ€™DEL* and NYS* (

 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> legs were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) between NYS/NYT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). No NYP leg titers were observed above the limit of detection. Using the LOD for NYP dissemination resulted in a significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) titer compared to NYS, NYT, NYF, SYS and SYP leg titers. Transmission rates of NYT disseminated mosquitoes were significantly higher than those of NYP and NYF and transmission rate of NYS was significantly higher than NYP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g005">Fig 5E</xref>)There were no other significant differences (p&gt;0.05) in transmission rates among NYS, NYT, SYS, SYP and KYS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). There were no significant differences (p&gt;0.05) in mean viral titers in the saliva (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). When transmission rates were compared as a function of the total exposed mosquitoes, NYT exhibited a 36% transmission rate with a 20% transmission rate for NYS; however, this difference was not significant (p = 0.3451).
