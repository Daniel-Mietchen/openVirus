<p>Since AMCRs are highly susceptible to WNV[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the impact of the various WNV mutants on avian survivorship was assessed. All crows inoculated with NYS, NYT, NYF and SYS mutants succumbed to infection at indistinguishable rates over a 6â€“7 dpi time period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Crows inoculated with NYS, NYT, NYF and SYS viruses all developed acute viremias &gt;8.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL sera (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, NYP and KYS mutants both resulted in only 60% mortality rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and exhibited attenuated viremia production (&lt;7.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL sera) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). No differences in peak viremia or viremia on any dpi were observed between the glycosylated NYS/NYT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The non-glycosylated NYF/SYS mutants demonstrated no significant differences in the magnitude (p&gt;0.9) or duration (p&gt;0.09) of peripheral viremias compared to the NYS/NYT. TheNYP/KYS mutants, although demonstrating indistinguishable viremia duration compared to NYS/NYT (p&gt;0.7) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), exhibited attenuated viremia production with mean peak viral titers 1,200-fold (p&lt;0.008) and 68-fold (p&lt;0.1) lower, respectively. Neither reversions nor compensatory mutations were identified in the E154-156 motifs observed from serum viral RNA sequenced from each bird at the time point with the highest viremia. Viral sequence from brain tissue of AMCRs that succumbed to infection also failed to demonstrate any genetic changes over the 500-nucleotide amplicon surrounding the E N-linked glycosylation motif when compared to the inoculum consensus sequences.
