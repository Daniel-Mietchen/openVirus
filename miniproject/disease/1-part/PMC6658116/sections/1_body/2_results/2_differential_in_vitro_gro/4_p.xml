 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], mutants were compared in cultured avian monocytes (HD11 cells) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The NYS/NYT viruses demonstrated statistically indistinguishable growth while the NYF mutant exhibited a 7-fold lower viral titer (p&lt;0.05) at the earliest time point (0.5 dpi) and the mean peak titer was 3-fold lower than that of NYS. The KYS mutant demonstrated the most restricted phenotype with a 16-fold lower mean peak viral titer compared to NYS virus (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, the non-glycosylated NYP/SYS mutants generated higher mean viral titers 6.3 and 6.8 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, respectively compared to 5.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL at 1 dpi; however, the mean peak titers at 3 dpi were indistinguishable to that of NYS.
