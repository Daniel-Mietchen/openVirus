<p>WNV mutants (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were harvested from transfected BHK-21 supernatants after observation of cytopathic effect at day three post-transfection. Rescued mutants were titrated and full-length Sanger sequencing performed to confirm the incorporation of the correct mutations and that spurious mutations were not inadvertently introduced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). A Western blot was performed to assess the glycosylation status of E viral proteins purified from Vero cells infected with the parental and mutant viruses. The E proteins of endoglycosidase untreated control NYS [NYS EndoF(-)] and NYT [NYT EndoF(-)] viruses ran at &gt;50 kDa. (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating de-glycosylation of NYS and NYT via endoglycosidase treatment. Mobility of NYS and NYT endoglycosidase-treated E proteins was indistinguishable from the untreated NYF, NYP, KYS and SYS E proteins, indicating that the nucleotide substitutions to create NYF, NYP, KYS and SYS successfully ablated glycosylation of the E protein[
