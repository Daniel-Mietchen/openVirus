<p>One hundred female 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> were individually intrathoracically inoculated with 0.14μL of 6 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL (~140 PFU) of the parental NYS virus and each of the mutant viruses (NYT, NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP and KYS). Following inoculation, mosquitoes were held at 28°C with 5% sucrose through 7 dpe under a photoperiod of 16:8 (L: D). At 7 dpe, 50 mosquitoes exposed to each virus were anesthetized as described above. Saliva and bodies were collected, stored and titrated as described previously. Infection rates were calculated as described above. The number of virus-positive saliva samples were expressed as a percentage of virus-positive bodies to calculate transmission rates
