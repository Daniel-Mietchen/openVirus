<p>Wild AMCRs were captured by cannon nets in Bellvue, Colorado (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Scientific Collecting Permit number MB-032526). House sparrows were trapped by Japanese mist nets in Bakersfield, California. In order to confirm that AMCRs and HOSPs had not previously been exposed to WNV or another endemic flavivirus, St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), birds were bled prior to inoculation and serum tested by plaque reduction neutralization assays (PRNTs) against these two viruses as previously described[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Detection of specific neutralizing antibodies within the sera of any AMCR or HOSP to either SLEV or WNV excluded the bird for use in 
 <italic>vivo</italic> experiments. All AMCRs/HOSPs were held for at least two weeks prior to viral inoculation for cage adaptation and quarantine. 6–8 AMCRs were subcutaneously inoculated with 1,500 PFU of each virus (NYS, NYT, NYP NYF, SYS and KYS). Six HOSPs were similarly inoculated with 1,500 PFU of each WNV glycosylation mutant, including a mutant lacking the E αA’ helix (A’DEL; ΔE157-E160). All AMCRs and HOSPs were examined for signs of disease twice daily for 14 days following inoculation and bled once daily from 1 to 7 dpi to assess viremias. Viral RNA was extracted from serum samples at peak viremias and from brain tissue of AMCRs that had succumbed to infection and sequenced over the N-linked glycosylation motif to identify potential compensatory mutations in the E154-156 or surrounding regions using the method mentioned previously.
