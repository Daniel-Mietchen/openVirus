<p>Interestingly, the midgut infection rate for NYT (70%) was more than twice that of the NYS virus (34%), indicating that a single amino acid polymorphism at E-156 that maintained glycosylation status of the E protein could result in a significant effect on vector competence. Nevertheless, the role of glycosylation for modulation of this phenotype between these viruses cannot be discounted as 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with recombinant rabies virus glycoproteins have shown that differential glycosylation efficiencies of the N-linked moieties were dependent upon the hydroxyl amino acid in the glycosylation motif[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. That study also showed that NYT motifs were preferentially and more efficiently glycosylated than the NYS motif[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus it is possible that higher glycosylation efficiency of NYT versus NYS potentially enhanced virus entry, release and/or subsequent infection rates in mosquitoes in the present study[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. That being said, while the infection rate for NYT was significantly higher than NYS, NYT viral titers, dissemination and transmission rates remained similar to NYS. While no naturally occurring NYT WNV variants have been described, other flaviviruses such as Zika (NDT), dengue (NET), Wesselbron (NHT), Sepik (NHT), Rocio (NYT), Spondweni (NDT) and Ilheus (NYT) viruses have been shown to encode a threonine at the hydroxyl amino acid of the N-linked glycosylation motif[
