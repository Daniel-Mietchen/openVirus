<p>In previous reports, WNV mutants with abolished E-protein glycosylation such as NYF[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], QYS[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and AYS[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] exhibited attenuated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> viral growth profiles in comparison to NYS whereas mutants representing NYS to IYS[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], NYE or NYP[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], were reported to have a minimal impact on viral growth in C6/36 cells. Other groups have reported that mutating NYS to QYS resulted in strikingly higher levels of infectivity in mosquito cells but lower virus production when compared with NYS[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These previous reports focused on ablation of glycosylation and did not specifically assess the effect of the actual amino acid identity at E-154/ E-156 on phenotype. The results presented herein have demonstrated that introduction of amino acid polymorphisms at either E-154 or E-156 differentially modulated WNV growth in C6/36 cells. Although many of the nonglycosylated WNVs showed an increased sensitivity to low pH, they all grew quite well in Vero, HD11 and DEF cells at 37°C. Interestingly, although temperature sensitivity at 44°C has been associated with lessened avian virulence phenotypes of other WNV variants/mutants[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], many of the nonglycosylated WNV mutants (NYF and SYS) that were highly sensitive for growth at elevated avian temperatures 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstrated high viremia levels in AMCRs (NYF and SYS) or HOSPs (NYF). These data indicate that amino acid polymorphisms in this region of the E protein, although impacting temperature sensitivity do not necessarily alter avian host competence phenotypes. Previous work has demonstrated nonstructural genetic determinants to be positively correlated with both temperature sensitivity and avian host competence phenotypes[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], indicating that structural determinants of temperature sensitivity observed herein could be dictated by factors unrelated to avian competence.
