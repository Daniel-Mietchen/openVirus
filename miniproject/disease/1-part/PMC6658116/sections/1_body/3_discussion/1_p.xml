<p>The N-linked glycosylation motif within the WNV E protein at position 154–156 has been implicated previously as an important molecular determinant associated with enhanced murine neuroinvasiveness, avian pathogenicity[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, we investigated WNV viral replication, WNV-vector interactions, avian virulence and vector competence of variable amino acid polymorphisms at the E-154 or E-156 loci that resulted in predicted glycosylated (NYS, NYT) and non-glycosylated E proteins (NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP, KYS and A’DEL). We demonstrate the novel finding that the amino acid identity at either E-154 or E-156 modulated WNV viral growth, avian virulence and vector competence independent of the predicted glycosylation of WNV-E protein.
