  <title>Vector competence assessment of WNV glycosylation mutant viruses in 
   <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>
   <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> were orally exposed to individual artificial blood meals containing 7 log
   <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL of the WNV parental (NYS) or glycosylation mutant viruses (NYT, NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP, KYS) or 6.3 log
   <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL of NYS and A’DEL (indicated as NYS* and A’DEL*). After an extrinsic incubation period of 14 days, bodies, legs and saliva were collected from 25 mosquitoes and titrated by plaque assay. The Figure panels demonstrate (A) infection rate (%) of 
   <italic>Cx</italic>. 
   <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> bodies positive for virus as a function of exposed mosquitoes (B) viral titers of infected 
   <italic>Cx</italic>. 
   <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> bodies (C) dissemination rate (%) of infected mosquitoes with virus-positive legs (D) viral titers in 
   <italic>Cx</italic>. 
   <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> infected legs (E) percent of mosquitoes with disseminated infections that had virus-positive saliva (F) viral titers in mosquito saliva. Mean viral titers were analyzed via a one-way ANOVA. Infection, dissemination and transmission rates were analyzed using a pairwise Fisher’s exact test. Limit of detection (LOD) is shown by dashed lines.
