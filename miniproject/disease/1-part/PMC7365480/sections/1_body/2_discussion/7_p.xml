<p>Experimental test of theoretical predictions on pathogen emergence are very scarce because the stochastic nature of the prediction requires massive replicate numbers. Some microbial systems, however, offer many opportunities to study pathogen emergence in controlled and massively replicated laboratory experiments [

It would be interesting to use these microbial systems to study the impact of periodic oscillations of the environment to mimic the influence of seasonality. Another way to explore this question experimentally would be to use data on experimental inoculation of hosts. Indeed, the experimental inoculation of a few bacteria in a vertebrate host (which could be viewed as “population” of susceptible cells) is equivalent to the introduction of a few pathogens in a host population. The outcome of these inoculations are stochastic and the probability of a successful infection (host death) is equivalent to a probability of emergence. Interestingly, some daily periodicity to bacterial infections has been found in mice [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Mice inoculated early in the morning (4am) have a higher probability of survival than mice inoculated at any other time. This pattern is likely to result from a circadian control of the vertebrate immune system [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] which are likely to impact the birth and death rates of bacteria. Given that the generation time of a bacteria is smaller than a day, it is not surprising to see a probability of emergence depending on the inoculation time (see 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007954.e011">Eq 6</xref>). In other words, our work may also be used to shed some light on the stochastic within-host dynamics of pathogen infections. One could envision that simple changes in therapeutic practices that take into account the time of day may affect clinical care and could limit the risk of nosocomial infections. Our work provides a theoretical toolbox that can integrate detailed description of the periodic nature of pathogen life cycles at different spatial and temporal scales (within and between hosts, over the period of one day or one year) to time optimal control strategies.
