<p>Note that our approach neglects the density dependence that typically occurs after some time with major epidemics. Our probability of pathogen emergence thus provides an upper approximation of the probability emergence. Indeed, with density dependence the size of the pathogen population may be too small to survive even very shallow demographic traps. In section 5 of
