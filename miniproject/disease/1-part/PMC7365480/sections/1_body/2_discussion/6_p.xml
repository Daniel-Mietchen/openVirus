<p>The above examples show that our analysis has very practical implications on the understanding and the control of emerging infectious diseases in seasonal environments. This theoretical framework could be used to produce maps with a very relevant measure of epidemic risk: the probability of pathogen emergence across space and time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007954.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Currently available risk maps are often based on integrated indices of suitability of pathogens or vectors [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These quantities may be biologically relevant but the link between these quantities and the probability of pathogen emergence is not very clear. We contend that using risk maps based on
