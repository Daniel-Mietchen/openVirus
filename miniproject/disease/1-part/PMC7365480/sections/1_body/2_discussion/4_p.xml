<p>This work can be extended to explore optimal timing of other control strategies. For instance [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] study the optimal timing of pulse vaccination in seasonal environment and show for a range of epidemiological scenarios that a pulse vaccination applied periodically 3 months before the peak transmission rate minimizes 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Yet, as pointed out above, the strategy minimizing 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> may not always coincide with the strategy minimizing 〈
 <italic>p
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>)〉 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007954.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Indeed, an examination of figure H in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007954.s001">S1 Text</xref> shows that the probability of emergence is minimized if pulse vaccination occurs a bit sooner than the time at which 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is minimized (3.71 instead of 3 months before the peak transmission).
