<p>So far we focused on control strategies that lower pathogen transmission. Our approach can also be used to optimize control measures that do not act on the transmission rate but on the duration of the infection. For instance, what is the optimal timing of a synchronized effort to use antibiotics to minimize bacterial pathogens emergence? We found that the timing of these treatment days have no impact on

 <sub>0</sub> but pathogen emergence is minimized when treatment occurs 1.3 months before the peak of the transmission season. This strategy creates deeper traps and results in a stronger

Numerical simulations showed that the speed of eradication is maximized (the time to extinction is minimized) when treatment is applied 3 months before the low transmission season. A similar result was obtained by [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] showing that it is best to treat against malaria in the low transmission season. The apparent discrepancy between these recommendations is driven by the use of different objective functions (pathogen emergence, speed of eradication or cumulative number of cases).
