<p>Understanding this effect allows us to identify the optimal deployment of control strategies minimizing the average probability of pathogen emergence in seasonal environments. We identified optimal control strategies in different epidemiological scenarios under the assumption that the introduction time is homogeneous (Figures 3, 5, and A, D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007954.s001">S1 Text</xref>). This assumption can be readily modified to take into account temporal variations in the probability of introduction events, which yields different recommendations for the timing of control (see subsection 1.3 and Figure C in
