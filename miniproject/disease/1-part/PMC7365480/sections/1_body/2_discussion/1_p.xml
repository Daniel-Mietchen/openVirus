<p>The effect of seasonality on the probability of pathogen emergence depends critically on the duration of the infection 1/
 <italic>μ</italic> relative to the period 
 <italic>T</italic> of the fluctuation. When the period of the fluctuation is small (i.e., 
 <italic>T</italic> &lt; 1/
 <italic>μ</italic>) the environment changes very fast and the probability of emergence does not depend on the timing of pathogen introduction but on the average transition rates of the pathogen life cycle. When the period of the fluctuation is large (i.e., 
 <italic>T</italic> &gt; 1/
 <italic>μ</italic>) the probability of emergence varies with the timing of pathogen introduction. This probability drops when the pathogen is introduced at a point in time where conditions are unfavorable (low transmission and/or high recovery rates). More surprisingly, we show that the probability of pathogen emergence can also be very low in times where conditions are favourable if they are followed by a particularly hostile environment. This 
 <italic>winter is coming</italic> effect results from the existence of adverse conditions that introduce demographic traps (where the net reproduction rate is negative) and pathogen emergence is only possible if the pathogen introduction occurs sufficiently far ahead of those traps. This effect is also expected to act on the size of the epidemics in deterministic models. Epidemics initiated at the end of the high transmission season are expected to be smaller because they do not have time to expand before reaching the low transmission season [
