<p>Seasonality can drive pathogen transmission through the fluctuations of the available density of the mosquito vector. Following [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] we assume that mosquito density fluctuates with temperature and is maximal at 
 <italic>T</italic>

 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>V</italic>
 </sub>/
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>H</italic>
 </sub>. In such a fluctuating environment the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the spectral radius of the next generation operator, see [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but there is no analytic expression for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Yet, it is tempting to use 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007954.e014">Eq (7)</xref> with the birth and death rates functions of the introduction time

 <sub>0</sub>, to obtain an approximation 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007954.g005">Fig 5</xref> explores the difference between this naive expectation and the exact value of the probability of emergence. Crucially, we recover the same qualitative patterns observed in the direct transmission model. In particular, we notice that when the product of birth rates remains higher than the product of death rates the naive expectation for the probability of emergence is not too far from the exact value of 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>). However, when seasonality induces more pronounced drops in transmission, we recover the 
 <italic>winter is coming</italic> effect where the probability of emergence can be very low before the low transmission season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007954.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). It is also possible to identify numerically the optimal control strategies minimizing the probability of Zika emergence (Figure F in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007954.s001">S1 Text</xref>).
