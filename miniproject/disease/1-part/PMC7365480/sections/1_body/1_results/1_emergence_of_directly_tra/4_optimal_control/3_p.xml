<p>Second, we consider a seasonal environment where λ(

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007954.g003">Fig 3B, 3D and 3F</xref>). Such periodicity may arise with more gradual changes of the abiotic environment driven by climatic seasonality [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007954.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Under this scenario, pathogen transmission varies continuously and the basic reproduction after control does depend on the time at which control is applied. The basic reproduction ratio is minimized when the intensity of control is maximal (

 </sub> = 1) in a time interval centered on the time at which pathogen transmission reaches its peak (red cross in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007954.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In contrast, the optimal control strategy that minimizes 〈

 </italic>〉 starts earlier, lasts longer and is a bit less intense (blue cross in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007954.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). As discussed in the square wave scenario, the timing of control in the optimal strategy extends the
