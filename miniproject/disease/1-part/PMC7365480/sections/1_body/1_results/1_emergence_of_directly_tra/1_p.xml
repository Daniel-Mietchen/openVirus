<p>For the sake of simplicity we start our analysis with a directly transmitted disease with a constant clearance rate

 <italic>μ</italic>, but with seasonal fluctuations of the transmission rate, λ(
 <italic>t</italic>). This epidemiological scenario may capture the seasonality of many infectious diseases. For instance, increased contact rates among children during school terms has been shown to have a significant impact on the transmission of many childhood infections [
