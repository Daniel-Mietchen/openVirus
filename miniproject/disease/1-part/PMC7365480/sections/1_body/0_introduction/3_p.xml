<p>In the following we show that very good approximations of the probability of pathogen emergence can be derived from this general expression when the period is very large (or very small) compared to the duration of the infection. These approximations give important insights on the effect of the speed and the shape of the temporal fluctuations of the environment on the probability of pathogen emergence. We use this theoretical framework to determine optimal control strategies that minimize the risk of pathogen emergence. We provide clear cut recommendations in a range of epidemiological scenarios. We also show how this theoretical framework can be extended to account for the effect of seasonality in vector borne diseases. More specifically, we use this model to estimate the probability of Zika virus emergence throughout the year at different geographic locations.</p>
