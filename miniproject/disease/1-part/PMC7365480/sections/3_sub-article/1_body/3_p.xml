<p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript 'Winter is coming: pathogen emergence in seasonal environments' for review by PLOS Computational Biology.  We apologize for the long time of the process and for the un-satisfactory point we have reached. Your manuscript was evaluated by only one referee so far, and the delay was due to a long process of trying to secure at least a second referee. After having invited 13 others, we would like to move forward on the basis of this referee and the evaluation by one of us.</p>
