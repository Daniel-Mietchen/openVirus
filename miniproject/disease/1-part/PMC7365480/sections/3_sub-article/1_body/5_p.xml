<p>While your manuscript cannot be accepted in its present form, we are willing to consider a revised version in which the issues raised by the reviewer have been adequately addressed. We believe a clearer version will have a better chance of additional reviews, which we would like to have to make a decision. We cannot promise publication at that time, but we believe this is a more effective course of action than seeking those reviews now. </p>
