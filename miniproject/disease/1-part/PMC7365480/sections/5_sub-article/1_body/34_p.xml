<p>Unfortunately, however, the authors do not better exploit the intuitive and biological aspects of this effect in a way that would be accessible to a broader audience (that would be very interested in this topic). The way the paper is written is quite technical. It would benefit from a deeper connection to particular infectious diseases or actual transmission results, mainly in the introduction and discussion sections. For example, the authors could compare/connect their results with Otero et al. 2010, who studied the probabilities of major dengue outbreaks based on the first infection arrival time to the city of Buenos Aires. Another example that could be discussed in this paper is the study of flu arrival times for different cities in the US and UK by Truscott &amp; Ferguson 2012, as well as the results obtained by Dalziel et al. 2018 also for flu. In addition, I was surprised that the authors did not cite and connect their probabilitiesâ€™ expressions with those in the papers by Bartlett 1964 and by Lloyd et. al 2007. Both papers discuss the probability of pathogen emergence, in direct and vector transmitted diseases.</p>
