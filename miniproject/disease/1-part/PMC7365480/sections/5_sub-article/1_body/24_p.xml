<p>Reviewer #1: This is a very carefully worked out and mature work that covers a lot of ground from periodically forced natural systems, to their optimal control. The authors have a detailed knowledge of stochastic systems and branching processes, and this has led to the fruition of a deep analysis from many fronts. I learnt a lot from reading this manuscript.</p>
