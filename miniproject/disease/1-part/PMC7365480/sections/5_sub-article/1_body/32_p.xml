<p>Reviewer #2: The topic and idea developed in this work is very interesting, and I find it particularly valuable that the authors emphasize the importance of working with probabilities rather than with deterministic quantities such as R0. Although R0 is useful for many purposes, it presents limitations, especially for low-transmission situations, among others.</p>
