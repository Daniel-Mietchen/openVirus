<p>Although the development of expressions and the study of probabilities for the occurrence of major outbreaks are not new, there is a lack of concrete applications and discussion of different transmission scenarios. This theoretical study investigates how the interaction of seasonality, duration and arrival time of the infection, affects the probability of a major outbreak. In particular, the authors contribute to the formalization of an effect that is somehow intuitive which they call “the winter is coming effect”.</p>
