  <title>Transmission mode and pathogen emergence without seasonality.</title>
  <p>In a direct transmission model pathogen dynamics is driven by the birth rate λ and the death rate 
   <italic>μ</italic> of a single infected compartment 
   <italic>I</italic>. In a vector borne transmission model pathogen dynamics is driven by the birth rates and death rates of multiple compartments: exposed and infected humans (
   <italic>E</italic>
   <sup>
    <italic>H</italic>
   </sup>, 
   <italic>I</italic>
   <sup>
    <italic>H</italic>
   </sup>), exposed and infected mosquito vectors (
   <italic>E</italic>
   <sup>
    <italic>V</italic>
   </sup>, 
   <italic>I</italic>
   <sup>
    <italic>V</italic>
   </sup>). In the absence of seasonality (i.e. no temporal variation in birth and death rates) the basic reproduction ratio 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> can be expressed as a ratio between birth and death rates. The probability of emergence 
   <italic>p</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>e</italic>
   </sub> after the introduction of a single infected individual can also be expressed as a function of these birth and death rates. With vector borne transmission this probability of emergence depends on which infected host is introduced (Figure E in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007954.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Here we give the probability of emergence after the introduction of a single human exposed to the pathogen, 
   <italic>E</italic>
   <sup>
    <italic>V</italic>
   </sup>, and where the index 
   <italic>i</italic> refers to the four consecutive states of the pathogen life cycle (see sections 2 and 3 of 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007954.s001">S1 Text</xref>).
