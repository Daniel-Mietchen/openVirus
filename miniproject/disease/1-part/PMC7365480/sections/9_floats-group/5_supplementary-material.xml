  <title>This document contains complementary material that supports the results that we discuss in the main body of the paper.</title>
  <p>We present: (1) a calculation of the probability of emergence of directly transmitted pathogen for different scenarios of seasonality, (2) a generalisation of our results when the pathogen life cycle goes through multiple stages before completing its life cycle, (3) an exploration of the 
   <italic>winter is coming</italic> effect on the seasonal dynamics of Zika virus, (4) an analysis of a scenario that involves pulse interventions (vaccination or treatment), (5) an exploration of the effect of density dependence on the 
   <italic>winter is coming</italic> effect, (6) additional computations and proofs.
