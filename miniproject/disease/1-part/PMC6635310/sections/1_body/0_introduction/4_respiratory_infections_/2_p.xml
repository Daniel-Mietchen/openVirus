<p>Fortunately two months after 2019 flooding in Iran, there was no report of respiratory infection outbreaks. However based on the previous studies, there is still a potential risk for it. Possible viral respiratory pathogens which might cause RTI outbreaks in survivors affected by recent floods could be predictable based on the annual epidemics and history of viruses’ circulation. In early spring in Iran, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus circulations were reported in previous years in Khuzestan and Golestan (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Among other viral causes of RTI, adenoviruses are common in the late winter, spring, and early summer, consequently adenoviruses might circulate in affected population. However the risk of viral RTI outbreaks would decrease in summer and again would increase in autumn and winter.
