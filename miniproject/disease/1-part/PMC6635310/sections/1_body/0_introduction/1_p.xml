According to the Iranian Department of Environment, of 421 flood events from 1951 to 2001 nearly 74% were only from 1981 to 2001 which during this period the flood rate was 20 times higher than before. Since 2001 to 2019, there were several floods in different parts of the country, which the last one was in spring 2019. In fact, during March and April 2019, Iran experienced flooding in three provinces (Khuzestan, Lorestan and Golestan) which affected many people that were displaced and moved into the camps. These floods had adverse impacts on living conditions in affected areas.
