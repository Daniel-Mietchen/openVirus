    "Floods are one of the natural disasters occurring worldwide which have a massive range of health impacts. In addition to immediate dangers such as drowning, floods can increase the transmission of some communicable diseases. Up to now there was no report of viral infection outbreaks after 2019 spring floods in Iran. This review explains the possible viral infections which may occur during or after floods."
