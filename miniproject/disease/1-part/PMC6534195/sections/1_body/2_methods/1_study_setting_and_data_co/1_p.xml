<p>Since May 2009, the Singapore Armed Forces has operated a sentinel FRI surveillance program at a major recruit-training center. Recruits who develop FRI would report to the primary healthcare clinic for assessment, where they would receive treatment and would typically be given home leave for 1–2 days. During regular consultation hours, recruits meeting our inclusion criteria (ie, a temperature ≥37.5°C plus either cough or sore throat) were asked to participate in the study. Following receipt of written informed consent from the patient, we administered a questionnaire and collected nasal wash samples from both sides of the nose. We excluded repeat consultations if the patient was determined not to have recovered from the earlier illness episode.</p>
