<p>Our study covered recruits undergoing BMT between 15 December 2009 and 31 December 2014, during which inactivated influenza vaccine was routinely administered to recruits who did not have any contraindications. This was initially a monovalent influenza vaccine (MIV) containing only 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09), for recruits who enlisted between 11 December 2009 and 4 October 2010. The MIV was superseded by a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) that included A(H1N1)pdm09, for recruits who enlisted between 8 November 2010 and 10 December 2014).</p>
