<p>BMT is tailored to the physical, medical, and vocational needs of a recruit. The majority enlist into the main intake types, with standard durations of around 9, 17, and 19 weeks, with a small proportion having a mix of shorter courses (termed “others”). Dropout rates are low, and our study clinic served most of the healthcare needs for recruits at the training center. We were hence able to reanalyze the individual FRI episodes as a cohort study by linking consultation episodes through coded subject identifiers. The first FRI episode (FRI-1) for a given participant served as the point of entry into the study (

Those with no further episodes accumulated follow-up time until their exit date from BMT, while participants with ≥2 episodes contributed additional follow-up intervals after each subsequent episode.
