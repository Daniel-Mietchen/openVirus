<p>The virus categories described above were also our exposures of interest, to investigate whether an FRI episode caused by one virus group conferred relatively greater protection against a subsequent FRI episodes than FRI episodes testing negative for that virus group. In individuals with â‰¥1 subsequent FRI episode, exposure to prior infections was regarded as cumulative. For instance, for scenario 3 in
