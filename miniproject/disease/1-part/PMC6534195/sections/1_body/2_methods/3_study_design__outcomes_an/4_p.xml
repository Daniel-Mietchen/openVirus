<p>Potential confounders included the year of the surveillance program, participant’s age and ethnicity, type of BMT intake, history of smoking and asthma (including childhood asthma), and receipt of influenza vaccine before the FRI episode. Assessment of whether the participant received MIV or TIV was based on self-reported vaccination history up to 1 year prior to the first FRI episode (since antibody titers and vaccine effectiveness could wane thereafter [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>]), supplemented with Singapore Armed Forces records for vaccines received after enlistment. Since FRI episodes are concentrated differentially during a BMT course, we adjusted for this effect using the FRI incidence rate during successive 2-weekly phases after the time of enlistment for that intake type (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup4">Supplementary Materials</xref>). Observation time was split into subintervals if the observation period straddled different BMT phases and was analyzed in a multilevel modeling framework (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The framework included random effects terms for the BMT companies that participants belonged to, within which were nested the intervals (delineated by consecutive FRI episodes), within which, in turn, were nested the subintervals straddling BMT phases (levels 4 to 1 for model 2). Models 1 and 3 only had 3 levels. Model 1 omitted the subintervals used to adjust for FRI incidence. Model 3, which stratified subintervals by whether they ended &lt;4 weeks or ≥4 weeks after the initial FRI episode, used only the first FRI episode for each participant (episode level was therefore redundant). Models 2 and 3 adjusted for FRI incidence rates by time from enlistment and, hence, excluded the BMT intake type termed “other” (for which data used to estimate incidence rates were unavailable).
