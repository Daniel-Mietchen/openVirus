<p>The study included 6138 FRI episodes among 5677 participants (enrolled over approximately 5 years; 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with a median of 33 days (interquartile range [IQR], 16–56 days) from enlistment to the first FRI episode and a median of 2 days (IQR, 1–3 days) from illness onset to the consultation. As inclusion in the study was based on having an FRI, the longer 17-week (2677 participants [47.2%]) and 19-week (1357 [23.9%]) BMT intake types contributed more participants, followed by the 9-week (1276 [22.5%]) and other (n = 367, 6.5%) intake types. The median age was 20.1 years (IQR, 19.0–20.9 years), and 99.9% were male. A total of 83.6% received influenza vaccine in the past 1 year (with only 113 receiving this before enlistment); 17.3% (981) received MIV only, 65.5% (3719) received TIV only, and 0.8% (47) received both MIV and TIV.
