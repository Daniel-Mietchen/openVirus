 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Supplementary Table 1</xref> corroborates these findings through an alternative approach using crude FRI incidence rates based on the underlying BMT population at risk. Following AdV and FluV infection, incidence rates for subsequent FRI episodes were consistently lower than the average for all recruits in the 19-, 17-, and 9-week BMT intake types. Moreover, compared with the full course duration, analyses censored 8 and 6 weeks after enlistment showed stronger protective effects from prior FluV infection. Likewise, incidence rate ratios stratified by BMT intake type revealed increased protection by prior FluV infection with shorter course durations (
