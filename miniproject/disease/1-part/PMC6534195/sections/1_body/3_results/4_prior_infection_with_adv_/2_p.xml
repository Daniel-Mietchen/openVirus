<p>Model 1, which accounted for the hierarchical data structure and other covariates, gave similar results (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Relative to episodes without an identified virus, only AdV (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% CI, .14–.44) and FluV (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, .38–.73) infections conferred significant protection against subsequent FRI episodes. AdV and FluV infections remained significantly protective, after adjustment for FRI incidence by time from enlistment (model 2) and after addition of a variable that stratified subintervals on whether they ended &lt;4 weeks before or ≥4 weeks after the initial FRI episode (model 3). Interestingly, the hazard of a subsequent FRI episode was significantly lower in subintervals ending &lt;4 weeks after the initial episode (vs those ending ≥4 weeks after the initial episode; HR, 0.43; 95% CI, .30–.61). Moreover, there was evidence for interaction with FluV (
