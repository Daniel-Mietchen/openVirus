<p>In summary, our study demonstrated broad-based viral interference in a population of military recruits. Infections from the adenovirus and influenza virus families conferred significant cross-protective effects against subsequent FRI episodes relative to other circulating viruses. The duration of these cross-protective effects extend beyond those previously demonstrated in studies of viral coinfections. Our study points the way for research into the underlying mechanisms for broad-based antiviral activity in the human host, which deserves greater study.</p>
