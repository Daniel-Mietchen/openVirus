<p>Our study provides evidence on how having a FRI episode due to respiratory viruses from certain categories reduced the risk of a subsequent FRI episode during basic military training relative to having a FRI episode that was not due to those respiratory viruses. Among the viruses, protective effects were strongest following AdV and FluV episodes. AdV infections conferred protection against subsequent infection with AdV and cross-protection to other groups of commonly circulating viruses in BMT (CoV, ERV and FluV), while FluV infection conferred significant protection against subsequent AdV infection. The observation of influenzaâ€™s protection against subsequent episodes of influenza (mostly due to other types/subtypes in our data, in the period prior to routine TIV administration) is also consistent with reports by other human and animal model studies [
