<p>However, our study has some limitations. Our study population largely comprises healthy young adults, and key circulating viruses in this group differs somewhat from those observed in the general population in Singapore [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Also, we excluded respiratory illness episodes that did not meet our inclusion criteria of having a temperature ≥37.5°C. We also acknowledge that our capture of data on FRI episodes is likely incomplete, as consultations outside office hours and over the weekend (when trainees are on home leave) were missed by our surveillance program. However, we argue that restricting our study to febrile cases and the incomplete capture of data are biases toward the null and thus do not negate our main findings on the relative cross-protection against subsequent FRI episodes conferred by adenovirus and influenza virus infections.
