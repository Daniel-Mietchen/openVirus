<p>Our findings have several implications. They provide an explanation for what has previously been suspected on the basis of time-series analyses, such as how influenza epidemics potentially delay RSV epidemics [

 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. They also add to the body of evidence motivating the search for the causative mechanisms for cross-protection among viral infections while providing additional clues. Given the relative ranking of virus families in conferring cross-protection, we suggest focusing the search for mechanisms on common factors induced by both adenovirus and influenza virus. Notably, our previous studies suggest that infections with these 2 infections may be more severe, because they are more likely to present with febrile illness [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and higher temperatures (≥38°C) than infections due to other common circulating virus families [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This again supports a cytokine-mediated antiviral effect. Finding a means to induce such cross-protection without severe side effects could potentially lead to interventions that may be particularly useful in the context of exposure to dangerous viruses for which there is no specific vaccine or antiviral agent [
