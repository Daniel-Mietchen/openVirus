<p>It is however important to note that infection by arboviruses induces a long-term protection, as recently demonstrated for CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. DENV is an excellent example of the opposite situation, with the presence of four different serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4). Infection with any of the four dengue serotypes induces protective immunity to the priming serotype but does not confer long-term protection against infection by other serotypes. Furthermore, heterotypic secondary DENV infection, with a DENV type distinct from the primary infecting type, is the greatest risk factor for Dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that the worsening of disease following a secondary infection is due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (See below). Recently, Katzelnick et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] demonstrated that the level of pre-existing anti-DENV antibodies is directly associated with the severity of secondary DENV disease in humans.
