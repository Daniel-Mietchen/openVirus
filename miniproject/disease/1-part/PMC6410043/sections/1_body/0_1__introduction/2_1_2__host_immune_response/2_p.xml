<p>Concomitantly with the production of type I IFN, trauma associated with mosquito bites and the presence of salivary protein(s) induce a multistep recruitment of leukocytes that is initiated with mast cell degranulation and the recruitment of neutrophils that express high levels of the key proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Î², which are important for the induction of inflammatory responses [

It is important, however, to note that results obtained from cytokine analyses in patients with arbovirus infection are often contradictory. Thus, For the same viral infection, discrepancies between studies could reflect different genetic backgrounds, heterogeneous sanitary conditions, patient management strategies or differences in laboratory techniques [

However, despite certain clinical similarities, there are also differences in the most severe disease manifestations such as the prominent and prolonged arthralgia with CIKV infection, haemorrhagic fever with DENV infection and microcephaly and other neurological manifestations with ZIKV infection [
