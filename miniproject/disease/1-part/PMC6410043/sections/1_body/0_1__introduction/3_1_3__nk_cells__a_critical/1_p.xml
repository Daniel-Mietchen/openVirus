<p>NK cells constitute the proverbial first-line defence against a variety of viral infections because of their unique centred position in the immune system, NK cells are considered innate short-lived effectors with a turnover time of approximately 2 weeks, compared to months or years for some T cell subsets [

Consistent with the critical nature of NK cell-mediated killing, impaired cytolysis is the primary diagnostic criterion in patients with functional NK cell deficiencies, associated with herpes virus susceptibility [

NK cells also play both antiviral and regulatory roles via the release of soluble factors and operate via a balance of inhibitory and activating signals that enable them to detect and lyse virus-infected target cells while sparing normal cells [
