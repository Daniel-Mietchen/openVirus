<p>Under normal immune surveillance, NK cells express inhibitory receptors, including killer Ig-like receptors (KIR-L), ILT-2 and the CD94:NKG2A heterodimer that recognize primarily classical and non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. This “missing-self” recognition counterbalances cytotoxic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell recognition restricted by pathogen-induced loss of MHC class I molecules. NK cells become functional when stimulatory signals, induced following the triggering of activating receptors, outweigh MHC class I-mediated inhibition. Several of these activating receptors have been characterized, including activating KIRs (KIR-S), which are highly homologous to their inhibitory counterparts in the extracellular domain, characterized by a short cytoplasmic tail lacking ITIMs, that interacts with DAP-12, a signalling polypeptide that induces NK cell activation. A growing number of studies point to a significant association between the presence of activating KIRs and the clinical outcome of some human diseases, including viral infections [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that HLA-C*0102 presents a highly conserved peptide derived from the helicase motif 1b region of related flaviviruses, including DENGV, ZIKV, YFV and Japanese encephalitis viruses, to KIR2DS2. The other activating NK receptors are: NKG2C, recently defined as the key receptor of the adaptive NK cells expended after viral infections, NKG2D and the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46, in addition to specific co-receptors [

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Their ligands are diverse and their expression mainly upregulated by cellular stress, which allows NK cells to specifically eliminate harmful or unhealthy host cells. The multitude of receptors that are expressed by defined NK cell subsets and that binds to viral ligands illustrates a specific mode of recognition.
