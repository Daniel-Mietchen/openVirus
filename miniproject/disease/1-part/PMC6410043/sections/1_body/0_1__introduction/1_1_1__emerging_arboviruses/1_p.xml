<p>Pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes constitute a profound and growing health burden according to the World Health Organization (

Urbanization, poverty, globalization, migration and climate changes are widely recognized as contributors to the spread of infections by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). These latter are genetically highly diverse and represent one of the largest virus groups, with nearly 500 members known at present throughout the world. While many arboviruses do not currently appear to be pathogens, they provide an immense resource for the emergence of new pathogens in the future To date, the most medically important mosquito-borne arboviruses are grouped in two major families: (i) the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>) which includes West Nile (WNV), yellow fever (YFV), dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses and (ii) the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>alphavirus</italic>) to which belong Chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River (RRV) and Sindbis (SINV) viruses [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A more complete list of arboviruses and their geographical repartition is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00131-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Of concern, the frequency and magnitude of arboviral epidemics has increased in both established and recently colonized geographic areas. Globally, millions of people are infected each year by arboviruses that cause epidemics, spread by the day-biting of the 
 <italic>Aedes (Ae.) aegypti</italic> mosquito, which is the primary vector [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This mosquito evolved from the sylvan African 
 <italic>Ae. formosus</italic> to become an anthropophilic species that breeds in urban environments and feeds primarily on humans [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast to the typically sylvatic outbreaks of CHIKV that occur in Africa, a single amino acid mutation in the E1 envelop protein adapted the CHIKV to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, a vector that readily adapts to diverse environmental conditions. Importantly, the past three decades have seen a dramatic global expansion in the geographic distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> that continues today [
