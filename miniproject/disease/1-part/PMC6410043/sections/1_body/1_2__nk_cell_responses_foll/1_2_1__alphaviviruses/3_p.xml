<p>It is clear that NK cells in CHIKV infection are strongly cytotoxic without producing IFN-γ, thereby suggesting a prominent role of NK cells in the control and destruction of virus-infected target cells [

Paradoxically perhaps, the lack of IFN-γ in the microenvironment could alter or delay initiation of the adaptive immune response and be associated with a delay in the resolution of persistent symptoms during the chronic phase of infection [

Thus, in an experimental mouse model of CHIKV infection, extension of oedema was correlated with high NK activity, whereas the depletion of NK cells significantly reduced acute joint pathology, thus corroborating the deleterious role of NK cells in driving virus-induced pathology [

These data are consistent with those obtained in degenerative joint disease associated with osteoarthritis in which synovial tissue-infiltrating NK cells displayed impaired IFN-γ production, suggesting that NK cells contribute to the evolution of disease [
