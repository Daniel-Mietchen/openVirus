<p>Alphaviruses are members of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that make up a major group of medically important arboviruses. Alphaviruses impact human health around the world, often in areas with heavy disease burdens from other arboviruses that cause infections that present similar early clinical symptoms. Countries in the Americas and the Caribbean are experiencing a waning epidemic encompassing over 2 million suspected infections from the arrival of CHIKV in 2013, an alphavirus associated with chronic and debilitating polyarthralgias (Pan American Health Organization 2017.

In 2008, CHIKV was listed as a US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases category C priority pathogen. Persistent joint pain is a common symptom also caused by other related pathogen alphaviruses, such as RRV, Oâ€™nyong-nyong virus and Mayaro virus, which are poised to become the next emerging pathogen [

Intriguingly, outbreaks were mostly reported to be unpredictable, with an interval of several decades between major events; the precise factors of alphavirus emergence are unclear but it can hypothesized that, in addition to ecologic and virus-linked factors, the immune status of the affected populations plays a key role both in the intensity and periodicity of recurrence.
