<p>In parallel, genetic evidence supports the role of KIRs in flavivirus infection. In studies performed in Gabon, Brazil and Western India, a difference in the frequencies of KIR genes was found in patients infected with DENV, as compared with healthy controls [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Mechanistically, KIR molecules interact with DENV peptides presented on HLA molecules. As observed in many viral infections [
