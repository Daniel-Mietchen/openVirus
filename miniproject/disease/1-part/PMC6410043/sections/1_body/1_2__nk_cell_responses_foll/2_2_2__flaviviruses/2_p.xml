<p>As described for other human pathogenic arboviruses, recovery from flavivirus infections depends on the host’s ability to mount effective innate antiviral responses that can eliminate or at least control, the virus. Following natural infection by an infected mosquito, viral particles are introduced into the subcutaneous space, where resident DCs are one of the first cell types to be infected by flaviviruses such as DENV or ZIKV. The DCs are specialized in the production of a robust level of type I IFN. Several lines of evidence have indicated that the type I IFN system is the central mediator of protection. First, studies with DENV-infected patient samples have shown that, during the early febrile period, high levels of type I IFN is observed in the serum of DENV-infected patients [

The tissue-specific localizations are consistent with the generally accepted finding of DENV infection that often results in “petechiae” following resolution of infection A protective role of CXCR3-expressing NK cells appears to be important in DENV, is supported by the high mortality rates and viral load in the brains of CXCR3-deficient mice infected by DENV [
