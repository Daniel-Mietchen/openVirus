<p>NK cells have been studied, to various extent, in several flavivirus infections, including DENV, WNV and ZIKV. Generally, in these infections, an early and robust activation of NK cells has been described, suggesting a key role for the latter cells. In DENV-infected patients, early activation of NK cells was also reported, clearly associated with mild dengue disease [

It is important to note that following vaccination with 17D, a live attenuated YFV, NK cell activation peaks at the same time as viral load, 6 days post-vaccination and correlates directly with a rise in plasma type I and type III IFNs. Thereafter, viral load and NK cell responses decline rapidly returning to baseline by day 10 and 15 post-vaccination, respectively [
