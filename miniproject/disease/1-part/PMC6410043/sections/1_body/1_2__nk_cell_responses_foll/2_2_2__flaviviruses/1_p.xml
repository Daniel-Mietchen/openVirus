<p>Among the most pathogenic flavivirus
 <italic>es</italic> in humans, the archetype, YFV, causes jaundice in those people who are severely affected. An effective and affordable vaccine providing long-lasting immunity has been widely available for more than 50 years [

However, despite the success of this vaccine, YFV continues to circulate in the tropical jungles of Africa and South America and re-emerges regularly to infect naïve persons. WNV is even more widely dispersed because it infects a range of mosquito, mammalian, avian and reptilian species. This virus has attracted attention as a major pathogen following an outbreak of fever and encephalitis in New York, USA in 1999, where deaths in horses, birds and humans were reported. Within 5 years, the virus had dispersed throughout the Americas [

DENV fever remains an important disease caused by four closely related viruses, DENV 1–4, for which no DENV-specific therapies are available. The sole approved DENV vaccine elicits protection in people with prior DENV exposure but not in naïve individuals in which it has been associated with more cases of DENV haemorrhagic fever upon subsequent infection [

Another important question concerns ZIKV, which was confined as a low-pathogenic arbovirus for a long period of time but was recently declared as a public health emergency by the WHO. The reason for this dramatic change was its recent spread worldwide and its link to Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and multiple neurodevelopmental defects, including microcephaly in infants born of mothers infected during the first trimester of pregnancy [
