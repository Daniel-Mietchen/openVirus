<p>The results from a principal component analysis based on the expression of different NK cell markers revealed that DENV-2 infection is mostly associated with the modulation of inhibitory KIRs and NKp44, a unique NK receptor only expressed on activated NK cells [

 <xref rid="B86-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Consistently, a direct interaction of NKp44 and protein E of DENV and WNV has been observed [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. These data suggest that this effect might be common for flavivirus infection regardless of the origin of the virus and E protein. Thus, it is likely that a complex balance exists between flavivirus-induced triggering of NK cells and subversion of NK killing as a result of the upregulation of the expression of MHC class I molecules on infected cells [

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Increase of MHC class I expression is a hallmark of flavivirus activity, leading to the inhibition of NK cell function. In WNV infections, this modulation is associated with upregulation of NKG2D ligands in infected cultures, suggesting that these stress molecules could play a role in the recognition of infected cells [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Increase of MHC class I expression in ZIKV-infected cells is mediated via the RIGI-IRF3 pathway which can be inhibited by blocking IFN-β [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Other flaviviruses such as WNV are associated with activation of NF-κB, as shown after infection of IFNAR
 <sup>(−/−)</sup> cells by WNV [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Furthermore, it was reported that HLA-E is upregulated in ZIKV but not in DENV-infected NK cells, suggesting a differential impact on NKG2A/2C responses [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. At least in ZIKV, little or no changes in the expression of other ligands, such as AICL for NKp80; B7H6 for NKp30; CD48 for 2B4; and MHC class I chain-related proteins A and B (MICA and -B molecules for NKG2D) was shown on infected targets [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Because ligands of other NK receptors can be induced by “stress”, further studies are needed to characterize each NK receptor ligand that is induced during flavivirus infection.
