<p>On the other hand, cellular immune responses to flaviviruses were shown to be involved in cross-protective immunity (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The use of such proteins as subunit vaccine antigens was well documented in the literature. However, such vaccines were not tested in a serocomplex cross-protection context. Recent reports showed the importance of non-structural proteins in autologous (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) or heterologous protection (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), regarding immunization with live attenuated viruses or natural infections. In contrast to structural proteins, it seems there are conserved residues in non-structural proteins which are capable of eliciting flavivirus cross-protective T cell immunity.
