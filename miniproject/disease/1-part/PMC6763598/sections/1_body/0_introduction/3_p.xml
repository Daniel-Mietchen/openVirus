<p>Humoral immune response to flaviviruses is complex and is involved in both, viral clearance and pathogenesis. An exacerbation of the disease severity mediated by antibodies, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), is observed in some cases of DENV infection. Immunoglobulins produced in a first infection by a specific serotype cross-react with viral particles present in a second infection caused by a different serotype. Viral particles are targeted to Fc-γ receptors bearing cells by non-neutralizing antibodies, which facilitates penetration and replication of DENV (
