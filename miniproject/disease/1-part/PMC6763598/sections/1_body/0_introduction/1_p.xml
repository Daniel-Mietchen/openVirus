<p>The Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family is composed by over than 70 viral species with relevant global epidemiological impact. Flaviviruses viral particles have icosahedral capsid, are enveloped and present a single stranded genomic RNA of positive sense (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The entry of flaviviruses is mainly based on endocytosis mediated by clathrin-coated pits and transport by an endocytic compartment. The low-pH environment within endosomes triggers conformational changes in the envelope glycoprotein (E), leading to membrane fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane and subsequent release of the nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The genomic RNA is translated into a viral polyprotein, which is cleaved by viral and cellular proteases, to originate flavivirus proteins (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Three of these proteins are structural components of viral particle, called structural proteins. The E protein is the major antigen of the viral envelope. In addition to E protein, flavivirus particles contains also another envelope protein (M) and the capsid protein (C) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The polyprotein also originates non-structural proteins, which are not present on viral particle, but have important roles in viral replication and pathogenesis. There are seven non-structural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B e NS5. After protein synthesis, the assembly of viral particles takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum. Immature viral particles are then sent to Golgi complex to be maturated by furin activity. Mature viral particles are then transported through vesicles to the plasma membrane and released by exocytosis (
