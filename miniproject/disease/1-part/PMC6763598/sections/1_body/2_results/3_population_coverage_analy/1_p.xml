<p>As shown in conservancy analyses, we selected fifteen epitopes with at least 90% identity among all flaviviruses. Such epitopes were shown to present relevant population coverages with regard to the most prevalent HLA alleles and main ethnicities in Brazil and United States, as shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In addition, population coverage for selected epitopes were shown to be also relevant for most of world regions, as shown in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Our results indicate that those highly conserved epitopes bind to HLA molecules of different human populations worldwide, with high population coverage.
