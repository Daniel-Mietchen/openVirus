<p>Nineteen research articles were selected reporting 529 epitopes. Such antigen determinants were experimentally characterized and associated with protective immunity. From the 529 epitopes 15 were selected after conservancy analysis. All selected epitopes are class I HLA ligands. Their amino acid sequences, HLA ligands, locations and percent conservations are shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Three epitopes showed conservation higher than 99% among all flavivirus polyproteins analyzed. In addition, virus-specific identity was also analyzed and is shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Epitope identity was shown to be constant in most of cases for each flavivirus. Together, these results indicate that there are fifteen epitopes associated with protective immunity which are highly conserved among flavivirus serocomplexes.
