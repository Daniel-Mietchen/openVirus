<p>All of selected epitopes were concentrated in flavivirus non-structural proteins 3 and 5 (NS3 and NS5, respectively). Thus, we used NS5 and NS3 3D models to study the locations of the epitopes. From fifteen epitopes, six were located in Helicase domain of the NS3 protein (NS3H), and eight were located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases domain of the NS5 protein (NS5p) (
