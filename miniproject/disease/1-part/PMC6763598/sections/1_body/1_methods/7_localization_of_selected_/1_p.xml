<p>Epitopes with high conservancy were submitted to location analysis along flavivirus polyprotein. Preliminary localization was retrieved from NCBI annotations. Then, 3D protein models of E, NS3 and NS5, deposited at the Protein Data Bank- PDB (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>), were used for fine localization. Pymol (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.pymol.org/</ext-link>) was used to highlight selected epitopes along the proteins 3D models, as previously described (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).
