<p>A database was built with polyprotein sequences from flaviviruses of different serocomplexes isolated in different continents of the world. Viruses taken in consideration were those of highest epidemiological relevance in Brazil and worldwide: 
 <italic>Dengue virus</italic> (DENV), 
 <italic>Zika virus</italic> (ZIKV), 
 <italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> (YFV), 
 <italic>West Nile virus</italic> (WNV), 
 <italic>Japanese encephalitis virus</italic> (JEV), 
 <italic>Saint Louis encephalitis virus</italic> (SLEV), 
 <italic>Rocio virus</italic> (ROCV), 
 <italic>Cacipocore virus</italic> (CPCV), 
 <italic>Ilh√©us virus</italic> (ILHV), and 
 <italic>Iguape virus</italic> (IGUV). Sequences in FASTA format were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database from September-2017 to September-2018 (

We aimed to recover sequences from all listed flavivirus species, isolated in all continents, with a limit of three sequences per country of each viral species. We noticed that for some species there were few deposits. In these cases, all available sequences were selected. Additional criteria for selecting sequences were: (i) complete annotation of structural and non-structural proteins within deposited polyprotein sequence and (ii) absence of undefined amino acid into sequence. The database consisted of a total of 325 polyprotein amino acid sequences (
