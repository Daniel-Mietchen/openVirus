<p>We carried out a literature search for reports of experimental characterization of protective epitopes. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes which were related to protective immune response to flavivirus were searched in reports available at Pubmed from September-2017 to September-2018 (

Criteria for selecting research articles were: (i) evaluation of epitope binding to HLA; (ii) determination of cytokine production pattern for both, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells; (iii) use of at least two different methods for determining cytokine production pattern and (iv), clear association with control of flavivirus infection. This last criterion involves validation of epitopes associated with survival under challenge experiments using humanized animals (transgenic mice expressing HLA), control of viral load under challenge experiments using humanized animals, infection of humans without disease and identification of important epitopes in immune responses elicited by well-known protective vaccines. Words used in the search were: CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell, epitopes, protection, immunity,
