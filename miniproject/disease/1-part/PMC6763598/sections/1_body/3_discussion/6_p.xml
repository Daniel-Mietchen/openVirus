<p>With regard to class-I HLA restricted epitopes, we found fifteen highly conserved peptides which were thoroughly shown to be involved in flavivirus infection control. The peptides APTRVVAAEM, DPASIAARGY, DISEMGANF, KAKGSRAIW, and RFLEFEALGF are located in the NS3 or NS5 proteins. They bind to a subset of multifunctional CD8+ T limphocytes capable of producing IFN-γ and TNF-α against DENV infection (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition, the peptide APTRVVAAEM is involved in cross-protection against DENV and ZIKV. The epitopes TDTTPFGQQRVFKEK, EFGKAKGSRAIWYMW, and AKGSRAIWYMWLGAR are concentrated in the NS5 protein and contain multiple HLA-I and -II binding motifs which are involved in elicitation of protective immune memory against YFV (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The epitope MTTEDMLQVW is involved in protection against JEV (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The remaining selected epitopes (see 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were also related to protection against DENV. All of the selected epitopes are involved in induction of anti-flavivirus CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. Some of the listed studies report generation os memory cells, which could also be recalled in order to favor cross-protective immunity.
