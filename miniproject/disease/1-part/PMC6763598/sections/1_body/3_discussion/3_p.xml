<p>The role of DIII in the flaviviral cycle is still unclear, although frequently related to a receptor binding function (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). It was previously shown that antibodies targeting different regions in DIII are able to strongly neutralize WNV. The regions are the N-terminal linker region (residues 302 to 309) and three strand-connecting loops, namely, BC (residues 330 to 333), DE (residues 365 to 368), and FG (residues 389 to 391) (

These epitopes revealed 100% conservancy among all 325 sequences analyzed. All of the selected B cell epitopes were show to be important in DENV neutralization (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> are located in the same structures of flaviviruses with known envelope glycoprotein structure. Our results indicate that such epitopes are important targets to be considered in flavivirus serocomplex cross-immunity due to their key roles in viral life cycle.
