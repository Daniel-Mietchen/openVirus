<p>Cross-protective immunity into a given serocomplex seems to be more easily achieved (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Such cross-protection depends on recall of serocomplex cross-reactive memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. There is not a high number of highly conserved class-II HLA restricted epitopes among all serocomplexes. Nevertheless, we identified two peptides capable of binding class-II HLA, involved in anti-YFV protective immune response which are highly conserved among all flavivirus serocomplexes. Thus, it seems achieving multivalent protection among serocomplexes depends on overcoming immunodominance. Highly conserved class-II HLA restricted epitopes do not seem to be immunodominant in order to promote recall of serocomplex cross-reactive memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in a multivalent way.
