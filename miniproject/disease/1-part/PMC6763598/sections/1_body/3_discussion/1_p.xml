<p>In this study, we aimed to identify both, immunological determinants and patterns of immune response possibly involved in flavivirus serocomplex cross-protection. Our premise was based on epidemiology of flaviviruses: most of them have both, vectoring and geographic conditions to co-circulate all together in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). However, it does not happen. In addition, recent studies showed evidences of cross-protective immunity induced by vaccines or sequential infections (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). We searched B and T cells epitopes, which were thoroughly shown to be involved in flavivirus infection control. We found a relevant number of epitopes which are capable of eliciting flavivirus protective immunity and are also highly conserved among serocomplexes. In addition, such epitopes cover a wide range of human populations and are concentrated in proteins E, NS3, and NS5. For such epitopes, mechanisms involved in virus control targeting the E protein are all related to antibody-mediated virus neutralization. On the other hand, mechanisms involved in virus control by targeting NS3 and NS5 proteins are mainly related to cytotoxicity mediated by CD8
