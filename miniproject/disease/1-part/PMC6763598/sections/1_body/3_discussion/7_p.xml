<p>Conserved epitopes could be enriched in artificial or natural immunizations. For example, sequential infection or administration of different anti-flavivirus vaccines would recall cross-reactive memory T CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and T CD8
 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes. It is important to stress that approved vaccines represent three serocomplexes: DENV, JEV and YFV. However, most of those epitopes which are important for recalling cross-reactive T cells, are concentrated in non-structural proteins. The only anti-DENV vaccine currently approved for use in humans is a chimera between DENV and YFV. Its structural antigens are representative of DENV proteins, while non-structural antigens are representative of YFV proteins. In addition, the JEV vaccine is based on inactivated viruses. Enhancing the recall of cross-protective memory T cells would ideally happen with the use of live attenuated viruses or other vaccine approach capable of providing epitopes of non-structural proteins.
