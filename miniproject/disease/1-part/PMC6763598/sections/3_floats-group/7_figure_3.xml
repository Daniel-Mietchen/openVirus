  <p>Distribution of T cell epitopes â‰¥90% conserved among flavivirus polyproteins. The locations of epitopes are shown in two different models: DENV NS3 protein 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> and ZIKV NS5 protein 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold>. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The helicase domain of the DENV NS3 protein is shown in olive, while its protease domain is shown in chocolate brown. Six epitopes (shown in red) were shown to be located in NS3, all of them located in the protease domain. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Zoomed view of NS3 protein to detail epitopes. The numbers refer to the following epitopes, respectively: (
   <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) APTRVVAAEM or APTRVVASEM, (
   <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) APTRVVAAEM, (
   <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) DPASIAARGY, (
   <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) GEAAGIFMTA, (
   <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) DISEMGANF, and (
   <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) LPVWLAYKVA. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The methyltransferase domain of the NS5 protein is shown in light salmon, while its RNA polymerase domain is shown in slate blue. Eight epitopes (shown in red) were shown to be located in the NS5 protein, all of them in the RNA polymerase domain. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Approximate view of NS5 protein to detail epitopes. Some epitopes present overlapping. Thus, we show three different regions: Region 1 is composed by one epitope TDTTPFGQQRVFKEK. Region 2 contain six epitopes: KAKGSRAIW, RFLEFEALGF, EFGKAKGSRAIWYMW, AKGSRAIWYMWLGAR, SRAIWYMWLGARFLE, and WYMWLGARFL. Region 3 is composed of only one epitope: MTTEDMLQVW.
