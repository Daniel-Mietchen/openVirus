<p id="p0045">We studied two main criteria. The first criterion was the proportion of children with identified respiratory tropism virus, both overall and according to different age groups. The second criterion was the proportion of children in whom the following were identified: influenza virus, RSV, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, HMPV and parainfluenza virus. For the secondary criterion, for each virus identified, we studied the average positivity rate and its evolution over the study period depending on age and sex.</p>
