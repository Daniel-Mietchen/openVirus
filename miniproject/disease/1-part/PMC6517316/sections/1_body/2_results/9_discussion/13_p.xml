<p id="p0160">We did not assess the prevalence of these viruses in asymptomatic infants from the same population sampled over the same period. Other authors have identified respiratory viruses, in particular HRV and coronavirus, in 9% to 36% of asymptomatic children 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, but it has been pointed out that HRV infection is much more frequent in sick children than in asymptomatic children 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. It is unlikely that the identification of HRV is a simple coincidence in our population because we targeted the most severe manifestation of ALRTI. We did not evaluate the role of bacterial agents; this will have to be the subject of further studies.
