<p>Most of the A(H3N2) strains characterized in the US belonged to 3C.2a clade and were antigenically similar to the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 cell-based vaccine strain. However, only half of these strains were antigenically similar to the variant of the vaccine strain adapted to growth in embryonated chicken eggs and used for the vaccine production. These observed antigenic differences may be due to the occurrence of amino acid substitutions in the adaptation process. Similar antigenic characteristics were observed for A(H3N2) viruses in Europe where 3C.2a clade also was prevalent [
