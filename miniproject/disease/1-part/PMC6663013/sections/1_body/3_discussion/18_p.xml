<p>Selection of D222G/N mutations inside an infected organism occurs due to the acquired increased ability of the virus to bind to α-2,3-type sialic acid receptors, which are present in the lower respiratory tract. However, in these mutant strains, the tropism to the cells of the human upper respiratory tract, where α-2,6-type sialic acid receptors are predominantly present, is weakened, and as a result, this may lead to reduced transmissibility of the mutant viruses among people. The reduced ability of the virus to spread through an infection of the upper respiratory tract may explain the low circulation of viruses with major variants of D222G/N mutations [
