<p>In the course of the monitoring of seasonal influenza, sensitivity to oseltamivir and zanamivir of 87 isolated influenza viruses A and B was analyzed. According to the results of the phenotypic study, all isolated isolates of A(H3N2) and B influenza viruses were sensitive to anti-neuraminidase drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Among the 47 A(H1N1)pdm09 analyzed isolates, only one strain, A/Samara/117868/2018, was characterized by highly reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 97.6 nМ and median value being 0.47 nМ for all studied strains falling within the normal sensitivity values range of 0.1–1.5 nM [
 <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Susceptibility of this one oseltamivir-resistant strain to zanamivir was normal. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of the H275Y amino acid substitution in the NA of this strain, which is associated with resistance to oseltamivir of A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses.
