<p>Genetic analysis of 2 selected B/Victoria-like viruses showed that B/Kaliningrad/310/2018 and B/Kaliningrad/313/2018 strains are genetically similar to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 vaccine strain. No variants of influenza B/Victoria-like viruses with a deletion in the HA gene (in 162â€“163 or 162-163-164 amino acid positions in the protein) were found.</p>
