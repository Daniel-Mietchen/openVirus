<p>Analysis of the HA D222G/N polymorphism using the next generation sequencing (NGS) data allowed us to detect and estimate the degree of the polymorphism in the studied cases. This analysis revealed the presence of D222G and D222N mutations in minor amounts in the primary clinical material of A/Krasnoyarsk/54/2018 lethal case (MDCK isolate was not available) and D222N mutation was detected in a minor amount in the primary clinical material of A/Irkutsk/1727/2018 lethal case (
 <xref rid="pone.0220401.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The presence of D222N mutation was not detected in the viral isolate of A/Irkutsk/1727/2018 lethal case (
 <xref rid="pone.0220401.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This difference from the primary material partially may be a result of using both lung and trachea original specimens to cultivate the viral isolate on MDCK cells compared to only lung specimen used for the direct sequencing of the original clinical material. This analysis also revealed the simultaneous presence of viruses with D222G and D222N mutations in three studied lethal cases (in two viral isolates, A/Ulyanovsk/205/2018 and A/Irkutsk/1728/2018, and in the original clinical material of A/Irkutsk/1728/2018 and A/Krasnoyarsk/54/2018 cases) (
