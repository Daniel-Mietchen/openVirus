<p>Sequencing was carried out at the FBRI SRC VB “Vector”, Rospotrebnadzor. To determine nucleotide sequences of viral genes and genomes, viral RNA was isolated using the RIBO-sorb RNA/DNA Extraction Kit (InterLabService, Moscow, Russia) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reverse transcription reactions were carried out with Uni12 primer [
 <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] for type A viruses and Uni11 for type B viruses using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer's instruction. PCR amplification of cDNA was done according to previously described protocols with modifications [

Deep sequencing of amplicons covering complete genomes was performed on an Illumina MiSeq using the MiSeq reagent kit v3 (Illumina, San Diego, US). The full-length genomes were assembled by alignment of reads to known references with bwa-0.7.15 [

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the maximum likelihood method based on the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model with 1000 bootstrap replications using MEGA 6.0 software (
