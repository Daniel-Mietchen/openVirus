<p>Throughout the epidemic, the A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses were detected in approximately equal proportions. Among the analyzed isolated virus strains and viruses analyzed directly from the original clinical material and autopsy material, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to clade 6B.1, A(H3N2) viruses belonged to clade 3C.2a, B/Yamagata-like strains belonged to clade 3, and B/Victoria-like strains belonged to clade 1A. All the viral isolates, except A(H3N2), were antigenically similar to the corresponding vaccine strains, according to the serological analysis. The analysis of A(H3N2) isolates indicated antigenic differences from the corresponding egg-grown vaccine strain.</p>
