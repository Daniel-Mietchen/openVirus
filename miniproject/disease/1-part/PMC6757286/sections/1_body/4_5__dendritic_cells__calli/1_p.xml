<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional APCs that patrol the body surfaces (skin, gut, or airway) for intruding microbes or insults. They play a key role in host immunity by bridging innate and adaptive arms of the immune system [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. DCs are broadly classified as CD11c
 <sup>+</sup> conventional DCs (cDCs) and CD11c
 <sup>−</sup> plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) [
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Furthermore, two subsets of cDCs have been identified in the airways: CD103
 <sup>+</sup>CD11b
 <sup>−</sup> (CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs) and CD103
 <sup>−</sup>CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> (CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs) cells [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]; the latter of which resides in the lamina propria which lies immediately beneath the airway epithelium [
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. In a steady state, the major DC population in the airway mucosa is CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs followed by CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs and pDCs [
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Humans also have more myeloid DCs (similar to cDCs in mice) in the airways than pDCs [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs can extend their dendrites or traverse the alveolar epithelia into the airway for surveillance and antigen capture [
