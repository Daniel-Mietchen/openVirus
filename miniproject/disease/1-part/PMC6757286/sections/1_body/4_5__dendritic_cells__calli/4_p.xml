<p>The effective function of cDCs in priming the T cell-mediated immune response depends on (1) trafficking of IAV-activated DCs into DLNs, (2) presentation of antigen to specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and (3) lung homing capacity of activated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. Migration of pulmonary cDCs into DLNs depends on expression of CCR7, as 
 <italic>ccr7</italic>-deficient mice lack DC trafficking into DLNs [
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Both CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs and CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs express CCR7 [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>] confirming the migratory nature of these cDCs. Once in the DLNs, these DCs prime IAV antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which migrate into infected lungs in a CCR4-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>] to exert anti-influenza activity (
