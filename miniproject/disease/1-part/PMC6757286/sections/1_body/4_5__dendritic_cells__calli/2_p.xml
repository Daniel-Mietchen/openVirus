<p>Acute IAV infection leads to a decrease in cDCs and pDCs in peripheral circulation [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggesting active trafficking of DC populations during influenza. Following intranasal inoculation of IAV (X31 H3N2) in mice, pulmonary cDC subsets demonstrated sustained increase while it was transient for pDC. Moreover, draining lymph nodes (DLNs) contained only cDCs [
