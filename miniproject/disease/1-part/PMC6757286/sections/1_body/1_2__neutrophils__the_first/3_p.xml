<p>In addition to these conventional roles, neutrophils also utilize more sophisticated strategies to safeguard the host during influenza. One such scheme is the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) through NETosis, a release of web like structures of nucleic acids coated with histones [

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], augmented damage to the pulmonary endothelia and epithelia [
