<p>Neutropenia has been demonstrated to increase the pulmonary virus titer and mortality rate upon IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] suggesting a protective role for neutrophils during influenza. Phagocytosis, release of granular contents, and production of cytokines are major effector functions of neutrophils. These granulocytes contain cationic antimicrobial peptides like defensins and cathelicidins that neutralize IAV [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Cathelicidins have anti-influenza activity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> through the reduction of viral replication and hindering the production of inflammatory mediators [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], showcasing a promising role for neutrophil antimicrobial peptides during virus infections. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines produced by neutrophils limit virus replication and halt progression to severe disease [

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], although infection has been demonstrated to be both productive (for pH1N1) [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and abortive (for seasonal H1N1 and WSN33) [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These discrepancies might be related to virus subtypes/strains used. Interestingly, mice treated with 
 <italic>β</italic>-defensin had reduced IAV burden and an associated reduction in neutrophils in the lungs [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], underscoring the importance of a prudently adjudicated immune response to host protection. Nonetheless, IAV-infected neutrophils upregulate IFNs and other antiviral factors [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] that limit viral replication (
