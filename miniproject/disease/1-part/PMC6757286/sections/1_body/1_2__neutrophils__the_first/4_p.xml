<p>Neutrophils were also shown to guide CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell activation and recruitment into the lungs during influenza emphasizing the reliance of adaptive immune cells on those from the innate branch. By presenting IAV antigens on the cell surface, neutrophils function as APCs to activate CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells within the lungs [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition, neutrophil membrane-bound CXCL12 is used as a beacon by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells during migration into the IAV-infected lungs [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The importance of neutrophils in innate immune defenses against IAV is well defined. Yet, uncontrolled trafficking of neutrophils as observed during infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 and 1918 pandemic IAV [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] results in the production of excessive reactive oxygen species [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] that causes oxidative stress-mediated pulmonary damage. Additionally, neutrophil CXCL12 trails can recruit CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] in excess which may boost/perpetuate inflammation, lung damage and severe pathology through cytolysis of infected epithelia during IAV infection. Thus, the abundance of neutrophils in the IAV-infected lungs may dictate their precise role in immunoprotection or immunopathology.
