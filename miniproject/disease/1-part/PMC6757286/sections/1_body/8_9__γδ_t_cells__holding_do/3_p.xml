<p>Subtypes of IAV differ in the degree of disease severity they elicit in the host. Apart from engaging the T cell receptor, IAV HA protein activates 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells [
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>] through 
 <italic>α</italic>-2,3 and 
 <italic>α</italic>-2,6 sialic acid receptor engagement on the cell surface [
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>] suggesting that HA-mediated differential activation of 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells might be related to the degree of protection provided by these immune cells to IAVs with different sialic acid preferences.
