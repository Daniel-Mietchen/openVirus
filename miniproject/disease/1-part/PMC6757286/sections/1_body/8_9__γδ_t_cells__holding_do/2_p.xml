<p>Similar to other innate lymphocytes, 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells exert anti-influenza activity either by direct killing [
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>] or noncytolytic inhibition of virus replication through the secretion of IFN
 <italic>γ</italic> [
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>] (

 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. In contrast, avian IAVs are resistant to the antiviral activity of IFN
 <italic>γ</italic>. The cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells involves cytolytic granules (perforin and granzymes), NKG2D, TRAIL, and Fas-FasL pathways [
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells effectively kill cells infected with various IAV subtypes [
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>] suggesting their role in the heterosubtypic immune response. It has been argued that IAV-infected macrophages and sentinel DCs alter the mevalonate pathway which in turn liberates isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP), an antigen for 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells [
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. The production of IPP activates 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells, thereby conferring immune protection independent of incoming virus subtypes.
