<p>Innate-like T cells expressing 
 <italic>γ</italic> and 
 <italic>δ</italic> chains as receptors, 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells constitute around 1-5% of blood lymphocytes. Given that 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells respond antecedent to 
 <italic>αβ</italic> T cells during infection [
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>], they may serve a pivotal role in early-stage antiviral host defense during influenza. Intravenous adoptive transfer of 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells to IAV-infected mice inhibits viral replication and controls disease progression [
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>] suggesting that these cells can traffic to lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, IAV-activated 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells express high levels of chemokine receptors CXCR5, CCR1, and CCR5 [
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>] allowing their migration towards CCL3 and CCL5 [
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>] abundant IAV-infected lungs [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As a means of self-promotion, IAV-activated 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cells produce preferred chemokines including CCL5 [
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>] to chaperon circulatory 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cell recruitment into the lungs. The production of CCL5 is dependent on virus subtypes (higher for avian viruses than human viruses [
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]), indicating that infection with avian viruses promotes more robust 
 <italic>γδ</italic> T cell infiltration.
