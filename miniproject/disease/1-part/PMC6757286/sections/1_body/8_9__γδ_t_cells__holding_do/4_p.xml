<p>The rapid secretion of IL-17A by

 <italic>γδ</italic> T cell-mediated IL-33 production serves as a cue for IL-33R expressing ILC recruitment [
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>], which in turn promotes tissue repair through amphiregulin secretion [
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>], the complex cell-cell interactions that occur even in the innate cell compartment of the immune system are necessary and important to anti-influenza host protection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These observations suggested that IL-17A and the timing of its release can modulate the balance between protection and pathogenicity in a host infected with IAV.
