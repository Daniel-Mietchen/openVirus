<p>Although ILC2s are known to provide antihelminthic immunity, recent findings demonstrate their influx into lungs following IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>] most likely in response to alveolar epithelial- and macrophage-derived IL-33 [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>–
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>] sensed through surface-expressed IL-33R [
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As potent producers of IL-5, ILC2s may regulate eosinophil infiltration during influenza [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Within the lungs, ILC2s increase expression of genes encoding amphiregulin and extracellular matrix proteins asporin, decorin, and dermatopontin [
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Strikingly, ILC2-derived amphiregulin is involved in tissue repair and remodeling [
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggesting that ILC2s are capable of lung tissue homeostasis during influenza. As major contributors of IFN

 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>–
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. However, IFN
