<p>As tissue resident professional phagocytes that safeguard the airway against intruding pulmonary pathogens, AMs maintain lung homeostasis [

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. With a prolonged half-life of about 1-5 weeks, the AM population is primarily maintained via self-renewal [

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Pulmonary homeostasis is conserved in part by interaction of these AMs with alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). At steady state, AECs that express CD200 engage surface CD200R on AMs controlling the production of inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. However, IAV infection lowers the expression of CD200 and CD200R [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] compromising the CD200-CD200R axis which leads to macrophage activation and production of inflammatory mediators (
