<p>The pulmonary macrophage population consists of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and interstitial macrophages (IMs) [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Macrophages are phenotypically classified as proinflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2). This classification is best suited for monocyte-derived macrophages wherein different cytokines and growth factors are used for differentiation but not AMs [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In relation to IAV, AMs are best studied while the role of IMs is ambiguous due to phenotypic similarity with monocytes and technical difficulty in liberating them from the lung tissue [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Irrespective of lower phagocytic ability compared to AMs [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], owing to their location in the interstitium, IMs phagocytose pathogens that have evaded AMs thereby providing a second line of defense within the tissue. The potential antiviral activity of IMs needs to be explored further.
