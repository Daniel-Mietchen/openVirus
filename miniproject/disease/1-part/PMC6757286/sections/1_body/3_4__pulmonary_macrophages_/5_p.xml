<p>The contribution of macrophages to immunopathology is evident from the fact that CCR2
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice are protected from IAV-induced pulmonary tissue destruction and mortality [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Furthermore, protective mechanisms in these macrophage deficient mice are traced to delayed migration of T cells [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] suggesting that macrophages alter cellular immune responses. The role of macrophages in IAV-mediated pathology is based on findings from monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The induction of macrophage-derived cytokines, IFN-

 <italic>β</italic>, TNF

 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] suggesting that these inflammatory mediators may contribute to IAV-induced immunopathology. In contrast, MDMs infected with H5N1 virus showed lower expression of cytokines, namely, IFN-
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic>, TNF
 <italic>α</italic>, CCL5, and CCL8 at early times postinfection [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. This may be representative of an immune evasion strategy of IAVs to prolong uncontrolled replication and replication-induced pathology to gain a foothold in the host. Cumulatively, these observations suggest that pulmonary dysfunction observed in fatal cases of influenza depends on how macrophages respond to the invading virus.
