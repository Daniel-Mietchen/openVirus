 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Moreover, transgenic mice selectively depleted of AMs exhibit severe influenza [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] suggesting a critical role for AMs in limiting virus-induced airway injury. However, the possible protective role of IMs may not be underestimated as they have more potent activators of antigen-specific T cells compared to AMs [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. As most other leukocytes, AMs too secrete type I IFNs during IAV infection [

 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] (

 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Since IAVs fail to infect human AMs [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], an alternative mechanism like phagocytosis of apoptotic cells may also trigger AM activation and cytokine secretion during infection [
