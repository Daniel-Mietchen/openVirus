<p>Eosinophils are not usually considered mediators of anti-influenza immunity. However, epidemiologic data associated with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic suggested that asthmatics, presumably with pulmonary eosinophilia, were less likely to suffer from IAV-induced morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Pediatric influenza patients who developed acute pneumonia demonstrated a rise in the serum IL-5 levels and peripheral eosinophilia [
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>], suggesting that eosinophil recruitment may be necessary for late-stage anti-influenza host defense. Pulmonary eosinophilia has also been documented in IAV-infected mice [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>–
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>] suggesting that cytokines like CCL5 [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or IL-5 [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>] produced during IAV infection may drive eosinophil migration (
