<p>Primary and secondary immune barriers play a crucial role in safeguarding the host against influenza. Physical barriers of the immune system including soluble components like mucus, collectins, and antimicrobial peptides provide the first line of defense by mitigating virus exposure to underlying airway epithelial cells which are the principal site for IAV replication [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Upon breaching these physical barriers, IAVs bind to sialic acid receptors on airway epithelial cells and enter these cells to complete replicative cycles within, destroying infected cells in the process [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Predilections for specific sialic acid linkages may restrict IAV to the upper respiratory tract. However, alterations in the sialic acid linkage preferences, particularly in reassortant viruses, can render IAV more adept at lower respiratory tract infection and dissemination [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Infection of the epithelium activates the innate branch of the immune system which consists of humoral/soluble as well as cellular components.
