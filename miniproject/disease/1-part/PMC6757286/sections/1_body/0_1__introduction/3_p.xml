<p>Rapid changes in IAV surface antigens through antigenic shift have resulted in three pandemics during the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century [

While annual vaccinations are highly encouraged by public health agencies, poor adherence and low efficacy increase the need for better strategies to understand host responses during IAV pathogenesis in order to delineate other mechanisms which enhance antiviral immunity.
