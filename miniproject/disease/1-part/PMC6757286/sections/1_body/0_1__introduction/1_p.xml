<p>Respiratory viruses infect millions around the world each year causing a range of symptoms and claiming thousands of lives [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus are lethal to the very young but harmless to most adults [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other viruses, such as rhinovirus, cause essentially the same symptoms (predominantly a runny nose) in any age group [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Still others like influenza A virus (IAV) can cause severe infections in patients across age groups during one season, mild symptoms in another year or be lethal in yet another season [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, IAV infections cause seasonal epidemics and global pandemics and are a major cause for public health concern. Although generally milder than pandemics, seasonal influenza epidemics can cause around 650,000 deaths globally each year [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite mainstay vaccination strategies to minimize IAV infections, influenza pandemics have occurred once every 10-30 years, primarily due to cross-species transmission and antigenic shifts in the virus [
