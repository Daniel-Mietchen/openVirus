 <caption>
  <p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and 
   <italic>γδ</italic> T cells are important during early stages of influenza virus infection. Schematic representation of immunoprotection and immunopathology mediated by ILCs in the IAV-infected lungs. 
   <italic>γδ</italic> T cell migration into the infected lungs is driven along the CCR5-CCL5 axis. 
   <italic>γδ</italic> T cells destroy infected cells through the secretion of IFN
   <italic>γ</italic> and perforin-granzyme B pathway and secrete IL-17A to trigger airway epithelium release of IL-33, a chemoattractant for ILC2. In addition, IL-33 secreted by IAV-infected epithelium enhances the trafficking of ILC2 into the lungs. Activated ILC2s release amphiregulin (Areg) which helps to repair tissue damage and IL-5 which induces eosinophil trafficking.
