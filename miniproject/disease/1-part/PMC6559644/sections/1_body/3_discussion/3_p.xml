<p>Our results corroborate previous estimates of the introduction date of the CHIVK ECSA lineage in the north-eastern region of Brazil in mid-2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. After its introduction, the risk of the ECSA lineage to spread from Bahia to other Brazilian states was estimated to be higher in the northeast and southeast regions due to abundance of competent vectors and climate conditions in those geographical areas [

CHIKV ECSA lineage spread to other north-eastern states, such as Para√≠ba, Sergipe, Pernambuco and Alagoas states, causing large outbreaks until it arrived in the southeast region, where this lineage caused a total of 25,245 suspected cases in 2016 alone [
