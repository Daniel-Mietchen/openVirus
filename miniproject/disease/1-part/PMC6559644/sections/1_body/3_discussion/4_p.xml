<p>This pattern of arbovirus cryptic transmission prior to first official reports have been observed before for dengue and zika virus epidemics [

 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Genetic and epidemiological analysis indicated the northern of Brazil acted as a source region for dengue, or as stepping-stone spot for the dissemination of arbovirus to other areas of the country, which might have been influenced by the increased human mobility and vector suitability [
