<p>The ML phylogeny was used as a starting tree for Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using BEAST 1.10.2 (

 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We employed a stringent model selection analysis using both path-sampling (PS) and stepping stone (SS) procedures to estimate the most appropriate molecular clock model for the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We tested: a) the strict molecular clock model, which assumes a single rate across all phylogeny branches, and b) the more flexible uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal rate distribution (UCLN) [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Both SS and PS estimators indicated the strict molecular clock (Bayes Factor = 4.3) as the best fitted model to the dataset under analysis. Besides, we have used the he HKY+G4 codon partitioned (CP)1+2,3 substitution model and the Bayesian SkyGrid coalescent model of population size and growth [
