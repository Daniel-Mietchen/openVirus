<p>Mean threshold cycle value of the generated sequences was 14.86. Most of the isolates are from patients that reside in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro (n = 6), and the other five isolates are from four different neighbouring municipalities. We did not selected isolates features, such as sampling location and collection date, since, at random, only 11 samples proved to be suitable for sequencing (they had enough DNA concentration after purification, &gt;4ng/Î¼L). Of the sequenced samples, 6 are from female and 5 from male patients. Ten samples are from over 40 years old patients, and one sample is from a 26 years old female. None of the patients had travelled to previous epidemic areas as indicated by the epidemiological data from the local surveillance service. Sequencing statistics and epidemiological details of the sequences generated here are available in Tables
