<p>To better understand the diversity of CHIKV in some of most affected municipalities from Rio de Janeiro, we generated 11 CHIKV near-complete genomes (coverage range 62%-83%, mean = 73%) from serum samples using a nanopore sequencing approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This genome coverage obtained is considered sufficient to perform phylogenetic inferences, according to a study that showed the occurrence of a decrease in phylogenetic accuracy when genome coverage is reduced from 40% to 20% [
