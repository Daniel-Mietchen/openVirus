<p>Pre-starved mosquitoes (24 hours), aged 4–9 days, from all three cities were exposed to 2 ml (per well of the hemotek membrane feeder) of an infectious blood meal consisting 1:2 parts of freshly harvested DENV-2 media suspension and defibrinated sheep blood (Central Veterinary Laboratories Kabete, Kenya). The artificial feeder (hometek membrane feeder) was covered with mouse skin (Kenya Medical Research Institute, Animal house). After 1 hour of feeding, fully blood-fed mosquitoes, originating from each of the three cities under study, were removed from the feeding cage, and divided into three new cages, each of which was incubated at either 22°C, 28°C, or 31°C. These three temperature treatments are representative of the minimum/maximum average monthly temperature of each source city; 22°C—minimum temperature in Nairobi, 28°C—maximum temperature in Nairobi, and minimum temperature in Kisumu and Mombasa, 31°C—maximum temperature in Kisumu and Mombasa. A proportion of the mosquitoes originating from the different cities were sampled on days 7, 14, and 21 (for each of the incubation temperatures) and tested for infection, dissemination, and transmission (by the capillary tube method) [
