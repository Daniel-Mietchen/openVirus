 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mosquitoes with positive saliva were considered competent in transmitting DENV-2. The overall dissemination and transmission rates at each temperature were compared for the different cities using Fisher’s Exact test. Human blood feeding rates were compared between the cities using Chi-Square test. All analyses were performed in R version 3.3.1 [
