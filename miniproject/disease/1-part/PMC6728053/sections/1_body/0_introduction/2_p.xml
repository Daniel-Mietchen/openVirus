<p>There are a number of factors such as temperature, vector bionomics (survival, density, feeding frequency/behavior), extrinsic incubation period (EIP), and vector competence that can affect DENV transmission [

Whilst determination of individual factors is valuable, they are rarely studied in parallel, yet their combined effects may be critical to fully understanding the complex interrelationships influencing DENV transmission risk. Studies investigating the various dengue risk factors in parallel are lacking in many endemic areas, including Kenya.
