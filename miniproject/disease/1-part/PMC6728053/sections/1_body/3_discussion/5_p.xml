<p>Another possible explanation for the lack of dengue in Kisumu and Nairobi could be the density of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations. Although the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> density in Nairobi, was about half of that observed in Kisumu and Mombasa, and might also be one of the reasons for the lack of dengue in Nairobi, the density of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was similar in Mombasa and Kisumu, so 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> density would not explain the lack of outbreaks in Kisumu.
