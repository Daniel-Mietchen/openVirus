<p>In conclusion, our study indicated that the current concentration of dengue in coastal Mombasa, and absence of outbreaks from Kisumu, appeared to be due to differences in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> feeding patterns rather than differences in vector competence or environmental temperature. However, lower vector density and environmental temperature appeared to be contributory factors to the current absence of dengue outbreaks in Nairobi. Risk factors such as mosquito density, environmental temperature, vector competence, host feeding pattern, and vector genetics, when interpreted individually, may not sufficiently inform risk of transmission of DENV and must therefore be evaluated collectively. Although the risk of DENV transmission is high in Mombasa, and low in Kisumu and Nairobi, continued monitoring of DENV transmission risk and vector surveillance, as well as monitoring of contributing behavioral and environmental factors, are needed to improve early warning and pre-emptive action.
