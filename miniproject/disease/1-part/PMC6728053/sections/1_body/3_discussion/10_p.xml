<p>Phylogenetic analysis of DENV-2 susceptible and non-susceptible 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes suggested that DENV-2 susceptibility did not vary on the basis of the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> subspecies/lineages present in these cities, as both the susceptible and non-susceptible 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic> were fairly represented in all three mitochondrial lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007686.g003">Fig 3</xref>). As a limitation, the susceptible mosquitoes corresponded to mosquitoes that were shown to be infected with DENV. However, not all infected mosquitoes eventually disseminate virus, and even fewer successfully transmit virus by bite. Thus, further studies investigating the genetic basis of vector competence should consider mosquito populations with at least a disseminated virus infection.
