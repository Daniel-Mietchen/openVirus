 <p>Dengue is a viral disease of global public health significance owing to rapid spread and increasing disease burden. Urbanization is an important risk factor for dengue emergence. In Kenya, repeated outbreaks of the disease have occurred in the urban areas of Mombasa but not in Nairobi and Kisumu, despite the presence of susceptible human hosts and the primary vector, 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> throughout these areas. We set out to determine whether this trend is related to variations in biological parameters of the vector, 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> between these areas. Our findings show that (i) 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> had lower density and human blood feeding ability in Nairobi and Kisumu, respectively, compared to Mombasa, (ii) the ability of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> populations from the three cities to transmit dengue-2 virus was comparable with no observed association between susceptibility and vector genetic variation, and (iii) vector competence was temperature-dependent. Based on this, it appears that higher temperature and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> vector density explains the higher risk of dengue virus transmission in Mombasa, compared to Nairobi, whereas differences in feeding behavior of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> may be responsible for the lower risk at Kisumu.
