<p>In summary, most information available for influenza viroporins is centered around AM2, followed by BM2. For the latter, structural data are increasingly available, but proteinâ€“protein interaction data studies comparable to AM2 are lacking. Viroporins in ICV and IDV have attracted much less interest, concomitant with their lower virulence in humans and biomedical relevance. Nevertheless, their mode of action, and those of lesser known viroporins, can help to better understand ionic transport across membranes. </p>
