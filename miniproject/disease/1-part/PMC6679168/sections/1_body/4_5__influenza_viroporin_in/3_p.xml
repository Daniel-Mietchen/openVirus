<p>In addition to adamantanes and other small molecules, the AM2 proton channel can be also inhibited by both oxidized and reduced copper ions, Cu(II) and Cu(I). Biphasic inhibition observed in electrophysiological assays has suggested two Cu(II)-binding sites with different affinities [

Solid-state NMR studies have shown that the low-affinity site is non-specific and localized at the membrane surface, whereas the high-affinity site would be located inside the channel in between the four imidazole rings from His37 residues and the four indole rings from Trp41 [
