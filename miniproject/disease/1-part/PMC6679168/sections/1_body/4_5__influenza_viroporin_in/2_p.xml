<p>Although AM2 and BM2 are functional homologs, wild-type BM2 is insensitive to Amt and Rim [

 <xref rid="B40-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and no BM2 inhibitors have been identified to date. The lack of amantadine inhibition of BM2 may be explained by differences in lumen hydrophobicity in the two channels. For example, the BM2 structure solved by solution NMR in DHPC [
 <xref rid="B42-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] shows a coiled-coil tetramer channel apparently in the C
 <sub>closed</sub> conformation, with three polar residues (Ser-9, Ser-12, and Ser-16) lining the pore and a bulky phenylalanine ring (Phe-5) protruding into the pore at the N-terminus and possibly blocking the BM2 channel pore. By contrast, the corresponding pore-lining residues in the AM2 channel are much more hydrophobic: Val-27, Ala-30 and Gly-34 [

 <xref rid="B53-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, the more hydrophilic channel of BM2 protein may not be able to accommodate a hydrophobic drug like amantadine. However, the poor inhibition by other small molecules is difficult to explain, since N-terminal interhelical separation of BM2, measured using fluorinated Phe-5, cannot prevent the access of small molecules to the lumen of the pore [
