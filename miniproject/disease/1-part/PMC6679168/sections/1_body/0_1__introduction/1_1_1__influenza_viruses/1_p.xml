<p>Influenza viruses are enveloped, segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Four influenza virus types have been identified to date, classified based on their core proteins: A, B, C [
 <xref rid="B1-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and D [
 <xref rid="B2-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Type A is known to infect humans, as well as porcine, bovine and canine species [
 <xref rid="B4-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The main reservoir of the influenza A viruses are aquatic birds [
 <xref rid="B5-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The seasonal flu caused by influenza A virus (IAV) in humans is a very contagious respiratory illness that is among the top ten leading causes of death in the United States and associated with high medical burden [
 <xref rid="B6-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Sudden pandemics with high mortality rates are caused by the sporadic transmission of avian or swan influenza viruses to humans, as pre-immunity to these new strains is non-existent [
 <xref rid="B6-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Influenza B virus (IBV), its close relative, is less severe but still capable of causing serious outbreaks, is responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics among humans [
 <xref rid="B9-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and accounts for half of the influenza diseases in recent years (

 <xref rid="B11-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], whereas type D (IDV) infects cattle and pigs [
 <xref rid="B3-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, IBV has also been reported to infect harbor seals [
 <xref rid="B12-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although IDV infection in cattle is usually asymptomatic, it can lead to disease in swine [
 <xref rid="B2-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
