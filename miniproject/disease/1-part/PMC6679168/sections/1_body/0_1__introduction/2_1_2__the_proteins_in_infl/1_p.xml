<p>In IAV, the viral envelope contains cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts and transmembrane glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [
 <xref rid="B14-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which are used to further classify IAV strains. A third membrane protein is matrix protein 2 (AM2 in IAV), present in lower abundance [
 <xref rid="B15-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. HA, NA, and M2 are type I, type II, and type III membrane proteins, respectively [

 <xref rid="B18-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A layer of matrix protein 1 (M1) just underneath the membrane is the most abundant protein of the virus. M1 forms an internal coat, enclosing the viral ribonucleoproteins as well as three polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2) that form the viral RNA polymerase complex [
