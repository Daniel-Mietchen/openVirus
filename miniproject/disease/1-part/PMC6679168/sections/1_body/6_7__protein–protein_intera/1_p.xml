<p>Influenza viroporins are also involved in viral pathogenesis by engaging in critical interactions with viral proteins or disrupting normal host cellular pathways through coordinated interactions with host proteins. The reader is referred to a recent review on this subject [
 <xref rid="B148-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] that provides an update on the characterization of the main PPIs for most viroporins, as well as the role of viroporins in these PPI interactions. In the next part of this review, we highlight and summarize the nature and outcome of some of these proteinâ€“protein interactions involving M2, and how the influenza virus may exploit these host cell factors to its advantage.
