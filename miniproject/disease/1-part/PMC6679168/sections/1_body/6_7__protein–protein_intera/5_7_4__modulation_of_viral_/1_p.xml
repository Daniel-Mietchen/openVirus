<p>The cytoplasmic tail region of IAV M2 encodes another host SLiM that interacts with the host caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Cav-1 is a cholesterol-binding raft-residing membrane protein with multiple roles in lipid and membrane trafficking, as well as in signal transduction [
 <xref rid="B160-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Inhibition of Cav-1 correlates with decreased virus titers in IAV-infected cells [

 <xref rid="B161-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>], but it remains to be determined whether this interaction also affects the surface localization of M2 and other viral proteins.
