<p>The β1 auxiliary subunit of the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ATPase, ATP1B1, was identified to interact with the cytoplasmic region of both AM2 and BM2, and a stable ATP1B1-knockdown cell line was able to suppress influenza virus A/WSN/33 replication [
 <xref rid="B167-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Using deletion mutations, the authors narrowed down the interacting region to residues 28–48 in BM2, and residues 117–303 in ATP1B1, although the interaction between AM2 and ATP1B1 has not been characterized.
