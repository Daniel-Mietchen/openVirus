<p>Targeting the function of the host cellular Na,K-ATPase pump offers a promising antiviral treatment (recently reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B163-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]), since infection by RNA viruses can affect the expression and activity of Na,K-ATPase. For instance, infection with IAV/H1N1 and IAV/H5N1 has led to the downregulation of Na,K-ATPase in alveolar epithelium [

 <xref rid="B165-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. This action of cardiac glycosides on viral replication could be due to activation of signaling cascades, or by altering the concentration of intracellular ions. Influenza protein translation has been reported to be affected by cardiac glycosides such as ouabain, digoxin and lanatoside C, which express antiviral activity against influenza [
