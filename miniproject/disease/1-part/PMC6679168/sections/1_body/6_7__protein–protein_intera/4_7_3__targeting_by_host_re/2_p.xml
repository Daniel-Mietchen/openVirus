<p>Cyclin D3 is a key cell-cycle regulator of the G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> phase that binds to the M2 cytoplasmic tail [
 <xref rid="B159-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Like AnxA6, siRNA-knockdown of cyclin D3 led to increased virus titer. It has been proposed that cyclin D3 disrupts the interaction between IAV M1 and M2 by competing with M1 for binding to M2, consequently impairing the proper assembly of progeny virions. To counteract cyclin D3 activity, IAV is able to induce the relocalization of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it is targeted for proteasomal degradation.
