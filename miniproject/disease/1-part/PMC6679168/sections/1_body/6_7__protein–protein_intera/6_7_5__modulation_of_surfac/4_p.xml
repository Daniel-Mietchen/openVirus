<p>TRAPPC6A and its truncated form TRAPPC6AΔ also interact with IAV M2 through a highly conserved leucine residue located at the M2 cytoplasmic tail (M2-L96) [
 <xref rid="B177-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. TRAPPC6A is a component of the multi-subunit transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex that mediates ER-to-Golgi transport [
 <xref rid="B178-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. siRNA knockdown of TRAPPC6AΔ increases M2 surface expression, while TRAPPC6AΔ overexpression has produced the opposite effect, suggesting that TRAPPC6AΔ slows down M2 apical trafficking. Two other subunits of the TRAPP complex, TRAPPC5 and TRAPPC9, were identified as binders to M2 in all of four independent influenza interactome screening campaigns [

 <xref rid="B181-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. It would be interesting to determine if these TRAPP complex subunits may cooperate in the modulation of the influenza life cycle.
