<p>UBR4 is a 600-kDa member of the UBR box-containing an N-recognin family with multiple roles, including targeting protein for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [
 <xref rid="B170-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. In the context of an IAV infection, UBR4 has been proposed to promote surface localization of the viral envelope proteins HA, NA, and M2. The M2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail regions have been found to be important for its interaction with host UBR4. Knockout of UBR4 has led to enhanced co-localization of M2 with the autophagosome marker DIRAS3 and reduced M2 cell surface expression [
 <xref rid="B171-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Taken together, the interaction between M2 and host UBR4 may benefit IAV replication by (i) protecting M2 from host degradation, and (ii) promoting surface localization of M2 and other viral glycoproteins to facilitate efficient IAV budding and release.
