<p>Finally, the host factor Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) is proposed to play an important role in the trafficking of viral proteins to the cell surface during the late stages of virus replication [
 <xref rid="B181-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. The latter work reported that siRNA-mediated depletion of GBF1 correlates with (i) significant reduction in virus titers, (ii) reduced efficiency of VLP formation and (iii) altered intracellular localization of the viral envelope proteins HA and NA. However, while GBF1 has been reported to associate with M2, it is not completely understood how M2 contributes to the process.
