<p>Influenza infection induces a number of host antiviral activities, including interferon (IFN) responses and activation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) [
 <xref rid="B152-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. During the early stages of infection, host PKR activation is inhibited by IAV to permit viral replication, by (i) masking of viral dsRNA using its nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) to prevent PKR activation [
 <xref rid="B153-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>], and (ii) activation of the PKR inhibitor P58
 <sup>IPK</sup> through nucleoprotein (NP)-mediated dissociation of Hsp40 from the Hsp40–P58
 <sup>IPK</sup> complex [
 <xref rid="B154-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. During the late stages of infection, AM2 stabilizes the Hsp40–P58
 <sup>IPK</sup> complex, leading to PKR activation and subsequent cell death and viral release [
