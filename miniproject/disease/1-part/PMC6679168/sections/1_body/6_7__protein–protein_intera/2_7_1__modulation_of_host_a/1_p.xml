<p>In IAV, M2 plays an important role in evading host autophagy by interacting with autophagic proteins such as Beclin-1 and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3). M2 blocks autophagosome fusion with lysosomes by interacting with Beclin-1 through the N-terminal 60 amino acids of M2, resulting in enhanced apoptotic cell death [

IAV is also able to subvert host autophagy by encoding a short linear motif (SLiM) in its M2 protein to mimic a highly conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, W/FxxI/L/V. This interaction hijacks LC3 to the plasma membrane to prevent autophagosome–lysosome fusion and is essential for IAV budding and transmission [
