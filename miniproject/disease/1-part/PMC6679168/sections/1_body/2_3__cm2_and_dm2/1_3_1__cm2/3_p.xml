<p>CM2 protein is capable of modifying pH within the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Indeed, when CM2 was co-expressed with a pH-sensitive hemagglutinin of IAV, CM2 protein was able to protect the co-expressed HA against acid activation in the TGN [
 <xref rid="B102-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], although its activity was much lower than that of the AM2 protein. Additionally, a chimeric AM2 protein containing the CM2 transmembrane domain could partially restore the infectious virus production of an M2-deficient influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="B103-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], which suggests that CM2 can alter intracellular pH. Electrophysiological studies of CM2-expressing mouse erythroleukemia cells also identified proton permeability [
 <xref rid="B97-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], and such permeability probably plays a role in the uncoating process of the influenza C virus. The glycoprotein HEF of the influenza C virus has the ability to cause low pH-dependent hemolysis and fusion [
 <xref rid="B104-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], and the virion is presumably uncoated in the acidic endosomal compartment. The CM2 protein might, therefore, have a function similar to that of the M2 protein in virus uncoating. Nevertheless, the proton and chloride permeabilities have not been clearly dissected.
