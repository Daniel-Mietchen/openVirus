<p>The influenza C virus M2 protein (CM2) was first reported by Hongo et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] and was proposed to function as a voltage-activated chloride ion channel when expressed in 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes [
 <xref rid="B92-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. CM2 is encoded by RNA segment 6 (M gene) of the influenza C virus [
 <xref rid="B20-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which produces a p42 protein precursor, and upon cleavage by a peptidase, CM1 and CM2 are obtained [

 <xref rid="B94-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Like AM2, CM2 is a type III membrane protein, with a 23-aa N-terminal extracellular domain, a 23-aa transmembrane domain and a 69-aa C-terminal cytoplasmic domain [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00654-f001">Figure 1</xref>). CM2 is abundantly expressed in virus-infected cells, and a small amount is incorporated into the virus particles [
 <xref rid="B96-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. CM2 forms disulfide-linked dimers and tetramers via evolutionarily conserved Cys1–Cys6–Cys20 [
 <xref rid="B97-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] and is post-translationally modified by N-glycosylation (Asn11), palmitoylation (Cys65), and phosphorylation [
