<p>The structure of the TM domain of the CM2 protein (Tyr27â€“Val46) has been obtained by site-specific infrared dichroism and the molecular modeling [
 <xref rid="B99-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] of isolate C/Ann Arbor/1/1950 [
 <xref rid="B100-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In that model, side chains of L31, L34, M41 and L44 residues were predicted to be lumenally oriented, and the peptide formed a left-handed coiled-coil tetramer [

 <xref rid="B101-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The transmembrane pore of CM2 was occluded by residue M41, and a motif of hydrophilic residues, T30, S33, T40 and Y43, was located at the outer surface of the CM2 channel.
