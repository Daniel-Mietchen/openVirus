Those authors proposed that the CM2 protein is transported to the cell surface where it may lower the ionic strength just beneath the viral budding site by inducing the efflux of Cl- ions. This may be advantageous during virion assembly to promote the interaction of M1 with RNPs, since a slight increase in salt concentration may trigger the dissociation of the M1â€“RNP complex in ICV [
