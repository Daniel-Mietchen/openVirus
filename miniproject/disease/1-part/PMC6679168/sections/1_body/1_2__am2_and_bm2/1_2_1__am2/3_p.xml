<p>Four main features characterize AM2-facilitated membrane permeabilization to protons: acid activation, proton selectivity, relative low proton conductance, and unidirectionality. These features are encoded in key pore-lining residues of the AM2 channel. AM2 has a conserved HxxxW functional motif in its TM domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00654-f001">Figure 1</xref>), where His37 is responsible for proton selectivity and acid activation [
 <xref rid="B36-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and Trp41 ensures asymmetric proton conduction from the N-terminus to the C-terminus [
 <xref rid="B37-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Other residues surrounding this motif also contribute to the dynamics and proton transfer equilibria in the channel.
