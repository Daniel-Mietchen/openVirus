<p>At a high pH (e.g., 7 to 8), the AM2 channel is in a C
 <sub>closed</sub> conformation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00654-f002">Figure 2</xref>, left), where the side chains at the C-terminal end of the channel, including His37 and Trp41 tetrads, are tightly packed, and the pore is lined by alternating layers of side chains and well-ordered water clusters. The closed Trp41 tetrad dehydrates the His37 tetrad and raises the His37 deprotonation barrier, thus blocking proton conduction through the channel. This conformation has been observed by X-ray crystallography [

 <xref rid="B53-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,

 <xref rid="B56-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. When the pH decreases to around 6, the His tetrad increases its protonation state to +2, and the channel becomes activated. Electrostatic repulsion with protons is lower due to the low charge state of the His37 tetrad, allowing proton permeation from the viral exterior. This asymmetry partly explains the rectification of proton flow observed experimentally. Protons rapidly diffuse to the His37 tetrad via an ordered water cluster, when the IAV particle is incorporated into the endosome, as it is surrounded by an acidic environment. At a low pH, the positive charge of the His37 tetrad increases, and the Trp41 gate and the C-terminal helices open and become more hydrated. This lowers the His37 deprotonation barrier, increasing proton conductance. Further reduction of pH expands the channel and increases pore water mobility, further increasing proton conductance [
