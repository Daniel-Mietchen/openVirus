<p>Depending on the role of the His37 tetrad, several proton transport models have been suggested [
 <xref rid="B35-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the “shutter” mechanism [
 <xref rid="B62-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the His37 tetrad works as a gate. At a low pH (around pH 6, see above) the gate opens due to the electrostatic repulsion between the biprotonated, positively charged histidine residues. The excess proton is transferred via the Grotthuss mechanism (i.e., proton transfer through a network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules [
 <xref rid="B69-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]), without changing the protonation state of His37. In the “shuttle” mechanism (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B55-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]), the His37 tetrad changes protonation state at a low pH, while the proton is shuttled through the His37–Trp41 region.
