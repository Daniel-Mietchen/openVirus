<p>The AM2 proton channel is inward rectified (i.e., it conducts more easily in the inward direction), from the N- to C-terminus. This is attributed to Trp41 and Asp44 [

 <xref rid="B60-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The Trp41 tetrad forms a gate that physically occludes the C-terminal end of the pore, while Asp44 stabilizes the Trp41 gate via water-mediated hydrogen bonds. When oocytes are subjected to low pH
 <sub>in</sub> and high pH
 <sub>out</sub> conditions, no outward current in the AM2 proton channel is observed [
