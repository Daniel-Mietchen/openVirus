<p>Although the proton conductance rate of AM2 is higher at a low pH [

 <xref rid="B74-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], it is still orders of magnitude lower than expected for a water-filled pore of the size of the M2 channel without ionizable groups [
 <xref rid="B75-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. This low conductance may exist to prevent toxicity in the host and has been attributed to a rate-limiting step caused by His37 protonation–deprotonation [
 <xref rid="B36-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. However, the His37–water proton exchange rate appears to be too fast to account for this (~10
 <sup>5</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B54-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and additional factors may account for the low rate of proton conduction [
 <xref rid="B77-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,

 <xref rid="B80-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Recent single-molecule fluorescence experiments using Trp41 as a probe have detected interhelical motion in AM2 on a microsecond timescale, which is consistent with the proton conduction rate, and which increased from a high to low pH with a transition midpoint in the range of those reported for the pKa of the His37 tetrad [
 <xref rid="B81-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This is consistent with a range of studies that show that the AM2 tetramer is more dynamic at a low pH [
 <xref rid="B70-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,

 <xref rid="B86-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Thus, proton conductance through AM2 may be limited by the transition between C
 <sub>closed</sub> and C
 <sub>open</sub> conformers. The structure and dynamics of water in the AM2 pore are also important because it is the essential medium for proton permeation. X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) [
 <xref rid="B68-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and 2D infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy [
 <xref rid="B87-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] studies of AM2 have shown that, at a low pH, water molecules form a continuous hydrogen-bonded network spanning the channel length.
