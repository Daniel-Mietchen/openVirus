<p>Importantly, in addition to this antiviral activity, we demonstrated that 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract did not exert a genotoxic effect on several mammalian cells, including human primary cells relevant for arboviral infection. Our COMET assay showed that the plant extract did not cause any deleterious effect on the cell DNA. Previous studies assessing the genotoxicity of medicinal plants showed great variability in their genotoxic potential, depending on the plants and types of extracts tested [

 <xref rid="B48-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We demonstrated that 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> did not exert a high cytotoxicity regardless of the cell lines tested. These non-deleterious effects further indicate that 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract is a potential candidate for the development of new antiviral drugs to fight ZIKV and DENV infections.
