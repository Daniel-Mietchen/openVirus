<p>Despite the recent ZIKV emergence worldwide and its subsequent classification as a major public health problem by the World Health Organization in 2016 [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], there are still no vaccine or licensed antivirals. Thus, the use of medicinal plants as a simple and economical means of treating the viral infection merits investigations. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of 
 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic> extract against ZIKV and DENV. Our data demonstrate that non-toxic concentrations of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> (100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) significantly reduced the ZIKV infection in Vero cells, regardless of the ZIKV strains tested (historic and epidemic strains). We also demonstrated that 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract prevents the infection of human cells by four DENV serotypes. We showed that 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract acts on early steps of the viral replication cycle, in a similar way than EGCG, a green tea polyphenol, which is known to inhibit viral entry into the host cells [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our attachment and viral inactivation assays show that 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract inhibits the viral attachment to the cell surface, probably via a direct interaction with the outer membrane of ZIKV particles. This type of interaction was previously described between EGCG and ZIKV or DENV particles [

 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We propose that the active compounds of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract act through a similar mechanism, probably via binding to the surface of the virions.
