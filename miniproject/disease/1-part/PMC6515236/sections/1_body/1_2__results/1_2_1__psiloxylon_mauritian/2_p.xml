<p>To further characterize the toxicity of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract, we analyzed human cell DNA damage by a COMET assay. A549 cells were treated with a maximal noncytotoxic concentration (MNTC) of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> (100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) for 24 h, and their DNA degradation was then analyzed with a COMET assay. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, which is known to induce DNA degradation [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], was used as a positive control. No comet formation and no DNA degradation were observed in the cells treated with the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D). However, the COMETs were clearly visible when the cells were treated with the positive control H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D). We obtained the same results using a cytotoxic concentration (500 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract on A549 cells (
