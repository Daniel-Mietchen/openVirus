<p>We also performed a viral inactivation assay to determine if the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract neutralizes ZIKV infectivity. Briefly, ZIKV
 <sup>GFP</sup> particles were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with different concentrations of plant extract, prior to infection [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. At 24 h post-infection, a significant decrease of GFP-positive cells (up to 80%) was observed in cells treated with 100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the plant extract, as compared to untreated ones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). Using a nonlinear regression curve, the concentration of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> that inhibits 50% of ZIKV infection (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was estimated at 19.5 ± 4.8 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Based on the cytotoxicity and the antiviral activity, the selectivity index (SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was then calculated. The SI of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> was 53.5. Together, these results suggest that the antiviral activity of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract is mediated by an interaction between the extract and ZIKV particles.
