<p>The ZIKV strains were pre-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with plant extracts in DMEM before infection. 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract was used at a final concentration of 100 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and EGCG at a final concentration of 100 µM. Vero cells were then infected at MOI of 1 for 24 h with viruses treated or not with the drugs. After fixation with 4% PFA for 30 min at RT, the cells were stained with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) AF-488 conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in PBS-BSA 0.5% overnight at 4 °C. After immunostaining, ZIKV plus strand RNA was detected using Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated probe sets recognizing the regions between nt 2 and 1144 of the ZIKV genome (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were processed following the manufacturer ‘ViewRNA ISH Cells Assays’ protocol. The nuclei were stained with NucBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at RT. The images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an X63 objective (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The images were processed with Zen2 (blue edition) software and analyzed with the ICY software (icy.bioimageanalysis.org) using the Spot Detector plugin. The number of individual RNAs per field was analyzed by assembling 3 × 3 images. A detection filter based on a size of 3 pixels in diameter (with a minimum of 2 pixels and a maximum of 5) was set up. Based on this size parameter, all the fluorescent signals, including ‘aggregated’ RNAs, were analyzed by the software and decomposed into individual RNA.
