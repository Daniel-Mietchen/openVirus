 <sup>4</sup> cells per well. Cells were infected by 0.1 mL of ten-fold dilutions of supernatant. Following an incubation of 2 h at 37 °C, 0.2 mL of the culture medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France)) were added, and the incubation was extended for 4 days at 37 °C. Cells were fixed (PFA, 3.7%) and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 20% ethanol, after the media had been removed. Plaques were counted and expressed as plaque-forming unit per mL (PFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup>).
