<p>Fresh aerial parts of 
 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic> were collected in Reunion Island in 2016–2017. The voucher specimens (JF 1004) were deposited in the herbarium of the University of Reunion Island. A solvent-free microwave extraction was applied on 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> fresh aerial parts. After heating 500 g of plant material for 20 min at 800 W using an IDCO E200 extractor (IDCO SAS, Marseille, France), the extract was recovered by gravity. The aqueous extract was lyophilized using cryotec 20K (Cryotec, Saint-Gély-du-Fesc, France). The powder was then solubilized on sterile water and stored at −80 °C until used.
