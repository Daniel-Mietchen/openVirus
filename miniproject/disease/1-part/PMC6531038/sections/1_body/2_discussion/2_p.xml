 </sup> The case we describe here has the distinctive clinical and radiological features of CZS (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, we have evidence that the mother was infected, at least once, in early pregnancy as ZIKV was detected in serum in association with clinical symptoms. Indeed, the detection of ZIKV RNA in the AF confirmed the involvement of the fetus and constitutes the only laboratory evidence of prenatal infection in this child.
