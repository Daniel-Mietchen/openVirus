 </sup> were present at birth, including severe microcephaly, craniofacial disproportion, partially collapsed skull, prominent occiput, and excess nuchal skin. Neurological exam showed irritability, hyperexcitability, exacerbation of the primitive reflexes, inconsolable crying, and joint contractures. Postnatal ultrasonography, computed tomography and MRI studies confirmed the microcephaly with a thinned corpus callosum and brain atrophy with parenchymal calcifications (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Ophthalmological examination was normal. Hearing test by brainstem auditory evoked potentials was normal. Clinical and radiological features were considered compatible with CZS.
