<p>We here describe a congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) case of a 2-year-old girl born in Barcelona to a mother infected with ZIKV during pregnancy, who presented a complete seroreversion of ZIKV-IgG serological response (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Her mother was infected during pregnancy while on a 1-month duration visit from Spain to Colombia (her country of origin) in December 2015; she was symptomatic with fever and micro-papular exanthema at 9 weeks of gestation within 2 weeks after returning to Spain. Following the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol,

 </sup> the mother was tested for ZIKV and other flaviviruses to assess the risk of fetal involvement. ZIKV infection was confirmed at 11 weeks of gestation, when she tested positive for ZIKV RNA by reverse-transcriptaseâ€“polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay (RealStar Zika Virus RT-PCR Kit 1.0, Altona Diagnostics) in serum, and later at 19 weeks in amniotic fluid (AF). The mother also tested positive for ZIKV-IgG (IIFT, Arboviral fever Mosaic, Euroimmun, Germany), and for ZIKV plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) achieving a maximum titer of 1/1024. Serological IgG response to dengue virus (DENV) tested positive, but was negative for chikungunya virus. Fetal neurosonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral mild ventriculomegaly, a shortened corpus callosum, brain parenchyma calcifications, and severe atrophy (Fig.

Genetic, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus I and II, and HIV (TORCH) testing in AF with microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (SurePrint G3 Unrestricted CGH ISCA v2 Microarray Kit, 8x60K, Agilent Technologies) and PCR were respectively normal and negative.
