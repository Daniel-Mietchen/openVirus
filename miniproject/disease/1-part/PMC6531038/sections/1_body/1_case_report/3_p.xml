<p>The infant was delivered by caesarean section at 37 weeks and one-day gestation because of suspected intrauterine growth restriction. At birth, all the RT-PCR assays of the maternal (serum, urine, AF, placenta, membranes, and umbilical cord) and neonatal samples (serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], and saliva) were negative for ZIKV (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the first 24â€Šh of life ZIKV immunoglobulin M (ZIKV-IgM) (IIFT, Arboviral fever Mosaic, Euroimmun, Germany) was negative in neonatal serum and CSF, while ZIKV-IgG was positive in both samples. At the same time, we also tested ZIKV-PRNT with a positive result (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Congenital cytomegalovirus infection was ruled out by PCR in urine.
