<p>CHIKV is a small, enveloped virus, with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of ~12 kilobases. The genome possesses a type-0 5’ 7-methyl-GpppA cap, a 3’ poly(A) tail and two open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF-1) encodes the non-structural polyprotein P1234 that is processed to yield four mature non-structural proteins (nsP1-4). The second ORF (ORF-2) encodes the structural polyprotein that is processed into the capsid protein, E3, E2, 6K, and E1. Virus attachment onto mammalian cells is mediated by the CHIKV E2 protein and the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Following CHIKV trafficking to early endosomes, the E1 glycoprotein facilitates endosomal fusion and capsid release into the cytoplasm [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Replication of the viral genome is not well studied but through analogy to other alphaviruses proteolytic cleavage of P1234 in 
 <italic>cis</italic> by the protease function of nsP2 releases the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsP4, initiating the synthesis of minus-strand RNA. Subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the remaining P123 polyprotein initiates synthesis of genomic and sub-genomic RNAs from the minus-strand template [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], facilitating an optimal environment for replication and protection of dsRNA intermediates from host cell detection. The structural polyprotein is translated from sub-genomic RNA and is co- and post- translationally cleaved by viral and host proteases. Virus assembly and budding takes place at the plasma membrane.
