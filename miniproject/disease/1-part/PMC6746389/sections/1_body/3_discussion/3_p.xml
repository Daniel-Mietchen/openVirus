<p>The tested compounds do not display virucidal activity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Intriguingly, 9-ACA- and NPPB-sensitive Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels were required specifically for efficient RNA replicationâ€”as evidenced by the effect of the inhibitors on the CHIKV-Fluc SGR and copy number of the CHIKV genomic and intermediate minus-strand RNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3</xref>). NPPB-sensitive Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels appear to have a conserved function in mosquito cells, as application of the inhibitor to infected C6/36 cells led to a reduction in CHIKV replication (
