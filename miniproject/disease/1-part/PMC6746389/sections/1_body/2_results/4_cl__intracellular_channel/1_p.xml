<p>All of the Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel compounds used in this study inhibit a broad range of cellular Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels. To date, ≥40 Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels have been identified that fall into six classes; 1) Cl
 <sup>-</sup> intracellular channels (CLICs), 2) voltage-gated Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels (CLCs), 3) cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 4) calcium-activated Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels (CaCCs), 5) ligand-gated Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels and 6) volume-regulated Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels (VRAC) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4Ai</xref>), cells were then infected with CHIKV (MOI 10) and released virus titers determined at 24 hpi. Compared to control siRNA transfected cells, in those with reduced CLIC1 or CLIC4 expression levels, replication of CHIKV was significantly inhibited (p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.001, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), confirming a role for both CLIC1 and CLIC4 in efficient CHIKV replication. Co-silencing of both CLIC1 and CLIC4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4Aii</xref>) did not result in synergistic inhibition of CHIKV replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), implying that both channels are required for the same or a related stage in the virus lifecycle.
