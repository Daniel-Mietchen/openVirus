<p>We then investigated the effects of the Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors on efficient CHIKV RNA replication using a CHIKV-Fluc SGR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and Fluc luminescence as a proxy of CHIKV RNA synthesis. For these assays, cells were briefly pre-treated with the MNTD of DIDS, 9-ACA, NPPB or Ribavirin before co-transfection with the CHIKV-Fluc SGR and a 5’capped Rluc mRNA 
 <italic>in trans</italic>, to control for differences in transfection efficiency. Cells were assessed for CHIKV replication by the measurement of luciferase activity 6 hrs post-transfection. NPPB-treatment significantly inhibited CHIKV-Fluc SGR replication 16-fold (p ≤ 0.0001) while DIDS-treatment led to a 9-fold decrease in CHIKV-Fluc SGR replication. As expected, ribavirin also significantly lowered CHIKV-Fluc SGR replication 37-fold (p ≤ 0.0001). 9-ACA treatment produced only a comparatively modest ~3-fold reduction (p ≤ 0.01) in CHIKV-Fluc SGR replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To confirm these findings, we quantified CHIKV genomic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and intermediate complimentary minus-strand (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) RNA copy number (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) by ssqPCR. For these assays, cells were infected (MOI 2) in the presence of each Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitory compound and total RNA extracted at 6 hpi. Significantly lower levels of the CHIKV genomic RNA were observed in cells treated with DIDS (p ≤ 0.05), 9-ACA (p ≤ 0.05), NPPB (p ≤ 0.05) or Ribavirin (p ≤ 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), consistent with the SGR data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Similarly, copy numbers of the intermediate complimentary minus-strand RNA were significantly reduced with DIDS- (p ≤ 0.001), 9-ACA- (p ≤ 0.01), NPPB- (p ≤ 0.001) and Ribavirin- (p ≤ 0.0001) treatment. From this data, we inferred that the efficiency of CHIKV genome replication is dependent on the function of Cl
 <sup>−</sup> channels that are sensitive to DIDS, 9-ACA and NPPB–via either a direct role in replication of the CHIKV genome or indirectly through upregulation of ORF-1 translation.
