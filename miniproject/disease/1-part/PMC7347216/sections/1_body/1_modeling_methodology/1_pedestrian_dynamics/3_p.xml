<p>To mimic the real-life scenarios, we also account for the formation of groups of pedestrians. The groups’ formation is controlled by adjusting the distance (
 <italic>δ</italic>) in Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0235891.e008">2</xref>). Literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] indicates that pedestrian spacing is different between pedestrians belonging to a group (e.g. family or friends in the queue) and other pedestrians. An average distance of

 <sub>1</sub> = 0.46 m is chosen for pedestrian particles within the same group, while this distance between independent pedestrians is given a value of 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.64 m.
