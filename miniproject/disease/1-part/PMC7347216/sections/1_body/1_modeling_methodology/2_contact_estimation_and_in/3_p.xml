<p>First, consider the viral shedding probability distribution (P
 <sub>c</sub>). Studies indicate that the amount of viral shedding is typically dependent on the length of the incubation period and the number of days since the appearance of symptoms. In a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we used CDC data on the amount of RNA (ribonucleic acid) virus copies in the blood serum since the illness contraction to generate this probability distribution for Ebola [
 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A similar approach can be used for other diseases, for example, for SARS pathogen, the viral gene expression of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, detected at different rates along with the evolution of the virus from post-onset of the symptoms till convalescence is indicative of viral shedding [
 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For influenza, nasal, oral or ocular shedding of the H1N1 virus has been detected by determining the relative equivalent unit from viral RNA level [
 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Such data can be used to generate the P
 <sub>c</sub> distribution.
