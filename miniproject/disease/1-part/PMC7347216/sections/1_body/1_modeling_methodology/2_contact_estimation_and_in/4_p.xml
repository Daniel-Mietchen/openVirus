<p>There are many formulations in the literature to compute the mechanism-specific probability of transmission. 
 <xref rid="pone.0235891.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists the details of the popular mechanisms for aerosol and coarse droplet mechanisms. The functional form of the aerosol inhalation probability is described in the data-driven modeling framework in Teunis 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], which in turn is based on Rileyâ€™s Dose-response model [
 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The probability for coarse droplet inoculation mechanism considers the droplet cone emitted during expiratory events like coughing [
