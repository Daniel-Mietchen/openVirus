<p>Consider a population of size N consisting of I(t) infected and S(t) susceptibles at time t. The pedestrianâ€™s position (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>)) evolves through the pedestrian dynamics model and is a function of age, sex and infection status. A susceptible can become infected when coming into direct contact with an infected individual. Given the trajectory of pedestrians over time, the number of contacts 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> can be evaluated by counting the instances when the distance between the

 <italic>j</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>th</italic>
 </sup> pedestrians (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub>) is less than a virus-specific contact radius (x). This transmission distance (x) used to define the contact is dependent on the type of pathogen and mechanisms for its spread. For diseases like Ebola, studies indicate that the primary mode of transmission is through contact droplets [

 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Consequently, a distance that enables direct touch needs to be used for estimating contact for such diseases. Other infectious diseases like SARS and influenza are known to be transmitted by both shorter and longer range airborne mechanisms [

 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Studies show that micrometer-sized aerosol clouds generated during cough can travel over 2 m [

 <xref rid="pone.0235891.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We vary the contact radius between these distances to account for the various infection spread mechanisms. Duration of contact is also needed to define a contact. Here, a contact is defined when a susceptible pedestrian is in the proximity of infective pedestrian within the contact distance (x) for a period of 4 seconds. The contact duration is chosen based on the breathing cycle as time sufficient to complete one inhalation of a contagion laden particle [
