<p>We evaluate the role of motion pattern and contact creation between neighboring pedestrians, for different queue configurations. The aislesâ€™ geometry, orientation. number of inlets and exits are altered between the different configurations. To model queue configurations that are used in practice, we used the dimensions of a waiting queue similar to those in typical theme park attraction as shown in
