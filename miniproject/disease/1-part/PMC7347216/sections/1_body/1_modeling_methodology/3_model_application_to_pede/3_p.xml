<p>We utilize the queue layout shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g002">Fig 2</xref> as the basis for evaluating the effect of the layout and shape of the queue configurations. The aislesâ€™ length and orientation are altered between the configurations of the same area and aisle width. We investigated four different rectangular configurations with the same shape and area as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The four configurations are split vertically (configurations in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>) or horizontally (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g003">Fig 3A and 3D</xref>). Configurations in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> have one inlet and one exit whereas configurations in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref> have two inlets and two exits due to the existence of separated zones. The width of the pedestrian lanes remains 1 m, which allows some pedestrians belonging to the same group to form a double line. The four configurations are termed Configurations 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
