<p>We identify three main methods to reduce the number of contacts when pedestrians are waiting in queues. The shape and configuration of the layout effects the number of contacts. A longer rectangular queue with pedestrian movement aligned along the short side like in configurations 2 and 3 reduces the number of contacts. Another simple way of reducing the number of contacts in waiting queues is if temporary walls are used in place of rope separators. Such walls would potentially limit the contacts within the row, which would reduce the number of contacts from up to 55% to 75% compared to rope separators (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g012">Fig 12B</xref> compares the number of contacts between the default case and when single file is enforced. The overall number of contacts reduces by 8â€“25% in the queue configurations we considered when a single file queue is considered.
