<p>Based on our observations of common queues, we consider the situations when two pedestrians belonging to the same group can move abreast or side-by-side in the four rectangular configurations shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g003">Fig 3</xref>. As initial conditions, the pedestrians are distributed side-by-side inside the aisle and in front of the inlet. The spacing between the pedestrian particles is varied to differentiate between individuals of the same groups and others from different groups as mentioned earlier. As time evolves, the abreast queues turn into a single file in the exit aisles where the pedestrian speed increases (See 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We do not consider a waiting time at the exit to decrease the computational effort.
