<p>Expanding the contact radius to 2.1 m assuming aerosol transmission mechanism, all configurations behave in the same manner for rope separators as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g010">Fig 10A</xref>. Here the infective’s influence crosses multiple surrounding aisles and separation zones, therefore, the number of corners and aisles do not have any effect. For walls, the pedestrians’ distribution at the corners alters the results with minor differences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). Configuration 4 has the most congested corners and highest number of contacts. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g011">Fig 11</xref> summarizes these results. At a low infection radius, for a rope separator, configuration 3 results in fewer contacts, whereas, with higher contact radii, the differences between the different configurations are reduced. For walls, pedestrians’ density at the corners leads to higher contacts for configuration 4. The short waiting time of configuration 3 makes it competitive in all conditions.
