<p>With temporary walls used as aisle separators, the order of the configurations alters as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g009">Fig 9B</xref>. In this case, only the waiting time within the same line and congestion at the corners play an important role. Referring to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g008">Fig 8</xref>, it can be noticed that the pedestriansâ€™ density along the aisles is almost the same between all the configurations. However, at the corners of configuration 4, pedestrians are congregated at higher density than the other layouts leading to an increase in the number of infections for Configuration 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). This is explained by the shorter aisles and the necessity to keep changing velocity direction, thus the reduction in the magnitude of the velocity components. This phenomenon also applies to the rope separator scenario. However, with ropes, the maximum interaction with pedestrians in neighboring aisles and corners is of greater importance and frequency than that within the same line. Configuration 3 remains the most favorable as it comprises a combination of moderate aisle length and less waiting time at corners.
