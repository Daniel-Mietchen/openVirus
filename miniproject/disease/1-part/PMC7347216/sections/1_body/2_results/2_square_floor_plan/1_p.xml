<p>We now consider square layouts with the same area as the rectangular layouts discussed previously. Since the aspect ratio of the square configuration changes from that of a rectangle, the number of aisles and their dimensions vary as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g008">Fig 8</xref>. Note that configurations 1 and 2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235891.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>, are the same except for rotation, therefore, we do not discuss them separately.
