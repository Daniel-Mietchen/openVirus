<p>To understand the observed discrepancy between the rising incidence rate and the reduced transmission rates, we sought to understand the trend of the infection:disease notification ratio in Singapore. Among the 4 serosurveys, the ratio declined from 14:1 (95% credible interval (CrI): 12:1, 16:1) between 2005 and 2009 to 8:1 between 2010 and 2013 (95% CrI: 6:1, 10:1) and subsequently 6:1 between 2014 and 2017 (95% CrI: 4:1, 8:1). Interestingly, during 2007–2012 and 2015–2017, when DENV-2 was the predominant serotype, the ratios were 16:1 (95% CrI: 14:1, 19:1) and 7:1 (95% CrI: 5:1, 10:1), respectively, whereas in 2005–2006 and 2013–2014, when DENV-1 predominated, the ratios were 10:1 (95% CrI: 8:1, 11:1) and 3:1 (95% CrI: 2:1, 5:1), respectively.</p>
