<p>A change in the age structure of the population due to a reduced birth rate and longer life expectancy is known to lower the disease transmission rate through a decrease in the proportion of the population that is susceptible. Because Singapore has seen a progressively aging population in recent decades, we explored whether the lower transmission rate could be attributed to such a dilution effect. We analyzed and reconstructed seroprevalence trends using age-stratified seroprevalence estimates and the changing age structure of the population (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwz110F5">5</xref>B), though the gradient of the decrease has become more gradual since the mid-2000s. These results suggest that the change in age structure cannot fully explain the reduction in FOI.
