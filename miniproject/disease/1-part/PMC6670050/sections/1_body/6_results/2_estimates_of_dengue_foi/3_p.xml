<p>The observed and reconstructed prevalence rates, together with the reconstructed prevalence rates of 2009, 2013, and 2017, indicate that the prevalence rose marginally within a birth cohort over this time period (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwz110F4">4</xref>A). However, comparing residents of the same age in 2009, 2013, or 2017, the estimated prevalence for persons over age 23 years was lower in 2013 than that for their counterparts in 2009, and similar in 2017 as compared with 2013 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwz110F4">4</xref>B). This indicated that despite the endemicity of symptomatic dengue incidence in the community, the population level of immunity within any adult age group showed a decrease from 2009 to 2017.
