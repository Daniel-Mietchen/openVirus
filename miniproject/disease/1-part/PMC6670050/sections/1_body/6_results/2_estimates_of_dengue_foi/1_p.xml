<p>The Bayesian estimates of the FOI were above 0.10 per annum until the 1960s, peaking at 0.178 (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCrI): 0.068, 0.511) in 1940 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwz110F2">2</xref>A). The estimated FOI gradually declined over the next 2 decades and remained at basal levels of around 0.009 in 1993 (95% BCrI: 0.006, 0.013) and 2017 (95% BCrI: 0.005, 0.015). Similar trends in FOI estimates were observed in models generated using individual data sets from 2004, 2009, 2013, and 2017 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwz110F2">2</xref>B) appeared to correspond to the large outbreaks experienced in 2005 and 2007. The rate of degradation of antibody detection was estimated to be 0.003 per year (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the posterior distribution: 0.002, 0.004), which is lower than the 2015 estimate made by Imai et al. (
