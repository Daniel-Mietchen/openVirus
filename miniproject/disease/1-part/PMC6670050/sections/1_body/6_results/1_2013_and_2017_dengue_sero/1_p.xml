<p>Among the persons sampled (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3,813 in 2013; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4,002 in 2017), dengue IgG prevalence declined from 49.1% (1,874/3,813; 95% confidence interval (CI): 47.6, 50.7) in 2013 to 45.7% (1,828/4,002; 95% CI: 44.1, 47.2) in 2017. The age-weighted prevalences in 2013 and 2017 were 49.8% (95% CI: 48.4, 51.1) and 48.6% (95% CI: 47.0, 50.0), respectively. The prevalence of dengue IgG antibodies increased with age (Figure

Males were more likely to be seropositive than females (
