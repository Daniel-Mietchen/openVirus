<p>We derived posterior median values for the proportion of individuals having a positive IgG ELISA test result for every combination of age and serosurvey year. These were used as null values within binomial tests to highlight observations with a statistically significant deviation from the model (at a 5% significance level), and the proportion of statistically significant observations was then tabulated (

In addition, the agreement between the empirical and reconstructed dengue IgG seroprevalences for every combination of age and serosurvey year was visually inspected, where Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals were used to quantify uncertainty resulting from potentially small sample sizes for each individual age.
