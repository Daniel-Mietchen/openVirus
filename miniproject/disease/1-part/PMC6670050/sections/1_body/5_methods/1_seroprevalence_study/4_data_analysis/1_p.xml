<p>Only data on Singapore residents (citizens and permanent residents of Singapore; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3,813 in 2013 and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4,002 in 2017) were analyzed. Dengue IgG prevalence was weighted to adjust for age as previously described (
 <xref rid="kwz110C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to assess the significance of differences in seropositivity between groups. Prevalence ratios and 95% Wald confidence intervals were computed for each group as compared with the referent. A 2-sample 
 <italic>z</italic> test for equality of proportions with continuity correction was used to determine whether differences in dengue IgG prevalence between age groups in 2009 and 2013 were statistically significant. Statistical significance was defined as 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.
