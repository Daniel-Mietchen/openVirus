<p>To estimate the number of primary infections averted among Singapore residents in 2017 because of changes in the FOI, the posterior samples of age-specific seroprevalence in 2017 were obtained according to 4 hypothetical situations (FOI held fixed at the level of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s averages). In each situation, the difference between the age-specific seroprevalence based on the original FOI estimate and that obtained using the “frozen” hypothetical FOI was multiplied by the number of residents of each age in the year 2017. The total number of infections averted was multiplied by 2, taking into account the 1:1 ratio for primary:subsequent dengue infections (
