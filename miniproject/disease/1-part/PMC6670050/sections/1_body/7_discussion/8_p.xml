<p>Despite these limitations, this work highlights how dengue has evolved over time in Singapore and that a substantial proportion of children and young adults are susceptible to dengue infection. The sensitivity of the national notification system, which relies on diagnosed cases, may vary over time, and hence the magnitudes of epidemics are not comparable across calendar years. Our findings provide updated estimates of overall dengue transmission intensity and modeled primary infections averted that could help guide analyses of the potential impact of future disease interventions or vaccination programs.</p>
