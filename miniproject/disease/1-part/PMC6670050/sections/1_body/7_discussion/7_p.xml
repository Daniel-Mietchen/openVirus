<p>One limitation of this study was the use of residual sera from blood donors. To render the samples as representative of the Singapore resident population as possible, we adjusted for age. Analysis of the spatial distribution of the study subjects showed that they were representative of the resident population as a whole (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figure 4</xref>) and resided in the two most common types of housing in Singapore (public and private high-rise apartment buildings). We believe that the spatial distribution of risk in Singapore is probably more uniform than that in the majority of other dengue-endemic countries. This is supported by a previous serological study which indicated that housing type was not significantly associated with previous infection (
 <xref rid="kwz110C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and by the fact that incidence rates between these two common housing types are similar (
 <xref rid="kwz110C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Other evidence supporting our use of blood donors’ samples includes the similar seroprevalence results and FOI estimates obtained from this study as compared with those derived from the 2004 survey (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figure 1</xref>). Unfortunately, information on ethnicity was not collected, and thus we could not ascertain whether blood donors matched the population as a whole in this regard. Bias may have been introduced by the request that donors with recent (diagnosed) dengue or chikungunya virus infection defer their donation for 6 months (
 <xref rid="kwz110C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), which may have affected the 2013 estimates in particular, because of the large dengue outbreak that year. Lastly, the temporal FOI model was based on non–serotype-specific data, given the limitation of the IgG ELISA used in this study and most of the prevalence studies.
