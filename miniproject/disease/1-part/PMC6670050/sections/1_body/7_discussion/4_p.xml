 </inline-formula> to vector control, the decreases in transmission intensity may reflect both demographic changes that reduce transmission potential (a top-heavy age pyramid) and the intensive vector control program in Singapore, which has reduced mosquito breeding rates to very low levels. Our study has highlighted the importance of using seroprevalence data to evaluate the impact and efficacy of a vector control program and to estimate the number of potential cases averted. The measure “number of infections averted” has been widely applied in the evaluation of malaria disease control efforts in Africa (
