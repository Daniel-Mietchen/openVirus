  <p>Estimated annual dengue force of infection (FOI) in Singapore during the periods 1931–2017 (A) and 1990–2015 (B). An overall declining trend in FOI estimates was observed from 1931 to 2017 (A); however, the FOI estimates increased slightly from 1999 to 2008 and then decreased (B). Solid lines represent the point estimates, and shaded regions represent the 95% Bayesian credible intervals. The model was developed using 2004, 2009, 2013, and 2017 serosurvey data.</p>
