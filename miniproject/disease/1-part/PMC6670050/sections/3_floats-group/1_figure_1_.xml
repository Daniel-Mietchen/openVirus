  <p>Age-specific prevalence of dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) in serological samples collected in Singapore in 2013 (A) and 2017 (B). The presence of dengue IgG in the serum samples was determined using the Panbio Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA (Alere Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts). Confidence intervals (black bars) were constructed using Wald's method. Participants aged 66 years or more were combined into one group because of the small sample size. ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p>
