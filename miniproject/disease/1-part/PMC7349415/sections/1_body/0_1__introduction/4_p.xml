<p>The present document will not address or discuss the ways prior DENV infection (symptomatic or not) would have been assessed and determined. One will take as a starting point that prior infection did take place and was laboratory confirmed, thus leading to the decision to vaccinate. In this context, one could encounter different situations. The “easiest” one would correspond to a confirmed acute dengue fever: when can vaccination be performed after such an acute infection? When should the patient come back? However, it is likely that the actual date of infection cannot firmly be established in most instances. In this regard, the present document aims at guiding individual practitioners in making a decision on when to vaccinate. Our findings would, we believe, also be of interest to a broader audience, including health authorities establishing vaccine policies at the country level. These aspects will be discussed in
