<p>The present document presents a short summary of wild type dengue virus-induced responses and kinetics, and how they can interfere with live vaccine-induced immunity when vaccination is performed at different times after infection. We propose the following conclusions:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Innate and adaptive immune responses triggered by dengue wild type infection should have no impact on vaccine reactogenicity/safety, whichever the time vaccination is performed after infection</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Innate and adaptive immune responses triggered by dengue wild type infection may induce a “refractory period” during which vaccination efficacy could be limited or even absent
    <list list-type="simple">
     <list-item>
      <label>⚬</label>
      <p>To be fully efficient, primary vaccination should then not take place before 1 month post-infection, and preferably not before 6 months </p>
     </list-item>
     <list-item>
      <label>⚬</label>
      <p>Performing vaccination after 3 months could nevertheless provide some benefit</p>
     </list-item>
    </list>
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>If the actual date of infection is unknown, or if for practical reasons vaccination would be performed before this 6 month period of time (i.e., 3–5 months), this would not be an issue in the case of multidose vaccine schedules, in which doses are given 6 months apart, as the second dose would induce a proper and efficient immune response outside of the refractory period</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>In this regard, vaccinating before the start of rainy seasons would be a pragmatic approach to reduce the magnitude of epidemics</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Waiting for 6 months to start vaccination after wild-type infection would also not be an issue regarding induction of protection, as infection induces at least a 6 month to 1-year cross-protection</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
</p>
