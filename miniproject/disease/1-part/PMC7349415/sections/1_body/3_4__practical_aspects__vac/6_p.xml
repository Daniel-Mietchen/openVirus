<p>One can also discuss the possibility to vaccinate seropositive individuals at the very beginning of an outbreak, in order to protect them before any contact with the wild-type DENV. This could be beneficial, as protective responses would be triggered rapidly in primed individuals. However, if by chance vaccination would be performed during incubation or shortly after infection, this would mostly be inefficient as discussed in the above sections. Nonetheless, given the small likelihood of such coincidence, it should be emphasized that the negative impact on population level vaccine efficacy should remain limited. Nevertheless, while rapidly performing vaccination in such an outbreak situation could be possible, we suggest that vaccinating before the start of rainy seasons would be a more pragmatic approach to reduce the magnitude of epidemics.</p>
