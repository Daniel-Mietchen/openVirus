<p>We took as a starting point that prior dengue infection would have been laboratory-confirmed, whichever the way/tool used to get such confirmation. The above sections suggest that the time interval between wild-type dengue infection and vaccination can have a significant impact, but such an interval will be difficult to firmly establish in real life. As mentioned in Introduction, the “easiest” situation would correspond to a confirmed acute dengue infection, but most infections are asymptomatic, and, even when dengue infection could be suspected to have occurred at one given time, symptoms can be caused by other pathogens (e.g., malaria, flu, chikungunya, or more recently Zika): it is therefore likely that in the absence of confirmation at the time of infection, the actual date of dengue infection will be unknown in many cases.</p>
