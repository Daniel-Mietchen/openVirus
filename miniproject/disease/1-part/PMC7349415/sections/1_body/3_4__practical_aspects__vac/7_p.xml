<p>This being said, vaccinating in well-defined periods could be problematic with respect to the refractory period discussed in the previous sections; however, in the case of a multidose vaccine in which doses are given 6 months apart, if the first dose falls within the refractory period, the second dose should fall outside that period. This type of regimen may then ensure that proper immunization and associated benefit will take place whenever the vaccination is done, thus allowing this type of vaccine to be used during such well-defined programs and periods.</p>
