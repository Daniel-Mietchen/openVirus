<p>In this regard, situations could be different according to who is performing vaccination and where: private versus public sector/program, doctorâ€™s office, hospital, or school. Each of these scenarios would pose a different amount of room for flexibility. For instance, vaccination could be performed at least one month before the start of the rainy season in a given country/region, i.e., before dengue cases rise, thus during periods well-defined in advance, with little latitude to perform vaccinations outside these periods.</p>
