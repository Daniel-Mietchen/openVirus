<p>This proposed 6-month time interval between infection and vaccination (refractory period) is also supported by field studies (“grace period” of cross-protection), as well as by Sabin’s human challenge studies (see above). Therefore, while primary vaccine administration during the first month following infection could be totally inefficient because of the innate immune response, vaccinating within the first 6 months could also be of reduced value because of cross-neutralizing immune responses; vaccinating during the first three months would be rather inefficient, while vaccinating 4–6 months after infection should bring at least moderate benefit. Overall, while one cannot rule out a positive effect of early vaccine administration on B/T memory during this refractory period, it could nevertheless be more efficient to start vaccination from 6 months post-infection.</p>
