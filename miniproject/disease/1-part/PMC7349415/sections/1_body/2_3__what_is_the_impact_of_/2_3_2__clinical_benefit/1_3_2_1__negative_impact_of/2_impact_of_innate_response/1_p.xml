<p>As mentioned above, innate antiviral responses are present during the first days following infection and can still be detected after several weeks. They can thus impact negatively—and potentially totally block—the replicative vaccine take. Therefore, regardless of adaptive responses, a strong early innate response, if induced, would be able to fully prevent infection and further presentation of vaccine antigens to adaptive cells.</p>
