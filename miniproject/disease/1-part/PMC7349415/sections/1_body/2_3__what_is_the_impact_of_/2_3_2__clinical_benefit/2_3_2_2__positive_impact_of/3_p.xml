<p>This is can be due to a “booster” effect linked to previous immunity and memory (for a review see [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00174" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Different mechanisms could be linked to such a booster effect, such as induction of cross-reactive CD4+ cells supporting cross-reactive B cell responses, as seen between different flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00174" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and/or through a boosting effect linked to cross-reactive antibodies allowing a better vaccine take and infectivity. This has been seen for instance in subjects presenting a specific range of cross-reactive antibody titers from a prior inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccination and then developing enhanced Yellow Fever (YF) immunogenicity upon YF17D vaccination [
 <xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00174" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Regarding this latter mechanism, one has to consider however that only a limited range of cross-reactive antibody titers boost dengue or YF17D vaccine infection: at either end of the cross-reactive antibody spectrum, reduced vaccine infection and immunogenicity was observed [
