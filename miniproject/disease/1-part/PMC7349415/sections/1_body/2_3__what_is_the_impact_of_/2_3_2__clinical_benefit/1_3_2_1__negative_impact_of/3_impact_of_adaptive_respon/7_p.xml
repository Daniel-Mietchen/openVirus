<p>When considering vaccination after secondary infection, one can propose that, due to higher and broader pre-existing immunity, the refractory period could be longer. However, as discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-vaccines-08-00174">Section 4</xref> below, the problem of the refractory period should be mitigated by a multidose vaccine which injections are performed several months apart (e.g., â‰¥ 6 months), ensuring that even if the first dose falls into that period, subsequent dose(s) would fall out of it. Therefore, even following secondary infections, such a vaccine would ensure induction of some significant immunity with a likely benefit on B and T memory, allowing to boost and maintain it. Supporting such a vaccine benefit after secondary infection, it was observed that the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine efficacy against virologically confirmed dengue and hospitalization was similarly high in volunteers presenting a monotypic or a multitypic profile based on measured baseline dengue PRNT
 <sub>90</sub> assay; the former volunteers were considered to have experienced a single infection while the latter were considered to have experienced at least two infections [
