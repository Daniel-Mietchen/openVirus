<p>One specificity of CYD-TDV is that it possesses a yellow fever 17D (YF17D) backbone, and thus expresses NS antigens of yellow fever virus. Accordingly, while CYD-TDV is able to induce cellular responses against dengue structural antigens and then provides benefit against dengue infection, potent CD8+ responses are induced against the YF17D NS3 protein, with only limited cross-reactivity with Dengue NS3, at least upon immunization in na√Øve volunteers [

Therefore, when considering the potential negative impact of dengue-specific cellular responses on CYD-TDV, one could propose that this impact would be more limited, because of the heterologous nature of the YF17D NS antigens, which are the dominant targets of CD8+ responses.
