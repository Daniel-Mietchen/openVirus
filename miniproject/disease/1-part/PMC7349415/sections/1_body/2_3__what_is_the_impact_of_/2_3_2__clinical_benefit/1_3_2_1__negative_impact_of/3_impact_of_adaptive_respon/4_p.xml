<p>As mentioned above, one needs to distinguish between sterilizing immunity and immunity allowing some viral replication and then further immune stimulation: following wild type infection with a given serotype, sterilizing immunity may more likely occur against the homotypic serotype present in the vaccine, while leaving more room to the other serotypes to replicate and trigger immune responses. Such sterilizing immunity against the prior infecting serotype would however not be an issue with regards to protection, as homotypic protection afforded by wild type infection is proposed to be life-long in most cases.</p>
