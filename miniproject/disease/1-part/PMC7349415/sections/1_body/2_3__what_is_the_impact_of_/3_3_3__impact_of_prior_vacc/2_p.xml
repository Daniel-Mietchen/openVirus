<p>Information in this regard is more limited, but one trial showed no negative impact of prior immunity induced within a short interval of time by the YF17D vaccine on a Japanese encephalitis chimeric vaccine (JE-CV, using as CYD-TDV a YF17D backbone), and vice versa [
 <xref rid="B40-vaccines-08-00174" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Different combinations were tested: YF17D followed by JE-CV 30 days later, JE-CV followed by YF17D 30 days later, or co-administration of JE-CV and YF17D, and none of these combinations significantly impacted in one or the other way induced responses. Similarly, co-administration of YF17D and CYD-TDV did not result in negative interferences at the serological level [

 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-08-00174" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This study was conducted across ten phase II and six phase III trials undertaken with the CYD dengue vaccine in endemic and non-endemic countries. After ruling out all dengue seropositive participants, the number of vaccines who were dengue seronegative but seropositive for either JE or YF at baseline was limited. Consequently, a potential increase in dengue immune response because of prior exposure to these flaviviruses could not be clearly established nor ruled out. Information was also lacking in most cases regarding time intervals between the two vaccinations.
