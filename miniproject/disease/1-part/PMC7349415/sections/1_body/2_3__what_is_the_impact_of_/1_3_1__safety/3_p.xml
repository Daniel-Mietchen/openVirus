<p>Regarding overall reactogenicity in the field, pooled safety data were analyzed from 18 phase I, II and III clinical trials in which the dengue vaccine was administered to participants aged 2â€“60 years, including long-term safety follow-up in three efficacy trials. It was shown that baseline dengue virus serostatus did not influence the safety profile of the vaccine nor vaccine viremia [
