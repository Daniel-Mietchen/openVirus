<p>Antibody responses induced by secondary infections (homologous or heterologous) present differences in kinetics, magnitude, quality, and specificity as compared to those after primary infection. IgG responses are induced faster and at higher levels following a secondary compared to primary infection; responses rise dramatically over an approximately 2-week period after secondary dengue. On the other hand, IgM response are usually lower in secondary infections [

Regarding antibody specificity, secondary responses induced by heterologous serotypes present a high proportion of cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes different from those targeted after primary infection, resulting in higher affinity responses [
