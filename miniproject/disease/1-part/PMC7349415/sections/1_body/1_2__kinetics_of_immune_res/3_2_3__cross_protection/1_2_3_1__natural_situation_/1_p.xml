<p>Immunity induced by primary infection is believed to induce life-long protection against the infecting serotype (homotypic protection); a small number of homotypic re-infections have been documented [

 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00174" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the other hand, cross-protection (heterotypic protection) following a primary infection may last from several months to up to 3 years (more generally from 6 months to 2 years), corresponding to a transient protective “honeymoon” or “grace” period [

 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-08-00174" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which in the present document will be referred to as a “refractory period” regarding subsequent vaccination. This period is followed by a period of higher susceptibility to severe disease; as mentioned above, as cross-reactive responses decline over time along with the potential for cross-protection.
