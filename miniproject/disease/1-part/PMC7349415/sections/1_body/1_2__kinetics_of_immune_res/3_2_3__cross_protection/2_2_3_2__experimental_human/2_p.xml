<p>Sabin and colleagues completed a series of experiments during the World War II era [

 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00174" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. With respect to the present question—how long a prior infection can block a subsequent live infection/vaccination—Sabin’s work reanalyzed by Snow et al. brings relevant information. Subjects primarily infected with either DENV-1 or DENV-2 were then secondarily ‘cross-infected’ at various timepoints with either DENV-2 or DENV-1 respectively, and their signs and symptoms of dengue disease were followed. The data showed self-limiting fever in subjects who received their secondary infection 4 months or later after the primary infection, while secondary challenge performed within shorter time intervals did not trigger clinical infection, except for one case with moderate fever. Significant limitations exist however in Sabin’s study. In particular, the lack of tools to titrate the viral inoculum and measure the antibody response to infection—the size of the inoculum may indeed impact in one way or another the magnitude of innate responses and subsequent adaptive ones. The method of virus delivery (i.e., mosquito versus needle) could also impact infection outcome. Nevertheless, Sabin’s data, as observed for natural infections in the field, further show that a “refractory period”, lasting at least several months, follows DENV infection.
