<p>Innate responses represent the first line of defense and particularly involve monocytes, macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells, the latter being critical antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the initiation of primary responses. Infection also impacts additional arms of the innate immune system, triggering the expression of a wide array of pro-inflammatory (or anti-inflammatory) cytokines and chemokines, which level and kinetics will shape the outcome of the disease and of subsequent adaptive responses (for reviews see [
