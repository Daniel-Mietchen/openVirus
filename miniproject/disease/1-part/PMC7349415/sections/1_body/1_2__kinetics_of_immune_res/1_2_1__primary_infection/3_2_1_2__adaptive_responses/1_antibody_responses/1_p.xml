<p>Upon primary infection, IgM antibodies appear first, between day 3–10 of illness; IgM levels peak about 2 weeks after the onset of fever and then generally decline to undetectable levels over the next 2–6 months. Dengue-specific IgG responses can already be detected by day 7 of illness and then slowly increase. Antibodies can be both specific to the infecting serotype and cross-neutralizing. It appears, however, that cross-reactive antibodies may decline faster than serotype-specific ones; it was observed that after primary infection children developed serotype–cross-neutralizing antibody responses that narrowed to a single serotype over a 12-month period [
