<p>While the kinetics of DENV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are not as well characterized as anti-DENV antibodies, such responses triggered in parallel to B cell responses can play a beneficial role in recovery, depending on their specificity and profile. The main targets of anti-dengue CD8+ cells are nonstructural (NS) proteins, while both CD4+ and CD8+ responses can be directed against structural proteins and also play a role in protection/recovery (for reviews see [
