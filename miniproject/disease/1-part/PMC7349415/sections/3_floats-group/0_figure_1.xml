  <p>Upon primary wild type dengue infection, innate responses develop early and peak during the first week following onset of fever, while some responses can persist for several weeks. Dengue specific IgM responses develop first, followed by IgG. IgM responses usually wane after two months and IgG responses persist a longer time, while cross-reactive responses wane more rapidly. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are also triggered during the early phase of infection, and T/B cell memory is then established. Induced responses support cross-protection (see below), which can last up to 3 years (more generally 6 months to 2 years). d: day; mo: month; y: year; wt: wild type.</p>
