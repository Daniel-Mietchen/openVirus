  <p>Upon secondary heterologous wild type dengue infection, innate responses develop early as after primary infection, but may present higher levels and a more inflammatory profile. Dengue specific IgM responses still develop, possibly at lower levels than after primary infection. IgG responses are triggered/boosted earlier than upon primary infection and reach higher levels. Of importance, cross-reactive responses raise to higher levels too, also presenting some higher affinity and different specificity. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are also triggered/boosted, and as for IgG responses present a broader specificity. These responses then support longer and more efficient cross-protection. d: day; mo: month; y: year; wt: wild type.</p>
