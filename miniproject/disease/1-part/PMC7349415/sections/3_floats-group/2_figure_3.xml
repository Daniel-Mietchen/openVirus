  <p>Wild type infection-induced responses will install a “refractory period” during which they would block or lower live-attenuated vaccine take and subsequent immunity/efficacy. Innate response would totally block any vaccine replication should it be given during the initial steps of infection, but IgM/IgG and T cell responses could still hamper vaccine take during the following weeks and months. When wild type-induced responses wane—cross-reactive responses in first place—this leaves more room for live vaccines to establish proper immunity, and they can even enhance it.</p>
