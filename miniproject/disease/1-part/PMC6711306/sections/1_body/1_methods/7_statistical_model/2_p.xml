<p>We used a boosted regression tree [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] to understand any potential gaps in the mechanistic model and its relationship to environmental and human population covariates. As predictors of yellow fever spillover in the boosted regression tree, we included the following covariates for each municipality-month: current and one-month lagged maximum predicted environmental risk, current and one-month lagged fire area, average and maximum number of primate species, estimated municipality vaccine coverage, average human population density, average monthly air temperature, average monthly precipitation, phenomenological primate dynamics, region and month (electronic supplementary material, table S6). Each observation is a municipality-month and the response variable is the binary indicator of whether or not yellow fever spillover occurred in a municipality-month (see Methods: Model–data comparison (§2d)). While some of predictor covariates contribute to the environmental risk metric (i.e., air temperature, rainfall and primate reservoir ranges), we also included them in the boosted regression tree analysis to identify whether the environmental covariates have any predictive power beyond their role in the mechanistic model, which could indicate that the mechanistic model does not fully capture their influence on spillover. We included fire area as a proxy for land conversion [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We also included vaccine coverage and human population density despite their poor predictive performance in the mechanistic model to identify whether these human population factors are predictive of spillover in ways not previously hypothesized, and therefore not captured in the mechanistic model. Boosted regression trees repeatedly fitted regression trees, which created multiple binary splits in the dataset based on predictor variables. Each successive tree was fitted to the residuals of the previous best model. The model was then updated to include the next tree [
