<p>We compared municipality means and maxima for all four risk metrics with human yellow fever data for model evaluation in the following three ways. First, for each modelled risk metric and each municipality summary statistic (mean and maximum), we fitted a logistic regression of spillover probability as a function of model-predicted risk (electronic supplementary material, table S4) using glm in R [

Second, we calculated a receiver operating characteristic curve to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), a measure of goodness of fit, for each modelled risk metric and municipality summary statistic (electronic supplementary material, table S4). As this analysis focuses on prediction of spillover as a way to compare hypothesized mechanisms, comparison of AUC values with a null model is beyond the scope of this paper. Finally, for all eight mechanistic predictions and estimated vaccine coverage, we regressed the number of reported yellow fever cases given that spillover occurred, and calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficient with number of reported cases to consider nonlinear but monotonic associations (electronic supplementary material, table S5).
