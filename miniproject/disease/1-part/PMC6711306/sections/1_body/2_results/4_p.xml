<p>Mechanistic model estimates matched seasonal variation in spillover, and accurately captured differences in seasonality by region (

The seasonal regional correlation between number of municipality-months with spillover and average environmental risk was highest in the Southeast (0.77), followed by the South (0.61), Central- West (0.58) and North (0.42) regions. The periodic risk matched interannual variation in spillover (

 <italic>c</italic>), an unsurprising finding given periodic risk incorporated phenomenological primate dynamics derived from human cases of spillover. Interannual regional correlations were weaker than seasonal correlations but similarly highest in the Southeast (0.54), followed by the Central-West (0.45), North (0.21) and South (0.13) regions.
