<p>The environmental risk model strongly predicted episodes of yellow fever spillover into humans (AUC = 0.72) and adding phenomenological reservoir infection dynamics in periodic risk further improved the model (AUC = 0.79; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F3">figure 3</xref>). Surprisingly, models that included human vaccination coverage and human population size performed worse than the environment-driven models (AUC = 0.64 and 0.64; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F3">figure 3</xref>). For all risk metrics, maximum value in the municipality-month was a better predictor of spillover than mean value (

Logistic regressions of spillover probability as a function of model-predicted risk showed similar patterns in Akaike information criterion (AIC) values (electronic supplementary material, table S4). Model-predicted environmental (mean and maximum), periodic (mean and maximum) and immunological (maximum) risk metrics were statistically significant predictors of spillover probability at the 5% level after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (electronic supplementary material, table S4; [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]). By contrast, given that spillover occurred, none of the eight mechanistic model risk summaries (maximum and mean of the four risk metrics) was a statistically significant predictor of number of cases, nor was estimated vaccine coverage (electronic supplementary material, table S5). In Spearman's rank correlations, we find that of the independent predictors, vaccine coverage is most correlated with risk, followed by maximum environmental risk, although these correlations are weak (electronic supplementary material, table S5).
