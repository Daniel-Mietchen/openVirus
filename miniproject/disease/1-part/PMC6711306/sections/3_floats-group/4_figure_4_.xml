  <p>Modelled environmental risk captures seasonal variation and periodic risk captures interannual variation in spillover. Each coloured line is the seasonal average of modelled maximum environmental risk in a municipality (
   <italic>a</italic>) and the yearly average of modelled maximum periodic risk in a municipality (
   <italic>c</italic>). White lines are the regional average over the municipal curves. Black points represent the total number of municipality-months with spillover in that region per month (
   <italic>a</italic>) and per year (
   <italic>c</italic>), or the municipalities with at least one month with spillover (
   <italic>b</italic>). Correlations between regional average environmental risk (white lines) and regional number of municipality-months with spillover (black points) are shown in parentheses (
   <italic>a</italic>,
   <italic>c</italic>) for regions where spillover has occurred (all except the Northeast). Regions of Brazil are shown with corresponding colours (
   <italic>b</italic>). The Southeast (shown in blue) was the region with the majority of cases during the large outbreaks in 2016â€“2018. (Online version in colour.)
