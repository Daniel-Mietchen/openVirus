<p id="Par6">The aim of the present study was to evaluate the applicability of CAP for inactivation of viruses in water from closed irrigation systems. We chose PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> as the model virus because of its demonstrated water transmissibility and economic relevance. We showed that CAP can inactivate high concentrations of PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> in nutrient solution after only 1Â min of treatment and suggested that the inactivation is mainly mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species.
