<p id="Par2">The availability of clean water is in continued decline due to the increasing global population and food demand, along with higher standards of living and climate change (WWAP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>). Water scarcity has an important impact on the environment as it affects aquatic organisms, groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems as well as plants and humans (Pfister et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>). Over the past 4Â years, water scarcity has been regarded as one of the highest global risks, in terms of its potential impact on humanity (World Economic Forum

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>). This makes agriculture a major environmental burden in terms of water use (Ridoutt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>). To tackle this important global problem, closed irrigation systems that recycle water, such as hydroponic systems, are becoming more common. However, such systems can serve as a route for efficient and rapid transmission of pathogens in case of water source contamination. Plant pathogens can reduce seed germination, affect the yield and even destroy entire crops (Syed Ab Rahman et al.
