<p id="Par4">Removal of viruses from irrigation systems is possible, but typically used methods can be expensive [membrane filtration, heating, ultraviolet (UV) light, ozonation], time consuming (slow filtration), require large infrastructure (slow filtration, heat), frequent maintenance (slow filtration, UV light, ozonation), produce undesirable side components (chlorination, ozonation), or need additional decontamination steps (some types of slow filtration, UV light) (Stewart-Wade 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>). The greatest weakness of all chemical processes for water decontamination is the generation of toxic by-products as well as production, transport and handling of large amounts of dangerous decontaminants. The main limitation of physical methods is that they are effective only in water areas that are in the close proximity of the operating device (Kraft 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>). Of all the disinfection methods, only thermal disinfection has been proven to be suitable for inactivation of plant viruses in hydroponic production systems (Bandte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). Thus it is extremely important to develop and implement efficient and environmentally friendly approaches for water decontamination that do not require toxic chemicals and can be scaled up. One of the technologies that might fulfill these requirements is cold atmospheric plasma (CAP).
