<p id="Par10">For isolation of the pure viruses, PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup>-infected tobacco and potato tissues from plants grown in the soil were prepared by grinding them in chilled (to 4 °C) grinding buffer. PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> was then purified using either a standard purification method that included saccharose and CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation (low concentration pure virus) or convective interaction media (CIM) monolithic chromatography (high concentration pure virus) (Rupar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). We added the low concentration pure virus particles to 10 mL nutrient solution and then either left the sample untreated (positive controls) or treated it with simple magnetic stirring (control treatment), gas treatment (control treatment with the gas mixture used for CAP production, but in the absence of CAP), H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (control treatment, various concentrations and times), or CAP (various times). The high concentration pure virus particles stayed untreated (positive control) or underwent CAP treatments (various times).
