 <caption>
  <p>The estimated daily milk change (Kg) per cow in 4 dairy cattle farms in Israel, during a 30-day period after vaccination. Linear mixed effects model was fitted to the milk production gaps (MPG) for each cow with distance from vaccination day (DIV) as a fixed variable and the farm as a random variable. This was performed separately for lactation group 1 (Lac 1-naive), lactation group 2 (Lac 2-mixed: na√Øve and vaccinated), lactation group &gt;2 (Lac &gt; 2-vaccinated), and all lactations groups combined (All lactations). For specific details on the model, see text.</p>
