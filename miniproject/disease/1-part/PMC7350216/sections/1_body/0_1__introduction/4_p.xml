<p>Several attenuated vaccines are used to date against LSD and generated by passaging isolated viruses serially in tissue culture and/or eggs until attenuation is achieved [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These vaccines can be divided to heterologous vaccines, based either on Sheep-pox or Goat-pox virus or homologous vaccines based on attenuated LSD virus [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are currently three companies in South Africa that produce LSDV homologous vaccines. Two companies are using vaccines containing cell-adapted strains of the original LSDV Neethling strain (LSD Vaccine for Cattle, Onderstepoort Biological Products; OBP, South Africa and Bovivax, MCI Sant√® Animale, Morocco). The third company is using an attenuated South African LSDV field isolate (Lumpyvax, MSD Animal Health-Intervet, South Africa) [

 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some challenge studies showed the efficacy of heterologous (mainly goat-pox based) vaccines [

 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, to date, no controlled field study was performed to evaluate their efficacy. The same is true for the homologous Kenyan goat and sheep pox (KGSP) vaccine, which was also associated with severe adverse effects when used in Israel [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The only vaccine for which field-controlled data exist is a homologous vaccine, based on an attenuated Neethling LSD strain. This vaccine was successfully used for controlling the LSD epidemics in Israel and the Balkans, where its efficacy (relative to RM65 Sheep-pox live attenuated vaccine administered at the same dose as the Neethling vaccine) and effectiveness were estimated at 76.6% and 79.8% (on average), respectively [

 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During the efficacy study conducted in Israel a self-limiting Neethling associated disease was observed in 0.38% of the vaccinated cows [
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This phenomenon was characterized by the appearance of small nodules up to two weeks after vaccination and was associated with isolation of the Neethling strain from the affected cows. Since then, several research groups reported on adverse effects associated with Neethling vaccination, mainly edema at the injection site, generalized skin nodules, and decrease in milk production [

 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, these studies were non-controlled and suffered from limited sample size.
