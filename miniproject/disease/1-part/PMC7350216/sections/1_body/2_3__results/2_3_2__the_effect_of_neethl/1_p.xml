<p>No significant difference in in-farm mortality and immediate culling was demonstrated between the pre and post vaccination periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00324-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, LogRank 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.3). The same results were observed in the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, after controlling for DIM and lactation group (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00324-f005">Figure 5</xref>b, LogRank 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.02). However, it should be noted that the survival curves cross each other, indicating on possible interaction with time. Multivariable analysis could not be performed for this outcome due to failure to comply with the proportional hazards assumption.
