<p>Analysis of milk production following Neethling vaccination on farms with naïve cows shows a similar pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00324-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Milk production, during the 30 days post vaccination, in lactation groups 1, 2, &gt;2, and combined shows no significant reduction except for day 2 and day 21 after vaccination. Notably, this milk reduction is lowest among the lactation 1 group (i.e., first vaccination naïve group) (
