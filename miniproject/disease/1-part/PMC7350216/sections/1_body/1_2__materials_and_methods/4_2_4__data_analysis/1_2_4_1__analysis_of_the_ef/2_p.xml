<p>The residuals of daily milk were retrieved from the results of this model and were used for further analysis of milk loss. The average of the daily milk production residuals for the 30 days prior vaccination of each cow was subtracted from the daily milk residual, beginning at vaccination day (day 0) until 30 days post vaccination. This milk production gap (MPG) was used to analyze reduction in milk production after vaccination. As detailed in
