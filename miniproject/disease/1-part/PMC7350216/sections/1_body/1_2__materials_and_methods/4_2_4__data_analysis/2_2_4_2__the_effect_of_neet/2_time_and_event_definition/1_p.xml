<p>Separate analysis was performed for two event definitions: 1. Any type of exit from the farm, i.e., death in the farm, urgent culling, and routine culling. 2. Only unexpected culling, i.e., death in the farm and urgent culling. When this second event definition was analyzed routine culling was treated as right censoring. All cows were censored at day 60 of follow-up of the relevant period.</p>
