<p>Based on previous data [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], there are several suggested mechanisms underlying adverse reactions to vaccines. The main two mechanisms are: 1. Short-term direct response to the vaccination itself. 2. Development of a disease due to infection by the vaccine attenuated virus. We therefore hypothesized that the effect of vaccine on milk production will be differentiated to four periods based on the day since vaccination (DIV): DIV 0 (at day 0), DIV 1–7 (days 1–7), DIV 8–14, DIV 15–30. In addition, in order to see the overall change during 30 days after vaccination, we fitted another model, including only two DIV categories: DIV 0 and DIV 1–30 (days 1–30).
