<p>A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to the data to control for DIM and lactation. Cows were classified to three groups according to their lactation (as described for the milk production analysis). Lactation was included in the model as a fixed nominal variable. DIM at the day of follow-up onset was defined according to the last calving occurring before the follow-up period. Cows were then divided to four (1–4) categories according to their DIM (0 ≤ DIM ≤ 90, 91 ≤ DIM ≤ 180, 181 ≤ DIM ≤ 270, 271 ≤ DIM, respectively). This DIM category was included as a fixed nominal factor in the model. All two-way interactions were tested for statistical significance.</p>
