<p>No significant milk loss was documented during the entire month period post vaccination. Katsoulos et al. and Bedekovic et al. demonstrated viremia from 5 up to 21 days post vaccination [

However, this phenomenon was reported only in 0.38–0.6% of the vaccinated cows and was mostly of mild nature [
