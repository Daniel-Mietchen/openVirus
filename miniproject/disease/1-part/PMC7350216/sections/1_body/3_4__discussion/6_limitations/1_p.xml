<p>Due to the retrospective nature of this study, we could not test directly the immune response elicited by this vaccine. However, evidence for the protective immunity elicited by the used vaccine batches is provided by the fact that in an epidemic, which occurred shortly after the study period, no cases of LSD occurred in vaccinated cows. The main limitation of this study is that it does not deal with specific adverse effects, such as abortions. This was impossible in this study due to wide and unspecific definition of abortion in the Israeli dairy farm. It should be mentioned, however, that the basic argument regarding potential association of abortions with the disease itself or with vaccination is anecdotal and was never proved. A controlled large-scale study to examine this potential association is therefore warranted. Future research could also be performed in order to analyze the influence of vaccination on conception rate. In addition, as we mentioned, the sample size for measuring adverse effects in na√Øve cows was small. Though it supports no association with previous vaccination, a larger study examining this question is warranted. Lastly, one might argue that the results of the study are relevant only to highly industrialized zero grazing dairy milk farms and not to smaller farms which are sometimes managed poorly. Though this may be a valid claim, we believe that the highly productive cow in industrialized farms is regularly in much higher stress than cattle reared at smaller farms. We therefore suspect that, if no vaccination associated adverse reduction in survival and milk production were observed in the current study, then such adverse effects in smaller farms are even less plausible.</p>
