<p>Another concern related to vaccination is the occurrence of severe adverse events. These events usually occur in very small numbers both in humans [

Any type of exit from the herd, i.e., death in the farm, urgent culling, and routine culling. 2. Only unexpected culling, i.e., death and urgent culling. This separate analysis was performed in order to examine vaccination effect, not just mortality, but also on routine culling. Both univariable and multivariable (controlled for DIM and lactation) survival analysis show that there is no significant difference in mortality and routine culling rate between the pre- and post-vaccination periods.
