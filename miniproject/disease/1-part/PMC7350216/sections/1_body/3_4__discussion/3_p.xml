<p>Our findings are opposed to the findings of Abutarbush et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Katsoulos et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], who described significant reduction of up to 5.5–16% in milk production for a period of up to several weeks post vaccination. These studies, however, suffer from a very small sample size of only one herd for the quantitative analysis. In addition, these studies do not incorporate variance in the cow level as they are based on milk quantification at the tank level and are not controlled. With the normal daily fluctuations in milk yield and the significant covariates that are not controlled for (e.g., days in milk and lactation group), such methodology cannot be accepted. Furthermore, while Katsoulos et al. studied vaccination by a commercial LSDV vaccine, in Abutarbush et al.’s study, the type of vaccine administered is not known as at that time farmers in Jordan used two vaccines, one of which was unlabeled and was later identified as a strain of LSDV.
