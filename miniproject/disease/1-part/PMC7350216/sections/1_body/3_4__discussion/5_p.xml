<p>One may argue that incidence of adverse events after vaccination might differ between na誰ve and previously vaccinated animals [
 <xref rid="B29-vaccines-08-00324" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Most of the farmers who vaccinated their herds in 2019, vaccinated them routinely in previous years. Therefore, only four farms were adequate for examining the influence of vaccination on na誰ve cows. From these four farms, only cows from lactation group 1 were na誰ve to LSD vaccination with high certainty. The sample size for examining this question is therefore small. However, this analysis shows that milk loss after vaccination in all lactation groups was similarly minimal and short with even less significant change in na誰ve cows. Interestingly, we also noticed a short and significant milk loss on day 21 post vaccination. It might suggest an adverse event related to clinical infection by the attenuated virus. However, the short duration of the milk production reduction and the fact that it is most prominent in previously vaccinated cows suggest that it might be related to a coincidental occurrence of another stressful event during the post vaccination period. Such an event could incidentally be more significant in the higher lactation groups, thus causing excessive reduction in milk production compared to the first lactation groups. Occurrence of severe adverse events could not be tested in this sample due to the rarity of these events and the small sample size.
