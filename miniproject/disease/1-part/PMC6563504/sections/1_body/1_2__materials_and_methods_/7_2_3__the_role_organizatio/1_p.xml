<p>Given a fixed point 
 <italic>x</italic> of an ODE describing a reaction system, the set of species with strictly positive concentrations in 
 <italic>x</italic> is an organization. This is shown in [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This in turn means that, if a subset of species is not an organization, then the system does not have a fixed point with exactly the chosen subset of species. This is not only true for fixed points but also for other attractors [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Attractors are those states that a system approaches in the long-run and once reached never leaves anymore. Besides converging towards a fixed point, the long-term behavior can be also periodic oscillations or chaotic trajectories. In particular, it was shown that the long-term behavior of the system always tends at least to one organization [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, organizations rule the long-term behavior of such dynamical reaction system. Note that the case of a system tending towards a fixed point is included in this statement as a special case. For example, the 
 <italic>simulation</italic> results of the Baccam model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f002">Figure 2</xref>a and Ref. [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) suggest that after about two to three days the species begin to decay to finally arrive in an organization namely the empty set.
