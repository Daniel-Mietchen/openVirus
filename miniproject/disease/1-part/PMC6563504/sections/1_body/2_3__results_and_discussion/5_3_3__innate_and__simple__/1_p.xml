<p>The Pawelek Model [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] contains 11 parameters and was designed to fit in vivo experimental data of horses [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The model has five variables and nine reactions. Like the basic Baccam Model, it contains uninfected target cells (
 <italic>T</italic>), infected cells (
 <italic>I</italic>), and viruses (
 <italic>V</italic>). Furthermore, there are two new species: interferon (
 <italic>F</italic>) and uninfected cells that are refractory to infections (
 <italic>R</italic>) because of the antiviral effect induced by interferons.
