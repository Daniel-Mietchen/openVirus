<p>Even though we have more species and more reactions, we get the same small pattern of organizations as in the basic Baccam Model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). Both models have in common that there is no self-replication of target cells. This might be one reason for the missing of other and bigger organizations which could contain species related to infection and/or immune response. This in turn means that, like the Baccam Model, this model implicitly treats infections and immune responses as phenomena that can only appear in a limited (transient) time span. The Hasse diagram of organizations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f005">Figure 5</xref>b) tells us that the system necessarily tends towards a state of healthiness, which is represented by the organizations
