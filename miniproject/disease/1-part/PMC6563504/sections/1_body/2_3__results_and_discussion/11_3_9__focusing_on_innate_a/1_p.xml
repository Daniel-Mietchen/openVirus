<p>The Hancioglu Model [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] contains 28 parameters, 10 variables, and 44 reactions. It has not been mathematically fitted to data but has been designed to meet specific general criteria [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The ODEs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f012">Figure 12</xref>a) describe the dynamics of the following 10 species: viruses (
 <italic>V</italic>), healthy cells (
 <italic>H</italic>), infected cells (
 <italic>I</italic>), interferon (
 <italic>F</italic>) and resistant cells (
 <italic>R</italic>). The remaining species are new: antigen presenting cells (
 <italic>M</italic>), effector cells (
 <italic>E</italic>), plasma cells (
 <italic>P</italic>) antibodies (
 <italic>A</italic>) and antigenic distance (
 <italic>S</italic>). There are no species for an eclipse phase in this model.
