<p>The models by Miao et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] are designed to fit experimental in vivo data from mice [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The first one ([
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1-viruses-11-00449">1</xref>)) depends on measured time-series. The second one ([
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2-viruses-11-00449">2</xref>)) is a simplified version of the first one, neglecting the terms depending on those time-series and still leading to a good fit within the first five days after infection [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, we analyze this second model (Miao Model).
