<p>The Lee Model [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] is the most complex model considered here. It contains 48 parameters and was designed with respect to experimental in vivo data from mice [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has 15 variables and 37 reactions (
