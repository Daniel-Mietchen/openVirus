<p>By looking at the hierarchy of models, it becomes evident that there is space for more models. Above the Smith and Handel Model, there could be one in which virus infection as well as bacterial coinfection can be simultaneously persistent (“fully persistent models” denote such hypothetical models in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f015">Figure 15</xref>). Another extreme case would be a “fully-transient model” in which we have only transient dynamics and all species would finally tend to zero. Such a model would be the smallest one in our partial order of models (
