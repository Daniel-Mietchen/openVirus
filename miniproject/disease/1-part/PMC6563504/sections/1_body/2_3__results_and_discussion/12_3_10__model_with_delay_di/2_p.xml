<p>Note that this is by far the oldest model analyzed here. The names of the variables are a bit particular when compared to those of the previously analyzed models. As in all the other models, we have viruses

 <italic>m</italic> as in the Handel Model. All other species belong to the immune response. Note that only in this model there is no state variable for uninfected, healthy cells. Bocharov et al. represent these healthy cells implicitly by subtracting the amounts of infected-cells 
 <italic>C</italic> and destroyed epithelial cells 
 <italic>m</italic> from the initial total amount of target epithelial cells
