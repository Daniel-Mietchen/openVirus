<p>Here, we present an approach to understand the overall structure of these models that allows them to be related to each other in a simple way. To this end, we apply chemical organization theory [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to obtain a hierarchical decomposition of each model into chemical organizations. A chemical organization is a sub-set of species (i.e., dimensions or model components, like, uninfected cells or viruses) that cannot generate any other species (property of closure) and that can self-maintain its own species, i.e., any species consumed by a process within the organization can be regenerated by a process within the organization. The organizations of an ODE model are rigorously related to its long-term dynamics in the following way: Given a stationary state of the ODE model, the set of species with strictly positive concentrations must be an organization [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Note that the advantage of this approach is that decomposition into organizations is based solely on the model structure (i.e., reaction rules) and thus is independent of kinetic details, like rate constants. The relation between measured data, ODE model, and organizations is depicted in
