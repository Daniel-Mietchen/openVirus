<p>In addition, our approach is not limited to IAV models, but can be directly applied to other viruses in the same way since their dynamics are similarly modeled by ODEs [

Another task for future work would be to study the transient virus immune system in more detail, for example, by mapping the basin of attraction of each organization or by systematically analyzing the transition dynamics in-between organizations [
