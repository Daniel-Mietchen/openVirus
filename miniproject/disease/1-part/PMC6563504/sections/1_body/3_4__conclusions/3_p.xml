<p>By deriving an organizational signature from a modelâ€™s organizations, we obtained a novel classification scheme and a hierarchy of models with respect to their qualitative long-term behavior. Although the classification via organizational signature is quite coarse-grained, the analysis revealed still a high diversity of models. That is, the models have different potentiality with respect to which variables persist in the long turn and which vanish. Furthermore, the hierarchy map of models contains various empty territories, suggesting space for potential future models.</p>
