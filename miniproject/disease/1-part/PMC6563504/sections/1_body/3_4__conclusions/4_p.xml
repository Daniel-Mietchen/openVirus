<p>We envision as a practical use that our method and results can help to select the right model for a particular situation, to relate other models to the present ones, to obtain an overview of the potential long-term dynamics of complex models, and to support model development, for example, by providing a rapid consistency check. Note that measured long-term as well as transient data can be explained with respect to organizations, by defining a projection from a system state to an organization, as demonstrated for the Handel model (
