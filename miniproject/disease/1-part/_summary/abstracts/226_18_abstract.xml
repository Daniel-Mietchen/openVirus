 <p>Influenza A virus (IAV) causes annual epidemics of respiratory disease in humans, often complicated by secondary coinfection with bacterial pathogens such as 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content>. Here, we report that the 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> secreted protein lipase 1 enhances IAV replication 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> in primary cells, including human lung fibroblasts. The proviral activity of lipase 1 is dependent on its enzymatic function, acts late in the viral life cycle, and results in increased infectivity through positive modulation of virus budding. Furthermore, the proviral effect of lipase 1 on IAV is exhibited during 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> infection of embryonated henâ€™s eggs and, importantly, increases the yield of a vaccine strain of IAV by approximately 5-fold. Thus, we have identified the first 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> protein to enhance IAV replication, suggesting a potential role in coinfection. Importantly, this activity may be harnessed to address global shortages of influenza vaccines.
