 <title>Summary</title>
 <p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause oral or genital ulcerative lesions and even encephalitis in various age groups with high infection rates. More seriously, HSV may lead to a wide range of recurrent diseases throughout a lifetime. No vaccines against HSV are currently available. The accumulated clinical research data for HSV vaccines reveal that the effects of HSV interacting with the host, especially the host immune system, may be important for the development of HSV vaccines. HSV vaccine development remains a major challenge. Thus, we focus on the research data regarding the interactions of HSV and host immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, and the related signal transduction pathways involved in immune evasion and cytokine production. The aim is to explore possible strategies to develop new effective HSV vaccines.</p>
