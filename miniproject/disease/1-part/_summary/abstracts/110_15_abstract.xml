 <p>The circulation of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) throughout the Pacific is no exception in French Polynesia (FP). We review here the mosquito vectors involved or potentially involved in the transmission of arboviruses in FP. We highlight 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Aedes polynesiensis</italic>; species that are widely distributed in FP and whose ability to transmit dengue, zika and chikungunya viruses is well known. In addition, we discuss the contribution of those species and the abundant 
  <italic>Culex annulirostris</italic> to the silent circulation of Ross River virus in FP. As these mosquito species and others present in FP are known to be vectors of a large panel of arboviruses, there is a high risk for new emergences.
