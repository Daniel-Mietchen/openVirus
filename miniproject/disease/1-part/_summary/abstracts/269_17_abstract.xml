 <p>Erasmus and Archer etÂ al. describe the optimization of monoclonal antibody expression from replicon RNA in order to enable efficacy following intramuscular delivery of formulated RNA. Using Zika virus infection of mice as a model, they demonstrated that such RNA can provide pre-exposure prophylaxis, as well as post-exposure therapy.</p>
