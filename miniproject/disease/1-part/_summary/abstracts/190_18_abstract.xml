 <p>Hepatitis E is a common, mainly water-borne hepatotropic virus prevalent mainly in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Central America. In the eastern part of India epidemics of acute hepatitis E are well reported. Hepatitis E commonly presents as self-limiting acute viral hepatitis among young adults, except for some critical clinical complications during pregnancy. In epidemiological research, subclinical acute hepatitis E infection is also reported from different parts of the world, including developed nations such as the USA (predominantly in the population aged &gt;60 years). Though primarily hepatotropic, in the literature there are reports of rare extrahepatic manifestation of acute hepatitis E. Here we present an elderly lady with acute hepatitis E who primarily presented with acute myocarditis.</p>
