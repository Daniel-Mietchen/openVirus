 <p>Viruses transmitted by mosquitoes have recently received huge attention from the media because the epidemics caused by Zika and chikungunya virus rapidly spread to new areas and infected a large number of individuals. Mayaro is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that circulates in the Caribbean and tropical regions of Latin America. It causes a highly inflammatory disease, called Mayaro fever, and acute disease is often followed by a prolonged arthralgia mediated by chronic inflammation that can last months or years. The spread of Mayaro to urban areas is a major concern by the authorities, given that the virus has potential to cause an epidemic if spread in high-risk areas. Thus, understanding the mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of this infectious agent would be of great value to treat and prevent the disease. Here, we established an adult mouse model of Mayaro infection and demonstrated that the virus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is important to regulate this viral disease. Our study provides molecular targets for a future treatment of Mayaro fever and provides an experimental model to understand the pathology caused by this emerging viral pathogen.</p>
