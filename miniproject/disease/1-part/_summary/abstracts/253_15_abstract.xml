 <p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly transmissible respiratory pathogen and is a constant threat to global health with considerable economic and social impact. Influenza viral RNA is sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). The activation of these PRRs instigates the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and inflammatory genes. FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) has been implied in the IκBα kinase (IKK) complex. However, the role of FKBP5 in the RIG-I signaling and IAV infection is not well elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the knockout of FKBP5 increases IAV infection. Furthermore, FKBP5 binds IKKα, which is critical for RIG-I-induced innate immune responses and ISG expression. Taken together, FKBP5 is a novel anti-influenza host factor that restricts IAV infection by the activation of RIG-I-mediated NF-κB signaling.</p>
