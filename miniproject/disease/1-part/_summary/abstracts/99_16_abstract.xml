 <p>Brazil has experienced several arbovirus outbreaks in recent years, among which yellow fever stands out. The state of Minas Gerais faced outbreaks of sylvatic yellow fever in 2017 and 2018, with 1002 confirmed cases and 340 deaths. This work presents the results of survey efforts to detect the yellow fever virus in mosquitoes from two conservation areas in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A total of 867 mosquitoes of 20 species were collected between September 2017 and May 2018, the most abundant being 
  <italic>Psorophora</italic> (
  <italic>Janthinosoma</italic>) 
  <italic>ferox</italic> (von Humboldt, 1819) (31.3%), 
  <italic>Limatus durhamii</italic> Theobald, 1901 (19.1%) and 
  <italic>Haemagogus</italic> (
  <italic>Haemagogus</italic>) 
  <italic>janthinomys</italic> Dyar, 1921 (18.2%). Total RNA was extracted from the mosquitoes for real-time PCR analysis for yellow fever, chikungunya, mayaro, Zika and dengue viruses. The yellow fever infection rate was 8.2% for 
  <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> (13 mosquitoes), which is the main vector of sylvatic yellow fever in Brazil. In addition to surveying the mosquito fauna of these conservation units, this work demonstrates the importance of monitoring the circulation of viruses near large urban centers.
