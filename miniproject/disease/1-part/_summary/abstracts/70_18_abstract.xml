 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>Virus infection induces different cellular responses in infected cells. These include cellular stress responses like autophagy and unfolded protein response (UPR). Both autophagy and UPR are connected to programed cell death I (apoptosis) in chronic stress conditions to regulate cellular homeostasis via Bcl2 family proteins, CHOP and Beclin-1. In this review article we first briefly discuss arboviruses, influenza virus, and HIV and then describe the concepts of apoptosis, autophagy, and UPR. Finally, we focus upon how apoptosis, autophagy, and UPR are involved in the regulation of cellular responses to arboviruses, influenza virus and HIV infections.</p>
