  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">The seroprevalence of human Parvovirus B19 (PVB19) is 70–85% in adults worldwide. PVB19 is the etiologic agent of the fifth disease, is a cause of aplastic anemia, and can be associated with kidney injury. We aimed to describe the cases of 4 patients with kidney injury related to PVB19 primary infection, and to evaluate the seroprevalence of PVB19 and the incidence of PVB19 primary infection in patients undergoing a native kidney biopsy.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">Cases of PVB19 infection with kidney injury were reviewed from the archives of the department of Nephrology. A systematic screening of anti-PVB19 IgG and IgM antibodies and viral DNA was performed in sera from 100 consecutive patients with a kidney biopsy in 2017–2018.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">The 4 patients with PVB19 infection-associated kidney disease displayed: one lupus-like glomerulonephritis (GN) without lupus auto-antibodies, one minimal change disease with tubular necrosis, one secondary hemolytic and uremic syndrome and one membrano-proliferative GN. In the 100 patients biopsied, 67 had elevated anti-PVB19 IgG, among whom 8 had elevated IgM, without circulating viral DNA, without any particular renal pathological pattern. One additional patient showed a seroconversion at the time of kidney biopsy, which revealed a class V lupus nephritis.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">PVB19 primary infection can be associated with different kidney diseases. The seroprevalence of PVB19 among patients with a kidney biopsy is similar to the overall population, and primary infection is rarely documented (1%) after systematic screening. Whether PV19 is nephrotoxic, or triggers renal endothelial injury and immune activation, remains to be elucidated.</p>
