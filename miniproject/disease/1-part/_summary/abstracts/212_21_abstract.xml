 <p>Effective mosquito surveillance and management depend on a thorough understanding of the biology and feeding patterns unique to species and sex. Given that a propensity to sugar feed is necessary for some mosquito surveillance and newer control strategies, we sought to document the amount of total sugar in wild 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (L.) and 
  <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (Say) captured from five different locations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of South Texas over 2 yr. We used Biogents Sentinel 2 (BGS2) traps in year 1 and aspirators, BGS2, and CDC resting traps in years 2 and 3 to collect adult mosquitoes. The hot anthrone test was used to quantify total sugar content in each mosquito. Additionally, the cold and hot anthrone tests were used to distinguish fructose content from total sugars for mosquitoes captured in 2019. Overall, 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females had significantly lower total sugar content than 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> males as well as both sexes of 
  <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>. However, the percentage of 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> positive for fructose consumption was four to eightfold higher than 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> previously reported in other regions. The difference between locations was significant for males of both species, but not for females. Seasonality and trapping method also revealed significant differences in sugar content of captured mosquitoes. Our results reinforce that sugar feeding in female 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is less than 
  <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, although not absent. This study provides necessary data to evaluate the potential effectiveness of sugar baits in surveillance and control of both 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes.
