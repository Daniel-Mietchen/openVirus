 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a RNA virus and belongs to genus 
  <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and family 
  <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. The virus was first discovered from a febrile primate from the Zika forests of Uganda in 1947 and the first human case was documented in 1954. The nonspecific clinical manifestations of ZIKV pose diagnostic dilemmas and delays early and effective treatment. Dental professionals should have a thorough knowledge about the virus and should follow standard infection control measures as the virus has been demonstrated in various body secretions (including salivary secretions). The disease is managed by symptomatic and supportive care and no vaccine exist till date. Recent ZIKV outbreaks and increase association of microcephaly with congenital ZIKV and neurological complications (Guillain-Barr√© syndrome) has drawn global public health attention. The World Health Organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern in 2016. This review article provides a detailed overview on ZIKV; it is clinical and oral manifestations, diagnostic aids, differential diagnosis, preventive aspects, and management protocol.
