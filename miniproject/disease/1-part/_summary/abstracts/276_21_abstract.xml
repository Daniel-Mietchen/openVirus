 <p>The plasma membrane is the major interface between a cell and its environment. This complex and dynamic organelle needs to protect, as a barrier, but also transmit subtle signals into and out of the cell. For the enveloped virus IAV, the plasma membrane represents both a major obstacle to overcome during infection, and the site for the assembly of progeny virus particles. However, the organisation of the plasma membrane–a key to understanding how viral entry works—at the scale of an infecting particle (length scales &lt; 100 nm) remains largely unknown. Sialylated glycans serve as IAV attachment factors but are not able to transmit signals across the plasma membrane. Receptor tyrosine kinases were identified to be activated upon virus binding and serve as functional receptors. How IAV engages and activates its functional receptors while initially binding glycans still remains speculative. Here, we use super resolution microscopy to study the lateral organization of plasma membrane-bound molecules involved in IAV infection, as well as their functional relationship. We find that molecules are organized in submicrometer nanodomains and, in combination with virus diffusion simulations, present a mechanistic model for how IAV first engages with AFs in the plasma membrane to subsequently engage and trigger entry-associated membrane receptors.</p>
