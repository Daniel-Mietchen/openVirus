 <p>Influenza A virus (IAV) causes annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics of respiratory disease. Secondary bacterial coinfection by organisms such as 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> is the most common complication of primary IAV infection and is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Here, we report the first identified 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> factor (lipase 1) that enhances IAV replication during infection via positive modulation of virus budding. The effect is observed 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> in embryonated henâ€™s eggs and greatly enhances the yield of a vaccine strain, a finding that could be applied to address global shortages of influenza vaccines.
