 <p>Influenza A virus (IAV) pandemics arise when a virus adapted to a non-human host overcomes species barriers to successfully infect humans and sustain human-to-human transmission. To gauge the adaptive potential and therefore pandemic risk posed by a particular IAV, it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying viral adaptation to human hosts. Here, we focused on the role of one of IAVâ€™s eight gene segments, the M segment, in host adaptation. Comparing the growth of IAVs with avian- and human-derived M segments in avian and mammalian systems revealed that the avian M segment restricts viral growth specifically in mammalian cells. We show that the mechanism underlying this host range phenotype is a dysregulation of viral gene expression when the avian IAV M segment is transcribed in mammalian cells. In particular, excess production of the M2 protein results in viral interference with cellular functions on which the virus relies. Our results therefore reveal that the use of cellular machinery to control viral gene expression leaves the virus vulnerable to over- or under-production of critical viral gene products in a new host species.</p>
