 <p>In this paper we introduce a field diagnostic device based on the combination of advanced bio-sensing and photonics technologies, to tackle emerging and endemic viruses causing swine epidemics, and consequently significant economic damage in farms. The device is based on the use of microring resonators fabricated in silicon nitride with CMOS compatible techniques. In the paper, the designed and fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) sensors are presented and characterized, showing an optimized performance in terms of optical losses (30 dB per ring) and extinction ration for ring resonances (15 dB). Furthermore, the results of an experiment for porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) detection by using the developed biosensors are presented. Positive detection for different virus concentrations has been obtained. The device is currently under development in the framework of the EU Commission co-funded project SWINOSTICS. </p>
