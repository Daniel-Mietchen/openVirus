 <p>Influenza is a very important respiratory infectious disease that causes seasonal epidemics and pandemics. A well-organized surveillance system is necessary to monitor and respond effectively to the epidemiologic features of influenza. Korea currently operates a national influenza surveillance system based on the clinical sentinel surveillance system, laboratory sentinel surveillance system, and hospitalization and mortality surveillance system. However, there is a need for a better national surveillance system due to a demand for various pieces of information related to influenza. This article discusses the general aspects of influenza surveillance systems and the future direction of the national influenza surveillance system of Korea.</p>
