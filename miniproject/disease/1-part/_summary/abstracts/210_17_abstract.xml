 <p>EV-A71 was supposed to infect the CNS through the neural pathway and the circulation of the blood in previous studies. Reverse axon transport had been confirmed as an important pathway for EV-A71 to infect the CNS; however, it is still unknown how EV-A71 infects the CNS through the circulation of the blood. Combined with the infectivity of sEVs secreted from EV-A71-infected cells and the characteristic that sEVs could cross the blood-brain barrier, we considered that sEVs may play a vital role in EV-A71 pathogenesis of the CNS.</p>
