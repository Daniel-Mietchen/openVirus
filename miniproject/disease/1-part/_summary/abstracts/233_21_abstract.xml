  <p>During ongoing passive surveillance in Burail, Chandigarh an unexpected rise in number of acute viral hepatitis (AVH) was reported during December 2016.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="st2">
  <title>Aims:</title>
  <p>An outbreak of AVH was investigated in an urbanized village, Burail, in Chandigarh, India with an objective of describing its epidemiological features.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="st3">
  <title>Settings and Design:</title>
  <p>A house-to-house survey was conducted in Burail (population 51,958).</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="st4">
  <title>Subjects and Methods:</title>
  <p>WHO's standard case definition for AVH was used to identify cases. Suspected cases were tested for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and E virus (HEV) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Drinking water samples were tested for fecal contamination. Control measures were implemented to contain the outbreak.</p>

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>Out of 141 confirmed cases of AVH, 85.1% were positive for HEV, 12.8% for HAV, and 2.1% for both HAV and HEV. The attack rate was 27.1 per 10,000 in a population. Males were affected more than females (

Drinking water samples were found negative for contamination. Around 27% of confirmed cases reported history of taking food from local vendors in Burail 2â€“6 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
