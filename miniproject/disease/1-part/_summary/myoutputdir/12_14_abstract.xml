 <p id="Par1">Chikungunya (CHIK) is an arboviral infection caused by the chikungunya virus. An unusual feature of CHIK is its long periods of quiescence followed by an epidemic of devastating severity that can involve millions of people. Manifestations of CHIK range from a mild self-limiting febrile illness with arthralgia and rash to crippling acute and lingering debilitating arthritis. In about 10–60% of patients, musculoskeletal symptoms may persist for up to 3–5 years. Management is mainly symptomatic, with analgesics, antipyretics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Ecological changes together with alterations in the viral genome facilitate the development of newer variants with greater pathogenicity, a matter of great concern. The social and economic burdens to a society as a result of CHIK epidemics have generated a considerable interest in the scientific community to decipher the reasons underlying myriad manifestations and to develop management strategies for tackling the menace of CHIK across the globe.</p>
