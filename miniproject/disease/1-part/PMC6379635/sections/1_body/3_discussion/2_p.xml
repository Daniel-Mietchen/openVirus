<p>Since 1984, the primary care 
 <italic>Sentinelles</italic> surveillance network has monitored influenza epidemics in France. Its seniority, the stability of the methods and ILI definition used allowed the comparison of 32 seasonal influenza epidemics and a pandemic, observed between winters 1984/85 and 2016/17. We highlighted a decrease in epidemic size and height over time. We bring out associations between epidemics characteristics and circulating dominant or co‚Äêdominant viruses: epidemic size, peak height and age of cases.
