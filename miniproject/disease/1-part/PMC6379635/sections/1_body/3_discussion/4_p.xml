<p>During the study period, type A viruses, and specially A(H3N2) subtype, were more often dominant in France, as it was already reported for Europe and USA.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> We highlighted that epidemics dominated by subtype A(H3N2) were mostly larger with older average age of cases and higher severity in elderly. This is consistent with greater virulence of type A,
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> particularly for subtype A(H3N2), subject to more frequent changes in the major surface antigens, and responsible for epidemics with a greater morbidity and mortality especially among elderly.

 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> This could be explained by acquired immunity against subtypes of influenza A(H1N1) in adults and elderly encountered through past exposure to epidemics,
