<p>During the 2009 pandemic, mean age of cases was lower (21.1 years; 95% CI 20.8; 21.5) than all observed seasonal epidemics. Larger differences across age groups were also observed, RIR in young was higher than 2 (2.1 for &lt;5 years (95% CI 1.1; 3.6); 2.8 for 5‐14 years (95% CI 2.0; 3.9)), while RIR in elderly was very low (0.1; 95% CI 0.0; 0.4) (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The observed requested hospitalization was higher than for seasonal epidemics (1% of ILI cases).
