<p>The average age of cases was 28.8 years (95% CI 28.7; 28.9) and the median was 26 years. Age of ILI cases was different according to dominant viruses (

 <sup>−10</sup>). Compared to epidemics dominated by type B viruses (mean = 27.5 years; IC 95% 27.3; 27.7), ILI cases were on average older during epidemics dominated by A(H3N2) (mean = 30.6 years; IC 95% 30.3; 30.8), and younger for epidemics dominated by A(H1N1) (mean = 24.5 years; IC 95% 24.2; 24.8).
