<p>Overall, children of 5‐14 years had the highest attack rate with an average of 7352 cases per 100 000 population (95% CI 6187; 8516) regardless the dominant virus, followed by the &lt;5 years (5545; 95% CI 4693; 6397), the 15‐64 years (3873, 95% CI 3269; 4477) and the elderly (1868; 95% CI 1392; 2344) (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Consistently across all dominant viruses, RIRs were highest in the young (&lt;5 years and 5‐15 years) and decreased in adults with lowest values for the elderly (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12620-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). School‐age children (5‐14 years) had higher RIR than youngest (&lt;5 years) except for an epidemic co‐dominated by A(H1N1)pdm09 and B (2013/14) were RIRs were decreasing with age.
