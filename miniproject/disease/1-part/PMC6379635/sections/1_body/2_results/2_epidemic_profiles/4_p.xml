<p>We highlighted a positive correlation between epidemic size and duration (ρ = 0.54, 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.002), epidemic size and peak height (ρ = 0.87, 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 10
 <sup>−9</sup>). However, there was no evidence of association between epidemic duration and peak incidence (ρ = 0.17, 
 <italic>P</italic> value = 0.36). Influenza epidemic start period and epidemic size were associated (variance analysis, 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 3.10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Compared to “winter” epidemics (starting between the 9th of December and the 18th of January), on average “early” epidemics (starting before the 8th of December) were larger (+1418 cases per 100 000 population; 95% CI 153; 2682) and “late” epidemics (starting after the 21th of January) were smaller (−1833 cases per 100 000 population; 95% CI −3051; −615). Likewise, peak incidence rate was higher for “early” epidemics and lower for “late” epidemics compared to “winter” epidemics (
 <italic>P</italic> value = 2.10
 <sup>−6</sup>; +483 [265; 700] and −292 [−502; −82] cases per 100 000 population, respectively).
