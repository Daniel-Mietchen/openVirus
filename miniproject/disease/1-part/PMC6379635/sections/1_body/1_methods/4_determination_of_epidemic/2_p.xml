<p>Influenza epidemic detection method was based on a regression model which fits non‐epidemic data to predict a non‐epidemic baseline. ILI non‐epidemic baseline were estimated by applying a periodic regression model including a linear trend, annual and semi‐annual periodic terms on weekly ILI incidence rates below a cut‐off value (defined at 279 cases per 100 000 population).

The epidemic is declared when at least two consecutive weekly incidence rates exceed the threshold. This epidemic detection method was selected based on its performance, evaluated in a recent study.
