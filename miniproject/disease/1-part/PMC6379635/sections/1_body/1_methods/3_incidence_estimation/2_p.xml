<p>In France, the size of the population covered by GPs is unknown because there is no mandatory practice register.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Thus, the total number of ILI cases by week (weekly incidence) is estimated by multiplying the mean number of reported cases per participating SGP for a given week by the total number of practicing GPs. To take into account the regional disparities of SGPs density, weekly incidence was first estimated at the regional level (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics—NUTS 2 level 
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>), and then summed to obtain the national estimates. Incidence rates (per 100 000 population) were obtained by dividing incidences by yearly population size (census data). Age‐specific incidence rates were estimated for the following age groups: 0‐4 years old, 5‐14 years, 15‐64 years, 65 years and older. Confidence intervals (CI) were estimated assuming that cases reported by SGPs follow a Poisson distribution.
