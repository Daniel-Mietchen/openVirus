<p id="Par37">Following ingestion of a viremic blood meal from an infected vertebrate host, the virus initiates infection in the mosquito midgut. However, the dissemination of virus from the midgut to salivary glands is not well understood. It is postulated that once the virus enters midgut epithelial cells, replication occurs in the cells and the virus subsequently spreads to the hemocoel [
