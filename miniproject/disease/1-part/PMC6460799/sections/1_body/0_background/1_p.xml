<p id="Par36">Mosquito-borne viruses are a global health priority due to frequent resurgences of major epidemics and unprecedented geographical expansion in the last few decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The majority of mosquito-borne viruses are RNA viruses, with either single or double-stranded RNA that have positive or negative polarity. Viruses primarily associated with global morbidity and mortality are from the following families: 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, positive single-stranded RNA), 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, positive single-stranded RNA) and 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>, negative single-stranded RNA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Viruses from the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family include yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. DENV is considered the most important mosquito-borne virus, causing 390 million dengue infections annually, and is primarily transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Dengue epidemics have expanded significantly in the last few decades to at least 128 countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is also the primary vector for other flaviviruses, including YFV and ZIKV. Zika virus infections are typically mild or asymptomatic, but have been linked to Guillain-Barré syndromes in adults. Zika virus infections are also a major concern to pregnant women and are associated with birth defects, such as microcephaly in prenatally infected infants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In February 2016, ZIKV epidemics were declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO), with 62 countries and territories reporting evidence of transmission since its introduction into Brazil in 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some flaviviruses, including JEV and WNV, are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Members that belong to the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family include chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Sindbis virus (SINV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Ross River virus (RRV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito, which is the main vector for the parasite 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, is only known to transmit O’nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), which belongs to genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
