<p id="Par50">The majority of studies on the Toll and the Imd pathways are focused mainly on their antifungal and antibacterial functions in mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]; however, their role in antiviral immune response is not well characterized. Comparative genomic analysis between 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquitoes revealed that the key components of the Toll and the Imd pathways are conserved between these two species. The homologues of genes from the Toll and the Imd pathways can be found in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. During DENV infection of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, the genes in the Toll pathway (
 <italic>GNBP</italic>, 
 <italic>Toll5A</italic> and 
 <italic>MYD88</italic> genes) were upregulated in the salivary glands. Silencing of 
 <italic>MYD88</italic>, caused a slight increase of DENV viral titre in the midgut [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Upon viral infection, Rel1 and its downstream antimicrobial peptides is upregulated to control infection against DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] and SINV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], whereas in 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, following WNV infection, the transcription factor Rel2 of the Imd pathway activates the secretion of an antiviral peptide against WNV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
