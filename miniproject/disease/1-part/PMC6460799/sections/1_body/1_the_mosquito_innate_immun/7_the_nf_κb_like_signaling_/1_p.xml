<p id="Par49">The Toll and Imd pathways are two distinct innate immune pathways very similar to the mammalian NF-κB signaling pathway, which is the key regulator in the production of AMPs. The Toll pathway was first reported in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and is known for its role in innate immunity against pathogens, such as fungi and Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In contrast, the Imd pathway is activated during infection by Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Both Toll and Imd pathways are activated by pathogens 
 <italic>via</italic> binding of PAMPs to the host’s PRRs, which leads to a cascade of events to activate immune effector genes for production of AMPs. The Toll pathway is initiated by cleavage of the cytokine Spätzle (Spz), which is a ligand that binds to the Toll transmembrane receptor. Activated Toll triggers signaling through MyD88, Tube (adaptor proteins associated with Toll) and the Pelle kinase. Subsequently, the negative regulator of the Toll pathway, Cactus, is phosphorylated and undergoes proteasomal degradation that cause the translocation of the transcription factor Relish 1 (Rel1) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and binding to κB motifs on the promoters of many AMPs genes, such as 
 <italic>Diptericin</italic> and 
 <italic>Cecropin</italic> that are active against fungi and Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. While in the Imd pathway, activation of the pathway leads to degradation of the negative regulator Caspar, which leads to the translocation of Relish 2 (Rel2) to the nucleus, resulting in the transcription of AMPs [
