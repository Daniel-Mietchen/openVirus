<p id="Par48">The majority of investigations into the JAK-STAT pathway in mosquito immunity have involved dengue infection; however, pathway activation in response to other viruses and downstream mechanisms may differ for each virus. Transgenic overexpression of Hop in the midgut decreased DENV2 infection and dissemination; however, for ZIKV, dissemination was only decreased at day 7 post-infection and infection was not altered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In contrast to ZIKV and DENV, the JAK-STAT pathway was not activated by CHIKV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], nor was it involved in viral dissemination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Furthermore, in human host cells, CHIKV non-structural protein 2 has been shown to inhibit interferon signaling 
 <italic>via</italic> inactivation of the JAK-STAT pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]; however, the precise mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Together, this raises the possibility that the CHIKV inhibitory mechanism acts directly on the JAK-STAT pathway and hence may be conserved in the mosquito immune system. Just as CHIKV may inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway, SFV has also been shown to downregulate transcription of the JAK-STAT pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, both CHIKV and SFV have developed mechanisms to avoid activation of this pathway and the downstream effectors of the JAK-STAT pathway are differentially affected between the viruses.
