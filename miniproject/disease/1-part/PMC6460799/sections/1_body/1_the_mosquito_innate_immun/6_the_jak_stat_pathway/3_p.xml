<p id="Par47">Transgenic 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes have been used to investigate the role of the JAK-STAT pathway in viral infection. Through RNAi-mediated gene silencing of the tyrosine kinase complex, Dome and Hop increased DENV infection, whereas knockdown of PIAS, a known negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway, decreased DENV infection [

However, although the JAK-STAT pathway is increased in response to DENV infection in the mosquito, strains that were either resistant or susceptible to DENV infection did not show a difference in viral infection, indicating that the pathway was not involved in viral susceptibility to DENV [
