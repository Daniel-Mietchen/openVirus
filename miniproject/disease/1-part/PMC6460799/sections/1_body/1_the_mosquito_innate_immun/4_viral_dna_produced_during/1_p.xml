Instead, a persistent infection, with little or no cost of fitness to the host, is established in mosquitoes, which makes them efficient vectors for viral diseases. However, the mechanisms by which viruses maintain persistent infection in mosquitoes are poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that virus-derived DNA (vDNA) generated during viral infection are important for mosquito survival and persistent infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The majority of mosquito-borne viruses are RNA viruses, and upon infection, viral RNA or truncated forms of the viral genome produced during virus replication, also known as the defective viral genomes (DVGs), are reverse transcribed to vDNA by the activity of host cellular reverse transcriptase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although the biogenesis and regulation of vDNAs in mosquitoes has not been well studied, it has been reported that Dcr-2 regulates the production of vDNA from DVGs as illustrated in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Dcr-2 is a multifunctional protein and vDNA production is regulated by its DExD/H helicase domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. vDNAs can be detected not only in mosquito cell culture during infection, but also in

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The vDNAs then stimulate the RNAi machinery to control viral replication. Interestingly, vDNA is sufficient to produce siRNAs to elicit antiviral response when challenged with a cognate virus. Furthermore, inhibition of vDNA production results in extreme susceptibility to viral infections [
