<p id="Par58">The prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases is primarily reliant on vector control measures, such as the use of insecticides, mosquito nets and environmental management to limit human-vector contact [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] and genetically modified mosquitoes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] into native mosquito populations have been undertaken. These approaches aim to either reduce viral capacity in vector populations or reduce reproductive success.
