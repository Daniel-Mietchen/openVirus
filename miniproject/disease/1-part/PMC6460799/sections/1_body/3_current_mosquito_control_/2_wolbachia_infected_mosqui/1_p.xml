 <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic> are symbiotic bacteria, vertically transmitted from mother to offspring, and exist naturally in an estimated 60% of insects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Recently, the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> has been introduced into 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, which is not a natural host of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, in an attempt to limit their ability to transmit important arboviruses including DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV. To date, ten countries, including Australia, Brazil and Vietnam, have participated in field trials for DENV control by releasing 
 <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected mosquitoes into the wild [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. In controlled field releases in Cairns, Australia, the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was successfully established in natural populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Several years later, the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection rate in the mosquito population remains high [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. Additionally, 
 <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected mosquitoes from the same field populations continue to demonstrate reduced susceptibility to DENV under laboratory conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Field and clinical studies in Vietnam showed that 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-infected 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are not permissive to DENV infection when the mosquitoes were fed with patient-derived viremic blood meals [
