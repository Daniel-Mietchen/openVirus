<p id="Par60">Despite the potential of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> as a useful and effective tool to combat mosquito-borne diseases, the mechanisms of how 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> mediate viral replication in mosquitoes remains largely unclear. However, there are likely to be multiple mechanisms involved: (i) priming the immune system by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating innate immune genes to secrete effector proteins such as Vago to limit viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]; (ii) direct competition for cholesterol between viruses and 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]; and (iii) perturbations in vesicular trafficking, lipid metabolism, intracellular cholesterol trafficking and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Despite promising results from field trials, many concerns need to be addressed before 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes can become a safe and effective strategy to suppress arbovirus transmission. For example, one study has reported that 
 <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infection of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> increased the infection rates of other insect-specific flaviviruses that are not medically important [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Secondly, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based mosquito control might not be effective for other mosquito species. For example, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infection of 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic>, which is a novel WNV vector in North America, enhanced the infection rate of WNV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Additionally, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes exhibited an enhanced susceptibility to 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, thus increased the risk of malaria transmission by these mosquitoes [
