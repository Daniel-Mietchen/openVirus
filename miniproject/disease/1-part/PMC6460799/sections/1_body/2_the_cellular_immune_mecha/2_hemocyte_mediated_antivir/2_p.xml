<p id="Par54">Hemocytes exist in two forms: circulating (circulate within hemolymph) and sessile (tissue resident). Furthermore, different populations of hemocytes have been described in mosquitoes. Studies have categorized mosquito hemocytes into prohemocytes, oenocytoids and granulocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Granulocytes are the most abundant and constitute 80â€“95% of circulating hemocytes. Granulocytes are phagocytic, and upon activation they rapidly adhere to and engulf foreign particles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Oenocytoids (~10% of circulating hemocytes) are the main producer of components of the phenoloxidase (PO) cascade in response to infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The PO cascade is a humoral immune response initiated by pathogen-associated pattern recognition molecules and leads to proteolytic processing of prophenoloxidase (PPO) to PO, which catalyzes the formation of melanin around invading pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The reaction intermediates generated from the proteolytic processes have been shown to inactivate SFV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. SFV has been shown to activate PO-based melanization cascade in mosquito cells, which results in inhibition of virus spread indicating that this pathway mediates the antiviral response in mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Nodulation occurs when multiple hemocytes bind to bacterial aggregates to form a multicellular sheath and the nodule formation is the main insect cellular defense reaction to clear a large number of bacteria from the hemolymph [
