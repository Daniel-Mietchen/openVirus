<p id="Par55">The insect fat body is an organ that functions analogous to both adipocytes and livers in mammals. The fat body is crucial in regulating metabolism and growth in insects, and is responsible for energy storage, synthesis and secretion of hemolymph proteins and circulating metabolites [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> during dengue virus infection [

 <italic>Dome</italic> or 
 <italic>Hop</italic> gene in the fat body of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, resulted in inhibition of DENV infection in these transgenic mosquitoes, but this inhibitory effect was not observed for CHIKV and ZIKV, indicating that different viruses elicited the JAK-STAT pathway differently [
