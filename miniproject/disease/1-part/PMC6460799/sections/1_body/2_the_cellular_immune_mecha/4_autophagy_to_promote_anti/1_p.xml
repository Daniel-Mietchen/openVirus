<p id="Par57">Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that sequesters and mediates the degradation of cellular components, such as proteins and organelles, to maintain cellular and tissue homeostasis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Autophagy involves the sequestration of damaged organelles or misfolded proteins by forming double-phospholipid membrane vesicles, known as autophagosomes. The autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes to mediate the degradation of sequestered contents within the lysosome [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. In addition to the role of autophagy in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis, a protective role for autophagy against intracellular pathogens including viruses has been shown in mammalian systems and, to a lesser extent, in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, antiviral autophagy against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is activated through pathogen recognition by the Toll-7 transmembrane receptor. The activation of Toll-7 leads to the activation of autophagy 
 <italic>via</italic> the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-signaling pathway, which is an autophagy pathway that senses the status of nutrient availability. Upon activation, autophagy is able to limit viral replication in flies. Furthermore, loss of Toll-7 leads to an increase in viral RNA production in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] and 
 <italic>Toll-7</italic> mutant flies which are more susceptible to RVFV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], suggesting that there is a role for autophagy in controlling viral replication. Due to the conservation of autophagy, it is postulated that the autophagy pathway is also involved during viral infection of mosquitoes. For example, during DENV infection, autophagy is activated to generate energy for viral replication. In particular, autophagy regulates lipid metabolism by degradation of the lipid droplets to release lipids that undergo oxidation to generate energy for viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. However, the role of autophagy during virus infection of mosquitoes is still largely unknown.
