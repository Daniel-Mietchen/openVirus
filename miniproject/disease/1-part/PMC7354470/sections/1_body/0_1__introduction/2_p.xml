Although elucidating such a putative mechanism will be challenging, reporting cases based on complete clinical profiles, laboratory tests and cerebral images is a good start. Herein, we report 3 cases of flavivirus-associated acute neurological manifestations with cerebrovascular involvement, observed by our surveillance team in São José do Rio Preto (SJdRP), Brazil. The city of SJdRP is on the northwestern region of São Paulo State, has a tropical climate and is hyperendemic for various arboviruses, including DENV [
