<p>One-Step Real time multiplex PCR assays were performed using the GoTaq
 <sup>®</sup> Kit by Promega. In fourplex reaction mixtures, 50 pmol (each) of DENV-1- and DENV-3-specific primers, 25 pmol each of DENV-2- and DENV-4-specific primers, and 9 pmol of each probe were combined in a 50-µL volume total reaction mixture. Real-time PCR was performed on a 96-well plate using the QuantStudio™ Dx instrument. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of less than 38 were interpreted as positive. Primer and probe sequences are available from the authors upon request [
