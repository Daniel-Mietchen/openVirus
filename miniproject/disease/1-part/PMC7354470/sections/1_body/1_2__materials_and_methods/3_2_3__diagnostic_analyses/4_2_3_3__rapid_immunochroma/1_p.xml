<p>The SD BIOLINE Dengue DUO
 <sup>®</sup> (Abbott, Santa Clara, CA, USA; former Alere Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) rapid immunochromatographic test kit was used for the detection of NS1 antigen and IgM and IgG DENV antibodies. Briefly, for NS1 antigen detection 100 µL of sample (serum or CSF) was applied to the corresponding well and allowed to incubate for 20 min. The presence or absence of antigen was determined by the absence or presence of the corresponding band. For the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies, 10 µL of sample (serum or CSF) was applied to the corresponding well, and 30 µL of diluent was added and allowed to incubate for 15–20 min. An NS1 antigen test was interpreted as positive by the presence of 2 color lines (T band and C band) within the 15–20 min incubation period regardless of which color line appears first and negative by the presence of 1 color line within the 15–20 min incubation period. An IgM or IgG antibody test is interpreted as positive when the control (C) line and the IgM (M) or IgG (G) line are visible and negative when only the control (C) line is visible.
