<p>While the clinical association between flavivirus and cerebrovascular events is challenging, obtaining a differential diagnosis is even more challenging. According to national and international guidelines, the presence of NS1 antigen, DENV RNA and/or anti-dengue IgM is enough for diagnosis of acute infection [

As presented in case 1, by the time stroke was diagnosed on our patient, we confirmed acute dengue infection by serology (positive NS1 and IgM dengue ELISA). Similarly, patient 2 was positive for acute DENV infection (positive IgM dengue ELISA), presented with similar clinical manifestations that progressed to a stroke. In a recent surveillance study in Brazil, Vieira et al. [

Although NS1-induced permeability may be involved to the development of neurological syndromes, the sensitivity of ELISA NS1 tests is influenced by the timing of testing after onset of symptoms, as well as the serological status of patients [

Thus, the diagnosis of a vascular event, during dengue acute infection, without coagulation or autoimmune disorders, led us to conclude that DENV infection had been associated with cerebrovascular events (multifocal ischemic infarctions and focal cerebral edema in patient 1 and stroke in patient 2).
