<p>The NS1 glycoprotein is involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and vascular leakage during flavivirus infection [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In addition to its membrane-bound form, NS1 may be secreted in patient serum during infection and widely used as a diagnostic tool for acute flavivirus infection [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Circulating levels of NS1 are correlated to DENV viremia and higher risk of SD [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The soluble and membrane-associated NS1 may activate complement system leading to generation of fragments such as anaphylatoxins that contribute to acute inflammation and, consequently, pathogenesis of vascular leakage that occur in severe manifestations of DENV infections [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In DENV-2-infected children, the greatest amount of plasmatic NS1 level was evidenced in those with more elevated viremia and free soluble NS1 level within 72 h from illness onset. Such findings were associated with risk of developing a more severe form of the disease [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This relationship between disease severity and NS1 protein has been corroborated in several studies [
