<p>Because of ZIKV short viremia, serum RNA-negative results do not exclude recent ZIKV infection. For this reason, since February 2016, when Zika emergence became a public health concern [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s (CDC) Zika Immunoglobulin M antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Zika MAC-ELISA) has been significantly improved and used for the presumptive diagnosis in human serum or CSF. However, patients with recent flavivirus natural infection, such as DENV or vaccinated against yellow fever or Japanese encephalitis may test positive [
