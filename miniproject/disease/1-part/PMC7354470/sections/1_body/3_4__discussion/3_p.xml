<p>Several factors may contribute to neurological manifestations of dengue, ranging from direct viral invasion of CNS to vascular and metabolic abnormalities [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], including prolonged shock, electrolyte disorders, cerebral edema or anoxia [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, the pathogenesis of dengue neurological involvement remains unclear. Evidence supports that DENV may be neurovirulent [

 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and invade the CNS [

 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], especially for infections attributed to DENV-2 and DENV-3 [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Furthermore, damage of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) during DENV infection in animal models corroborates the notion of viral invasion [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] into the brain prominently involving astrocytes, as well as microglia and endothelial cells (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]). Virus invasion of the brain may trigger T-cell activation and release of inflammatory mediators, as well as cytokine overproduction, such as interleukin (IL) 2, interferon (INF) γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, which could lead in immune-mediated endothelial damage [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Additionally, alterations in coagulation and viral-induced vasculitis might lead to cerebral hemorrhages and infarctions [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Thus, in cases of cerebrovascular events, meningovasculitis, a transient hypercoagulable state [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or thrombocytopenia [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], elevated vascular permeability and plasma leakage [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] during dengue infection have been postulated as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis.
