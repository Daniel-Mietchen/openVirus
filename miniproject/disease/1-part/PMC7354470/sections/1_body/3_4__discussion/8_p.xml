<p>Cerebrovascular events in ZIKV-infected patients are even less frequent than in dengue infected patients [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Considering that Zika has tropism and may infect endothelial cells, as demonstrated in models using human vein and artery cells [

 <xref rid="B100-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], and due to its phylogenetic relationship to DENV in genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], and the eventual similarity among their components, including NS1 [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], it is reasonable to admit a correlation between this protein and strokes or brain hemorrhage. Besides, ZIKV-infected monocytes may have transmigrated through BBB in a model based on inflammatory activation, with essential role of T and B lymphocytes, TLR, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and microvascular endothelial dysregulation [
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The end of RAGE pathway is the production of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> among other cytokine by monocytes [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> upregulation was observed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells after ZIKV infection, followed by decreased proinflammatory cytokine levels when IL-1 receptor antagonist was added to model [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Once the integrity of BBB, which is composed of specialized microvascular endothelial cells, is crossed, the virus is able to reach and infect its target cells, and thus, presentation of rare clinical events may be observed [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Indeed, a number of studies have shown the prominent role of astrocytes in ZIKV infection [

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], which may play a role in ZIKV infection in the brain.
