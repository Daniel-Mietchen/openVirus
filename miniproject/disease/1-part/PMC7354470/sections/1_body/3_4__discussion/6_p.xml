<p>A recent in vivo and in vitro study demonstrated that flavivirus secreted NS1 alters endothelial cell permeability and induces disruption of critical membrane components. While ZIKV NS1 has caused increased vascular permeability in both umbilical vein and developing brain endothelial cells, DENV NS1 has induced hyperpermeability in more tissues, such as the lung, skin, liver, brain and placenta [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A proposed mechanism in a mouse model of infection suggests that DENV NS1 elicits an inflammatory cytokine response (e.g., TNF-a, IL-6, IFN-

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Furthermore, the application of the TLR4 antagonist

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00671" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Since NS1 plays a direct role in endothelial dysfunction and disruption leading to SD, it may also play a role in the development of cerebrovascular events in flavivirus infections. In our first case, the onset of neurological symptoms onset occurred on day 7, a critical phase of in dengue course, although NS1 level peaked in the serum on day 5, suggesting a delayed effect on the cerebrovascular endothelium.
