<p>A 65-year-old male presented to our hospital with symptoms of headache, altered consciousness level (confusion), drowsiness, dark urine and malaise that occurred a week prior to his admission. Upon admission, examination showed jaundice, disorientation, absence of neck rigidity or pupil alterations, a blood pressure of 158/90 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 bpm. Interview of his relatives indicated an absence of symptoms, including fever or dengue-like symptoms, up to the point of hospital admission and no recent travel history. NMR showed posterior meningium thickening (data not shown) and a reduced cerebral activity (mild, probably by the sedation) was observed in the electroencephalogram cerebral. A subsequent brain NMR performed 48 h later showed the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the cerebellar tent, cerebellar sickle and right hippocampal groove (

Following the second resonance, the differential diagnosis was modified to subarachnoid hemorrhage with spontaneous posterior vessel constriction syndrome or vasculitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected (leukocytes 83 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (79% lymphocytes), glucose 48 mg/dL, protein 43 mg/dL, bacteria culture negative). IgM capture ELISA on serum and CSF samples were both negative for DENV and positive for ZIKV. The patient was subjected to cerebral drainage, received supportive care treatment and 53-days-later was discharged, totally dependent on others for daily functions, such as hygiene care, food and mobility.
