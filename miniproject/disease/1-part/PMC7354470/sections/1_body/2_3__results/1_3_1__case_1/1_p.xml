<p>A 38-year-old female without comorbidities was admitted complaining of fever, myalgia, arthralgia and ocular pain. Onset of symptoms were first observed 5 days prior to hospital admission. Upon initial examination by the medical team, she was conscious and with stable vital signs; however, she expressed abdominal pain and discomfort in the liver upon palpation. Her hematocrit was at 38% and platelet count at 16,000/mm³. On day 3 post admission, she tested positive to DENV by NS1 ELISA. Two days later, she suddenly became disoriented with seizures and decerebrate posturing. She was subjected to orotracheal intubation and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A new serum sample obtained upon her admission to ICU was tested positive for DENV by IgM and IgG ELISA and ICA, respectively, and to DENV-2 by RT-PCR [

 <sup>3</sup>. No acute mass or vascular lesions were observed by computed tomography (

Rheumatologic and coagulation diseases, as well as arrythmia and infectious endocarditis, were investigated as differential diagnoses and discarded. The patient gradually improved with supportive management care and was discharged after sixty days of hospitalization. Upon discharge, the patient retained limited motility (absence of voluntary movement of lower and upper extremities) and oral communication and required continuous home care support for basic daily duties.
