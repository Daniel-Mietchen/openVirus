<p>A 73-year-old male with diabetes and prostatic neoplasia with bone metastasis was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of myalgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia and exanthema that appeared 2 days prior to his admission. He was conscious, communicating and with stable vital signs (hematocrit 24.9%, leukocytes 3500 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> and platelets count 83,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>). One day later, he developed mental confusion and decreased consciousness level. Immediate computed tomography showed evidence of hypodense images in right parieto-occipital (0.5 cm) and left front-temporal (1.6 cm) areas, middle-line deviation (1.5 cm) and left lateral ventricular and cerebellar cisterns compression, compatible as subarachnoid hemorrhage (

 <sup>3</sup> were recorded at the time. The patient was subjected to cerebral drainage, and his condition improved gradually. A serum sample tested positive by IgM DENV ELISA (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany). Seven days later, the patient exhibited sudden reduced mental awareness, cardiac arrest and death. The last laboratory exams showed hematocrit levels of 22% and platelet count of 35,000 mm
