  <p>Brain radiologic imaging of patient 1. (
   <bold>A</bold>) No evidence of mass or vascular lesions in cerebellum or (
   <bold>B</bold>) occipital lobes (OL) in brain computed tomography (CT) immediately after seizure and decerebrate posturing events (10 days post onset of dengue symptoms). (
   <bold>C</bold>) T1 weighted image from brain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) performed 24 h after occurrence of disorientation and seizures, with evidence of ischemia in cerebellum (
   <bold>C</bold>) (11 days post onset of dengue symptoms). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Ischemic areas in thalamus (T) and occipital lobe. (
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>) Extensive ischemic infarct in cerebellum and parietal lobe (PL), in diffusion-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image from brain NMR performed 24 h after occurrence of acute clinical events (disorientation and seizures), respectively. (
   <bold>G</bold>) Ischemic infarct in thalamus and occipital lobe. (
   <bold>H</bold>) No evidence of vessel lesions, including basilar and vertebral arteries responsible to vascularization of injured areas in brain angiographic study performed 24 h after seizures.
