<p>Finally, we would like to argue that some other factors must be considered in the possible zoonotic scenario of CDV. Cross neutralization between MeV and CDV has been recognized since many years (Brown and Mccarthy, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>), and this premise has existed for more than half a century when the MeV vaccine was used to protect pups against CDV at an age when passive maternal immunity often interfered with CDV vaccination (Baker et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; Brown et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). Nevertheless, the use of a commercial dual CDV/MeV vaccine is still recommended for vaccination in the presence of maternal immunity, and the vaccine has been useful against clinical measles disease in non-human primates (Christe et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Hence, one may speculate that MeV herd immunity avoids CDV jump and possible readaptation to humans via transmission through dogs or wildlife animals.
