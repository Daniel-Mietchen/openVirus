<p>According to Uhl et al., morbillivirus could have originated from cattle around 376 BC in the “old continent” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), and animal domestication may have had a significant influence on cross-species events, probably tracing a starting point in MeV emergence to approximately 900 AC (Uhl et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Contrary to the current CDV phylogenetic reconstructions, MeV divergence is strongly supported by the relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. The divergence time between MeV and the rinderpest virus had been shown to have occurred in approximately the eleventh to twelfth centuries (Furuse et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Other molecular data, such as the presence of a new morbillivirus (closely related to CDV and PDV) circulating in bats from Brazil (DrMV), allows the speculation that CDV and DrMV might share a common South American ancestor (Drexler et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), thereby indirectly supporting the idea of the early South American Origin of CDV.
