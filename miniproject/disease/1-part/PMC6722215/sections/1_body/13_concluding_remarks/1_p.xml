<p>The evolution and origin of viral pathogens cannot be easily studied; hereafter, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to understand and perhaps predict new possible viral threats to humans. Due to their peculiar biology, viral pathogens such as CDV represent a unique model for understanding interspecies jumping and zoonotic potential of viral agents very close to the human population. Besides the traditional molecular phylogenetic studies and the paleopathology works, researchers must adopt different approaches to study CDV origin and current viral and host requirements for interspecies jumping. The introduction of computational methods, such as structural bioinformatics and paleovirology studies, could help in the prediction and prevention or at least provide a better understanding of this emerging, and perhaps, zoonotic disease from a different perspective considering not only sequencing data but also structures and functions as key information to this aim.</p>
