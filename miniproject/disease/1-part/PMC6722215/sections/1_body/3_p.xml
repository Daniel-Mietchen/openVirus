<p>Notably, native dog populations from America almost disappeared after the colonization period, and European and Eurasian dogs were introduced to the continent, leaving little genetic background of its American predecessors (Ni Leathlobhair et al.,

Another important factor worth considering is that “unknown” diseases could have also been introduced, making it harder to track the origin of new pathogens. Moreover, artificial selection pressure over domestic dogs and even human populations, particularly during the colonization period, could have enhanced disease incidence, thereby limiting genetic variation (Ostrander et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), which in turn could mean less effective response against pathogens.
