<p>“Emerging viruses” could reportedly arise via the cross-species transmission of viruses from animals into humans (Wolfe et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Novel studies, both structural and bioinformatic, suggest that just a single amino acid change in a protein sequence could be enough to overcome the restriction in using cellular receptors among two different hosts, such as humans and ruminants (Abdullah et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A unique mutation in the CDV H protein 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> enables this pathogen to infect cells expressing the human SLAM receptor (Otsuki et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, if we embrace the hypothesis that CDV evolved from MeV, it could be possible that a CDV descendant could be able to re-infect humans because of the continuous evolution of both the virus and humans, as has been previously suggested in other models even though the ancestral “jumper virus” had disappeared from earth time ago (Emerman and Malik, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).
