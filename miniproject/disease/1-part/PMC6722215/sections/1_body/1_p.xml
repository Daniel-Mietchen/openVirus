<p>Measles virus (MeV) and canine morbillivirus (CDV) are considered the most contagious viruses among this family (De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and due to the high transmission potential of CDV as well as its cross-species transmission potential, the global health, and conservationist authorities are greatly concerned about role of CDV on endangered species conservation and the possible “jump” from animals to humans (Terio and Craft, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ohishi et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Domestic dogs are the main host for CDV and could also be considered as a reservoir for other mammals (Suzuki et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Duque-valencia et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>); however, based on the biology of CDV, humans could also turn into a potential target (Cosby and Weir, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Rendon-Marin et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
