<p>Morbilliviruses are highly contagious pathogens and are responsible for various outbreaks in unexposed populations (Pfeffermann et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). They belong to the order Mononegavirales and family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> and are characterized by a non-segmented, linear, negative-stranded RNA genome (Lamb and Parks, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Morbilliviruses are distinguished for causing moderate-to-severe respiratory, gastrointestinal, immunosuppression, and/or neurological diseases in a wide range of hosts, including humans (measles virus), carnivores (canine morbillivirus formerly canine distemper virus), cattle (rinderpest virus), dolphins and porpoises, and other wildlife-endangered species (Lamb and Parks, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Martinez-Gutierrez and Ruiz-Saenz,
