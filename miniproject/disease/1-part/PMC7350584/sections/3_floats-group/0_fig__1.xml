  <p>Diversity of renal pathological lesions in patients with primary PVB19 infection. 
   <bold>a</bold> Kidney biopsy of patient 1 showing lupus-like GN. Diffuse and global membrano-proliferative pattern (Jones silver staining, × 400). 
   <bold>b</bold> Kidney biopsy of patient 2 showing minimal glomerular changes and mild alterations of tubular epithelium (Jones silver staining, × 200). 
   <bold>c</bold> Kidney biopsy of patient 4 showing subendothelial deposits without typical duplicated basement membrane and irregular segmental subepithelial deposits. A few sickle cells are seen in glomerular capillaries (Jones silver staining, × 1000). 
   <bold>d</bold> Electron micrograph (× 8000) of patient 4: capillaries show thickening of the basal membrane with many irregular dense granular deposits and diffuse effacement of foot processes. 
   <bold>e</bold> Kidney biopsy of the patient with PVB19 primary infection identified through the systematic screening, showing thickening of the basement membrane with sparse subepithelial deposits (Jones silver staining, × 1000)
