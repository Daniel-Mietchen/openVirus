<p id="Par35">Moreover, a transient positivity of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), with anti-proteinase 3 or anti-myeloperoxidase specificity, has been reported in 10% of patients during acute PVB19 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and is a potential pitfall for the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Recently, an association between persistent PVB19 infection and the production of antiphospholipid antibodies in pediatric and adult patients with rheumatic diseases has also been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Molecular mimicry could be a major pathogenic mechanism triggering the production of auto-antibodies after PVB19 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Several reports have described lupus-like manifestations related to PVB19 infection, including some with acute glomerulonephritis, with transient positive anti-nuclear or anti-dsDNA antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In a murine model, the injection of apoptotic bodies containing dsDNA modified by PVB19 induced the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies and immune-mediated organ damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although PVB19 infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of (auto)immune-mediated diseases, as an infectious trigger, the correct diagnosis of PVB19 infection is particularly important in this setting, to avoid an inadequate and potentially harmful immunosuppressive therapy in some patients [
