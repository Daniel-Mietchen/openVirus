<p id="Par31">Only one additional patient with PVB19 primary infection was identified through the systematic screening of 100 consecutive patients who underwent a kidney biopsy. PVB19 infection is thus probably not a frequent and underdiagnosed cause of kidney injury. However, it could be searched for in patients with unexplained lupus-like GN, MCD or TMA, especially after the onset of viral-like symptoms and in periods of seasonal epidemic. Regrettably, as opposed to other viral epidemics, such as flu or gastro-enteritis, no specific health alert is displayed for PVB19 incidence peaks, and PVB19 infection is not a notifiable disease in most countries.</p>
