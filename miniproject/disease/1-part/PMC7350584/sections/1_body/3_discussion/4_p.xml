<p id="Par33">PVB19 viremia, in immunocompetent hosts, occurs 5 to 10 days after exposure and lasts approximately 5 days, with virus titers peaking on the first days of infection. Symptomatic primary infection in adult concerns mostly women (sex ratio 3/1), with a median age of 40 years [

PVB19 specific IgM antibodies can be detected from days 10–12 and can persist for up to 5 months. Specific IgG antibodies are detectable at day 15 and usually persist life-long. The development of a robust antibody response corresponds to the virus clearance [

Anti-PVB19 antibodies are often undetectable in this setting, and the detection of viral DNA in the blood is the diagnostic gold standard. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins has proved to be effective, but no controlled studies have been carried out [
