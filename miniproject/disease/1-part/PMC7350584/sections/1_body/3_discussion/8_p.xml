<p id="Par37">We acknowledge certain limitations to this study. First, this retrospective work did not allow to evaluate the real incidence of kidney injury associated with PVB19 infection. To overcome this limit as much as possible, we demonstrated through a systematic screening that the incidence of PVB19 primo-infection in patients undergoing a kidney biopsy was very low. Second, 2 of the cases were not fully explored for CAP abnormality. Third, because EM examination is not a routine practice in France, it was available for 1 patient only.</p>
