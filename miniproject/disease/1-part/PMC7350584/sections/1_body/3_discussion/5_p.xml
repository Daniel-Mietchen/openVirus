<p id="Par34">The specificity and sensitivity of PVB19 specific IgM assay vary between 70 and 100%, meaning that false positive results are possible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Autoimmune antibodies, such as a rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulinemia or antinuclear antibodies, can cross-react with PVB19 serology and yield false positive IgM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Most patients with positive anti-PVB19 IgM antibodies from the present cohort had a mixed cryoglobulinemia. This could either reflect a cause of false positive serological results, or con-firm the suspected role of PVB19 in the development of infectious cryoglobulinemia. Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most frequent cause of infectious cryoglobulinemia (70â€“90%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], several case reports of PVB19-related cryoglobulinemic vasculitis have been reported [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the French nationwide CryoVas survey, among 18 patients with non-HCV-related infectious cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, one (5%) was related to PVB19 [
