<p id="Par30">We confirm in this work the rareness of renal involvement during PVB19 infection: the 4 cases identified over 16â€‰years in our center constitutes the largest case series reported in the literature. We report 4 cases of different kidney diseases associated with acute or chronic PVB19 infection, ranging from immune deposition diseases to minimal change disease and thrombotic microangiopathy. The viral infection was suspected, in all cases, upon the observation of an anemia that was either non-regenerative or poorly regenerative, sometimes associated with viral-like symptoms (fever, rash). Although the causality of PVB19 primary infection could not be established in these 4 cases, the timing of kidney injury, the spontaneous favorable course (except in case #4 with chronic PVB19 infection), and the detection viral DNA in the kidney of one patient are in favor of a role of a role of PVB19. The detection of PVB19 DNA in kidney biopsy specimen is indeed often considered as a proof of causality in the kidney injury [
