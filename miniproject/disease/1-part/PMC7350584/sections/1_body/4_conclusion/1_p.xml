<p id="Par38">Kidney diseases associated with PVB19 primary infection are diverse and infrequent. Although PVB19 primary infection is rare in adults, we suggest that PVB19 serology could be performed in patients with atypical presentations of TMA or glomerulonephritis, especially if they were preceded or associated with a viral syndrome or non-regenerative anemia, or occurred in an epidemic context. The diagnosis of PVB19 infection in these patients can spare an inadequate and potentially harmful immunosuppressive therapy.</p>
