<p id="Par6">In nephrology, PVB19 infection is a matter of concern mainly in kidney transplant recipients, as a cause of aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia. The incidence of PVB19 infection after kidney transplantation either as a primary infection or a reactivation, varies between 2 and 30% [

Several cases of glomerulonephritis (GN) occurring after a PVB19 primo-infection have been reported in the literature, although the pathogenic role of PVB19 was difficult to establish. Renal presentation was mostly post-infectious GN, but collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membrano-proliferative GN, and thrombotic microangiopathy have also been reported [

Extra-hematological and extra-renal signs can vary from mild or moderate (rash, symmetric arthralgia or arthritis) to severe manifestations (myocarditis, pericarditis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, lymphoproliferation), depending on the age, comorbidity, and immunological status of the host [
