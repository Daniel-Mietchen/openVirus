<p id="Par12">A 42-year-old women was admitted to the Nephrology department in 2018 for a weight gain of 12 kg over a week, with exertional dyspnea. She had no past medical history. Physical examination revealed normal blood pressure (120/60 mmHg), lower limb edema, and bilateral pleural effusion. A nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed (serum albumin 2.5 g/dL, proteinuria 9.6 g/24 h), with a rise in serum creatinine (1.17 mg/dL), active urinary sediment (red blood cells (RBC) 27/mm3, white blood cells (WBC) 60/mm3), and non-regenerative anemia (hemoglobin 10.7 g/dL, reticulocytes 35 G/L). The complement C3 was low (0.69 g/l), with normal C4 (0.12 g/L), and low CH50 (36%). The exploration of the complement alternative pathway revealed no deficiency in complement factors B, I and H, no antibodies against factor H, and no C3 nephritic factor. No antinuclear or anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected. </p>
