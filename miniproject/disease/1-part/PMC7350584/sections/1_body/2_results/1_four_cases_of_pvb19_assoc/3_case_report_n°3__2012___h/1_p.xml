<p id="Par19">A 28-year-old man was admitted to the Nephrology Intensive Care Unit in 2012 for HUS. He reported fever, abdominal pain and non-hemorrhagic diarrhea, 10 days earlier. He came to the emergency room for a worsening asthenia. Physical examination showed only pallor, a blood pressure of 128/97 mmHg, without fever. The blood tests revealed acute renal failure (serum creatinine 6.14 mg/dl), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (Hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, undetectable serum haptoglobin, positive schizocytes 1.5%, elevated lactate deshydrogenase 2000 UI/L), without regeneration (reticulocytes 4.2 G/L) associated with a thrombocytopenia (platelets 16 G/L). Urinary tests showed proteinuria (0.8 g/L) and leukocyturia (350/mm3) without hematuria.</p>
