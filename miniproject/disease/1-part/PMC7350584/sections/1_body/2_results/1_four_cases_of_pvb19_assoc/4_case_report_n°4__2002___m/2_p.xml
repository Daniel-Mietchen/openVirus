She was pale, with worsened exertional dyspnea, lower limb edema, and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur. Laboratory tests revealed a nephrotic syndrome (serum albumin 2.4 g/dL, proteinuria 3.5 g/24) with preserved renal function (serum creatinine 1 mg/dL), without hematuria or leukocyturia, and poorly regenerative anemia (hemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, reticulocytes 136 G/L, platelets 882 G/L) without vitamin deficiency. Complement C3 and C4 were normal, and anti-nuclear antibodies were negative. PVB19 viremia was negative, but both IgG and IgM titers remained elevated, rising the hypothesis of a chronic PVB19 infection.</p>
