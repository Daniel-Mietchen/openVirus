<p id="Par21">One session of plasma exchange was performed, and the patient subsequently reached hematological remission, followed by renal remission. Nine days after his admission, platelet count had normalized (382 G/L), LDH decreased (400 UI/L), and renal function improved (serum creatinine 3.64 mg/dL). No kidney biopsy was performed. The patient recovered a normal renal function (eGFR 95 ml/min/1,73 m2) at 1 month. No relapse occurred subsequently.</p>
