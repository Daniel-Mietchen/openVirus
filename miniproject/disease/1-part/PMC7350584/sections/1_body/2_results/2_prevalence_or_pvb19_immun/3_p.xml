<p id="Par28">One additional patient, a 63-year-old women, initially had elevated anti-PVB19 IgM without IgG antibodies, and subsequently developed anti-PVB19 IgG when she was tested again 4 months later. This was consistent with a PVB19 primary infection at the time of kidney biopsy, although viremia was negative. She had been admitted for arthralgia, and nephrotic syndrome with acute kidney injury (serum creatinine 1.23 mg/dl). Laboratory tests had revealed a non-regenerative anemia (hemoglobin 9,6 g/dl, reticulocytes 26 G/L). Renal pathological examination showed a membranous nephropathy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Serum anti-PLA2R antibodies were negative, but there were positive anti-nuclear (&gt; 1/1280) and anti-dsDNA (41 UI/mL) antibodies. The diagnosis retained was a class V lupus nephritis.
