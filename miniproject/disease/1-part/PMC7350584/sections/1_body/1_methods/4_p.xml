<p id="Par11">Renal pathological examination was performed by two independent renal pathologists (LD and JT). For light microscopy, araldite-embedded sections were stained with Masson’s trichrome and Jones silver impregnation (2 and 0.2 μm sections respectively). For Immunofluorescence 4 μm frozen sections were incubated with anti-Immunoglobulins, C3, and C1q antibodies (The binding site, 1/50 dilutions, Birmingham, UK). For electron microscopy, the biopsy was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and then post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxyde-potassium ferrocyanide. We stained the tissue with 1% uranyl acetate for 3 h. The sample was then dehydrated and embedded in araldite. Ultrathin transverse sections were cut and stained using lead citrate. After staining, these sections were observed under a Jeol 1200 CX electron microscope (Japan).</p>
