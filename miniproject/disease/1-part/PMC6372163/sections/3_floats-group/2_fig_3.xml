  <title>Infection rates, transmission rates, and virus titers of mosquitoes intrathoracically injected with Shuni virus (SHUV).</title>
  <p>Mean infection rates (A) and transmission rates (B) of 
   <italic>Culex pipiens pipiens</italic> (N = 50) and 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (N = 50) intrathoracically injected with SHUV after 10 days incubation at 25째C and 28째C, respectively. Infection rates are presented as the percentage of virus-positive body or saliva samples, respectively, out of the total number of injected mosquitoes that remained alive at the end of the incubation period. Error bars indicate the SEM. SHUV titers of virus-positive body samples (C) and saliva samples (D) of

   <italic>pipiens</italic> (body samples: N = 26, saliva samples: N = 16) and

   <italic>aegypti</italic> (body samples: N = 14, saliva samples: N = 4) intrathoracically injected with SHUV after 10 days incubation at 25째C and 28째C, respectively. Each dot represents an individual sample, and the black bar indicates the mean. The detection limit of the endpoint dilution assay is indicated with the dashed line.
