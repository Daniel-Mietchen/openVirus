<p>SHUV (strain An10107, P2 Vero, 1980) was kindly provided by the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA). The virus was originally isolated from the blood of a slaughtered cow in 1966 in Nigeria by inoculation of neonatal mice [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The P3 cell culture stock was generated by inoculation of Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. The supernatant was harvested at 6 days post inoculation, centrifuged, and stored in aliquots at -80°C. The P4 stock was generated by inoculating Vero E6 cells at MOI 0.01 using the P3 stock. At this MOI, full cytopathic effect (CPE) was present at 3 days post infection. Virus titers were determined using endpoint dilution assays (EPDA) on Vero E6 cells [
