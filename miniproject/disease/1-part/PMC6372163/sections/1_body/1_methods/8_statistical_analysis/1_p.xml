<p>Infection, dissemination, and transmission rates were calculated, respectively, by dividing the number of females with virus-containing body (infection), virus-containing head (dissemination), or virus-containing saliva (transmission) by the total number of females tested in the respective treatment, and multiplied by 100. Dissemination and transmission success was calculated by dividing the number of virus-positive head or saliva samples, respectively, by the number of virus-positive bodies, and multiplied by 100. Two biting midge samples of which only the head was virus-positive, but not the body, were excluded from further analysis.</p>
