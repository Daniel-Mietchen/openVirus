 <italic>Culicoides sonorensis</italic> were kindly provided by the Arthropod-Borne Animal Diseases Research Laboratory, USDA-ARS (courtesy of Dr. Barbara Drolet) in 2017, and were maintained at 25°C with 16:8 light:dark cycle and 70% relative humidity. Similar rearing protocols were used for both biting midge species. Eggs were transferred to square larval holding trays (

Trays were filled with tap water, a few millilitres of rearing water in which larvae had completed their life cycle, and two drops of Liquifry No.1 (Interpet, Dorking, United Kingdom). Larvae were fed with a 1:1:1 mixture of bovine liver powder (MP biomedicals, Irvine, CA, US), ground rabbit food (Pets Place, Ede, The Netherlands), and ground koi food (Tetra, Melle, Germany). 
 <italic>Culicoides nubeculosus</italic> larvae were additionally fed with nutrient broth No. 2 (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). Pupae were transferred to buckets (diameter: 12.2 cm, height: 12.2 cm; Jokey), and provided with 6% glucose solution
