  <title>Phylogenetic tree of sequences studied with reference sequences.</title>
  <p> The studied sequences are in bold and represented by a black triangle, the reference sequences are demarked with the genotype between hooks. Accession numbers and virus names are included on the tree. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 450 nucleotides of the N gene in MEGA version 7.0. Evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method and distances were computed using the Kimura two-parameter model. The bootstrap test was set to 1000 replicates and bootstrap values above 70% are shown next to the main tree branches.</p>
