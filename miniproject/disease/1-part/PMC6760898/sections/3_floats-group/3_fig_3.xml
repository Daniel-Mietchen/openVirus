  <title>Sub genotyping phylogenetic tree.</title>
  <p> The studied sequences are represented by a black triangle. The tree was rooted with a sequence belonging to genotype D2. Accession numbers and virus names are included on the tree. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 450 nucleotides of the N gene in MEGA version 7.0. Evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method and distances were computed using the Kimura-two parameter model. The bootstrap test was set to 1000 replicates and bootstrap values above 70% are shown next to the main tree branches.</p>
