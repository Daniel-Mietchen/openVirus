<p>The exclusive presence of cluster B3.1 strains in this study indicates the possible elimination of cluster B3.3 from Cameroon which was identified to circulate between 2010 and 2011 in the Far North and in the Centre regions. This suggests that, efforts made by the country for elimination of the disease are effective though should be re-enforced as the B3.1 genotype has been in circulation for over 17 years. Efforts should be put on childhood immunization since most affected children are not immunized. A second vaccine dose must as well be introduced into routine childhood immunization [
