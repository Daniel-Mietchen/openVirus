<p>The latest genetic data on MeV strains circulating in Cameroon have been known since 1994 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and were updated in 2001 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and 2011 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], however they remain fragmented and are relatively old. The aim of this study was to update the MeV strains circulating in Cameroon. These results will enable to establish a genetic basis of virological surveillance in Cameroon and evaluate the countryâ€™s efforts to eradicate this disease.
