<p>Phylogenetic analyses were performed on 450 nucleotides of the N gene according to WHO recommendations for measles virus strains genotyping [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All consensus sequences obtained from the CLC Mainworkbench 5.5 software were first aligned with the 26 reference sequences and subsequently by 11 other sequences of genotype B3 available in GenBank using the Clustal W algorithm in MEGA 7 software. The best fit-model of nucleotide substitution was selected in MEGA 7 and was found to be the Kimura two-parameter gamma model among 24 different nucleotide substitution models. Phylogenetic trees were generated with the Maximum likelihood algorithm using Kimura two-parameter distance model in MEGA 7. Evolutionary rates among sites were modeled using the Gamma distribution and the attribution of clades, genotypes and clusters was based on the clusters formed between the studied sequences and the reference sequences of known clades. All sequences obtained in this study were named according to the WHO recommendations and submitted to Measles Nucleotide Surveillance (MeaNS) and GenBank under accession number MH255950 to MH255989.
