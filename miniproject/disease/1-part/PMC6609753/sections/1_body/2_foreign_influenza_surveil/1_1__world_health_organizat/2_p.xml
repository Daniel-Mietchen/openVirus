<p>National influenza centers collect virus specimens, and ship representative clinical specimens and isolated viruses to WHO CCs for advanced antigenic and genetic analysis. The WHO recommends the composition of influenza vaccines based on the results of the analysis. WHO CCs are responsible for the development of literature and research. One of the six WHO CCs is responsible for surveillance, epidemiology, and influenza prevention. Essential regulatory laboratories have the critical function of connecting surveillance and risk assessment activities with influenza vaccine response. H5RefLabs were established in 2004, in response to the public health needs arising from avian influenza A/H5N1 infection in humans and influenza pandemic preparedness. H5RefLabs collect and analyze influenza A/H5N1 or other influenza subtypes that can potentially cause human infections. The data collected by each institution of the GISRS are uploaded to the WHO database and presented via FluNet, a global web-based tool for influenza virologic surveillance first launched in 1997. The virologic data presented via FluNet are crucial to tracking the movement of viruses and interpreting the epidemiological data. The WHO also operates a data sharing platform called FluID, which provides connections between existing databases.</p>
