 <bold>Virologic surveillance.</bold> Approximately 100 public health laboratories and over 300 clinical laboratories participate in the virologic surveillance: the US WHO Collaborating Laboratories System and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System. The clinical laboratories provide data on the weekly total number of specimens tested, the number of positive influenza test results, and the percentage of positive test results by influenza virus type. Public health laboratories also report other kinds of data on the weekly total number of specimens tested, the number of positive influenza test results, and the number by influenza virus type, subtype, and influenza B lineage.
