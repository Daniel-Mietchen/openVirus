 <bold>Mortality surveillance.</bold> Influenza-associated mortality surveillance consists of two systems. The first is the National Center for Health Statistics mortality surveillance system. The National Center for Health Statistics collects pneumonia and influenza mortality data from each state based on ICD-10 codes. The seasonal baseline pneumonia and influenza mortality rate is estimated using a periodic regression model. The epidemic threshold is estimated by an increase of 1.645 standard deviations above the baseline. The second is the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System. Since 2004, deaths among children younger than 18 years with laboratory-confirmed influenza have been added as a nationally notifiable condition.
