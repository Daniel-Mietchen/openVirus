 <bold>Outpatient illness surveillance.</bold> Information on outpatient visits to health care providers for ILI is collected through the US Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). ILINet consists of more than 3,500 enrolled outpatient healthcare providers. They report data on the total number of patients seen for any reason and the number of those patients with ILI by age group (0 – 4 years, 5 – 24 years, 25 – 49 years, 50 – 64 years, and ≥65 years). ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 37.8°C or greater) and a cough and/or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza. Based on the ILINet results, state health departments report the estimated level of the geographic spread of influenza activity in their states each week through the State and Territorial Epidemiologists Reports. The influenza activity is classified at five levels: no activity, sporadic, local, regional, or widespread.
