<p>The national influenza surveillance system of Japan is affiliated to the National Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases (NESID), which includes a mandatory reporting system for nationally notifiable diseases and sentinel surveillance systems for various kinds of infectious diseases including influenza [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The sentinel outpatient surveillance system has been applied to influenza surveillance. Sentinel sites were designated according to the geographic distribution, type of medical institutions, and population densities. Sentinel sites report the age group and sex of patients with ILI every week. Virologic surveillance, consisting of testing for influenza virus and the analysis of viral antigenicity, is incorporated into outpatient surveillance under the scheme of NESID. About 500 medical institutions out of 5,000 sentinel sites are designated as pathogen collection sites. In addition to the outpatient and virologic surveillance, data on the number of influenza-associated hospitalizations are also collected under NESID. Around 500 hospitals with more than 300 beds are selected as sentinel sites for hospitalization surveillance. Japan has monitored the incidence of influenza-associated encephalopathy since the late 1990s. Japan has a surveillance system for student absence and school closures. The law of Japan states that children with influenza infection should stay home for at least 6 days after the onset of symptoms. The act also designates that the school can be closed to stop the transmission of influenza depending on the size of influenza outbreaks. In addition to the surveillance system operated by the public sector, there is a volunteer-based web ILI surveillance system. The surveillance system is organized by volunteer clinicians who report the number of influenza patients diagnosed at their clinics through the ML-Influenza Database.
