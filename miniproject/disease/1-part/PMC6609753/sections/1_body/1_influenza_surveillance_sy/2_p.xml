<p>There are two major forms of influenza surveillance systems: clinical sentinel surveillance and virologic sentinel surveillance systems [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A clinical sentinel surveillance system is used to identify influenza outbreaks and epidemics, establish a vaccination plan, initiate antiviral agent use, and measure the burden of influenza, which are the basic data required for public health policies for influenza. The most important indicators in clinical sentinel surveillance are the influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence and influenza-associated mortality. In addition, other indicators can be used that represent the burden of influenza in the community such as absenteeism, or that show the severity of influenza or burden from the healthcare perspective such as emergency department visit ratio and hospitalization ratio. Virologic sentinel surveillance is used to identify the characteristics of circulating viruses, which include resistance to antiviral agents, and matching of vaccine strains and circulating strains. Since clinical sentinel surveillance and virologic sentinel surveillance play a complementary role, they should not be operated separately; they should ideally be operated concurrently by selecting representative sentinel sites.
