Pooled estimates for the risk of having been exposed to HCV using these data were 8.0% (95% CI, 6.1‐9.8) for Egypt and 4.9% (95% CI, 4.7‐5.1) for Pakistan. The corresponding numbers needed to be tested were 16.9 (95% CI, 13.6‐21.7) for Egypt and 27.3 (95% CI, 26.3‐28.5) for Pakistan. These estimates are similar to those generated using the totality of the evidence (Tables 
 <xref rid="hep41310-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="hep41310-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
