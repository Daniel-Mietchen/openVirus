<p>For countries with a concentrated epidemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="hep41310-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), the highest program efficiency was achieved by targeting PWID, where only three individuals needed to be tested to identify one chronically infected individual. As the program was expanded to include populations with high‚Äêrisk health care exposures and populations with liver conditions, five and nine tests, respectively, would be needed to identify a chronic infection. As the program was expanded to more populations, the curve began a rapid climb upward, highlighting the diminishing returns of testing. Most notably, expansion of the program to general populations implied exponentially more tests (&gt;200) to identify a single chronic infection.
