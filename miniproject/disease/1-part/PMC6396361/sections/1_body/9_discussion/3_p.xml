<p>Epidemiologically and for testing strategies, MENA countries clustered into two main patterns: generalized epidemics where HCV prevalence in the general population is ≥3% (Egypt and Pakistan) and concentrated epidemics where prevalence is &lt;3% (remaining countries). In countries with generalized epidemics (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41310-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), the risk of having been exposed was high and similar for PWID, populations with liver conditions, and populations with high‐risk health care exposures; in this last group, one in every two individuals is infected. This risk was also substantial, although less than the former groups, for special clinical populations, populations at intermediate risk, and even general populations, signifying the terminology of generalized epidemics.
