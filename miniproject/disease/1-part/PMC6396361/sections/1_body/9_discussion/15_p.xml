<p>Our study has key strengths. The analyzed database is, to our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive ever assembled of HCV prevalence measures. The database was built systematically and through standardized protocols and included all available prevalence measures in all populations in MENA countries. Such scope of epidemiologic evidence allowed extensive and stratified analyses that could not have been possible without such a database.</p>
