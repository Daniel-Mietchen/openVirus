<p>Our analyses are limited by the variability in quantity and quality of available data. For some countries, prevalence measures in some of the epidemiologic populations were not available or not sufficient to warrant estimations. On occasion, estimates were based on a small number of studies that may not have been representative of the considered population. We provided an analysis to inform testing with a focus on developing a regional strategy, but this may not be sufficient to devise a country‐specific optimal strategy. The latter may need to incorporate additional data and contextual factors and be conducted as in‐depth country‐specific analyses that include all subpopulations beyond the broad populations considered here. In the present study, however, the focus was on analyses at the regional level and by epidemic type.</p>
