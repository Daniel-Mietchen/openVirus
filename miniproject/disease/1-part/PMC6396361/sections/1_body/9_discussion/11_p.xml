<p>Population accessibility is yet one more important factor. Accessing current PWID or ex‐PWID may prove difficult.

Cost‐effectiveness is another consideration, and this varies from one country to another based on actual costs of testing and treatment and the country‐specific cost‐effectiveness threshold as set based on the per‐capita gross domestic product.
