<p>In concentrated epidemics, a targeted testing strategy is critical for program efficiency (Table

 <xref rid="hep41310-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Testing is most efficient by targeting PWID, followed by populations with high‚Äêrisk health care exposures, populations with liver conditions, and lastly, special clinical populations. Given the large number of tests needed to identify a single chronic infection, it will be difficult to justify commitment of large resources for testing populations at intermediate risk and general populations. For instance, &gt;200 tests would be needed to identify a single case in general populations. This being said, modeling studies could be used to assess the full impact of testing strategies on cost before a detailed policy is established.
