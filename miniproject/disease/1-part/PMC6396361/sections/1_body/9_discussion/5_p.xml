<p>Remarkably, for both generalized and concentrated epidemics, the risk of exposure in clinical populations, including populations with high‐risk health care exposures and special clinical populations, was substantial if not very high, indicating a critical role for health care in transmission. Although this important role for health care may not be well appreciated,
