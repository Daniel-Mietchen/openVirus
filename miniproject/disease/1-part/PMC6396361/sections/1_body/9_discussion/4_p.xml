<p>Meanwhile, in countries with concentrated epidemics, there was a clear hierarchy in the risk of exposure (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41310-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). PWID had the highest risk, followed by populations with high‚Äêrisk health care exposures, populations with liver conditions, and special clinical populations. The relative role of PWID was thus higher here than in generalized epidemics (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41310-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="hep41310-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A,B). The risk for populations at intermediate risk and for general populations was very low (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41310-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Overall, risk estimates across countries were consistent and comparable with those of recent global reviews and estimations for the general population
