<p>Testing prioritization should be made with the aim of achieving the quickest public health gains in terms of achieving the elimination goal and thus should take into consideration testing efficiency based on the infection burden in specific population groups, the size of those population groups, and their contribution to the pool of infections within the country. For example, based on our findings, testing efficiency is highest if it targets, respectively, populations with liver conditions, PWID, and populations with high‚Äêrisk health care exposures, where only two to four tests would be needed to identify a chronic infection, followed by special clinical populations, populations at intermediate risk, and eventually general populations. However, realities on the ground, such as the size of the population of concern and its contribution to the overall pool of infection, may change the prioritization order. Of note, challenges like ensuring adequate resources and necessary laboratory infrastructure to perform testing and linkage to treatment at the district level should also be considered, even in the context of generalized epidemics.</p>
