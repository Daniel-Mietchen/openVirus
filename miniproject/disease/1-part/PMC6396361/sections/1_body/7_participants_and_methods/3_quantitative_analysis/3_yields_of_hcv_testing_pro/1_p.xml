<p>Country‐specific, epidemic‐specific, and regional estimates for the yields (number of individuals needed to be tested to identify one chronically infected individual) of potential testing programs targeting the different epidemiologic populations were derived using the inverse of the pooled mean risk of having been exposed to HCV.
