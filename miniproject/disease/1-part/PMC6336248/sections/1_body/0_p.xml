<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an RNA alphavirus belonging to the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family, first identified in Tanzania in 1952. During epidemics and endemic circulation, CHIKV is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and, to a lesser extent, by 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Infection with CHIKV typically causes a self-limiting febrile illness, chikungunya fever (CHIKF), characterized by chronic, severe joint pain, and sometimes accompanied by an itchy maculo-papular skin rash. Severe complications, such as encephalitis, may occur in the elderly and in individuals with comorbidities, and peripartum infections can be fatal or involve severe neurologic sequelae in fetuses and infants [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CHIKV is enzootic in Africa, where transmission involves different arboreal 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. vectors and nonhuman primates (NHP) in forested habitats. Direct spillover infections of humans from these enzootic cycles probably occur in many regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, CHIKV is endemic and causes recurrent and sometimes large epidemics, especially in the Indian subcontinent and in Southeast Asia [

In 2004, CHIKV reemerged to cause large outbreaks, which began on the coast of Kenya and ravaged several Indian Ocean islands and the Indian subcontinent in the years 2005 to 2006, before spreading to initiate transmission in Southeast Asia [

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, including two outbreaks in Italy in 2007 and 2017 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and two in France. The unabated spread and increasing burden of CHIKF underscores the need to develop an effective vaccine [
