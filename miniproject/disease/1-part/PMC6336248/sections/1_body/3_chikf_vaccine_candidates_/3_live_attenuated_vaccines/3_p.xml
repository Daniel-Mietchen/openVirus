<p>The first of these rationally attenuated CHIKF vaccines to undergo extensive preclinical testing employed a picornavirus-derived internal ribosome entry site to replace the CHIKV subgenomic promoter [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This replacement is highly stable after serial cell culture and mouse brain passages [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and a single dose of the vaccine elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses and protects mice and NHPs against virulent CHIKV challenge, including weight change, fever, and viremia in cynomolgus macaques [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Protection after a single dose in mice lasts over 9 months, and protection of both mice and NHPs from this Indian Ocean lineage-derived strain also extends to Asian/American lineage CHIKV strains [
