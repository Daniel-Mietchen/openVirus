 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, most development of these vaccines was discontinued decades ago because of high-production costs and risks associated with handling large quantities of virulent, wild-type, virus prior to inactivation. Therefore, although newer inactivated candidates have been tested with promising results [
