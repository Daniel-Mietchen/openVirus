<p>Secondly, although the case–fatality rate of CHIKF is relatively low—usually well below 1% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]—it may be underestimated in small outbreaks and in epidemic waves that occur in resource-poor countries. Excess mortality was investigated during an outbreak in Mauritius, and the case–fatality rate was estimated to be around 2.3 per 1000 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and fatal encephalitis has been reported with CHIKV infection both in Italy [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and in La Reunion, where it was observed in patients mostly below 1 year or over 65 years of age [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Relatively high case–fatality rates (17%) and persistent disability (30% to 45%) were documented among patients with CHIKV-associated encephalitis. An increased incidence of other neurological syndromes, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, was also reported during a CHIKF outbreak in French Polynesia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These findings provide evidence of severe disease associated with CHIKV infection, which may have a high impact in terms of hospitalization and mortality during large outbreaks.
