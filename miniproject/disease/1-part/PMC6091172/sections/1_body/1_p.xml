<p id="Par3">The paper by Rich et at in this journal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] has looked at the number of men attending open access sexual health services in Israel over 7 years and found that 27% were MPS. This group of men reported more at-risk behaviours such as increased partner number, drug taking and a history of STI diagnoses than the men that did not pay for sex; however, in this analysis no additional STI diagnoses were made in MPS.
