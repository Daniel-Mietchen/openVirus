<p id="Par38">The models were compared for their fit to the epidemic data. Naturally, models are compared for their performance based on the ability to fit well on the data and their reliability in predicting future epidemic outbreaks. Fundamentally, in our model fitting to data we searched for the model that provided the best trade-off between the fit to data and the model structure complexity. Often, approaches such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are sufficient for ranking and selecting the best performing models. However, when the data is non-Gaussian and the model is Bayesian, like in our case, then the deviance information criterion (DIC) is more appropriate. For the comparison of our models we used the DIC proposed by Spiegelhalter et al. [

The model with the smallest DIC value gives the better trade-off between model fit and complexity; therefore, it is considered as the model that best predicts a replication of a data set with a similar structure as that which was observed currently [
