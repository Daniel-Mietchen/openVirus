<p id="Par39">To further assess the model performance with regards to the parameters, sensitivity analysis to alternative prior assumptions was performed because there are no true priors in the Bayesian analysis. In order to ensure reliable and robust results from our best model, it was crucial to verify how sensitive the resulting posteriors were for each prior input for the epidemic parameter

 <sub>
  <italic>it</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>it</italic>
 </sub>, the parameter that quantifies the influence of one virus on the other. Therefore, we assumed independent gamma priors with uniform hyper-priors on the second parameter,

 </sub>). To our understanding, this comparison of models has not yet been done using RSV and HMPV time series data. All the models in our work were run and tested in the statistical software WinBUGS version 14. The models differed on the epidemic part 
 <italic>ξ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>, 
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> by the assumptions made on the interactions between the viruses. We used 6 models depending on the assumptions applied as explained below with each model with a corresponding inclusion of climatic factors giving rise to a total of 12 models (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In model 1, it is assumed that the incidence rate is the same in every virus; hence, no interactions between the viruses. Model 2 assumes that there is the interaction between viruses where the sum of related viruses at the same time point has an equal rate. Models 3 and 4 are generalizations of models 1 and 2 respectively with a different rate for each virus. Models 5 and 6 generalize model 3 and 4 respectively with a different rate for each virus per time point.
