The meteorological dataset was recorded on a daily basis and aggregated monthly for the purpose of this analysis. The variables included the mean temperature, mean dew point for the day (both in 
 <sup>0</sup>F), the mean sea level pressure for the day in millibars, the mean visibility for the day in miles, the mean wind speed for the day in knots, the minimum and maximum temperature (°F) reported during the day and the total precipitation (in inches).
