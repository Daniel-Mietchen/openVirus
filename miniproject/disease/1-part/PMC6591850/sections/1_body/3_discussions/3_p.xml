<p id="Par47">Some of the limitations of this study were that the available time series data for the viruses was only for a four-year time-frame which is short for time series analysis and that the climatic factors were from the neighboring weather station which is about 100â€‰km away from the Dadaab camp. Nevertheless, the weather measurements are a good representation of the actual weather around Dadaab. There was no establishment of whether patients were co-infected during virus testing. We used the DIC which is an approximation of a penalized loss function based on the deviance to evaluate the models. The application is valid only when the number of parameters is much smaller than the number of independent observations [

The criterion used to select the best model did not allow for the computation of weights of each fitted model to quantify for uncertainty, that is the model averaging techniques were not used [
