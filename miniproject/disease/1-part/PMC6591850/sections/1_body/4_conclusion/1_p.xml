<p id="Par48">We provided a comprehensive comparison of RSV and HMPV in a refugee camp setting by using a bivariate non-Gaussian model to jointly model the epidemics. By comparing various model structures, we identified a model that satisfactorily fits the epidemic data, thereby explaining most of the observed variation therein. The models and estimated parameters also provided clues into the dynamics and stability of the two epidemics. Our results demonstrated the influence of RSV on HMPV while adjusting for climatic factors. The climatic factors played a significant role in explaining the influence of RSV incidence on HMPV incidence. These models are important to the public health implication since controlling the incidence of RSV would consequently reduce the incidence of HMPV.</p>
