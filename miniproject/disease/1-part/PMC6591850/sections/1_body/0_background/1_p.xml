<p id="Par14">Epidemiological knowledge of the respiratory system has been mostly related to developed countries, though the burden of respiratory virus infections (RVIs) is more manifested in developing countries with very high hospitalization and mortality rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Higher mortality is associated with increased displacement into overcrowded refugee camps [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The burden of RVIs is considerably high during crises times [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and is more severe in infants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recently, Pastula et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] highlighted that hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is not limited to infants but also includes adults. In 2001, HMPV was identified as a potential etiologic agent for respiratory infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A study at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong showed that the peaks of HMPV and that of RSV activity occurred in spring and the early months of summer and viral diagnoses during the study period showed that RSV and HMPV had similar seasonality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Guerrero et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] indicate that RSV but not HMPV induces a productive infection in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Reinfection by RSV has a great impact on human health and may cause long-term effects on the host immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Greensill et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] detected HMPV in 21 out of 30 infants infected with severe RSV and were hospitalized requiring intensive-care unit ventilator support. Konig et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found out that 60% of the cases with HMPV had RSV. They also found that HMPV contributed to the severity of Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) at a lower rate than RSV and coinfection was considered a cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease. The HMPV infections have similar symptoms to those caused by RSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], they share similar risk factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and simultaneous detection times [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The HMPV and RSV may cross-react directly or indirectly because they are both co-viruses to each other [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The correlation between RSV and HMPV in the refugee settings and even in the tropical region has not been studied. We specifically aimed at establishing the heterogeneity in the autoregressive effect to account for the influence between these viruses. The modelling of the time series events of these viruses will not only help in the prediction of their outbreaks but also in estimating which outbreaks precede each other. The results could be used by other countries in the tropical zone of Africa with similar settings to inform control measures to prevent outbreaks.
