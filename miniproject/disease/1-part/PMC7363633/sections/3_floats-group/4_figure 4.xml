  <p>Rapid Prophylactic Protection against Lethal ZIKV Challenge</p>
  <p>(A) Outline of experimental design C57BL/6 mice received i.p. injection of MAR1-5A3 antibody followed by IM administration of 40 μg of ZIKV-117 RNA. (B and C) 1 day later, mice were challenged by footpad injection with 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV and serum was harvested 2 days later to assess: (B) antibody concentration by ELISA and (C) viremia by qRT-PCR of extracted RNA. ∗p &lt; 0.001 as determined by two-tailed t test. (D) Mice were monitored daily for survival until the end of the study. ∗p = 0.008 as determined by Mantel-Cox test. Results are combined from three independent experiments (n = 17 mice/group). Data in (B) and (C) are represented as mean ± SD.
