  <p>Comparison of repRNA and Non-Replicating mRNA 
   <italic>In Vivo</italic> following IM Administration
  </p>
  <p>C57BL/6 mice (n = 5/group) were injected IM with 40 μg NLC-formulated repRNA or non-replicating mRNAs, or with their pseudouridine (Ψ)-modified counterparts, each encoding ZIKV-117. ZIKV-117 concentration then was measured by ELISA in sera collected 0, 3, 5, 7, or 10 days after injection. ∗p &lt; 0.0001 between repRNA and all other groups at all time points except day 0 as determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. Differences between mRNA and mRNA
   <sup>Ψ</sup> were not significant at all time points. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments.
