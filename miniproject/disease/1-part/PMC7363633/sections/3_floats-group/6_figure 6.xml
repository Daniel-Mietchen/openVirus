  <p>ZIKV-117 Expressed in the Absence of IFNAR Blocking Protects</p>
  <p>(A or F) Outline of experimental design. (A–J) C57BL/6 mice (n = 8/group) received IM administration of ZIKV-117 RNA 7 (A–E) or 5 (F–J) days before ZIKV challenge. Mice received i.p. injection of MAR1-5A3 antibody 1 day before then 1 and 4 days after challenge. On the day of challenge, mice were bled to assess antibody concentration by ELISA and (B) then challenged by i.p. injection with 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of WT ZIKV. Serum was harvested 4 days after challenge to measure viremia by plaque assay (D or I). ∗p &lt; 0.0001 and ∗∗p = 0.007 as determined by two-tailed t test. Mice were monitored daily for weight loss and survival (C and E or H and J) until the end of the study. ∗p &lt; 0.0001 and ∗∗p = 0.009 as determined by Mantel-Cox test. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. Data in (B), (D), (G), and (I) are represented as mean ± SD.
