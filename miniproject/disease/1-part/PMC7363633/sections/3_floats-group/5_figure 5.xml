  <p>Therapeutic Protection against Lethal ZIKV Challenge</p>
  <p>(A or E) Outline of experimental design. C57BL/6 mice received i.p. injection of MAR1-5A3 antibody, and 1 day later, were challenged by footpad injection with 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV. (A–H) Mice then received IM administrations of 40 μg of ZIKV-117 RNA either 1 (A–D) or 3 (E–H) days after RNA administration. 1 day later, serum was harvested to assess antibody concentration by ELISA (B or F), as well as viremia by qRT-PCR of extracted RNA (C or G). ∗p = 0.0019 as determined by two-tailed t test. Mice were monitored daily for survival (D or H) until the end of the study. ∗p = 0.0004 as determined by Mantel-Cox test. Results are combined from three independent experiments (n = 18 mice/group). Data in (B), (C), (F), and (G) are represented as mean ± SD.
