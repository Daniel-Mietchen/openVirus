  <p>(A) Design of IRES and Furin-T2A antibody constructs to evaluate the effect of H/L chain orientation on expression. See 
   <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref> for optimization of IRES sequences. The IRES sequence depicted here is an optimized sequence derived from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV
   <sub>opt</sub>). (B) Western blots of BHK cell lysates or supernatants 24 h after transfection with repRNAs encoding variations of ZIKV-117. Recombinant ZIKV-117 IgG protein was used as a positive control. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments. (C) Total IgG ELISAs of supernatants harvested from BHK cells 24 h after transfection with repRNAs encoding variations of ZIKV-117. ∗p &lt; 0.001 as determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. (D) Human anti-ZIKV IgG ELISAs of C57BL/6 (n = 8/group) mouse sera harvested at various times after IM administration of nanostructured lipid carrier-formulated repRNA encoding variations of ZIKV-117. Recombinant ZIKV-117 diluted in normal mouse serum was used to generate an absolute standard curve. ∗p &lt; 0.005 for H-T2A-L compared to all groups and for L-T2A-H and H-EMCV
   <sub>opt</sub>-L compared to L-EMCV
   <sub>opt</sub>-H as determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test at the day 7 time point. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. Data in (C) and (D) are represented as mean ± SD.
