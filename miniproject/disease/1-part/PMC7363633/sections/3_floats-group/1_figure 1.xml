  <p>Expression of H and L Chains of ZIKV-117 from an Alphavirus Replicon RNA</p>
  <p>(A) Replicon RNAs (repRNAs) derived from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, vaccine strain TC-83. (B) Schematic of ZIKV-117 human IgG monoclonal antibody with L and H chains depicted in light or dark gray, respectively. (C) Varied strategies for encoding ZIKV-117: a single open reading frame (ORF) separating H and L chains by a furin-T2A site; two ORFs separated by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES); two ORFs on two separate repRNAs rep repRN; or just the variable regions expressed as an scFv. (D) 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) titers of supernatants harvested 24 h after transfection of BHK cells with 10 or 1 μg of various repRNAs encoding ZIKV-117. Data is representative of two independent experiments. nsP, nonstructural protein; SP, signal peptide; VH, heavy chain variable region; CH, heavy chain constant region; VL, light chain variable region; CL, light chain constant region. Data in (D) is represented as mean ± SD.</p>
