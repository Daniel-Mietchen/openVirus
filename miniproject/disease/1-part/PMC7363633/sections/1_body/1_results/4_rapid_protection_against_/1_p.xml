 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B), which we reasoned might evoke an unintended immune response against the antibody. To evaluate efficacy of the H-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-L repRNA construct, hereafter called ZIKV-117 repRNA, we used a previously described lethal challenge model of ZIKV infection wherein a mouse-adapted (MA) strain of ZIKV (strain Dakar 41525) is combined with a single-dose antibody (MAR1-5A3

 </xref> We first applied this model to assess prophylactic efficacy of ZIKV-117 repRNA. C57BL/6 mice were given 2 mg of anti-IFNAR1 antibody and administered 40 μg of either ZIKV-117 repRNA or a non-specific repRNA using the same H-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-L framework but encoding an influenza virus-specific human antibody directed to hemagglutinin (5J8), via IM injection 1 day before challenge with 10
 <sup>3</sup> focus-forming units (FFU) of ZIKV-MA (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Mice then received an IM treatment of 40 μg ZIKV-117 or influenza virus-specific mAb 5J8 repRNA beginning at 1 (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A–5D) or 3 days (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>E–5H) after virus inoculation. Mice were bled 1 day later to measure serum antibody concentration by ELISA (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and 5F) and ZIKV viremia by qRT-PCR (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5G). Mice were followed for survival over 21 days (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>D and 5H). The mean antibody concentrations in mice receiving ZIKV-117 or influenza virus-specific 5J8 repRNA therapy at day +1 after infections (2 days after infection and 3 days after MAR1-5A3 treatment) was 0.8 μg/mL and 0.6 μg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). All mice in ZIKV-117 repRNA group were protected against detectable viremia (limit of detection = 1,000 FFU equivalents/mL; 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C) and death (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D), whereas the influenza virus-specific mAb 5J8 repRNA control group experienced viremia (mean of 2.7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU/mL) and an 80% mortality rate. However, the cohort receiving ZIKV-117 repRNA therapy 3 days after infection had a mean human IgG concentration of 0.05 μg/mL, compared to the 5J8 control group which exhibited mean human IgG concentration of 0.1 μg/mL, 1 day after treatment (4 days after infection and 5 days after anti-IFNAR1 treatment; 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F), both of which did not protect against viremia or mortality (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>G and 5H). This decrease in human antibody concentration between studies is likely due to difference in ZIKV load at the time of repRNA therapy combined with increasing time from IFNAR1 blockade. The decrease in 5J8 antibody concentration can be explained by the latter, whereas the more pronounced decrease of ZIKV-117 can be explained by both factors.
