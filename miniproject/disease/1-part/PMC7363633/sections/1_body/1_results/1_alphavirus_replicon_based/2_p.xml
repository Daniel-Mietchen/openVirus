<p id="p0035">We then transcribed and capped these four RNA constructs and, using the NLC formulation previously described, transfected BHK21 cells with 10 or 1 μg of RNA. 24 h later, we harvested and clarified cell supernatants and measured their capacity to neutralize ZIKV in a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT
 <sub>50</sub>; 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). Whereas both the 2A and IRES strategies resulted in similar PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> titers, the separation of each ORF onto two separate repRNAs did not mediate efficient expression of neutralizing antibody, suggesting either inefficient delivery of both RNA species into the same cell or inefficient co-expression of each ORF in cells receiving both RNA species. The scFv version of ZIKV-117 was expressed more efficiently, with at least ∼2-fold higher neutralizing titers at the 10 μg dose compared to the 2A or IRES strategies. Substantial cell death was observed in the groups receiving 10 μg doses of the T2A, IRES, and two repRNA IgG constructs (data not shown), whereas the same dose of the scFv construct caused less cell death. This factor likely contributes to the expression differences and suggests potential toxicity associated with expression of complete IgG compared to scFvs.
