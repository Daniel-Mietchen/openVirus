 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> we initially tested four different strategies in the context of alphavirus repRNA-based expression (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Given that canonical antibodies are comprised of heavy (H) and light (L) chains (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B), it is necessary to express both chains, using either a single open reading frame (ORF) or two separate ORFs (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). We encoded the H- and L-chain-variable regions of ZIKV-117 as (1) a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or (2) in an IgG1 framework as a single ORF separating the two chains by a furin and thosea asigna virus 2A (T2A) peptide sequence to promote T2A-mediated ribosomal skipping followed by host furin-mediated cleavage of residual T2A amino acids. Alternatively, (3) we used an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence to mediate translation from the second ORF following cap-mediated translation of the first ORF of the same RNA message or (4) we separated the two ORFs onto two separate repRNAs.
