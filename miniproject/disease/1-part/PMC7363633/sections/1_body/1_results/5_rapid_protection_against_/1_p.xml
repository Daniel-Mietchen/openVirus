<p id="p0090">To quantify the effect of IFNAR signaling on repRNA-mediated antibody expression, we evaluated ZIKV-117 repRNA expression kinetics in C57BL/6 mice receiving IM injections of 40 μg ZIKV-117 repRNA 1 day after mock or anti-IFNAR1 pre-treatment (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>). We observed a 3- to 5-fold enhancement of antibody expression by repRNAin the presence of IFNAR1 blockade. To determine whether protection was dependent on the enhanced repRNA propagation when IFN signaling was attenuated, we evaluated whether repRNA-mediated expression of ZIKV-117 in the absence of IFNAR1 blockade could mediate protection against lethal ZIKV challenge. Given peak antibody concentrations observed between 5 and 7 days after injection of repRNAs and subsequent decline in immunocompetent mice (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D), we reasoned that the enhancing effects of IFNAR1 blockade on repRNA-mediated mAb expression would be minimal at 5 or 7 days after repRNA injection. This factor allowed us to evaluate whether antibodies expressed prior to IFNAR1 blockade could mediate protection during the immunocompromised state required for lethal endpoints in this mouse challenge model of ZIKV. In contrast to the above efficacy studies, we used an alternative and previously described

 </xref> IFNAR1-blockade model of lethal ZIKV infection with the wild-type (WT) ZIKV Dakar strain 41525 (parental to ZIKV-MA described above) with additional low-dose MAR1-5A3 antibody administrations on days 1 and 4 after ZIKV inoculation. Using this model, two cohorts of mice (n = 8/group) were injected IM with 40 μg of ZIKV-117 RNA on either day −7 (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A–6E) or day −5 (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>F–6J). Then, anti-IFNAR1 antibody was administered on days −1 and 0, and mice were bled to determine ZIKV-117 IgG concentrations immediately before challenge with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV. Additional doses of anti-IFNAR1 antibody were administered on days +1 and +4, and mice were bled to measure viremia and followed for body weight change and survival for 15 days. ELISA results from serum obtained at day 0 confirmed similar ZIKV-117 concentrations as seen in immunocompetent mice, with mean serum IgG concentration of 1.28 μg/mL from the day −7 cohort (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D), and 1.45 μg/mL from the day −5 cohort (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). These levels of ZIKV-117 IgG were sufficient to reduce viremia (
