<p id="p0080">We next constructed mRNA versions of ZIKV-117 using the H-T2A-L framework and previously published 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, to compare repRNA-mediated antibody expression to that of non-replicating mRNA. Furthermore, we transcribed normal, as well as pseudouridine (Ψ)-modified mRNA of each construct, since previous studies demonstrated reduced innate immune stimulation by mRNAs containing pseudouridine that was associated with higher levels of protein expression.

 </xref> Following transcription and capping, 40 μg of each RNA was formulated with NLC and delivered via IM injection in C57BL/6 mice, and serum was harvested on days 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10 to measure ZIKV-117 concentration by ELISA (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). RepRNA-mediated ZIKV-117 expression achieved between 17- to 32-fold higher serum concentrations of ZIKV-117 than mRNA with or without pseudouridine over the course of the experiment. Additionally, pseudouridine-modified mRNA did not improve antibody expression following IM administration. For reasons that remain unclear, pseudouridine-modified repRNA was non-functional, resulting in lack of detectable ZIKV-117 antibody in the serum of mice.
