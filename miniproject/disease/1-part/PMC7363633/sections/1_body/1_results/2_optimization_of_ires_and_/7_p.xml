<p id="p0070">We performed studies in C57BL/6 mice following NLC formulation and intramuscular (IM) delivery of RNA constructs encoding ZIKV-117 mAb. First, we performed a dose escalation study to determine the maximum dose per injection that resulted in an increase in serum concentrations of ZIKV-117 mAb by formulating the RNA in NLC at 11 different RNA concentrations, while maintaining a constant nitrogen-to-phosphate ratio between NLC and RNA. We administered a single 50 μL IM injection to each group of mice (n = 3/group) such that each group received a total dose of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5, or 25 μg of ZIKV-117 RNA. Mice were bled 5 days after injection, and the ZIKV-117 IgG protein concentration in serum was determined by ELISA (

We observed increasing serum concentrations of ZIKV-117 IgG as the dose escalated from 0 to 10 μg, at which point no appreciable gains were observed suggesting a maximum RNA concentration of 200 μg/mL could be administered in a 50 μL injection volume.
