<p id="p0075">Using this maximal dose per injection, we administered each of the four RNA constructs described above via the IM route in C57BL/6 mice (n = 8/group), with each mouse receiving four IM injections of 10 μg RNA for a total dose of 40 μg RNA in a single administration. We collected serum on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 14 after injection and determined the levels of ZIKV-117 antibody protein by ELISA (

 <sub>opt</sub>-H construct, which resulted in the lowest expression

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C), reached peak serum concentration of 1.19 μg/mL on day 5 post-injection. The H-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-L and L-T2A-H groups achieved similar levels on day 5 (1.25 and 1.10 μg/mL, respectively), and the H-T2A-L group reached a mean concentration of 1.68 μg/mL on day 5, which was significantly greater than L-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-H (p = 0.04; 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Peak expression was achieved on day 7 for the H-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-L, H-T2A-L, or L-T2A-H groups, with mean concentrations of 1.58, 2.61, or 1.52 μg/mL, respectively, compared to the L-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-H group, which had declined (mean concentration of 0.72 μg/mL) to levels lower than the other groups (p &lt; 0.002). The H-T2A-L group achieved significantly higher mean antibody concentration (2.61 μg/mL) compared with all other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Concentrations steadily declined thereafter, and all groups exhibited a serum level of ZIKV-117 close to baseline by 14 days after injection.
