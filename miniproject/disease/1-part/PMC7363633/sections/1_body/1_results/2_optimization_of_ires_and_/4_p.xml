<p id="p0055">We next assessed the effect of H and L chain orientation around the IRES or T2A sequences. After generating L-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-H, H-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-L, L-T2A-H, and H-T2A-L constructs, which varied only in the relative location of the H and L chains (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), we transfected capped RNA transcripts into BHK21 cells and measured IgG production 24 h later by western blotting of cell lysates and supernatants (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) and ELISA of supernatants (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). The L chain was expressed at higher relative levels than the H chain in the H-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-L construct in both the cell lysates and supernatants, and this finding correlated with higher IgG concentrations in the supernatant. In contrast, the L-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-H construct resulted in higher levels of H chain expression in cell lysates but lower IgG concentrations in the supernatants.
