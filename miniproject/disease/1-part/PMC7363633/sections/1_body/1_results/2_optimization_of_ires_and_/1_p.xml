<p id="p0040">Due to the short 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> half-lives of scFvs and lack of Fc-mediated effector functions, we next focused on optimization of the IgG IRES and T2A strategies to maximize expression. We first evaluated the use of an IRES to drive expression of a second cistron reporter gene by screening seven viral and five cellular IRESs
