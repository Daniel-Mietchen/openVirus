<p id="p0065">In contrast to the IRES strategy, the IgG concentrations in supernatants of cells transfected with the T2A constructs were not affected by the orientation of H and L chains (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). However, the efficiency of furin cleavage of residual T2A amino acids was affected by the upstream sequence. Furin-T2A downstream of the L chain resulted in the production and secretion of a slightly larger L chain, as observed in the western blots of cell lysates and supernatants, respectively. Whereas furin-T2A downstream of the H chain resulted in the production of a slightly larger H chain intracellularly, the supernatant appeared to contain a correctly processed form.
