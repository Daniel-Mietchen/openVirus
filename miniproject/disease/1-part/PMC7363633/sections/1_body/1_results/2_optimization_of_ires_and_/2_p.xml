<p id="p0045">Given this result, a subset of the viral IRESs was cloned into constructs containing either ZIKV-117 H-chain-IRES-L-chain (H-IRES-L) or L-chain-IRES-H-chain (L-IRES-H) orientations to determine the combined effect of each IRES and chain orientation on antibody expression. We transcribed and capped the RNA, transfected BHK21 cells, and 24 h later, cell supernatants were harvested and IgG was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>C). The EMCV full-length IRES produced the highest concentrations of IgG in the supernatant. When comparing antibody expression between H-IRES-L and L-IRES-H orientations, higher levels of antibody were expressed when the H chain was located in the first cistron.
