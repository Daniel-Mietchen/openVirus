<p id="p0060">To confirm the unexpected observation that the IRES mediated higher levels of downstream ORF expression than the upstream cap-dependent ORF, we cloned nLUC in both orientations as H-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-nLUC or nLUC-EMCV
 <sub>opt</sub>-H. Transcribed RNA was capped, transfected into BHK21 cells, and cell lysates were harvested 16Â h later for measurement of nLUC activity (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3</xref>A and S3B). Expression of nLUC downstream of the IRES in the second cistron was more efficient than cap-dependent expression from the first cistron at each of the doses tested.
