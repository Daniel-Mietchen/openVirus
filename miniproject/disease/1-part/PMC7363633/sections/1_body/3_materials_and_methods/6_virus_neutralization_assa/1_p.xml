 </xref> using the Cambodian ZIKV strain FSS 13025 as the control virus. Briefly, ZIKV FSS 13025 (200 PFU) was mixed with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum in DMEM containing 1% FBS. Samples then were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, transferred to 90% confluent monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well plates (Costar), and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. An overlay containing 1% agarose in DMEM with 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% gentamycin then was pipetted into each well, and plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C. Cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and plaques visualized following crystal violet staining.
