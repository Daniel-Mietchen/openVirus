<p id="p0170">The amount of human mAb in serum was detected using a capture ELISA with a standard curve of recombinant anti-ZIKV mAb ZIKV-117 or an IgG1 isotype-matched control anti-influenza mAb, 5J8. Briefly, plates were coated with 2 μg/mL of goat anti-human kappa or goat anti-human lambda antibodies cross-absorbed against mouse IgG at 4°C overnight. Plates were blocked using 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37°C and then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated mouse serum in parallel with a serial dilution of a known quantity of ZIKV-117 hIgG1 protein. After washing, bound antibody was detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-human Fc multiple species cross-absorbed (1:2,000; Southern Biotech) for 1 h at 4°C. Plates were developed using TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the reaction was stopped with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. ELISA plates were read using a TriBar LB941 plate reader (Berthold Technologies). The optical density values from the known quantity of ZIKV-117 hIgG1 were fitted to a standard curve and compared to the optical density values of serum to determine the concentration of ZIKV-117 hIgG1.
