<p id="p0175">Blood was drawn from ZIKV-infected mice at various time points, allowed to clot at room temperature, and serum was separated by centrifugation. Viral RNA was isolated using the 96-well Viral RNA kit (Epigenetics), as described by the manufacturer. ZIKV RNA levels were determined by TaqMan one-step quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), as described previously

For quantification of infectious ZIKV in serum, virus titer was determined by plaque assay as follows: serial dilutions of serum were added to 90% confluent monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well plates (Costar) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. An overlay containing 1% agarose in DMEM with 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% gentamycin then was pipetted into each well, and plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C. Cells then were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and plaques were visualized following crystal violet staining.
