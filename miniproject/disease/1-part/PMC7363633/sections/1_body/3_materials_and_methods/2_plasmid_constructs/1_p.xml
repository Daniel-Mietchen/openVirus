 </xref> All cloning steps below used a Gibson assembly method with 40-bp homologous overlaps (SGI-DNA). ZIKV-117 (IgG1 isotype) with T2A or IRES DNA sequences was synthesized using gblocks (IDT) and cloned between PflFI and SacII sites of pT7-VEE-Rep. For screening of various IRES sequences, a fragment encoding H chain nanoluciferase was synthesized with 2 BspQI restriction sites between the 2 genes for universal insertion of heterologous sequences. This fragment was inserted between the PflFI and SacII of pT7-VEE-Rep. Synthesized IRES sequences then were inserted between the BspQI sites. For the mRNA control plasmids, a fragment encoding a T7 promoter, genes encoding ZIKV-117 antibody flanked by previously described 5′ and 3′ UTRs and a poly(A) tail was inserted between MluI and NotI sites of pT7-VEE-Rep, replacing the entire VEE-Rep sequence.
