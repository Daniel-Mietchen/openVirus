<p id="p0180">All animal studies were approved by the Infectious Disease Research Institute or Washington University School of Medicine (assurance number A3381-01) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The facility where animal studies were conducted is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International and follows guidelines set forth by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011. Blood was obtained as approved by cheek or retro-orbital bleeding. Virus inoculations were performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. Mice were non-specifically and blindly distributed into respective groups. WT female C57BL/6 mice (4 weeks of age) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory or Charles River. For studies involving ZIKV challenge, mice were treated with 2 mg of an IFNAR1-blocking antibody (MAR1-5A3, Leinco Technologies) by i.p. injection 1 day before virus inoculation, and in some cases (as indicated in the figure legends) additional 0.5 mg doses of anti-IFNAR1 were administered 1 and 4 days after ZIKV inoculation. Mice were inoculated with 40 μg of RNA using by an IM route (into each quadricep and hamstring muscle groups) with four injections of 50 μL of RNA/NLC complex per injection. For most ZIKV infections, mice were inoculated by a subcutaneous (via footpad) route with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of ZIKV-MA in a volume of 30 μL of PBS. In other studies, mice were inoculated via i.p. route with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of parental ZIKV strain Dakar 41525. For survival studies, mice were monitored for 21 days.
