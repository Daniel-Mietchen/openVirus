 <sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). All cell lines were prescreened for mycoplasma contamination. Propagation of ZIKV-MA (GenBank: MG758786.1), a mouse-adapted isolate of ZIKV strain Dakar 41525 mouse (Senegal, 1984; GenBank:
