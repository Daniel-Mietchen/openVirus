<p id="p0150">To generate linear templates for RNA transcription, we cut repRNA or mRNA plasmid DNA by restriction digest using NotI or BspQI enzymes (New England Biolabs), respectfully, and purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and sodium acetate precipitation. RNA was transcribed using T7 polymerase, RNase inhibitor, pyrophosphatase enzymes (Aldevron), and reaction buffer. RNA transcripts were capped with vaccinia virus capping enzyme using GTP and S-adenosyl-methionine (New England Biolabs) as substrates to create a cap-0 structure. RNA was purified using LiCl precipitation. To generate pseudouridine-modified RNAs, was replaced 100% of uridine with pseudouridine in the reaction mixture and transcribed and capped as described above.</p>
