 </xref> The oil phase is composed of squalene (the liquid-phase of the oil core), glyceryl trimyristate (Dynasan 114; the solid-phase of the oil core), a non-ionic sorbitan ester surfactant (sorbitan monostearate [Span 60]), and the cationic lipid DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride). The aqueous phase is a 10 mM sodium citrate trihydrate buffer containing the non-ionic PEGylated surfactant Tween 80. Separately, the two phases were heated and equilibrated to 60°C in a bath sonicator. Following complete dissolution of the solid components, the oil and aqueous phases were mixed at 5,000 rpm in a high-speed laboratory emulsifier (Silverson Machines) to produce a crude mixture containing micron-sized oil droplets. Further particle size reduction was achieved by homogenization in a M-110P microfluidizer (Microfluidics). The crude mixture was processed at 30,000 psi for ten discrete microfluidization passes. The final pH was between 5.5 and 6.0. Formulations were filtered with a 0.2 μm polyethersulfone membrane syringe filter and stored at 2°C to 8°C. RNA was complexed with NLC at a nitrogen-to-phosphate ratio of 5, diluting NLC in 10 mM citrate buffer and RNA in a 20% sucrose solution and complexing on ice for 30 min prior to use.
