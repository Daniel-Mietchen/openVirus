<p id="p0025">For proof-of-principle studies of this RNA gene-delivery platform, we tested delivery of a human antibody to Zika virus (ZIKV), which has high overall public health importance because of the recent large epidemics of this viral disease.

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We developed constructs to express a previously described human mAb, ZIKV-117, using alphavirus replicons. ZIKV-117 is a potently neutralizing mAb with broad activity against African and Asian lineages of ZIKV and binds a quaternary interdimer epitope on the viral envelope protein.

 </xref> A recombinant ZIKV-117 mAb previously was shown to protect against lethal viral challenge in both pregnant and non-pregnant mouse models. We recently described the development of a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) to mediate non-viral delivery of replicon RNA (repRNA)
