<p id="p0015">A possible solution to these problems is to shift the production of mAbs to the patient’s own cells by delivering the desired antibody in the form of cDNA or mRNA molecules encoding the antibody IgG protein. This approach eliminates the protein manufacturing pipeline and instead uses a universal cell-free production and purification process that is independent of the encoded antibody nucleotide sequence.

While intramuscular (IM) electroporation of plasmid DNA encoding antibody genes has been effective in mice, scaling to larger animals remains a challenge. Also, the requirement for nuclear delivery of inoculated cDNA for subsequent mRNA transcription to occur poses a safety concern due to a possible risk of genome integration.
