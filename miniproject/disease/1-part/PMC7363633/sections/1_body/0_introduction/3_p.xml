 </xref> Advances in formulations have improved mRNA stability and delivery across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm where protein translation can occur directly, eliminating a dependence on nuclear delivery. To date, most applications of mRNA-encoded antibodies have used an intravenous (i.v.) route of administration, targeting the highly vascularized liver or spleen in which it is easier to achieve the necessary number of transfected cells required for the expression of therapeutic levels of antibody in serum.

Intramuscular delivery of mRNA-encoded antibodies could enable the rapid distribution of an effective therapy to a population of individuals in an outbreak setting, but this injection route has largely failed in the past, likely due to the limited number of target cells in the inoculation site. To achieve effective expression of antibodies by RNA delivery following intramuscular administration, we used a replicating viral RNA
