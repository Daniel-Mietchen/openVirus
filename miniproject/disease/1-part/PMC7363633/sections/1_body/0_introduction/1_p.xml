<p id="p0010">While the commercial application and impact of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is immense, the necessary quality and regulatory control associated with the complex manufacturing process poses an impediment to realizing their full potential. Currently there are over 80 licensed mAb therapeutics but only one of those, palivizumab, is used in humans as a passive-immunotherapy against a viral infection.

 </xref> Given the recent emergence of several viral zoonotic diseases, such as those associated with infection by Zika virus, chikungunya virus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome virus, and the potential for outbreaks of pandemic diseases such as influenza or those yet to be identified, there is an urgent need to develop the capacity to respond swiftly to future biothreats. The current manufacturing paradigm includes recombinant immunoglobulin G (IgG) protein production in mammalian cell lines followed by a purification process that must be optimized for each target antibody. These IgG protein products then are qualified rigorously in a series of assays to characterize the many biochemical features that are important for their stability or biological activity.

 </xref> In addition to the resulting long timeline for development of IgG protein drug products, on the order of years, these processes are costly, limiting their use in an outbreak scenario.
