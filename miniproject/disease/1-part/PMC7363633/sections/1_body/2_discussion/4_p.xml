<p id="p0110">First, in the optimization of bicistronic expression of heterodimers of H and L chains in the context of plasmid DNA, others have established that cap-mediated translation of the L chain followed by IRES-mediated translation of the H chain (L-EMCV-H) resulted in optimal secretion of IgG from Chinese hamster ovary cells

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> However, the same finding was not observed in the context of repRNA-based expression where IRES-mediated translation was more efficient than cap-mediated translation of the upstream ORF. In this case the H-EMCV-L orientation resulted in higher peak antibody secretion 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, correlating with higher expression of the L chain. This finding could be due to early IRES-mediated translation of the downstream antibody ORF directly from the repRNA genome prior to subgenomic RNA transcription-dependent expression of the upstream antibody ORF, which occurs later in the replication cycle of alphavirus repRNAs. Alternatively, alphaviruses replicate in host lipid-derived spherules where high concentrations of host and viral factors may favor IRES- rather than cap-mediated translation.
