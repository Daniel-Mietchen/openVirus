<p id="p0135">In summary, we have optimized the expression of human IgG from repRNA to enable production of protective levels in mice following intramuscular administration from 7 days before and up to 1 day after viral challenge. If we can successfully translate this approach into larger animals and eventually humans, it may become possible to deploy inhibitory antibodies in response to epidemics. Of course, such an approach requires a complementary, rapid antibody discovery platform against emerging pathogens, many of which are under active development.</p>
