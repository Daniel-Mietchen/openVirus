<p id="p0105">To further improve antibody secretion from repRNA-transfected cells, we performed a series of optimization experiments, first identifying optimal signal peptides, and then screening a variety of IRES sequences in the context of repRNA-mediated expression, and finally assessing the effect of H- and L-chain orientation around the IRES or T2A intergenic sequences. While improvements between mAb ZIKV-117 repRNA constructs 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> were modest (about 4-fold), we achieved serum antibody concentrations as high as 3.4 μg/mL in immunocompetent mice following IM injection, which was sufficient to protect against death. Furthermore, 100% of mice were protected when RNA was administered 7, 5, or 1 day before and up to 1 day after challenge. Due to a growing number of reports on nucleic acid-encoded antibodies, it is worth discussing three major observations in our studies within the context of previous publications on antibodies encoded in plasmid DNA, non-replicating mRNA, and repRNA RNA, including the optimization of bicistronic constructs, the use of two monocistronic constructs, and the targeting of muscle versus liver tissue.
