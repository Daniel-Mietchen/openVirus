<p id="p0120">Targeting muscle tissue for antibody expression poses challenges including adequate number of target cells and suitability of this cell type for secretion of large quantities of antibodies. While antibody-RNA applications mediating protection following IM administration have not been reported to date, a number of applications of plasmid DNA for

To facilitate electroporation of more target muscle cells, we pre-administered hyaluronidase with plasmid DNA to achieve better dispersal of the injection volume, resulting in serum antibody concentrations between 2 and 6.2 μg/mL following a 10 μg dose of DNA encoding either an antibody specific for influenza virus or ebolavirus.
