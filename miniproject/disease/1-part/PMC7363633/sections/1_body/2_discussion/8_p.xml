<p id="p0130">Although a repRNA strategy offers advantages over non-replicating mRNA for expression of antibodies following IM administration, significant improvements in protein secretion may still be needed for optimal expression in larger animals. While we were able to demonstrate protection in mice when repRNA was administered before the enhancing effects of IFNAR1-blockade, 7 or 5 days prior to challenge, protection following RNA administration 1 day before or after challenge was facilitated by temporary blockade of IFNAR1, with waning antibody concentrations observed when RNA was administered 3 days after challenge (4 days after IFNAR1 blockade), resulting in no protective efficacy. The latter observation is likely due to administration of repRNA at a later time following IFNAR1 blockade combined with increasing ZIKV viremia depleting the amount of measurable ZIKV-117 antibody. However, the observation that mice receiving IFNAR1 blockade 1 day prior to IM injections with ZIKV-117 repRNA exhibited relatively high concentrations of ZIKV-117 (e.g., 7.5 μg/mL), indicates that muscle cells can achieve high levels of protein secretion. The presence of intact type I IFN signaling presumably restricts the replication and translation steps of repRNA-mediated gene expression, which limits antibody levels. We are actively pursuing genetic strategies that modify the repRNA to antagonize innate immunity more effectively and augment protein secretion and IgG accumulation from muscle cells.</p>
