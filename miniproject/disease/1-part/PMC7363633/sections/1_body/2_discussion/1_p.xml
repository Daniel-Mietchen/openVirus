<p id="p0095">mAb countermeasures are a major strategy in the treatment and prevention of disease. Recently, the mAb therapy field has shifted toward optimization of formulations for subcutaneous delivery after evidence that a change from i.v. infusions to subcutaneous injections of trastuzumab and rituximab reduced costs and burden on the healthcare system and was preferred by patients.

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Given the emerging role of mRNA gene delivery in mAb therapeutics, we aimed to develop an alternative mRNA strategy that could be administered by the IM route to avoid challenges associated with the i.v. route of administration. Furthermore, there is a need to optimize mRNA-mediated antibody gene delivery platforms for less complex routes of administration to facilitate deployment during epidemics to control outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.
