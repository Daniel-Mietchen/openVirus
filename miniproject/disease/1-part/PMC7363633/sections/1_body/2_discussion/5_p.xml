<p id="p0115">Second, we were unable to express functional antibody 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> upon co-transfection of two repRNAs independently encoding the H and L chains, while it has been established that plasmid DNAs or non-replicating mRNAs encoding each chain separately mediate very efficient expression of functional antibody. This finding may be due to differences in delivery formulation. Previous studies generally have used electroporation or LNPs, respectively, which could mediate efficient co-delivery of each DNA or RNA species into the same cell. In contrast, the specific conditions we used with NLC for co-transfection of two repRNA species may not have achieved efficient co-transfection. Alternatively, differences between replicating and non-replicating mRNA and DNA could explain this discrepancy. Due to the virus-like nature of repRNA, other mechanisms could be at play that inhibit the formation of monomeric IgG when each chain is encoded on a separate repRNA, such as competition between repRNAs within the same cell or host responses including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

 </xref> As described in the results above, we did observe significant cell death in the high dose 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transfections of the IRES, T2A, and 2 repRNA constructs, while little to no cell death was observed for the scFv construct at the same dose. Perhaps expression of the H chain in the absence of, or out-of-synchrony with, expression of L chain triggers cell death via ER stress due to accumulation of H chains in the ER.
