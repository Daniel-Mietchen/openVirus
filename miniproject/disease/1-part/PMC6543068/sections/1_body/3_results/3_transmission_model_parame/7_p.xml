<p id="par0195">We observed some correlations in the estimated parameters. In particular there were strong positive correlations within the relative susceptibility by age parameters. The within household transmission coefficient for RSV A was strongly positively correlated with the within household transmission coefficient for RSV B. The age effects of susceptibility were strongly negatively correlated with the age effects on community exposure. Figure A. 8 in the Supplementary index shows all the pairwise correlation patterns.</p>
