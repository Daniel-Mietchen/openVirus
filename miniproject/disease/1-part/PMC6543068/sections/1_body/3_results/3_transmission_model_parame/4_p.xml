<p id="par0180">Although there is suggestion that pre-school individuals are the least likely to acquire infection from the community, and school-age individuals and older are the most likely to acquire community infection, the evidence is very weak: the relative estimate for age groups 1–4 years is 
 <italic>Exp.age.2</italic> = 0.56 (0.21–1.5) while for age group ≥5 years is 
 <italic>Exp.age.3</italic> = 1.9 (0.78–4.2). Symptomatic individuals are more infectious than asymptomatic individuals, more so those with high viral load, the relative estimate for high viral load symptomatic shedders is given as 
 <italic>High.Sym</italic> = 6.7 (2.6–16). However there are not enough instances where individuals have high viral load and are asymptomatic to quantify the relative infectiousness of this specific combination, the relative estimate for high viral load asymptomatic shedders, 
 <italic>High.Asym</italic>, has a very wide 95% CrI. Given 71,132 person days of observation (493 individuals * 180 days of data, minus days individuals were away), 1021 had RSV A shedding, of which 49 were asymptomatic high viral load shedding days, and 1227 had RSV B shedding with 49 days of asymptomatic high viral load shedding. Given the inability to distinguish between the infectiousness of high versus low viral load asymptomatic shedders, we will not make this distinction in subsequent results and instead just refer to asymptomatic shedders in general.
