<p id="par0205">To check if any information is lost when we have less data, we refitted the data in three additional ways: RSV A alone, RSV B alone and RSV with no distinction between groups. The results are shown in Table A. 1 in the Supplementary index. In reducing the data used to infer parameters we notice that more posterior densities for the relative effect parameters now include 1 in their 95% credible interval, as can be expected. In general, the trends with age, household size and relative infectiousness, as seen in Figure A.6, are maintained. However, when RSV is treated as one entity, the protective effect of previous infection is reduced, symptomatic cases are more infectious and the estimate of the community transmission coefficient is increased. This suggests that misclassification of viruses disrupts the ability of the model to track transmission patterns, resulting in a greater propensity to account for infections as spontaneous.</p>
