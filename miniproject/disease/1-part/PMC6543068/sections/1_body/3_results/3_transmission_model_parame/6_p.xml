<p id="par0190">Given two competing sources of infection, an infectious housemate and a source outside of the household, a susceptible individual is more likely to get infected within the household rather than from the community. There is a suggestion that RSV A has a higher transmission potential at the household level relative to RSV B, while the situation is reversed at the community level. However, there is considerable overlap between the distributions of within household transmission coefficient for RSV A and that for RSV B as seen in Figure A.6, which shows the distribution of the parameters on the log scale, which is mirrored in the rate of household exposure shown in
