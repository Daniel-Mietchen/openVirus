<p id="par0200">Given the posterior densities for the parameters, we calculated the source with the highest likelihood for each infection. While respecting the correlation patterns observed in Figure A.8, we sampled 10 different parameter sets and for each, we calculated the proportion of cases whose most likely source was an infectious housemate. The changes made to the likelihood equation to allow for this calculation are described in the Supplementary appendix. For all the infection cases, 32–53% of them were attributed to transmission within the household. For RSV A, this range was 40–59%, while for RSV B it was 26–48%.</p>
