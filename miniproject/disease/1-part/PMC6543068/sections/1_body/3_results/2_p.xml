 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> gives a summary of the shedding episodes in the data. This particular outbreak had more RSV B cases than RSV A, with a significant portion of cases being symptomatic both for RSV A and B. Eighty five percent of the households that were successfully followed up had an introduction of an RSV case. In addition to the information in 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; 28 (13.5%) of the total 208 episodes were censored during imputation; of the A and B episodes, 14 (6.7%) were simultaneous RSV A and B shedding episodes, 7 (3.3%) of which had a simultaneous onset; of the 179 individuals who got infected 31 (17.3%) were &lt;1 year old, 41 (22.9%) were 1–4 years, 66 (36.9%) were 5–14 years and 41 (22.9%) ≥15 years old. Of the symptomatic infected individuals, 28 (25.7%) were &lt;1 year old, 35 (32.1%) were 1–4 years, 36 (33%) were 5–14 years and 10 (9.2%) ≥15 years old.
