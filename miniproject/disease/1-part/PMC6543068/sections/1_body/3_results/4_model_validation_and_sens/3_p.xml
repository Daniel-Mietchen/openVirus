<p id="par0215">We performed a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of our results to the background community density function. We used 3 additional background functions and found that despite a change in summary values for the parameters, in general the trends were maintained. These results are shown in the Supplementary appendix. They show that the results are robust to the choice in the shape of background community density function.</p>
