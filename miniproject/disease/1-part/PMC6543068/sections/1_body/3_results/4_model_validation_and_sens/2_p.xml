<p id="par0210">To validate the model we checked to see that the range of simulated epidemics contained the real data; then we chose a single simulation with known parameters and re-estimated to see if the posterior distribution contained the known values. Details of this process can be found in the Supplementary appendix, but in general, we were satisfied that the model was working as expected. 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows multiple simulated epidemics for different parameter sets relative to the real data. From this we see that as with the real data, the simulations show the RSV B epidemic taking off earlier than the RSV A epidemic. There is a tendency for simulate epidemics to be larger than that observed in terms of total number of cases (Figure A.23).
