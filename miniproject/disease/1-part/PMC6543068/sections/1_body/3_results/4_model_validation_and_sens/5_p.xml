<p id="par0225">Following the validation of the model, we simulated epidemics altering the degree of infectiousness. Initially we reduced the infectiousness of symptomatic individuals to predict the effect of reducing RSV related ARI; then we assumed that asymptomatic individuals are not infectious in order to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. The results show that reducing infectiousness of symptomatic individuals to the level of asymptomatic individuals lowers the distribution of total number infected. Assuming that asymptomatic individuals are not infectious also tends to decrease the total number infected (see Figure A. 23 in the Supplementary appendix). We also removed the asymptomatic shedding episodes from the data and re-estimated the parameters to check what the effect of only having sampled symptomatic individuals would be. We found that we lose precision in the estimates of the relative infectiousness parameters, previous infection is estimated as being more protective as is being ≥15 years old (Figure A. 24 and A.25).</p>
