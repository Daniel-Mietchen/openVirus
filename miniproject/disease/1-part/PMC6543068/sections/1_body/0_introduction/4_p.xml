<p id="par0015">Prior to vaccine introduction, drivers of transmission need to be well understood in order to predict the potential public health impact of implementation. Investigating outbreaks within the household setting could help to further characterize RSV transmission. The household is an important unit of study for diseases that are transmitted through close contact. The quantitative analysis of household outbreaks has been conducted for influenza (

One of the earliest is a household cohort study in the USA in which 36 families were followed up for 2 months during the 1974/1975 RSV season (

Older siblings to infants were found to be the most likely index cases in household outbreaks, and illness was found to have an age-related severity. Several other studies over the years across different settings have highlighted the importance of older children in household outbreaks (
