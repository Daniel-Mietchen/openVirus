<p id="par0025">RSV can be categorized into two antigenically and genetically distinct groups, RSV A and RSV B (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Cane, 2001</xref>). These groups, thought to have diverged about 350 years ago (
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">Zlateva et al., 2005</xref>), have been observed to co-exist geographically and temporally with most outbreaks being dominated by RSV A and, in some locations, clear patterns of alternating dominance (
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2005</xref>). Within the RSV groups are subgroups or genotypes whose frequency changes from season to season, with some genotypes undergoing complete replacement over time (

 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Thongpan et al., 2017</xref>). This pattern of group and genotype replacement is thought to be due to a herd immunity effect (

 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2005</xref>). A phylogenetic analysis of RSV A sequences from the Kenyan household study showed that most infections arise from a single variant introduction followed by accumulation of household specific variation, i.e. cases arise more from within household spread rather than multiple introductions (
