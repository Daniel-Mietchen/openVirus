<p id="par0030">However, there is yet to be a mechanistic analysis of RSV household outbreak data that consolidates information on the characteristics of infection episodes and characteristics of the host population into a single dynamic framework. Inference could then be drawn on the competing risks of within household exposure and community (external to household) exposure, in order to quantify the importance of households in RSV transmission. We proposed to use an individual-based approach within a Bayesian framework to analyze the household cohort data from Kenya to further understand transmission dynamics. We also explore the differences and interactions between RSV groups.</p>
