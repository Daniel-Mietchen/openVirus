<p id="par0055">We built a mechanistic model for RSV that tracks infection onset at the individual host level. The main assumptions about transmission are contained in the equation giving the per capita rate of exposure (to infection) per unit time, also known as the infection hazard. The rate of exposure to a particular RSV group (index 
 <italic>g</italic>) is given for a particular individual, (index 
 <italic>i</italic>) from a given household (index 
 <italic>h</italic>) at a given day (index 
 <italic>t</italic>) and is specified by the notation 
 <inline-formula>

 </inline-formula>. We assume that an individual can be exposed to infection in the household they occupy and from external infection sources and as such, decompose the rate of exposure into two parts, a within household component and a community component.
