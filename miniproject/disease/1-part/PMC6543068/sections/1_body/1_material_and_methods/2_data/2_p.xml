<p id="par0035">The data to be used were collected from a household cohort study conducted in rural coastal Kenya within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) during the 2009/2010 RSV epidemic. Details of the study have been published elsewhere (

In brief, the infant-centric study recruited household members using the criteria that the infant was born after 1 April 2009 (after the previous RSV epidemic) and had at least 1 older sibling less than 13 years old. Deep nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples were collected every 3â€“4 days regardless of symptoms, together with a record of clinical illness. The samples were tested for RSV antigen using an in-house real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A sample was considered antigen positive if the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value was 35.0 or below. Positive Ct values were then converted to viral load (log
 <sub>10</sub> RNA equivalent). A household was defined as a group of individuals living in the same compound and eat together. The data contain information from 493 individuals spread across 47 households whose dates of data collection span 180 days. The household sizes range from 4 to 37 occupants with a median of 8 members.
