<p id="par0040">An RSV A/B shedding episode is defined as a period within which an individual provided PCR positive samples for RSV A/B that were no more than 14 days apart. A shedding episode is referred as symptomatic if within the window of virus shedding, there is at least one day where symptoms were recorded. The symptoms of interest are those of an acute respiratory illness (ARI), which are: cough, or nasal discharge/blockage, or difficulty breathing. Sampling of the study population was done in 3–4 day intervals, as such, complete duration of shedding and ARI episodes had to be imputed, and missing viral loads were linearly interpolated. Shedding durations were imputed first, after which, if there were any days of recorded ARI within shedding episodes, the total duration of the ARI was imputed based on the days of recorded symptoms. As such, the length of an ARI episode within a shedding episode can be ≤ length of related shedding episode.</p>
