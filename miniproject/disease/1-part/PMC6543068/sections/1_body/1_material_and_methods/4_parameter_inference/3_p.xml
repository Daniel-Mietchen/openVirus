<p id="par0155">Burn-in was assessed visually after which the results of the three concurrent chains were combined to infer the posterior distribution. To obtain fairly accurate values for the 95% credible intervals, we ran the MCMC algorithm until the effective sample size (ESS) was â‰¥ 4000 (
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Raftery and Lewis, 1992</xref>). The three chains were run for 250,000 iterations each and burn-in for each chain was 80,000, 90,000 and 80,000. After burn-in the reminders of the three chains were combined into a single chain with and overall acceptance rate of 16.8%. The parameters were estimated on the log scale. All the computation was done using R software package (RStudio version 1.1.383 running R version 3.4.0 (R
