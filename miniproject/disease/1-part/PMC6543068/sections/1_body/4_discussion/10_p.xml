<p id="par0270">Our study is not without limitations. The households in the study were selected based on the presence of an infant born after the previous RSV epidemic and older siblings to the infant in order to determine who infects the infant. As such the sample is not random and this might introduce bias in the parameter estimates, the extent of which we are uncertain. Relative to other studies, our sample size in terms of number of households is small. However, the intensive sampling regardless of symptoms means we had less biased observation of infections relative to index-case ascertained household studies that rely on symptom reporting by household contacts. In our study we had 47.2% of RSV A and 40.2% of RSV B positive samples that were symptomatic, 60.8% of RSV A and 55.2% of RSV B episodes were symptomatic. Estimation of parameters only using data from symptomatic episodes shows similar parameter estimates, although with loss of precision, especially in terms of differential infectiousness (Figure A. 24). In addition, sampling was done every 3 or 4 days, which means that short duration infections might have been missed, and we do not have serological data to complement the PCR results.</p>
