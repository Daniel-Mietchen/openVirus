<p id="par0275">The present analysis could be extended in several ways. We used interpolated shedding durations; it would be an added advantage to use the data to estimate a distribution of shedding durations that could potentially be more generalizable. The inclusion of other sources of information into the analysis could improve parameter inference, as was the case with Li et al and the inclusion of genetic data (
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The inference made on within-household transmission compared to community transmission is based on the latency distribution that links onset of cases. This is a temporal linking of cases that is not always correct. A combination of temporal and genetic distance would allow better inference on linked cases and consequently the competition between within-household and community source transmission. Finally the RSV A and B model could be used to look at other pathogen interactions and perhaps incorporate more than two pathogens.
