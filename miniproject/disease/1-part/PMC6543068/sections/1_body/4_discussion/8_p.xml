<p id="par0260">We looked at a combination of presence of symptoms and viral load to infer infectiousness. We found that being symptomatic is of key importance. In general, symptomatic individuals were more infectious, particularly if shedding large amounts of virus. Though this result is not surprising it has an important implication on vaccine effectiveness. If an RSV vaccine works by reducing or preventing disease in the form of an ARI, this will in turn have an impact on transmission potential and we should expect to see reduced morbidity and infection. To check what that potential impact of such a vaccine would be, we simulated epidemics where the infectiousness of symptomatic individuals was equal to that of asymptomatic individuals and we found a significant shift in the overall distribution of simulated case towards smaller total numbers infected. The shift was more for ages between 1 and 15 years, given that this group also had the larger fraction of symptomatic cases, the observation from simulations with reduced infectiousness suggests largely assortative mixing within this group, which in turn means largely assortative transmission. The number of cases in the &lt;1 year age group is not greatly altered by reducing the infectiousness of symptomatic individuals, implying that there are several sources of infection to the infant and reducing or removing only one has little impact (Figure A. 23).</p>
