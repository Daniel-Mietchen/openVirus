<p id="par0255">With the definition of a household as a group of individuals living in the same compound and eating food from the same kitchen, we found that the pairwise rate of within household transmission is higher in small households than large ones. However, the total household incidence rate is in general higher for larger households as they have the potential to have larger numbers of infectious individuals at a given time point. The relationship between household size and pair-wise rate of transmission has been observed before for Influenza, (
