<p id="par0280">In conclusion, our analysis presents the first transmission modelling of cohort data for RSV and we find that it is important to factor in household size and social structuring – such as the tendency for households to contain several members of the extended family – when modelling transmission. It is also important to model competing risks of infection from within the household and the community. There are questions on the mechanisms that allow co-existence of RSV groups temporally and geographically. The weak cross immunity between RSV groups demonstrated by our analysis and the possibility of different transmission niches could form part of the explanation for the co-existence.</p>
