<p id="par0235">Older individuals are less susceptible to detectable infection, presumably due to immunity acquired in previous epidemics. We found strong evidence of partial immunity to homologous re-infection within the same epidemic for the RSV groups. The effect of previous infections is captured in two different ways in our model. Age (
 <italic>Sus.age</italic> parameters) captures the combined effect of age and experience of epidemics prior to the one under study, while the estimates for the effect of previous observed infections (
 <italic>Prev.hom</italic> parameter), captures effect of infections in the current epidemic. It is therefore implicit that immunity to RSV is built up in the long term, from one epidemic to the next and in the short term from one infection to the next. The evidence for cross-immunity between RSV A and B was weaker, which presumably allowed the two virus groups to co-circulate in this epidemic. However, typically, RSV epidemics are dominated by one or other of group A or B and so the particular circumstances of this epidemic might not always hold. It remains to be explored how this individual level parameter estimate is translated into population dynamics.
