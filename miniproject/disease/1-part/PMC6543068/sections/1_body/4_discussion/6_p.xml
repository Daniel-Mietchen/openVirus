<p id="par0250">By separating RSV A and RSV B we find that RSV B has a higher rate of introduction into the household, and RSV A is more transmissible once in the household, an observation also made by (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Agoti et al., 2017</xref>) from a phylogenetic analysis of RSV A sequences. This, together with the fact that RSV A had a larger proportion of cases attributed to within household transmission, suggests that there might be some niche separation, explaining how and why these two different groups are able to co-exist and remain separate. It should be noted however that the difference in the distribution of the within household transmission coefficient between the RSV groups is not large, there is a significant overlap of credible intervals. As such, whatever advantage RSV A might have over RSV B at the household level is small in terms of transmission, but might be larger in terms of interaction with other respiratory viruses, and small differences in individual based parameters might translate into large population effects. In the present epidemic, the RSV B epidemic takes off earlier than the RSV A epidemic despite the first case being RSV A (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition to which, we see that despite RSV B infecting more households than RSV A, RSV A infects a larger proportion of household members (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). An examination of the comparative dynamics of RSV A and B within epidemics might be a good way to understand how they interact.
