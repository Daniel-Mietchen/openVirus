<p id="par0240">We found some evidence that individuals aged ≥5 years were the most likely to get infection from a community source (less likely to get infected during a household outbreak). This means that given our assumption of latent periods between 2–5 days, which forms the temporal link between cases, individuals ≥5 years were the most often identified as index cases in a household outbreak relative to the younger age groups. We have not considered an age-dependent latent period, and estimating the latent period from these data is a future goal. The ≥5 years age group contains school going children and our result is in line with those of Munywoki et al (
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Munywoki et al., 2014</xref>), based on a different analysis of the same study, who found that school-going children were often initiating household outbreaks. Establishing transmission chains using genomic information could strengthen this result.
