<p id="par0245">We have assumed that the community risk of infection changes smoothly over time and is homogeneous apart from an age effect. These assumptions are necessary as community infections are not completely observed. We are confident that these assumptions do not have significant influence on our estimates of within-household transmission (which is fully observed), but may result in an over-estimate of community exposure, which will be more heterogeneous than we have assumed. Consequently the simulated epidemics are larger in total numbers than that observed, 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, and our results of up to one half of infections arising from within the household are likely to be a minimum. Data on genetic relatedness between viral isolates will clarify the extent to which individuals are infected from the community during a household outbreak.
