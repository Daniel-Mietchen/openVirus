<p>Following pathogen shedding from reservoir hosts, spillover risk is influenced by the duration of pathogen survival and possible reproduction outside the host in the environment [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For pathogens such as avian influenza virus, persistence in the environment (e.g. ponds) can also facilitate viral reassortment when strains co-occur, promoting co-infections during environmental exposure [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] review and discuss how genomics, experimental ecology and epidemiological modelling can be leveraged to understand viral reassortment in environmental reservoirs. Although no gold standard for capturing, isolating and identifying avian influenza virus diversity from the environment exists, environmental metagenomics and field-based viral diagnostics (e.g. field-based nucleic acid extraction, PCR and sequencing) hold promise for characterizing this context of viral reassortment [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The authors note how standardizing such field protocols and coupling these data streams with quantitative disease models and natural transmission studies should dramatically improve our understanding of viral co-occurrence and reassortment and thus, this additional process in the pathway to spillover.
