<p>Exposure of recipient hosts to pathogens (e.g. those persisting in the environment) can take a variety of forms; however, in a more general sense, exposure often occurs at elevated rates near boundaries between ecosystems [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] review how ecosystem boundaries can promote spillover by applying ecological theory to understand landscape permeability across ecosystems. The authors highlight that the traits of hosts and pathogens are critical for determining effects of ecosystem boundaries on cross-species transmission. Properties of ecosystem boundaries can also promote or inhibit exposure; for example, edge effects can affect species composition, diversity and population size between ecosystems, as can features of landscape configuration such as patch size and perimeter-to-area ratio [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. By considering the analogy between parasite flow and resource flow and by applying concepts from movement ecology, Borremans

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] connect contact rates and spillover risk across ecosystem boundaries to generalize between pathogens and integrate into broader ecological theory.
