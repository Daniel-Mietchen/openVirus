<p>Following the complex interactions between reservoir hosts, vectors, pathogens, the environment and recipient hosts, a crucial juncture in any potential spillover event is the point when a recipient host is challenged with a given dose of pathogen (through a particular route and sometimes over a particular duration) and a successful infection does or does not ensue [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Lunn 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] describe how the dose–response relationship, which quantifies the probability of successful infection in the recipient host as a function of challenge dose, can act as a filter on the aforementioned upstream dynamics to shape pathogen spillover risk. The authors integrate recent developments in the dose–response literature, as well as re-analysing data from animal challenge experiments with Nipah virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], to highlight challenges and opportunities arising at the intersection of infectious disease ecology, microbial risk assessment and virology. Lunn 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] call for closer interactions between these fields and for a new generation of pathogen transmission models that link dose–response data to epidemiological dynamics. Gostic 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] next provide an example of the epidemiological insights such an approach can yield. They present a modelling analysis of dose–response experiments for 
 <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic>, a globally important bacterial zoonosis for which environmental exposure to soil or water contaminated by urine of infected reservoir hosts is the primary transmission route [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. By conducting well-designed challenge experiments across a range of exposure routes, and then developing a mechanistic model to identify and quantify the key barriers to infection, Gostic 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] show that intact skin is the crucial defence against leptospiral infection and that skin abrasions or wounds can increase recipient host infection risk by at least a million-fold. This close integration of experimental and modelling approaches isolates a potent and well-defined risk factor for infection with 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>, opening the door to targeted interventions to reduce spillover risk.
