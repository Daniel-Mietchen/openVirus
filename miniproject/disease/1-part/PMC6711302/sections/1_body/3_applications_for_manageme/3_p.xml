<p>Two other contributions focus on zoonotic pathogen surveillance efforts in domestic animals and human populations. Mwangi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] present a real-time surveillance system that leverages the existing mobile phone network and shows immense potential to improve adaptive management of spillover. This surveillance system has been implemented in 1500 households across rural Kenya, where participants are asked to report symptom syndromes in their livestock. Zoonotic diseases such as Rift Valley fever present with severe clinical signs in domestic animal populations, but lack of active surveillance can miss these sentinels [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The authors demonstrate that illnesses were more likely to be reported on mobile phones compared with standard routine household animal surveys. They also show that more severe symptoms are likely to be reported, highlighting the utility of this surveillance method for diseases such as Rift Valley fever. Das 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] similarly describe the implementation of a surveillance system in hospitals in Bangladesh that screens symptomatic patients for potential zoonoses. Most patients did not have a laboratory diagnosis for their illness, indicating that unidentified pathogens are likely spilling over in human populations. Broad-scale, sustainable human surveillance programmes such as outlined by the authors can play a critical role in early detection of zoonotic spillovers.
