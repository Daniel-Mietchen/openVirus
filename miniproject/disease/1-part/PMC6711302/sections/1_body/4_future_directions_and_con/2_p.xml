<p>Pathogen spillover is the result of a complex series of events that result in the successful establishment of infection in a recipient host [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As highlighted in the final paper of this theme issue, developing actionable forecasts of risk is further complicated by the various phylogenetic, spatial and temporal scales over which we study and predict spillover [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The authors here contextualize a diverse range of approaches to pathogen spillover within these scales to illustrate critical areas of pragmatic overlap. By focusing on an ecological perspective, the authors outline a research pipeline that connects pathogen discovery and macroecological analyses with spatio-temporal surveillance in reservoir and recipient hosts. Through several case studies (e.g. Lyme disease [

 <italic>Plasmodium knowlesi</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]), the authors further demonstrate how ecologically focused research has facilitated predicting spillover of particular pathogens in space and time and facilitated design of intervention strategies. This synthesis shows how greater integration of macroecology, pathogen discovery and surveillance could ultimately generate more actionable predictions and interventions to limit spillover risks.
