<p>Recent epidemics, pandemics and disease emergence events all underscore the need to improve approaches to predict and prevent pathogen spillover. This theme issue highlights a range of methods and their commonalities through diverse hostâ€“pathogen systems for which researchers are assessing factors driving spillover risk across varying phylogenetic, spatial and temporal scales. Contributing manuscripts further emphasize how developing a mechanistic understanding of the hierarchical factors affecting spillover can facilitate quantifying the drivers of cross-species transmission, deriving generalizable theory and making robust predictions, even for seemingly rare and idiosyncratic spillover events. Importantly, such insights can improve our ability to deploy surveillance efforts, design interventions at early stages of the pathway to spillover and manage disease cases in recipient hosts, thereby limiting or preventing further outbreaks. Continued study of pathogen spillover as a repeated and hierarchical phenomenon will only improve our ability to predict, prevent and manage cross-species transmission risks.</p>
