Extra-hepatic manifestations of HEV infection may stem from various causes; however, its distribution in organs such as the liver, as well as the mechanisms underlying HEV-induced cell injury, remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the chronological distribution of HEV in various tissues of HEV-challenged miniature pigs and to investigate the mechanisms underlying HEV-induced cell death in the pancreas and liver. Virological and serological analyses were performed on blood and faecal samples. Histopathology of the liver and extra-hepatic tissues was analysed. Cell death pathways and immune cell characterisation in inflammatory lesions were analysed using immunohistochemistry. The liver and pancreas displayed inflammation and cellular injury, and a large amount of HEV was observed in the lesions. The liver was infiltrated by T and natural killer cells. HEV was identified in all organs except the heart, and was associated with immune cells. Although the liver and the pancreas strongly expressed TNF-&#x003b1; and TRAIL, TUNEL assay results were negative. RIP3 and pMLKL were expressed in the pancreas. RIP3, but not pMLKL, was expressed in the liver. Pancreatitis induced in HEV-infected miniature pigs is associated with necroptosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Virology</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003710</institution-id><institution>Korea Health Industry Development Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI16C0973</award-id><award-id>HI16C0973</award-id><award-id>HI16C0973</award-id><award-id>HI16C0973</award-id><award-id>HI16C0973</award-id><award-id>HI16C0973</award-id><award-id>HI16C0973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Soontag</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeo</surname><given-names>Daseul</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhaoqi</given-names></name><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Ae</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ziwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Mengxiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Changsun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Soontag</given-names></name><name><surname>Seo</surname><given-names>Dong Joo</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeo</surname><given-names>Daseul</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhaoqi</given-names></name><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Ae</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ziwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Mengxiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>In-Soo</given-names></name><name><surname>Myoung</surname><given-names>Jinjong</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Changsun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Worldwide, 14 million symptomatic infections, 5,200 stillbirths, and 300,000 deaths are attributed to hepatitis E virus (HEV) according to the World Health Organisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. While HEV infection is mostly associated with large epidemics in developing countries, autochthonous sporadic cases are on the rise in industrialised countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the UK, hepatitis E cases have been increasing since 2009, with an estimated annual infection rate of 200,000, which is largely attributed to the consumption of pork products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Clinical symptoms of HEV are mainly associated with acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, or chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients and the elderly. HEV genotype 1 and 2 infection is associated with high mortality rates (up to 25%) in pregnant women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Extra-hepatic lesions, including acute pancreatitis, renal failure, neurological diseases, haematological diseases, and the Guillain&#x02013;Barre syndrome, are linked with HEV infection, cases of which are increasing. However, its pathogenesis is not well understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.
</p><p id="Par3">Although several in vivo and in vitro models have been proposed for the purpose of cultivating HEV or mimicking HEV infection in laboratory animals, including rabbits, mice and rats, such in vivo models have not been successful in demonstrating the clinical symptoms of HEV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The use of non-human primates and conventional pig models is limited by high maintenance costs, difficulties in manipulation, and the need for many personnel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Miniature pigs have been experimentally infected with HEV genotypes 1, 3, and 4; they are susceptible to genotypes 3 and 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Extra-hepatic manifestations have not yet been modelled because existing studies on miniature pig models have focused to the liver. In clinical cases, 55 patients with hepatitis E in India, Nepal, Poland, and France were diagnosed with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis. Although the association between other hepatitis virus infections and acute pancreatitis is well known, the presence of HEV in the human pancreas has not been clearly proven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Presently, HEV pathogenesis in the pancreas has not been elucidated in animal models or humans.</p><p id="Par4">HEV infection occurs in humans from all age groups, but mainly in the elderly, who usually suffer from chronic diseases such as hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, and hypertension. Hepatitis E patients with hypercholesterolaemia are generally prescribed simvastatin, which lowers the blood cholesterol levels and enhances the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. As the cholesterol pathway is closely associated with infection by enteric viruses, including HEV and norovirus, treatment with statin drugs may enhance the replication of these viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The objective of this study was to analyse the localisation and dynamics of HEV in the liver and other organs in miniature pigs experimentally infected with HEV. HEV-induced cell damage was investigated to unravel the mechanism underlying HEV-induced cell death. In addition, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on HEV infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Establishment of HEV gt3 infection in miniature pigs</title><p id="Par6">HEV RNA was detected in the plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and faeces by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). HEV RNA was not detected in any of the pre-infection samples, and animals in the two mock groups tested negative throughout the experiment. Faecal virus shedding was the highest at 7&#x000a0;days post infection (dpi) and was observed in 11/12 (91.6%) and 9/12 (75%) of pigs in the HEV group and HEV&#x02009;+&#x02009;sim group, respectively, and gradually decreased, and both groups were not detected at 28 dpi in both groups. Similarly, caecal contents all tested positive until 21 dpi and turned negative at 28 dpi (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Although cell-free viraemia was not detected in the two inoculation groups, cell-associated viraemia was detected in 6/12 (50%) and 7/12 (58%) pigs from 3 dpi onwards, and was maintained at more than 50% until 28 dpi. There was no difference in the HEV RNA titre between any of the samples from the pigs in the two groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

</p><p id="Par12">The expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3), a critical regulator of necroptosis, was investigated. A significant level of RIP3 expression was observed in hepatocytes around lymphocyte-infiltrated lesions, where RIP3 was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm and to a lower extent in the nuclei (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). In the pancreas, RIP3 was strongly expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D). The two mock groups showed mild RIP3 expression in the nuclei in the liver and pancreas. Subsequently, we examined the expression of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), which functions downstream of RIP3 as a key executioner of necroptosis. In the pancreas, pMLKL was predominantly expressed in morphologically changed acinar cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E). RIP3-positive hepatocytes did not co-express pMLKL, and pMLKL expression was observed only in individual immune cells in the liver (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par13">Although HEV infection has been well researched, much is unclear regarding its pathogenesis, for example, the transmission of HEV to the liver via the faecal-oral route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Various cases with extra-hepatic symptoms of the virus have been reported, perhaps indicating an extra-hepatic replication site, but few have been experimentally proven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Yucatan miniature pigs, which are similar to humans in anatomy and physiology, are widely used as experimental animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The structure and function of the swine immune system are more than 80% similar to those of the human immune system. Thus, the swine model may represent pathogenic and immune responses that are similar to those seen in human infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, pigs are natural hosts of HEV gt3, and miniature pigs have been successfully infected with HEV under experimental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, we surmised that a miniature pig HEV infection model would be most suitable for the investigation of extra-hepatic manifestation aimed at enhancing the understanding of HEV pathogenesis.</p><p id="Par14">Acute pancreatitis is a well-known complication of viral hepatitis, but the mechanism whereby it causes cell injury remains unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. HEV-induced necrotising pancreatitis has recently been reported, excluding other causes of acute pancreatitis, such as gallstones, alcohol, drugs, trauma, hypercalcemia, and hypertriglyceridemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Unlike the case for other hepatitis viruses, such as HAV, HBV, and HCV, the presence of HEV in the pancreas is unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To date, HEV inducing necrotising pancreatitis has been genotyped in only one patient, and was identified as HEV gt1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. It is not known whether HEV gt1 has high tropism for the pancreas or whether it causes pancreatitis due to genetic susceptibility of the patient. The pancreas, which we focused on in our study, exhibited extensive histological changes, an abundance of HEV, and the development of necroptosis. Therefore, it may be said that this study elucidated the mechanism underlying the pancreatic injury associated with HEV infection and identified that such pancreatitis can be caused by HEV gt3 and is not limited to strains of HEV gt1. In previous studies, RIP3 expression did not match TUNEL staining, as it did in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, staining with propidium iodide, an indicator of cell viability based on membrane permeability, indicated strong co-localisation. Necroptosis is also termed programmed cell necrosis because it has characteristics similar to those of necrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, the indicator of cell death is more likely to be related to necrosis than to apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Necroptosis can be triggered by various stimuli, the most-studied stimulus being TNF signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. When TNF-&#x003b1; binds to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNFR1-associated death domain protein binds to the intracellular domain of TNFR1. Subsequently, Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase 8 are recruited to form the death-inducing signalling complex, which causes apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Inhibition of caspase activity during the course of this process alternatively activates RIP3, following which RIP3 signalling phosphorylates and oligomerises MLKL downstream, resulting in necroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Further research is required to reveal the mechanism underlying caspase inhibition by HEV. Necroptosis is a recently discovered cell death pathway that is assuming importance as a topic in the field of inflammatory diseases, including acute pancreatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Recent studies have identified necrotising pancreatitis as a major determinant of mortality associated with HEV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This study suggests a link between necroptosis and necrotising pancreatitis caused by HEV. The presence of HEV in the pancreas sharply decreased after 21 dpi, which was in line with the pattern of faecal shedding. This suggests that pancreatic infection may be responsible for faecal shedding of HEV.</p><p id="Par15">HEV is a hepatotropic virus and thus, the primary site of HEV replication is the liver. However, the path by which HEV reaches the liver remains unclear. Because inducing oral HEV infection in animal models poses difficulties, most studies focus on symptoms that develop after HEV reaches the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In some previous studies, the HEV antigen was observed in infiltrating inflammatory cells and Kupffer cells, whereas in other studies, it was observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In our study, HEV was continuously detected in lymphoid tissues and PBMCs, from the early stages of infection until the end of the experiment. It was rarely present in hepatocytes at 7 dpi, but multiplied in hepatocytes following liver infiltration by HEV-infected immune cells, presumably, T cells or NK cells. It was found that infected immune cells delivered HEV to hepatocytes via cell-to-cell transmission. In HEV-infected patients, NK/NKT cells showed a significant decrease in degranulation activity directly related to cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Based on this finding, it was postulated that HEV is transmitted via impaired immunological synapses generated between infected T/NK/NKT cells and hepatocytes. However, further research is required to verify this. The liver showed no signs of cell death in the form of either apoptosis or necroptosis. Although the TUNEL assay detects only the late stages of apoptosis that follow extensive DNA fragmentation, and not the early stages of apoptosis, no satisfactory signals were detected in the liver throughout the experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Compared with that in the pancreas, RIP3 expression was stronger in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, although it was substantially lower in the nucleus. RIP3 is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein that is phosphorylated in the nucleus, and nuclear export of phosphorylated RIP3 to the cytoplasm induces necrosome formation, leading to necroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, necroptosis of hepatocytes is not induced by insufficient nuclear&#x02013;cytoplasmic export. There are several possible reasons why necroptosis does not occur in the liver. One possibility is associated with the strain and virulence of the virus. HEV gt3 used in this study may be a low-pathogenic strain as it was isolated from the faeces of pigs that did not exhibit significant clinical symptoms. In a previous study in which rabbits were inoculated with genotype 1 or 4, ALT levels increased only in rabbits inoculated with genotype 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Similarly, in chimpanzees inoculated with genotype 1, 3, or 4, only chimpanzees inoculated with genotype 4 displayed elevated ALT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A second possibility relates to the dose of HEV used. Clinical and immunological progression of HEV in humans and animal models is known to be dose-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In this study, the amount of HEV in the liver was less than that in the pancreas and was insufficient to induce necroptosis, which may be associated with the dose&#x02013;response pattern of HEV infection. This possible explanation requires verification in high-dose, long-term studies using various HEV strains.</p><p id="Par16">Extra-hepatic localisation of HEV has been frequently observed. HEV RNA was localised in the immune cells of the lamina propria rather than in enterocytes in the colons of pigs naturally infected with HEV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In rabbit and monkey models, HEV antigens were found in interstitial and infiltrated immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In particular, HEV antigens were detected in lymphoid tissues before they were detected in the liver. Thus, lymphoid tissue is presumed to be a replication site prior to the liver. Negative-strand-specific RT-PCR confirmed the replication of viral RNA in the tonsils and intestines in human HEV-infected pigs before it was detected in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, which is in line with the findings in this study.</p><p id="Par17">The presence of HEV in the brain has been observed in various animal models, and the possibility of in vivo and in vitro replication in neuronal cells has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Peripheral neurological disorders, Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, and neuralgic amyotrophy are strongly associated with HEV infection in humans, although this has not been experimentally substantiated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Our study not only revealed the presence of HEV in peripheral nerves, but also indicated that HEV may be transmitted to the nervous system in a retrograde manner. These findings were obtained following intravenous virus inoculation, which has several advantages over the faecal&#x02013;oral route. When HEV enters the host orally, it replicates in the primary site and then spreads to various target organs. This process takes a long time, during which the host cells initiate various immune responses. In contrast, upon intravenous administration, which results in a high virus titre in the blood from the early stage of infection, the virus would have spread more easily. However, our findings provide a rationale for the distribution of HEV in the body and the pathogenesis associated with cell damage caused thereby.</p><p id="Par18">Simvastatin administered for immunosuppression and efficient replication of HEV significantly affected only the IFN-&#x003b3; levels. IFN-&#x003b3; levels increased only in the HEV&#x02009;+&#x02009;sim group at 28 dpi, whereas it was hardly expressed in the other groups. This result was presumably associated with the activation of NK/NKT cells during HEV infection. NK/NKT cells reportedly are rapidly activated in patients with acute HEV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In addition, HCV activates NK cells by consuming IFN-&#x003b3;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. HEV also consumes IFN-&#x003b3; during the activation of NK/NKT cells. However, IFN-&#x003b3; levels were elevated in the HEV&#x02009;+&#x02009;sim group, suggesting that simvastatin reduced IFN-&#x003b3;-induced MHC class II expression on antigen-presenting cells, thereby lowering the NK/NKT cell activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Simvastatin treatment increased human norovirus infectivity in gnotobiotic pig models, possibly by inhibiting innate immunity and lowering cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. However, the effect of simvastatin on HEV infection in the miniature pig model was limited, presumably due to differences in the infection mechanisms of HEV and norovirus.</p><p id="Par19">In conclusion, the present study showed that HEV gt3 causes pancreatitis in pigs and that injury to pancreatic cells is associated with necroptosis. In addition, HEV is distributed to immune cells in various organs, including the liver.
