<p id="Par23">RT-qPCR was used to detect HEV RNA in faeces, plasma, and PBMCs. The qPCR mixture (25 μl) consisted of 9 μl of nuclease-free water, 12.5 μl of Premix Ex Taq (2 ×), forward and reverse primers at 400 nM each, probes at 200 nM, and 1 μl of cDNA. RT-qPCRs were run in a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan)
