<p id="Par26">For histopathological examination purposes, tissue slides were stained using haematoxylin and eosin. For IHC, slides were deparaffinised and rehydrated, washed, and subjected to antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched and non-specific immunoreactivity was blocked using normal serum. Then, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies, rinsed, and incubated with avidin–biotin-HRP complex (Vector Laboratories). To visualise immunoreaction sites, the sections were incubated with DAB solution (Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin, dehydrated, clarified, and sealed using permanent mounting medium under coverslips.</p>
