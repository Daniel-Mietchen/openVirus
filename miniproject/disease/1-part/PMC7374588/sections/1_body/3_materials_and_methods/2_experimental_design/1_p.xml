<p id="Par21">Thirty 8-week-old SPF Yucatan miniature pigs were tested for the HEV antigen and the most significant pig viral pathogens (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, classical swine fever virus, swine influenza virus, Aujeszky’s disease virus, porcine circovirus type 2) using ELISA. Pigs were divided into four groups: (i) group HEV (n = 12) was intravenously injected with 1.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> genome equivalents of HEV gt3; (ii) group HEV + simvastatin (HEV + sim; n = 12) was administered 8 mg/kg of simvastatin via the oral route for 6 days prior to virus inoculation, intravenously infected with 1.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> genome equivalents of HEV gt3, and administered 4 mg/kg simvastatin for 5 more days following inoculation; (iii) group mock + simvastatin (mock + sim; n = 3) was treated in a manner similar to group HEV + sim, except for HEV inoculation; and (iv) group mock infection (mock; n = 3) was treated with PBS
