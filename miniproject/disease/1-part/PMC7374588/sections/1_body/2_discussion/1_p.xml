<p id="Par13">Although HEV infection has been well researched, much is unclear regarding its pathogenesis, for example, the transmission of HEV to the liver via the faecal-oral route

 </sup>. Various cases with extra-hepatic symptoms of the virus have been reported, perhaps indicating an extra-hepatic replication site, but few have been experimentally proven

 </sup>. The structure and function of the swine immune system are more than 80% similar to those of the human immune system. Thus, the swine model may represent pathogenic and immune responses that are similar to those seen in human infectious diseases

 </sup>. Furthermore, pigs are natural hosts of HEV gt3, and miniature pigs have been successfully infected with HEV under experimental conditions

 </sup>. Therefore, we surmised that a miniature pig HEV infection model would be most suitable for the investigation of extra-hepatic manifestation aimed at enhancing the understanding of HEV pathogenesis.
