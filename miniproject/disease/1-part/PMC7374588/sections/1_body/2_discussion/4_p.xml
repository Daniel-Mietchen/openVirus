<p id="Par16">Extra-hepatic localisation of HEV has been frequently observed. HEV RNA was localised in the immune cells of the lamina propria rather than in enterocytes in the colons of pigs naturally infected with HEV

Negative-strand-specific RT-PCR confirmed the replication of viral RNA in the tonsils and intestines in human HEV-infected pigs before it was detected in the liver
