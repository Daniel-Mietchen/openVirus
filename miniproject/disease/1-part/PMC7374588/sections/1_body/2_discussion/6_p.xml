<p id="Par18">Simvastatin administered for immunosuppression and efficient replication of HEV significantly affected only the IFN-γ levels. IFN-γ levels increased only in the HEV + sim group at 28 dpi, whereas it was hardly expressed in the other groups. This result was presumably associated with the activation of NK/NKT cells during HEV infection. NK/NKT cells reportedly are rapidly activated in patients with acute HEV infection
