 </sup>. Our study not only revealed the presence of HEV in peripheral nerves, but also indicated that HEV may be transmitted to the nervous system in a retrograde manner. These findings were obtained following intravenous virus inoculation, which has several advantages over the faecal–oral route. When HEV enters the host orally, it replicates in the primary site and then spreads to various target organs. This process takes a long time, during which the host cells initiate various immune responses. In contrast, upon intravenous administration, which results in a high virus titre in the blood from the early stage of infection, the virus would have spread more easily. However, our findings provide a rationale for the distribution of HEV in the body and the pathogenesis associated with cell damage caused thereby.
