<p id="Par10">Lymphoid tissues, including those of the tonsils, spleen, and lymph nodes, were continuously monitored from the very early stages of infection until the end of the experiment, and were found to have the highest amounts of HEV antigens. A few cells in the thymus were also positive for HEV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, duodenum, ileum, and colon, HEV was mainly distributed in the immune cells of the lamina propria or concentrated in lymphoid tissues, such as the Peyer’s patches (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Interstitial thickenings due to lymphocytic infiltration were observed in the lungs, and HEV antigens were distributed in these lesions and in lymphoid nodules adjacent to the bronchioles (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Mild inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the kidneys, where HEV antigens were detected in infiltrated cells in a manner similar to that seen in previously described organs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). HEV antigens were also present in the glomeruli of some individuals. With regard to the brain and peripheral nerves (splenic plexus), HEV antigens were detected in peripheral nerves at up to 21 dpi and in the neuronal cell bodies and axons in the brain from 21 dpi (Fig.
