<p id="Par6">HEV RNA was detected in the plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and faeces by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). HEV RNA was not detected in any of the pre-infection samples, and animals in the two mock groups tested negative throughout the experiment. Faecal virus shedding was the highest at 7 days post infection (dpi) and was observed in 11/12 (91.6%) and 9/12 (75%) of pigs in the HEV group and HEV + sim group, respectively, and gradually decreased, and both groups were not detected at 28 dpi in both groups. Similarly, caecal contents all tested positive until 21 dpi and turned negative at 28 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Although cell-free viraemia was not detected in the two inoculation groups, cell-associated viraemia was detected in 6/12 (50%) and 7/12 (58%) pigs from 3 dpi onwards, and was maintained at more than 50% until 28 dpi. There was no difference in the HEV RNA titre between any of the samples from the pigs in the two groups (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were not significantly different from those of the mock group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A,B). HEV-specific antibodies were detected in the plasma, indicating that these may be used as an immunological indicator of HEV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). HEV-specific antibodies were first detected at 14 dpi, increased steadily to a maximum at 21 dpi, and remained at this level until the end of the experiment. Interferon (IFN)-α levels were elevated until 3 dpi in both HEV-infected groups, but decreased after 7 dpi and remained low until the end of the experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). The IFN-γ levels increased only in the HEV + sim group, with a significant difference at 28 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E).
