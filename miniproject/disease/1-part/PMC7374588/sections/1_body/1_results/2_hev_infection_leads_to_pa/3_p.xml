<p id="Par9">Immunohistochemistry (IHC) identified HEV antigens in the liver (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). HEV antigens were present at low levels mainly in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions of hepatocytes at 7 dpi. In livers infiltrated by inflammatory cells, HEV antigens were predominantly localised in infiltrated inflammatory cells, rather than in hepatocytes. After the inflammatory cells receded at 28 dpi, HEV antigens were prominently detected in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. In the pancreas, HEV antigens were exclusively localised in the cytoplasm of acinar cells, and not in the islets of Langerhans (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). On 7 dpi, HEV antigens were detected as spots around the perinuclear regions of damaged cells only, and persisted throughout the cytoplasm of some cells at up to 28 dpi. HEV antigens were not found in or near vacuolated cell lesions. Simvastatin treatment slightly increased HEV antigen in the liver and pancreas, whereas both mock groups displayed no signals.
