<p id="Par8">In HEV group, cell membrane rupture as well as nuclear condensation and fragmentation were observed in a large area of the pancreas at 7 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Mild cell vacuolation and cell depletion were observed starting from 21 dpi and peaked at 28 dpi. In the HEV + sim group, similar events as in the HEV group were observed, but they were slightly more severe. Histopathological lesions were not detected in the liver and pancreatic tissues of pigs from the two mock groups. The infiltrating cell profile was dominated by CD3ε as a T-cell marker and CD107a as a marker of functional natural killer (NK) cells, and significantly less so by the B-cell marker, CD19 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–C). CD163, a macrophage marker that is also expressed in Kupffer cells, was detected in normal areas, but not in infiltrated lesions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D).
