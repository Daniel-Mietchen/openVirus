<p id="Par11">Lesions in the liver and pancreas were examined for expression levels of TNF-α and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which are known as ‘death ligands’. Expression patterns of the death ligands were similar to the distribution of HEV in both organs. In the liver, TNF-α expression was stronger in infiltrated lymphocytes than in hepatocytes, and TRAIL expression showed a similar pattern, but was lower than TNF-α expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A,B). High levels of TNF-α and TRAIL were observed exclusively in acinar cells throughout the pancreas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A,B). However, although ruptured cell membranes, nuclear condensation, and high expression levels of death ligands were observed in the pancreas, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells were not observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C). In the liver, only a very weak signal, which was very low when compared to the severity of lymphocytic infiltration, was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C).
