<p id="Par12">The expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3), a critical regulator of necroptosis, was investigated. A significant level of RIP3 expression was observed in hepatocytes around lymphocyte-infiltrated lesions, where RIP3 was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm and to a lower extent in the nuclei (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). In the pancreas, RIP3 was strongly expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D). The two mock groups showed mild RIP3 expression in the nuclei in the liver and pancreas. Subsequently, we examined the expression of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), which functions downstream of RIP3 as a key executioner of necroptosis. In the pancreas, pMLKL was predominantly expressed in morphologically changed acinar cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E). RIP3-positive hepatocytes did not co-express pMLKL, and pMLKL expression was observed only in individual immune cells in the liver (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E).
