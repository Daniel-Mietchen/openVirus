<p id="Par5">The objective of this study was to analyse the localisation and dynamics of HEV in the liver and other organs in miniature pigs experimentally infected with HEV. HEV-induced cell damage was investigated to unravel the mechanism underlying HEV-induced cell death. In addition, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on HEV infection.</p>
