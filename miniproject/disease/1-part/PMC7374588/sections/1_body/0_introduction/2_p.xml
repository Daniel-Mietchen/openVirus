<p id="Par3">Although several in vivo and in vitro models have been proposed for the purpose of cultivating HEV or mimicking HEV infection in laboratory animals, including rabbits, mice and rats, such in vivo models have not been successful in demonstrating the clinical symptoms of HEV infection

 </sup>. Extra-hepatic manifestations have not yet been modelled because existing studies on miniature pig models have focused to the liver. In clinical cases, 55 patients with hepatitis E in India, Nepal, Poland, and France were diagnosed with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis. Although the association between other hepatitis virus infections and acute pancreatitis is well known, the presence of HEV in the human pancreas has not been clearly proven
