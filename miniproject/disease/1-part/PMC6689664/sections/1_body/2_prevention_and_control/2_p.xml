<p>Viral outbreaks are not completely avoidable, but preventative strategies can help restrict their occurrence. Management strategies can also be used in an attempt to eradicate a pathogen from a population or limit its impact. Particularly due to its zoonotic potential, an outbreak of HeV led to the re-evaluation of infection control and equine management practices in Queensland, Australia. Horses can also be used as epidemiological sentinels for human surveillance.
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For example, although horses are not believed to be an amplifying host of EEE virus epidemics, they tend to be the first to show clinical signs, therefore providing the first indication that the virus is circulating.
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Thus, illness detection in horses can trigger measures to prevent associated outbreaks in humans. Viruses can be spread through many different mechanisms, therefore warranting different control strategies.
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> New equine encephalitic viruses are still being discovered, for example, HeV and NiV were both first identified in the 1990s,
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> and there are likely to be more that remain undiscovered. Control of future emerging virus outbreaks may rely on identifying appropriate strategies already applied to related known diseases. Mathematical modeling can provide an understanding of mechanisms driving disease outbreaks. However, it is important to consider how reliable the values assigned to parameters are (“parameter identifiability”) before mathematical models are used to guide interventions.
