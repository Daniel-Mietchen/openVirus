<p>The majority of equine encephalitic viruses are limited to specific geographical areas. Spread to disease-free areas of the world can have catastrophic consequences on equine welfare and industry including mortality, loss of earnings, increased costs (due to veterinary treatment and hospitalization, and preventive measures such as vaccination), as well as public health consequences. For example, outbreaks of African horse sickness in the past have caused 300,000 equine deaths in a short time. It was estimated that the economic cost of such an outbreak in the Netherlands could be more than 500 million Euros.
