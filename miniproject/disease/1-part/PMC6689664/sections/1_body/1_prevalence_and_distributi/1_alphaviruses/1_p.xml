 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The most common equine encephalitic viruses are Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Western equine encephalitis (WEE), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). Collectively known as the equine encephalitides, they are transmitted by mosquitoes and wild birds are the main reservoir host. Horses and humans are considered dead-end hosts for EEE and WEE viruses because they do not generate enough viremia to infect mosquitoes and perpetuate the transmission cycle. On the other hand, equids are the key reservoir host for VEE virus because they develop high titer viremia that can act as source of infection for subsequent feeding mosquitoes.
