<p>West Nile virus is the flavivirus with the widest distribution, which includes all continents (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In affected regions, WNV is maintained in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds.
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Horses and humans are considered dead-end hosts because of the low viremia developed, which is not sufficient to transmit the virus back to mosquitoes.
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Experimental studies have demonstrated that only 10% of the infected horses develop neurological signs, but they can be lethal.
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> WNV was first isolated in Africa in 1937 and spread to Eurasia and Australia where sporadic outbreaks occurred.
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Since the 1990s, more frequent outbreaks have occurred in the Mediterranean Basin and WNV appeared for the first time in North America in 1999, subsequently spreading across the continent.
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Since 2008, a re-emergence of WNV in Central and Southeastern Europe has been observed, with both lineage 1 and lineage 2 WNV involved in outbreaks.
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In Australia, WNV was named Kunjin virus, which was endemic in northern Australia but has caused recent outbreaks of encephalitis in horses in the southeast probably because of enhanced vector transmission.
