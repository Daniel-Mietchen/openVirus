<p>Vaccines are currently available for many of the viruses that cause equine encephalitis (
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). An equine vaccine for JEV is notably missing although human vaccines are available and are sometimes administered to horses (eg, in Japan). In contrast, although there are equine vaccines against WNV, there is no human WNV vaccine. Although live-attenuated and inactivated virus vaccines have successfully prevented disease for many decades, these vaccines have some limitations. For example, inactivated virus vaccines typically induce short-lived protective antibody responses and there is a risk of reversion to virulence with inactivated virus vaccines. This has led to the development of second-generation vaccines, such as the live-vectored and DNA vaccines available for WNV. These vaccines often enable a “differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals” (DIVA) approach to be taken whereby diagnostic tests are used that detect antibodies against proteins not generated in response to the vaccine. This can be critical in controlling an emerging virus outbreak as it enables authorities to determine when an outbreak is over by screening for antibodies that only develop in infected animals.
