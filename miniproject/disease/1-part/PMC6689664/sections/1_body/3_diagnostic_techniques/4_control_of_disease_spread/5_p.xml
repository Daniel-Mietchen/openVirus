<p>Whereas some regions may be able to support the vector life cycle throughout the year, viruses may overwinter in unidentified hosts or be re-introduced (eg, by importation or migratory birds) in some climates. Some viruses, such as WNV, are transmitted vertically (from adults to eggs) within mosquito populations; this provides a mechanism for the viruses to be maintained within the population.
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> Vector-borne diseases can spread when vectors are carried by the wind. Incursions of JEV into northeastern Queensland are thought to be most likely due to infected mosquitoes blown by the wind from Papua New Guinea.
