<p>Increased globalization has led to a greater potential for the spread of infectious diseases. Most international equine movements are for competition purposes. The number of prestigious international competition events has increased in the last 10â€“15 years. There has also been an increase in the number of stallions being transported between the northern and southern hemispheres for breeding; this number rose from 7 in 1989 to over 100 in 2000.

Countries often have different strategies of restricting pathogens from entering, including testing and quarantine of imported animals. They may also place restrictions on importation from specific countries to prevent introduction of certain pathogens. However, this can have an impact on the equine industry given the frequent international movement of some horse populations.
