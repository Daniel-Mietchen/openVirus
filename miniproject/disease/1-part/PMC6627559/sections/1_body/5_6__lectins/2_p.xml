 <italic>Halimeda renschii</italic>, which was highly specific to HM-N-glycans with (1,3)-bound monosaccharide residues. Lectin HRL40, by binding to the hemagglutinin of the virus, effectively inhibited (with an ED
 <sub>50</sub> 2.45 nM) the infectious process in NCI-H292 cells caused by the influenza A/H3N2/Udom/72 virus. Additionally, a lectin with anti-influenza activity was obtained by Sato et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] from the red alga 
 <italic>Eucheuma serra</italic>. This compound, called by the authors a “high mannose-specific lectin” and designated as KAA-2, effectively inhibited the entry of the influenza virus into cells. The carbohydrate-binding profile of this lectin was determined by centrifugation and ultrafiltration. KAA-2 was associated exclusively with high mannose N-glycans, but not with other glycans. The authors tested this lectin against various strains of influenza virus, including the pandemic variant H1N1-2009. With the immunofluorescent method, it was shown that lectin prevented the virus from entering the host cells. Using ELISA, it was found that the lectin KAA-2 was directly associated with the HA of the influenza virus. It was proposed the use of this lectin as a future means of preventing influenza infection.
