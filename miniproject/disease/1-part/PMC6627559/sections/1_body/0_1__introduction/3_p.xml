<p>Despite the presence of a significant number of anti-influenza drugs, this infection is still dangerous, as annual flu epidemics remain insufficiently controlled. Recently developed drugs are quite effective against currently circulating influenza virus strains, but their use can lead to the selection of resistant viral strains [
 <xref rid="B11-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this regard, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches and drugs with a broad spectrum of activity. Sulphated polysaccharides of algae (red and brown), such as carrageenans and fucoidans fulfill these requirements. This review presents the in vitro and in vivo results of experimental and clinical studies demonstrating the excellent effectiveness of these compounds in combating influenza infection and explain the need to use them as a potential basis for the creation of new drugs with a broad spectrum of activity. Despite their pronounced antiviral properties, they have not been entered the category of drugs yet, because of the difficulties of these compoundsâ€™ standardization [
