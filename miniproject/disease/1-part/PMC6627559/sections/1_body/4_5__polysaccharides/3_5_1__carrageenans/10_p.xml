<p>Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] suggested using hybrid carrageenan (ı/κ/ν-carrageenan) as a potential inhibitor of influenza A virus. In this study, the authors obtained three polysaccharides from the red alga 
 <italic>Eucheuma denticulatum</italic> by successive extraction with cold and hot water and an aqueous solution of NaOH: hybrid polysaccharide (EW), preparation EH, containing only ι-carrageenan, and α-1,4α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucan (EA), which consisted of 88% of glucan and 12% carrageenan as an impurity. The molecular weights of the compounds were 480, 580, and 510 kDa, respectively. Antiviral activity against the H1N1 influenza virus was highest when used the hybrid polysaccharide (276.5 μg/mL), and the H1N1 virus suppression index was 52% using a polysaccharide dose of 250 μg/mL. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> for ι-carrageenan EH was 366.4 μg/mL. The polysaccharide EA showed the lowest antiviral activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 430 µg/mL).
