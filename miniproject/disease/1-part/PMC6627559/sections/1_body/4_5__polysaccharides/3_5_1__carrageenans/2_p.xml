<p>The variability of the primary structure of carrageenans determines the diversity of their macromolecular organisation and defines a wide range of their biological activity [
 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The uniqueness of these hydrocolloids is in the alternating galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose residues, which are linked by α-1,3 and β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. A characteristic feature of carrageenan molecules is the large number of sulphate groups [
