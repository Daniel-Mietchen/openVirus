<p>A positive evaluation of the effectiveness of nasal sprays in patients with acute respiratory viral infections was provided in two randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials by Koenighofer et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In patients treated with carrageenan, the duration of the disease decreased by two days, there were fewer relapses, and the body was cleared of viruses more rapidly. The spray was effective in both children and adults. The treatment of patients with influenza by carrageenan gel was shown to significantly facilitate respiratory tract, reduces the duration of illness, and the severity of symptoms of intoxication. Carrageenans were found to provide a more pronounced synergistic effect with anti-influenza drugs with a different mechanism of action.
