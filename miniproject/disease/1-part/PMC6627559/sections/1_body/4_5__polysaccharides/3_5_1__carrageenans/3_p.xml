<p>The quantity and location of sulphuric acid residues determine the type, form, and functions of carrageenans, which are actively used in food industry for the production of meat, dairy, and confectionery to improve the microtexture of nutritive products, i.e., as gelling agents, emulsifiers, and thickeners. Among the polysaccharides of algae, carrageenans are the most studied regarding their toxicity, pyrogenicity, and allergenicity [

 <xref rid="B50-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Among the diverse biological properties of these sulphated polysaccharides, their antiviral, anticoagulant, immunomodulatory, antitumor, and anti-ulcer activity are currently attracting the greatest interest [

 <xref rid="B52-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Sulphated polysaccharides interact with a variety of eukaryotic cell proteins and have a multidirectional effect on the body’s immune response, both inhibitory and stimulatory, which makes it possible to consider carrageenans as possible immunomodulators. It is assumed that the immunomodulatory effect of carrageenans is initiated by α-Gal-(1,3)-Gal epitopes [
