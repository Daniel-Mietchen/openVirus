<p>Carrageenans are sulphated polysaccharides of red algae whose chemical structure is based on a disaccharide repeating unit consisting of two D-galactose residues joined with each other by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. These units are bound in polysaccharides by α-1,3 bonds [
 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The structural diversity of carrageenans is due to the presence of β-(l,4)-linked residues in the form of 3,6-anhydrogalactose, as well as the number and position of sulphate groups in monosaccharide residues [
 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Regular polysaccharides, the polymer chain of which is built from repeating disaccharide units of the same type, represent a different class of carrageenans. Natural carrageenans are rarely regular, as more often they contain repeating units of several types and have an irregular or hybrid structure (
