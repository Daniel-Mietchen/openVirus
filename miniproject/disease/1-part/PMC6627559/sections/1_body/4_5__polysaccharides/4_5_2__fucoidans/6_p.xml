<p>Using SPEV cell culture sensitive to the reproduction of influenza A (H5N1), Makarenkova et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] investigated the in vitro antiviral effect of a fucoidan from the brown seaweed 
 <italic>Laminaria japonica</italic> against the H5N1 influenza virus. The results showed that the fucoidan did not possess cytotoxic properties in concentrations from 500 μg/50 μL to 125 μg/50 μL and did not change the morphological properties of the SPEV cell culture. Fucoidan had a virucidal effect and suppressed the infectious properties of the H5N1 flu virus (a decrease in virus titer of 3.0–3.3 log units relative to the control), but did not protect the cell culture against cytopathogenic effects of the influenza A virus at 48 and 72 h after infection. At the same time, the fucoidan showed antiviral activity at an early stage of infection, i.e. during the first 24 h. The application of fucoidan to the cell culture in various concentrations an hour before the virus was introduced resulted in a decrease in the titer of the influenza virus by 2.3–3.3 log units. With simultaneous introduction of influenza A virus and fucoidan into the cell culture, the virus titer was decreased by 2.3–2.8 log units relative to the control. These results open up prospects in terms of developing new approaches to interrupting virus adsorption by sensitive cells.
