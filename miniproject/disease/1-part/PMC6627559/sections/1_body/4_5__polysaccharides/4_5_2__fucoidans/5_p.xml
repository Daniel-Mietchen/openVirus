<p>The fucoidan from the brown alga 
 <italic>Kjelmaniella crassifolia</italic> (Mw about 536 kDa, sulphate content 30.1%, purity more than 98%) is a glucuronomanan with branches in the form of oligosaccharides at position 3 of the fucose residues. Oligosaccharides (degree of polymerisation from 0 to 6) consist of 3-linked glucose residues, sulphated at positions 2 and 4 [

 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 6.5 μg/mL). Treatment with fucoidan reduced the severity of flu symptoms and pathological changes in the lungs. One valuable quality of fucoidan was the lack of formation of resistant strains of the virus under the action of this polysaccharide. In the supernatants of spleen cells, the levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) increased following treatment with fucoidan compared with the control animals. In addition, a direct effect of fucoidan on viral particles was found. It was shown that pre-incubation of the virus with fucoidan at concentrations of 31.25–250 μg/mL significantly reduced the number of plaques in MCDK cell culture, i.e. this polysaccharide can inactivate viral particles by direct contact. This polysaccharide inhibited the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-epidermal growth factor receptor) and was able to bind to viral NA and inhibit its activity. In this regard, the authors believed that such inhibitors of the EGFR pathway and NA can be used alone or with other drugs to block the processes of penetration and the release of influenza A virus from cells. The investigated fucoidan is a potential candidate for creating a medicine in the form of a spray or drops.
