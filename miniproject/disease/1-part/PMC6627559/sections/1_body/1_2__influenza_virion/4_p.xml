<p>Influenza virus, like all complex viruses, has a supercapsid, i.e., an additional envelope or peplos, the structural elements of which are peplomer, including HA and NA [
 <xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The capsid encloses the genome of the virus. Three types of influenza virus (genera) have been described: A, B, and C [
 <xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Type B and C viruses cause disease only in humans. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase carry antigenic determinants of the influenza virus and determine its subtype (H5N1, H3N2, H1N1, etc.). Influenza hemagglutinin is a highly variable surface glycoprotein, with 17 known antigenic subtypes [
 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The main function of hemagglutinin is receptory, i.e., it mediates the attachment of virions to target cells by binding to sial-containing receptors [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hemagglutinin is the main specific antigen of the virus, causing the formation of antibodies that neutralize the infectivity of the virus. The presence of antibodies against HA is the main criterion for assessing the post-infectious or post-vaccination humoral immune response to the influenza virus [
