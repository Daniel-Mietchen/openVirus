<p>Protein M1 is the matrix protein of the influenza virus; it covers the lipid membrane. It is in contact with the cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA, and it is bound to the ribonucleoprotein complex of the virus [

 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Membrane protein M2 is an influenza virus surface protein that participates in the creation of an ion channel that regulates pH while disassembling the virus in endosomes and the Golgi apparatus. An acidic pH is a prerequisite for disassembly the virus and stabilizing it during intracellular transport. Viruses with a defect in the activity of this ion channel have poor reproduction efficiency [
