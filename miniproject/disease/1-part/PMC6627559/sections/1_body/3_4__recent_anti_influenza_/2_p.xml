<p>For a long time, rimantadine and amantadine were very actively used to treat the flu. Leibbrand et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported that these anti-influenza drugs act on two stages of the life cycle of the influenza virus: stripping the virus and releasing virus particles from the cell after replication. Rimantadine is able to increase the acidity inside vacuoles surrounding viral particles after they penetrate into the cell. As a result, the fusion of the influenza virus with the vacuole membrane is prevented, which makes it impossible to transfer viral genetic material from the virus particle to the cytoplasm of the cell. Thus, rimantadine becomes an obstacle between the influenza virus and the genome of the host. Along with clinical efficacy, these drugs caused side effects in the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system [
