<p>At present, adamantane group of drugs are recommended in case all other measures fail. In the last decade, a number of drugs with direct action on the influenza virus (direct-acting antivirals, DAA) have appeared [
 <xref rid="B39-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These include NA inhibitors (oseltamivir/Tamiflu
 <sup>TM</sup> and undecivir/Relenza
 <sup>TM</sup>), M2 channel blockers, and fusion inhibitors (umifenovir/Arbidol
 <sup>TM</sup>). Zanamivir and oseltamivir have shown lower than expected efficacy in clinical trials. At the same time, these drugs are more effective in children, in whom the drugs reduce the duration of the disease if they are applied within 48 h after the onset of the first symptoms; they also reduce the number of serious complications. Moreover, these drugs are successfully used to prevent and reduce the intensity of symptoms of seasonal flu. The disadvantages of these chemotherapy drugs are a decrease in their effectiveness during the later stages of infection [

 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Such processes are induced by the virus, but are carried out by the host mechanisms. These include toxic shock syndrome, hyperproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, cellular tissue infiltration, haemorrhagic syndrome, etc. Although modern drugs are quite effective against currently circulating influenza virus strains, their use often leads to the selection of resistant viruses and resistant strains [
