<p id="par0320">For simplification, the model structure does not account for land. While this potentially means some unrealistic behaviour, the distances simulated are not large and most flow datasets are aligned parallel to the coast. It is assumed that the current conditions observed or simulated for a farm origin, will be consistent within the vicinity. That is to say, a particle located at the farm will have the same trajectory as a particle located at distance from the farm.</p>
