<p id="par0085">Some fish diseases can be maintained in wild populations with examples in parasitic disease or sustained via vertical transmission. However, most evidence points to the threat to wild fish in the vicinity of fish farms and not the threat posed to fish farms from wild fish (see Jonkers et al. (2010)). Our primary concern is notifiable infectious diseases with the potential for epidemic spread rather than endemic infectious diseases. Environmental reservoirs sustaining endemic infection are therefore explicitly excluded here, although this background risk could be incorporated in infectious disease simulation models and this would be relevant for the parasite
