<p id="par0090">Between-site river connections were derived from the European Environment Agencyâ€™s

 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Jonkers and Sharkey, 2016</xref>). This provides the basis for constructing downstream waterborne transmission links between sites that discharge into, or take in water from, any river or stream in Britain (as opposed to the use of boreholes, mains water, sewage discharge, and recirculation systems). We note that for Scottish fisheries, only intake was recorded; here discharge was assumed to match intake, which, from a transmission risk perspective, represents the worst-case scenario.
