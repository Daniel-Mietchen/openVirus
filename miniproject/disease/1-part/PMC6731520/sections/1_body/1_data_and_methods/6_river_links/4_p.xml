Subsequently, sites that discharged waste water into the river were considered starting points for following that particular river branch through all confluence junction points down to the sea, cataloguing all other river-connected sites along the way, provided they take in water from the river. Each of these constituted a destination site for a river link, given the start point’s site as source, for which downstream distance between source and destination was also stored.</p>
