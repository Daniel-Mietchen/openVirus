<p id="par0130">In addition to exploring this measure of network connectivity for different network layers, we consider the impact of control measures, in the form of a complete ban on live fish movement for selected nodes, on the EOR of the resulting network. This gives an indication of the extent to which the network can be broken up, and consequently disease spread reduced, by removing nodes which are influential within the network. In graph theory, this influence, or “centrality” has no single definition, but rather a number of alternative measures, the usefulness of which depends on the specific application. Here we consider three different centrality measures for selection of significant nodes:
 <list list-type="simple" id="lis0010">
  <list-item id="lsti0030">
   <label>1</label>
   <p id="par0135">The number of incoming links to a node, or inward degree.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="lsti0035">
   <label>2</label>
   <p id="par0140">The number of outgoing links from a node, or outward degree.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="lsti0040">
   <label>3</label>
   <p id="par0145">The betweenness of a node, defined as the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes which pass through a given node (
