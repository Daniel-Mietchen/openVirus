<p id="par0120">The out-component of a node is the set of other nodes which can be reached by following all network links from the node, including the node itself. Similarly, the in-component is the set of nodes from which the node can be reached. The “largest strongly-connected component”, LSCC, is the largest group of nodes in the network which are strongly-connected (every node can be reached from every other node). This gives an indication of the potential for endemic or self-sustaining epidemics and is also a measure of the probability of large epidemics, since large epidemics would start in the LSCC. We also consider the size of the network consisting of all nodes outwardly reachable by from the nodes in the LSCC (denoted LSCC + out), which gives the maximum outbreak size for introduction into the LSCC.</p>
