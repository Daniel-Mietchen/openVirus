<p id="par0055">We focus on two salmonid species groups, referred to as salmon and trout, where salmon include Atlantic salmon (
 <italic>Salmo salar</italic>) only, and trout refers to all other salmonid species stocked (genera: 
 <italic>Salmo, Oncorhynchus, Salvelinus, Coregonus, Thymallus</italic>), here almost exclusively rainbow trout and brown trout.
