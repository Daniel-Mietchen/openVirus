<p id="par0080">Our objective was to provide a robust representation of the links within the network. For salmon, a significant number of sites take two years to get from input to harvest and fallow periods can last for up to a year (

Consequently a three year timeframe captures the full industry structure while minimising the potential for changes in that structure due to an over-long time period. While it would be ideal to have overlapping years, the offset between Cefas data and MSS data, necessitated by data availability, does not interfere with the objective of characterising the industry structure.
