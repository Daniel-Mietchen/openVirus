<p id="par0210">The diameter of the network is given by the longest shortest path between nodes. For the combined network, there are three paths with the longest path length of 22 links. These three paths differ only by one node each and have the same breakdown of links including three of the four network layers: 10 local links, 0 river links, 11 transport links and 1 marine link. 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the combined network broken down by links and nodes which are present only in specific layers and combinations of layers. For the local, river and transport layers, the majority of links are present only in those layers; for example, 5625 out of 6250 (90%) of local links are unique to the local layer and 4925 out of 5249 (94%) of transport links are unique to the transport layer. In contrast, the marine layer contains only 143 links out of 382 (37%) which are unique to that layer.
