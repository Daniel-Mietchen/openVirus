<p id="par0215">The size of the largest strongly connected component (LSCC) for each subnetwork is given in 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. By definition, the group-specific transport network structure separates the movements in the salmon industry from those in the trout industry and so these should initially be considered separately. The movements in the salmon industry lead to an LSCC of 54 and those in the trout industry lead to an LSCC of 104. These are relatively small connected components. For the river network on its own, transmission is assumed to only go downstream; hence its LSCC has size 1. For local transmission (within 3â€‰km) the LSCC is 79, and for marine waterborne links it is 17. Each of these layer LSCCs contribute to the LSCC of the combined network. Analysing the 725 nodes in the combined LSCC subnetwork further: for transport, other than the LSCC itself, the second largest component is 54 nodes (which is the salmon network LSCC), with all other components of size 8 nodes or less; for the marine links, all other components smaller than the LSCC are of size 4 nodes or less; for the local network, the other components are slightly larger on average, varying in size from 1 to 20 nodes.
