<p id="par0225">The fourth column in 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (LSCC + out) includes all nodes reachable by the specified link types from the nodes in the LSCC. It shows that unlike the other transmission mechanisms, the transport network layer is by itself sufficient to spread a pathogen network-wide, potentially infecting 2572 trout nodes: 88% of trout nodes or 71% of all 3598 network nodes. Adding local transmission to the transport links (row 4 in the table) raises this worst-case proportion to 3416 nodes or 95% of all nodes. This is only marginally increased to 3419 nodes for all links types.
