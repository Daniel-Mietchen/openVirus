<p id="par0230">The EOR for transport links is 108 nodes or 3% of all nodes, whereas the EOR for all link type layers is 740 nodes or 21% of all nodes. This measure, reflecting maximum possible outbreak size, shows that the average size of an epidemic can be substantially increased by combining all network routes together. The impact of a small number of highly-connected nodes on the reach of the full network is illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, which shows the resulting EOR when increasing numbers of highly-connected nodes are removed from the transport layer, with the nodes selected according to different estimates of their influence on the network. The most effective method for node selection is betweenness centrality calculated on all network layers, reflecting the presence of key nodes which connect sub-components of the network. Further analysis of the reduced networks depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows that by removing transport links from 15 nodes (0.4% of all nodes) using this criterion, the EOR for the combined network was cut to 36% of its value for the full network (EOR of 266 versus 740). By increasing this to 25 nodes (0.7%) using the same criterion, the EOR was reduced to 20% of its full value (EOR of 145). The 25 nodes selected in the latter case comprise four salmon nodes in Scotland, five trout nodes in Scotland, 1 salmon node in England and Wales and 16 trout nodes in England and Wales. Of the 25 nodes, 18 have cross-border links.
