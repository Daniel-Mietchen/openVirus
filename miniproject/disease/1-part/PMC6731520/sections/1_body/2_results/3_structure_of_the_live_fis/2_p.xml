<p id="par0170">For the purposes of describing the network structure, we consider network nodes rather than geographical sites, such that each of the 81 multi-group sites (those with records of both salmon and trout) are treated as two separate nodes in close proximity. The live fish movements within Scotland comprise 1669 unique links between nodes, carrying a total of 15,471 transports over three years. In Scotland, 984 of the links are between farms. In England and Wales, there are 3293 unique links, carrying a total of 9898 transports with 583 of the links being between farms.</p>
