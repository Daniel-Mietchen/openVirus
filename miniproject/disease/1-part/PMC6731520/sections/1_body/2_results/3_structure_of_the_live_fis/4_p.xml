 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> illustrates the structure of GBâ€™s salmonid aquaculture industry in terms of live fish movements, with nodes colour-coded by location, and including only those 3326 (of a total of 3598 nodes across both species groups) connected via live fish movements to the main clusters during the period considered. Since movements are species group-specific, the network is depicted as two separate clusters, one for each group. For both groups there are smaller clusters of nodes that are not connected via live fish movements to the main clusters. The hub-spoke nature of the trout industry is conspicuous in 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, where the trout hub sites are primarily farms (see Fig. S1). In general, this hub-spoke structure is not seen in the salmon industry due to the lack of salmon fisheries, although there are a few exceptions, corresponding to stock enhancements of salmon in England and Wales.
