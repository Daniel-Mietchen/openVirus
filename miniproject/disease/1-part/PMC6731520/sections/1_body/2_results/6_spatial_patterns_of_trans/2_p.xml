<p id="par0235">The spatial density of sites in the network is illustrated on a raster grid of 10 km in 
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, together with the mean size of the in and out components of nodes in these 10 km grid cells. The results for the network consisting of only transport links (middle row in 
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) show that, for cells where sites are present, all locations are similarly reachable from other sites: there is a fairly homogenous distribution of in-component size across the country, with the majority of grid points having nodes reachable from around 130 other nodes. In contrast the out-component size is highly heterogeneous, with a large number of grid cells having a mean size of zero, and a scattering of cells with very large out-component size across south western England, northern England and south and central Scotland. When all links type layers are included in the network, the size of the in-component is increased by approximately a factor of 6 (median value = 764), remaining fairly spatially homogeneous. Out-component size also increases, with more grid cells having non-zero size. The number of cells with very large out-component sizes also increases, with 5% of grid cells having a mean size of more than 3418 nodes. In addition to an expansion of the large out-component area centered on Hampshire in the south of England, there is also a notable increase in the out-component size of grid cells in Scotland, particularly the west coast and the Outer Hebrides. Both are areas of high site density (
