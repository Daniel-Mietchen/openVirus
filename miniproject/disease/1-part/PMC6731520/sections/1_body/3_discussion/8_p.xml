<p id="par0270">In conclusion, the contact structure of GBâ€™s salmon and trout aquaculture industry has been shown to be a single epidemiological unit due to cross-border live fish movement. The movement of live fish is the single most important network layer when considering the risk of large outbreaks, and should therefore remain the priority for control, with the potential for targeted surveillance of sites corresponding to high-centrality network nodes. Given the potential for even more widespread transmission via local, river and marine contacts, real outbreaks may be considerably greater than those anticipated by considering the transport network in isolation.</p>
