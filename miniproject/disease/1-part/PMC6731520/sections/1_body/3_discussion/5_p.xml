<p id="par0255">We considered how easy it is to fragment the network by applying movement controls to nodes targeted according to network properties. We found that it is possible to identify a relatively small number of nodes with high influence due to their position in connecting sub-components of the network. More generally in infectious disease transmission, “super-spreaders” are often identified (
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Woolhouse et al., 1997</xref>), occurring due to high heterogeneity within a population, for example in the number of close contacts or in physiological or immunological factors associated with transmission efficiency (
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Stein, 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that, due to network contact heterogeneity alone, in the event of the introduction of a pathogen which could potentially infect all nodes on the network, 25 super-spreader nodes (0.7% of all nodes) could be responsible for 80% of the expected outbreak size, allowing for the possibility of effective targeted surveillance.
