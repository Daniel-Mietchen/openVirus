<p id="par0045">Network theory has applications across science and engineering and in recent years there has been considerable interest in the analysis of “multi-layer” networks; these are networks which encompass different types of connections and different types of nodes and incorporating such subtleties is important for improving our understanding of complex systems (
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Kivelä et al., 2014</xref>). Disease transmission within the salmonid industry is a prime example of such a system: nodes of the network are farms or recreational fishing waters which hold trout or salmon. Fish farms are authorised to rear fish for ongrowing, restocking fisheries or for direct sale to table market. Recreational fishing (angling) waters (fisheries) range from small put and take lakes to open stretches of river. Links in the network through which diseases can be transmitted occur in several layers due to link types spanning the socio-economic, the ecological and the environmental. Previous studies have primarily focused on potential transmission via networks of live fish movements (e.g.(

A multi-layer network of the salmonid industry of England and Wales, incorporating transport, river and local links (transmission via human or animal vectors in the immediate vicinity of each site) was the basis for the epidemiological modelling study of (

In our combined network, we consider four layers with different link types: movement of live fish between sites, waterborne pathogen transmission via the river system, waterborne transmission in the marine environment, and local transmission via human or animal vectors in the immediate vicinity of each site.
