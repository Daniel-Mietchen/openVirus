<p id="Par26">In the two cases of infant sudden death included in this study, an HPeV1 was detected in gastrointestinal samples, and it was not determined if the HPeV1 played a role in these deaths. However death in children under the age of 2 years associated with HPeV1, HPeV3 and HPeV6 infection have been described in other countries

 </sup>. The two cases in our series occurred before and after the main peak in HPeV case numbers during the 2017/18 outbreak. Routine post-mortem testing for HPeV appears warranted when investigating cases of sudden unexplained death in infancy, irrespective of whether an HPeV epidemic is currently occurring or not.
