 </sup>. This study has found that there has been no major genetic changes (ie recombination) in the predominant HPeV3 circulating in Australia, nor has there been a change in the capsid protein structure or antigenicity of the virus circulating that may explain the increased incidence of the disease in 2017. The increase in the number of cases in 2017 compared to earlier epidemics may have been attributable to epidemiological factors such as the virus entering subpopulations with a higher proportion of individuals at risk (young children) such as child care centres, maternal health centres or even maternity wards. The higher number of cases could also be partly due to increased testing for HPeV as awareness about the virus increases in the medical community. More research on the burden of HPeV disease in the community and its epidemiology is certainly warranted, and could be helpful in determining drivers of future epidemics.
