<p id="Par25">While the Australian recombinant HPeV3 was the predominant HPeV in the 2017 epidemic, other HPeV’s were detected sporadically. A second HPeV3 most similar to an HPeV3 sequenced in Taiwan in 2011

 </sup> was identified in two cases during the epidemic. These cases were both from the Hunter Valley region of NSW and are representative of a localized, likely travel-associated, outbreak with this second HPeV3 (case V11 and V12 were from localities ~7 km apart). HPeV1 viruses were also identified, but these were found predominantly in samples from outside the main epidemic period. These may have represented the HPeV types that continuously circulate in the Australian community or were travel related as they were not identical and could have been introduced from different parts of the world. The HPeV1’s did cause clinical disease in the infants, but it appeared to be milder, and sepsis-like syndrome was not seen. Overseas, non-HPeV type 3 parechoviruses are observed to be continuously circulating in children in the community, while HPeV3 has a peak in cases separated by 2–3 years and has been associated with more severe clinical signs
