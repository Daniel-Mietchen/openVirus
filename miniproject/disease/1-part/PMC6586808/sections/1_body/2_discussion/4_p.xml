<p id="Par24">The majority of the HPeV3 cases were in infants under 3 months of age, while HPeV1 cases were seen in infants older than 3 months. This is consistent with observations by investigators in other countries, where HPeV3 illness is seen most frequently in very young children

 </sup>. The most severe clinical cases in this study, where meningitis- or sepsis-like syndrome were noted by the treating clinician, were all infected with the Australian recombinant HPeV3 virus. The most noticeable changes to the amino acid sequence of the recombinant HPeV3 viruses occurred at codons 1359 and 1366 of the polyprotein (2C) where some of the viruses exchanged polar amino acids for charged basic amino acids. 70% of cases with a virus with two basic amino acids at these sites developed sepsis-like syndrome, while only 42% of infections with HPeV3 with a single basic amino acid developed sepsis-like disease. While the association was not statistically significant, possibly given the relatively low number of cases in this study, we speculate that these changes may have an effect on the resulting 2C protein structure or function. This may result in a more efficient viral replication complex in infected cells

 </sup>. However, it appears that the evolution of this virus over time has not selected for virus genomes with 2 basic amino acids in the 2C protein, as the 2015 wave already contained viruses with one or two basic amino acids and while the ancestor of the 2017 wave appears to have come from the 2015 cluster of viruses with two basic amino acids at this site, further evolution and selection have produced viruses with two or only one basic amino acids; perhaps suggesting that while two basic amino acids in 2C may be linked to virulence, one basic amino acid in this region of 2C may be of importance for other aspects of virus spread, such as e.g. level of excretion. Further investigation in a larger number of infants combined with
