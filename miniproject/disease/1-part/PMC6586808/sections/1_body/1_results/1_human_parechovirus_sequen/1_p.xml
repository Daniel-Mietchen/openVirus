<p id="Par6">Of the 33 clinical cases included in this study, 26 cases were infected with an HPeV3, and 7 cases were infected with an HPeV type 1 (HPeV1) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>: case and sample identifiers). In 24 of the 26 HPeV3 infected infants, the virus detected was closely related to the Australian recombinant HPeV3 identified as the predominant virus in the previous two epidemics in Australia in 2013 and 2015 (see below). Megablast searches of the NCBI GenBank database found that the two remaining HPeV3 cases (case V11 and V12) were most similar to an HPeV3 sequenced in Taiwan in 2011 (GenBank accession: KT626009.1). The HPeV1 sequences were most closely related to a number of different HPeV1’s identified in various parts of the world (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
