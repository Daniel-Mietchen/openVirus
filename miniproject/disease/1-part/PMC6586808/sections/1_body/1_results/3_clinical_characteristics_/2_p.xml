<p id="Par12">In 26 of the 33 cases, information on the clinical signs experienced by the infants was available. Meningitis or sepsis-like syndrome were only reported in the children infected with the Australian recombinant HPeV3. However, the association between the type of parechovirus and clinical disease severity (sepsis-like syndrome or not) was not significant (HPeV3: 12/23 cases, HPeV1: 0/3 cases, p = 0.14, Fisher’s Exact Test). HPeV1 was detected in samples from two cases of sudden infant death (Case V1 and V16), however, the ultimate cause of death was not specified and therefore the detection of the HPeV may have been incidental in these cases.</p>
