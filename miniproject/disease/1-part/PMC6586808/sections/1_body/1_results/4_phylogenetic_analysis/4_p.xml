The maximum clade credibility tree of the capsid nucleotide sequence of all HPeV3 from the Australian epidemics along with their closest counterparts identified overseas (Yamagata 2011 HPeV3 (GenBank accessions: AB759204.1, AB759205.1 and AB759207.1) and Taiwan 2011 (KT626009.1)) is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The maximum likelihood tree of the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the capsid gene are shown in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>. The nucleotide phylogenetic analysis by both methods indicated that the 2017 recombinant HPeV3 were likely descendants of the HPeV3 viruses circulating during the 2015 epidemic. The two Taiwan 2011-like viruses formed their own branch and had evolved from an ancestor common with KT626009 from Taiwan. The average evolutionary rate in the capsid (9.39 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year, 95% CI: 6.18 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> − 1.27 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) was lower when compared to the whole polyprotein gene.
