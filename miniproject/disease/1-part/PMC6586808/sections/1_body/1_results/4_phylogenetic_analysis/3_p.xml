The 2017/18 epidemic Australian recombinant HPeV3 viruses were likely descendants of viruses circulating in the 2015 epidemic which in turn were descendants of viruses detected during the 2013/14 epidemic in Australia. The rate of molecular evolution (2.46 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site per year, 95%, CI: 2.00 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> − 2.94 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) was very stable during and between epidemics (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and suggested that there had been ongoing transmission and evolution of this HPeV3 lineage between, as well as during, epidemics.
