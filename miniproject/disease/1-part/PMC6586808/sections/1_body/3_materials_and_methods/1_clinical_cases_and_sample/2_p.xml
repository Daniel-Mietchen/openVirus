<p id="Par30">Samples were collected between March 2017 and May 2018 coinciding with the 2017/18 HPeV epidemic in Australia. Samples came from infants which were treated for a range of clinical presentations including irritability, fever, rash, gastroenteritis, meningitis and sepsis-like syndrome. These samples likely represented the most severe cases during the epidemic, where parents sought medical attention for their children. Samples from two cases of sudden infant death (cause of death was not specified) during this period were also included. Sample types included faeces, nasopharyngeal aspirates, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Samples were screened for the presence of parechovirus using an established PCR protocol
