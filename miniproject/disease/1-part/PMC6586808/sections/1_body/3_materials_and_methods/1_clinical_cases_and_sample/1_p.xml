<p id="Par29">Human parechovirus positive samples from the 2017/18 outbreak in south eastern Australia (NSW and Victoria) were identified by reviewing laboratory and clinical records from the Children’s Hospital at Westmead (CHW), Sydney, New South Wales, and from the laboratory submission database of the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory (VIDRL), Melbourne Victoria. Samples were selected for this study on the basis that 1) they had been identified as human parechovirus positive by PCR in a clinical laboratory; and 2) sufficient clinical sample remained for further nucleic acid extraction and sequencing. If multiple HPeV positive samples were available from a clinical case, the sample which gave the lowest C
 <sub>T</sub> value (had the highest virus content) in the diagnostic PCR was selected for inclusion in this study. Samples from a total of thirty three cases were ultimately selected for inclusion in this study. The studies performed here were performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations. Data on samples collected from VIDRL were provided with ethical exemption from the Barwon Health Research Ethics Committee (Ref No. 16/191), data on the clinical presentation of the infants from the Children’s Hospital Westmead was collected with approval from the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network Human Research Ethics Committee project No. LNR/14/SCHN/528 and Deakin University’s Human Research Ethics Committee project No. 2018–243. Informed consent was obtained using an opt-out process as approved by the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network Human Research Ethics Committee.
