 </sup> with a gamma-distribution (T92 + G), which was selected as the best model by MEGA for the nucleotide alignments of the polyprotein, capsid and non-structural proteins. 1000 bootstrap replicates were used to test the robustness of the phylogeny. Amino acid maximum likelihood phylogenies were performed using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution model

 </sup> and 500 bootstrap replicates. All maximum likelihood trees were rooted on the oldest sequence to compare topology with the Bayesian methods.
