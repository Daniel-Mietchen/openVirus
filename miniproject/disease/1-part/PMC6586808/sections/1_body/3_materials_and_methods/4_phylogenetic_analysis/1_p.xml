 </sup> webserver. Codon selection was analysed using the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed effects likelihood (FEL) and random effects likelihood (REL) packages on the Datamonkey webserver. A cut-off p-value of 0.05 was used for SLAC, a p-value of 0.05 and 0.01 for FEL and the cut-off Bayes factor in REL was set to 100 as described previously
