 <caption>
  <p>The maximum clade credibility tree of the complete nucleotide sequence (6534 nt) of the polyprotein gene of 23 of the HPeV type 3 viruses detected in the Australian 2017 epidemic and similar viruses identified in the previous Australian epidemics of 2013 and 2015. Sequences were aligned by MUSCLE and phylogenetic analysis was performed in Beast 2.5.2 using the HKY model with a gamma distribution, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo chain length of 50 million and a relaxed evolutionary clock. Node circles are scaled proportional to the posterior probability.</p>
