 <caption>
  <p>The time scaled Maximum Clade Credibility phylodynamic tree of the complete capsid nucleotide sequence (2313nt) of the HPeV type 3 viruses identified in Australia 2012–2018 and the related representative viruses identified overseas. Sequences were aligned by MUSCLE and phylogenetic analysis was performed in Beast 2.5.2 using the HKY model and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo chain length of 50 million. Node circles are scaled proportional to the posterior probability. The sample name is shown. The structural protein genes of all Australian HPeV type 3’s except V7185593 and V7193255 belonged to a Yamagata-2011 HPeV type 3 lineage.</p>
