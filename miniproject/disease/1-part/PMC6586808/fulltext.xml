We investigated the molecular epidemiology of HPeV infection in thirty three infants requiring hospitalization before, during and after the peak of the 2017/18 HPeV epidemic wave in Australia. During the peak of the epidemic, all cases were infected with an HPeV3, while before and after the peak, HPeV1 was the predominant type detected. The predominant HPeV3 was the recombinant HPeV3 also detected in the 2013/14 and 2015/16 Australian epidemics. Sepsis-like or meningitis-like symptoms were only reported in cases infected with the recombinant HPeV3. Phylogenetic analysis of the recombinant HPeV3 revealed that the virus continued to evolve, also between the Australian outbreaks, thus indicating continued circulation, despite not being detected and reported in Australia or elsewhere in between epidemic waves. The recombinant HPeV3 continued to show a remarkable stability in its capsid amino acid sequence, further strengthening our previous argument for development of a vaccine or immunotherapeutics to reduce the severity of HPeV3 outbreaks due to this virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Viral infection</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Whole genome amplification</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease Emergencies, Centre of Research Excellence</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT9000413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alexandersen</surname><given-names>Soren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Human parechovirus (HPeV) is a small non-enveloped RNA virus in the virus family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>.

HPeV infection is often asymptomatic, or associated with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal disease in children. However some types, in particular human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3), are capable of causing severe disease including central nervous system (CNS) infection and a sepsis-like syndrome in very young children (aged&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3 months)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

There was clustering of the recombinant HPeV3 sequences by the year of sampling. There were two distinct networks of sequences observed in the 2015 epidemic. The network indicated that the sequences from the 2017 epidemic were descendants from viruses belonging to just one of these 2015 networks; notably, a group of viruses having two basic amino acids in the 2C gene (see above). Within the 2017 epidemic, there were three subnetworks of cases, and these likely each represented just a small fraction of larger transmission networks. One network was a Sydney-centric outbreak occurring over November and December 2017 (including cases W1, W3, W5, W7, W8, W9, W10, W12). Interestingly, this network included sequences with either one or two basic amino acids in the 2C gene. The other two networks were made up of cases from wider geographic regions and over longer time periods (4 to 7 months) and one of these networks (cases V4, V7, V14 and W4, W11) had viruses with two basic amino acids in 2C and the other network (cases V5, V6, V8, V9, V10 and W2, W6, W15, W16) only a single basic amino acid. Case V8 (Sample V7181489) sat at the end of a long branch in one of the networks, suggesting it was quite different from the next most similar sequence.

The most severe clinical cases in this study, where meningitis- or sepsis-like syndrome were noted by the treating clinician, were all infected with the Australian recombinant HPeV3 virus. The most noticeable changes to the amino acid sequence of the recombinant HPeV3 viruses occurred at codons 1359 and 1366 of the polyprotein (2C) where some of the viruses exchanged polar amino acids for charged basic amino acids. 70% of cases with a virus with two basic amino acids at these sites developed sepsis-like syndrome, while only 42% of infections with HPeV3 with a single basic amino acid developed sepsis-like disease. While the association was not statistically significant, possibly given the relatively low number of cases in this study, we speculate that these changes may have an effect on the resulting 2C protein structure or function. This may result in a more efficient viral replication complex in infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, it appears that the evolution of this virus over time has not selected for virus genomes with 2 basic amino acids in the 2C protein, as the 2015 wave already contained viruses with one or two basic amino acids and while the ancestor of the 2017 wave appears to have come from the 2015 cluster of viruses with two basic amino acids at this site, further evolution and selection have produced viruses with two or only one basic amino acids; perhaps suggesting that while two basic amino acids in 2C may be linked to virulence, one basic amino acid in this region of 2C may be of importance for other aspects of virus spread, such as e.g. level of excretion.

These cases were both from the Hunter Valley region of NSW and are representative of a localized, likely travel-associated, outbreak with this second HPeV3 (case V11 and V12 were from localities ~7&#x02009;km apart). HPeV1 viruses were also identified, but these were found predominantly in samples from outside the main epidemic period. These may have represented the HPeV types that continuously circulate in the Australian community or were travel related as they were not identical and could have been introduced from different parts of the world. The HPeV1&#x02019;s did cause clinical disease in the infants, but it appeared to be milder, and sepsis-like syndrome was not seen.

The increase in the number of cases in 2017 compared to earlier epidemics may have been attributable to epidemiological factors such as the virus entering subpopulations with a higher proportion of individuals at risk (young children) such as child care centres, maternal health centres or even maternity wards. The higher number of cases could also be partly due to increased testing for HPeV as awareness about the virus increases in the medical community.

Screening for recombination was performed using GARD on the Datamonkey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> webserver. Codon selection was analysed using the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed effects likelihood (FEL) and random effects likelihood (REL) packages on the Datamonkey webserver. A cut-off p-value of 0.05 was used for SLAC, a p-value of 0.05 and 0.01 for FEL and the cut-off Bayes factor in REL was set to 100 as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par38">The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in Beast 2.5.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> was used to estimate the nucleotiode substitution rate per site per year and the time to the most recent ancestor.

Given the small sample size, the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> with a gamma-distributed rate amongst sites was selected. A constant coalescent population and a relaxed clock were used for analysis. Two independent runs using a chain length of 50 million, and sampling every 1000 simulation were conducted for each of the polyprotein, capsid and non-structural gene analyses. The convergence and effective sample size (ESS) of each estimate was checked using Tracer 1.7.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. All parameters for each run showed an ESS &#x0003e;1000.

Amino acid maximum likelihood phylogenies were performed using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and 500 bootstrap replicates.
