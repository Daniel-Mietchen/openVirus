<p>Dengue viruses 1–4 (DENV1-4), Zika virus (ZIKV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are viruses spread by the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and are among the foremost arboviral threats to humans today [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. DENV and ZIKV are flaviviruses with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes of ~11 kb that encode for a single polyprotein, which is then post-translationally cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are four different DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) that share 60–75% identity at the amino acid level. Collectively, DENV1-4 are responsible for an estimated 390 million infections yearly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Evidence suggests that the geographic distribution of DENV is increasing [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and poses a threat to travelers visiting affected regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].There is a single serotype of ZIKV that can be further broken down into two primary lineages, the African and the Asian/American. At the time of writing, ZIKV had spread to 86 countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and is a documented cause of microcephaly in infants when transmitted vertically from an infected mother during pregnancy [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CHIKV is an alphavirus with three major lineages, all of which comprise a single serotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The genome of CHIKV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~11.6 kb that is post-translationally cleaved into four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4) and five structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6k and E1) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CHIKV has seen resurgence in the tropical and subtropical world with several notable epidemics in recent years [
