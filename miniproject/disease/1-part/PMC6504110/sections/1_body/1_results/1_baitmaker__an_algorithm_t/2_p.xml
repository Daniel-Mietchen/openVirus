<p>For DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, there were more than 11,000 genome sequences available in the NCBI database (

 </bold>). Using BaitMaker-Conserved mode we generated conserved baits for each DENV serotype (65 baits total). As these baits are not designed to cover the genomic regions that are more variable, we designed an additional 22 baits that were specific to the Asian strains of DENV1-4 we were working with at the time (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007184.s006">S1 Table</xref>
 </bold>) hence, we developed the BaitMaker Exhaustive mode and utilized it to account for potentially under-represented variation in these viruses. The resulting panels for these viruses were 67 baits for ZIKV and 53 baits for CHIKV covering both conserved and variable regions of the respective genomes (
