<p>RNA extraction was done using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 250 μL of sample was added to 750 μL of TRIzol Reagent in a Phase Lock Gel Heavy 2 mL tube (5 PRIME) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Following incubation, 200 μL of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the mix was incubated for a subsequent 10 min. The sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The aqueous phase was decanted into a new tube and 2 μL of Glycoblue Coprecipitant (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 500 μL of 2-propanol (Merck) was added to precipitate the RNA. The sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to obtain an RNA pellet. The pellet was washed with 500 μL of 75% ethanol (Merck), centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 rpm, air-dried and resuspended in nuclease free H
 <sub>2</sub>O.
