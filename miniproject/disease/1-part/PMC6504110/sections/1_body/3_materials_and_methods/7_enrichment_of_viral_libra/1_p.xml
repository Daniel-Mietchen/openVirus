<p>Targeted viral enrichment was achieved using custom designed biotinylated, 120mer xGen Lockdown baits (Integrated DNA Technologies). Prior to capture of viral sequences, 1 μL each of xGen universal blocking oligo TS-p5 and TS-p7 (Integrated DNA Technologies), matched accordingly to the library index was added to 20 μL of library DNA and 0.5 μL of 5 μg Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) to block binding of baits to non-viral regions of library fragments. Blocked libraries were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 2.5 μL H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 3 μL Nimblegen hybridization solution and 7.5 μL Niblegen 2X hybridization buffer (Roche). Following a 10 min incubation at room temperature, resuspended libraries were denatured at 95°C for 10 min and cooled on ice before the addition of the DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV bait pool. A total amount of 3 pmol of baits were added and hybridized to the libraries for 4 h at 65°C. To capture virus specific library fragments, 100 μL magnetic M-270 streptavidin Dynabeads (Life Technologies) were added to the hybridization reaction and the mix was incubated for a further 45 min at 65°C, with shaking at 2000 rpm in a ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf). Streptavidin beads were washed to remove unbound DNA using SeqCap EZ hybridization and wash kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A post-capture PCR amplification of 20 cycles with P1 and P2 primers (Illumina) was performed and the enriched library was purified using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The purified, enriched library was eluted in 25 μL nuclease-free H
 <sub>2</sub>O, visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel and quantified using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Assay (Agilent). For the complete protocol, please see
