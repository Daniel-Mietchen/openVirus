<p>For targeted-enrichment method, we designed reverse complementary DNA baits of 120 nt in length, targeting the viral genome of interest. As the hybridization takes place at 65°C, we designed baits such that they had a melting temperature greater than this. The baits in our panel had melting temperature ranging from 69 to 87°C and GC content from 31 to 66%. We developed two modes to design baits (i) Conserved mode, to design baits at the species-level conserved regions and (ii) Exhaustive baits, to design baits for both conserved regions as well as regions with strain level variations.</p>
