<p>Illumina libraries were constructed from total RNA using NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) in conjunction with NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, 5 μL of total RNA was added to first strand synthesis buffer and random primers before incubating at 94°C for 2 min in order to generate RNA fragments larger than 500 nt. Following first strand and second strand cDNA synthesis, double-stranded cDNA was purified using Mag-Bind RxnPure Plus beads (Omega Bio-Tek) and eluted in 60 μL nuclease-free water. In order to obtain a library size between 400–600 nt, size selection of the libraries was performed using Mag-Bind RxnPure Plus beads (Omega Bio-Tek) in a two-step selection, by adding 35 μL, then subsequently 15 μL of beads to the reaction. The library was eluted in 20 μL nuclease-free water and amplified by PCR. Libraries were purified using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), eluted in 25 μL nuclease-free H
 <sub>2</sub>O and visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel and quantified using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Assay (Agilent).
