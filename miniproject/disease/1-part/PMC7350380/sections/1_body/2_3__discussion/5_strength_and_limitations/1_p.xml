<p>Previous systematic review studies have investigated the prevalence of HIV, HCV and HBV in PWID worldwide, but we have investigated the prevalence of these infections and their co-infections in the high-risk groups PWID and FSWs as distinguished by geographical areas. One limitation of this study is the changing sensitivity of HIV, HCV and HBV diagnostic tests over time, therefore, the results of the 2018 surveys may be different from 2008. In this study, all the reviewed articles had used anti-HCV serology test to detect HCV, which does not differ between past and present infections. The articles reporting HCV-RNA were scarce and excluded. Another limitation of our study is the high heterogeneity in studies. As the analysis was performed in different geographical areas, the heterogeneity may be due to different inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., type of drug, minimum duration of injectable drug use, sampling location (prison, the Behavioral Disease Counseling Center, MMT Center, homeless people), frequency of sex during a specific time, number of sexual partners and condom use).</p>
