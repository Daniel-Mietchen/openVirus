<p>The prevalence of HIV/HCV in PWID and FSWs was 13% and 3%, respectively, with the highest prevalence in PWID being in South-East Asia (17%), Africa and Europe (16% each), and the lowest in Eastern Mediterranean (8%); and the highest prevalence in FSWs being in Africa, and the lowest being in the Americas and South-East Asia (23%, 0% and 0%, respectively). The prevalence of HIV/HBV in PWID and FSWs was 2% and 1%, respectively, and the prevalence of HCV/HBV and HIV/HCV/HBV in PWID was 3% and 2%, respectively. The study by Larney et al. found a positive association between the high prevalence of anti-HCV and the prevalence of HIV in PWID worldwide [
