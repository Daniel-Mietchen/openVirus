<p>The prevalence of HCV in PWID and FSWs was 60% and 1%, respectively. That means that almost one in every two PWID has HCV, with the highest prevalence of HCV in PWID being in the Western Pacific, the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean, with 75%, 64% and 60%, respectively, and the lowest being in Africa (38%); the highest prevalence in FSWs is in Africa (9%), and the lowest prevalence is in the Americas and Western Pacific (1% each). In a 2007 meta-analysis study, the prevalence of HCV in PWID worldwide was estimated to be 50% [

In another study published by Nelson et al. in 2011, the prevalence of HCV in PWID was reported to be 60–80% in 25 countries and over 80% in 12 countries, with approximately 10 million PWID suffering from HCV, China and the US having the largest population [

 <xref rid="B152-pathogens-09-00432" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Worldwide, it is estimated that 14 million PWID are at risk for HCV exposure from contaminated blood. In 2011, the prevalence of hepatitis C in PWID worldwide was estimated to be 67%, the highest prevalence being in Eastern Europe (2.3 million) and East and South-East Asia (2.6 million) [

The relatively high prevalence of needle/syringe sharing, low condom use, high levels of sex with sex workers, homosexual sex between men, and selling sex, indicate high-risk behaviors associated with HIV and HCV prevalence in different regions [
 <xref rid="B156-pathogens-09-00432" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Another parameter influencing the prevalence and natural history of HCV infection is the host immune response-related genetics such as 
 <italic>IFNL3/4</italic> polymorphisms which impact the spontaneous clearance of HCV, and it was also observed that the genotypes associated with favorable outcome has different prevalence in ethnic groups [
