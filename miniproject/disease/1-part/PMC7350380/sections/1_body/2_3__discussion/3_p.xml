<p>In this study, the prevalence of HBV in PWID and FSWs was 6% and 3%, respectively, with the highest prevalence in PWID being in South-East Asia (9%) and Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean (5% each), and the lowest prevalence being in the Americas and Western Pacific (1% each). Moreover, the highest prevalence in FSWs was in Africa (5%) and South-East Asia (4%), and the lowest prevalence was in the Americas and Eastern Mediterranean (1% each). Nearly 3.6% of the world’s population (257 million people) have chronic hepatitis B, with a prevalence of 0.01–2% in the UK, the US, Canada, Western Europe, and Japan, and over 8% in most sub-Saharan areas in Africa and some countries in the Western Pacific region [

Asia and Africa have the highest HBV endemicity, but highly effective vaccination programs in some countries have pushed the pattern towards moderate or low endemicity. Therefore, China is currently the only country in Asia where HBV is of paramount importance. Countries with moderate endemicity include India, Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. Countries with low endemicity include Japan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. Most countries in Africa have high endemicity, with the exception of Tunisia and Morocco, which have moderate endemicity [

According to the WHO, in 2017, 97% of blood donors were screened for HBV, but there are gaps in the program and strategies have been suggested to resolve the problems, including reducing insecure injections (it has reduced from 39% in 2000 to 5% in 2010), and safer sex practices, such as minimizing the number of sexual partners and using protection (condoms). On the other hand, according to WHO, 80% of people with hepatitis live without prevention, testing and treatment [
