<p>The results show that the prevalence of HCV and HIV infections in PWID, and the prevalence of HIV in FSWs are higher than in the general population. The results indicate that the coverage of interventions for HIV and HCV prevention in PWID appear to be poor, and may not be sufficient to effectively prevent HIV and HCV transmission. Additionally, the lack of political commitment and, as a result, inadequate investment, reluctance to address sensitive issues related to young peopleâ€™s sexual and reproductive needs and rights, and issues related to key populations and harm reduction, and a lack of systematic prevention implementation, even with regard to policy, are three interconnected reasons that seem to underpin the failure to implement effective programs at scale. Increasing the interventions for PWID and FSWs, such as HBV vaccination for the prevention of HBV, and the use of harm reduction programs, such as reducing the number of sexual partners per person, condom distribution, the use of clean needles and syringes, opiate substitution therapy (e.g., methadone) and the treatment of people living with HIV to reduce viral load and prevent onward transmission of HCV, are still a top priority in stopping the HIV and HCV epidemics. For HCV patients, education and counselling on options for care and treatment; immunization with the hepatitis A and B vaccines to prevent co-infection from these hepatitis viruses, and to protect their liver; early and appropriate medical management, including antiviral therapy; and regular monitoring for early diagnosis of chronic liver disease are necessary. Key population should be regularly monitored and screened for these infections and their associated infections.</p>
