 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00432-f001">Figure 1</xref>, 5631 articles were found in the original search. After the removal of duplicate data, 2810 articles were selected for screening. After reviewing the title and abstract, 408 articles were selected for full text study. A total of 291 articles were excluded for various reasons, including inappropriate study design (121), failure to report prevalence (68), irrelevant target group (91), lack of proper testing (9) and non-originality (2). Eventually, after qualitative evaluation of data, 117 articles that had reported 161 records of HIV, HCV, HBV prevalence and their co-infections (HIV/HCV, HIV/HBV, HCV/HBV, HIV/HCV/HBV) among PWID and FSWs were analyzed. The characteristics of the studies are shown in
