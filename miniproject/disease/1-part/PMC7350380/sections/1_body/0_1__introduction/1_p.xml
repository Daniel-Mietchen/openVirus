<p>According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2018, there are approximately 38 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the world, the largest number being in Africa, with 25.7 million [

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have affected 71 million and 257 million people worldwide, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer, respectively. Removing these viruses, which requires significant economic and sanitary capital, will prevent more than 1.2 million deaths worldwide annually [

HCV has the highest prevalence in the Eastern Mediterranean region, followed by the European region, with a prevalence of 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively. It varies from 0.5% to 1% in other areas. HBV is most prevalent in the Western Pacific and African regions, with values of 6.2% and 6.1%, respectively. The lowest prevalence is reported in the US, with a value of 0.7% [
