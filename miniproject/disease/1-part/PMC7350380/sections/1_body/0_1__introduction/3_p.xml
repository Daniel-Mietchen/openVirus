<p>FSWs are also more exposed to high-risk behaviors, especially through sex. A study in a region with a high prevalence of HIV in India stated that about 77.5% of FSWs had drug injection history, and that they were at a higher risk of BBVI than those without drug injection. The prevalence of HIV in FSWs worldwide ranges from less than 1.4% to over 11%. The prevalence of viral hepatitis is not high in FSWs, but WHO reports that the prevalence of HBV in FSWs ranges from less than 0.3% in Brazil to over 3.6% in Peru, and hepatitis C prevalence ranges from less than 1.9% in Brazil to 6.2% in Kazakhstan in the same group. In fact, HIV is more prevalent among FSWs than HBV and HCV infections [
