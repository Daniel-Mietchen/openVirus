<p>In patients co-infected with two or three HIV, HCV and HBV infections, HIV-induced immunodeficiency increases the likelihood of HBV and HCV persistence, and hepatotoxicity associated with anti-HIV treatment can worsen HBV-related liver diseases or HCV persistence. Evidence suggests that HIV infection increases the risk of HCV- and HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, liver diseases associated with chronic HBV and HCV are leading to increased mortality and complications in HIV patients [
