<p>Cross-sectional studies published in English that assessed anti-HIV, anti-HCV and HBsAg were selected. The studies that did not have a specific serology test to detect infections, those in which the prevalence rate was based on self-reports, the ones that used HBsAb, HBcAb, HBeAg and HBeAb tests to detect HBV and used HCV-RNA to detect HCV, and non-cross-sectional studies (case reports, reviews, case-control and cohort studies) were excluded. </p>
