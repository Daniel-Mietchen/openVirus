<p>In this study, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) checklist for cross-sectional studies was used to evaluate possible bias and quality of studies. This checklist was completed by two people. The quality of studies were judged based on such aspects as selection, comparability and outcome using the “star” rating system. Scores ranged from 0 stars (worst case) to 9 stars (best case). Studies with a score of 0–4 were categorized as low quality, 5–7 as moderate and more than 7 as high quality.</p>
