  <p>Indirect protection of immune sera. Naïve BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) were inoculated with a mixture of immune sera and 3 × LD
   <sub>50</sub> rgH5N1 A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 virus and monitored for average weight changes (left) and survival (middle) for 14 days post-challenge. Right panel shows analysis of body weight loss by measuring the area under the curve (AUC, relative to 100% value) for each mouse. For mice that died or were humanely euthanized a 75% value was assigned to all subsequent days for the purpose of statistical analysis. Error bars represent mean ± SD. The survival rates were analyzed by Mantel–Cox test, and the AUC values were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test (*
