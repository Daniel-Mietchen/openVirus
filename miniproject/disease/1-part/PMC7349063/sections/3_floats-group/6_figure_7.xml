  <p>Protective immunity induced in mice immunized with recombinant vaccine candidates. BALB/c mice were vaccinated with Alum-adjuvanted recombinant proteins or placebo group samples (PBS) at days 0, 14, and 28. 17 days after the final vaccination mice were challenged with 3 × LD
   <sub>50</sub> of (
   <bold>A</bold>) H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) or with (
   <bold>B</bold>) H3N2 A/Philippines/2/1982 (X-79) virus (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) and monitored for body weight loss (left) and survival (middle) for 14 days. Right panel shows analysis of body weight loss by measuring the area under the curve (AUC, relative to 100% value) for each mouse. For mice that died or were humanely euthanized a 75% value was assigned to all subsequent days for the purpose of statistical analysis. Error bars represent mean ± SD. The survival rates were analyzed by Mantel–Cox test, and the AUC values were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test (*
