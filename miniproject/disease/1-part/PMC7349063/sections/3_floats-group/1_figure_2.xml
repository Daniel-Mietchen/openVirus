  <p>Schematics of the recombinant protein design. We produced three soluble antigens: an N-terminally extended long alpha-helix of H1 hemagglutinin (tri-stalk), a triple M2e peptide (3M2e), and a wild-type bacteriophage AP205 coat protein that self assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs). The genes of 3M2e and AP205 coat protein (CP) were genetically fused and expressed as a single protein, yielding in stable chimeric particles (AP-M2e), and the tri-stalk protein was coupled to the surface of AP205 VLPs (AP/tri-stalk) or AP-M2e VLPs (AP-M2e/tri-stalk).</p>
