  <p>Immune protection conferred against lethal H1N1 A/California/7/2009 influenza virus challenge. (
   <bold>A</bold>) BALB/c mice were vaccinated with Alum-adjuvanted recombinant proteins or PBS at days 0, 14, and 28. 17 days after the final vaccination mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 9) were challenged with 30 × LD
   <sub>50</sub> of Cal/09 virus and monitored for 14 days post-challenge. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Naïve BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) were inoculated with a mixture of immune sera and 3 × LD
   <sub>50</sub> Cal/09 virus and monitored for 14 days post-challenge. Left panel shows dynamics of body weight change; middle panel shows survival rates; right panel shows analysis of average body weight loss by measuring the area under the curve (AUC, relative to 100% value) for each mouse. For mice that died or were humanely euthanized a 75% value was assigned to all subsequent days for the purpose of statistical analysis. Error bars represent mean ± SD. The survival rates were analyzed by Mantel–Cox test, and the AUC values were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test (*
