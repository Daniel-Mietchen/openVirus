  <p>Overview of the mice study design. Mice were immunized with the recombinant vaccine prototypes three times with a two-week interval. Two weeks after the last immunization mice were bled to assess antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 for each), and to test the indirect protection of immune sera. For the in vivo indirect protection experiment, naïve mice were inoculated with 1:1 sera/virus mixture (3 × LD
   <sub>50</sub> of rgH5N1 or Cal/09 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 for each)) and monitored daily for weight loss and survival for 14 days. In addition, on day 35 and 43 spleens (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) were collected for the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) in vivo assay respectively. On day 45 immunized mice were infected with a lethal dose of challenge virus (3 × LD
   <sub>50</sub> of either PR8 or H3N2 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 for each), or 30 × LD
   <sub>50</sub> Cal/09 virus (
   <italic>n</italic> = 9)) and monitored daily for weight loss and survival for 14 days.
