<p>To test the cross-protective efficacy of the recombinant protein vaccine candidates, groups of 6 BALB/c mice, immunized with the indicated immunogens, were challenged with lethal doses of heterologous and heterosubtypic influenza viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The antibody responses induced by AP-M2e and AP-M2e/tri-stalk immunizations fully protected mice against a lethal unmatched PR8 virus challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). Mice from these two groups displayed minimal signs of disease, measured as weight loss, and completely recovered from the infection. Tri-stalk protein and AP/tri-stalk VLPs provided partial 66.7% protection against PR8 virus challenge, although these vaccination groups experienced significant weight loss. Furthermore, while HA stalk-based vaccine prototypes often elicit incomplete cross-group protection, limited to the sequence similarity between the immunization antigen and challenge virus [

 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], all AP-M2e and AP-M2e/tri-stalk vaccinated animals were completely protected from the group 2 H3N2 virus challenge. The weight loss during the challenge phase did not exceed 10% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). In contrast to the PR8 challenge, immunization with the tri-stalk protein and AP/tri-stalk vaccine candidates did not protect mice against death and weight loss caused by the heterosubtypic H3N2 virus, suggesting that the M2e-targeted antibody were the main contributors to the cross-protection.
