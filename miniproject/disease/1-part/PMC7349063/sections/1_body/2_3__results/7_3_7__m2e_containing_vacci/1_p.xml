<p>The levels of virus/protein-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup>/CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells were assessed by ICS assay. A week after the last immunization, spleens were isolated from immunized BALB/c mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). Splenocytes were stimulated with one of the antigens (whole Cal/09 virus, tri-stalk, 3M2e) in vitro. Neither vaccine candidate could induce significant levels of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to any of the antigens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f011">Figure 11</xref>, right panel). There were no significant increases in the population of Cal/09 and tri-stalk specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell levels after immunizations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f011">Figure 11</xref>, left panel). However, vaccination with 3M2e and AP-M2e significantly increased the population of M2e-specific TNFα-secreting CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f011">Figure 11</xref>C). Interestingly, chemical attachment of the tri-stalk protein to AP-M2e VLPs led to the decrease of the M2e-specific TNFα-secreting CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f011">Figure 11</xref>C). Analysis of effector memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets (CD44
 <sup>+</sup>CD62L
 <sup>−</sup>) led to similar findings: only M2e-containing vaccines could induce significant levels of the M2e-specific CD4 T-cells (
