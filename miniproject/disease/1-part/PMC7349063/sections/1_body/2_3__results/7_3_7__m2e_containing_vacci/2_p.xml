<p>The functional activity of cytotoxic T-cells was measured by a CTL in vivo assay. Splenocytes from na√Øve BALB/c mice were loaded with antigens (tri-stalk, 3M2e) or PBS, differentially labelled with various concentrations of CFSE. This mixture was then administered to BALB/c mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5), immunized as described previously. On the following day, spleens were collected to count the proportion of tri-stalk or M2e loaded cells to the control cells loaded with PBS. Surprisingly, despite the absence of M2e-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells, the immune system of mice vaccinated with M2e-containing vaccine candidates could efficiently recognize and kill the M2e-loaded target cells (

Intriguingly, the 3M2e protein alone induced the highest level of functional cytotoxic T-cells, and the killing activity was significantly higher than in the AP-M2e and AP-M2e/tri-stalk groups. No significant cytotoxic activity against tri-stalk loaded target cells was detected in any group of immunized mice (
