<p>Vaccinated mice were challenged with 30 × LD
 <sub>50</sub> of the Cal/09 virus. Antibody responses induced by all five vaccine candidates delayed the infection and significantly improved the survival rates of mice after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f009">Figure 9</xref>A). However, the tri-stalk protein, AP/tri-stalk, AP-M2e, and 3M2e vaccine prototypes did not protect animals from a significant weight loss, and only 11.1–55.6% of mice survived the infection. In contrast, an impressive 100% survival was achieved in the AP-M2e/tri-stalk group, with no significant weight loss observed. Noteworthy, the AP-M2e/tri-stalk vaccine afforded significantly better protection against this challenge than the AP-M2e vaccine.
