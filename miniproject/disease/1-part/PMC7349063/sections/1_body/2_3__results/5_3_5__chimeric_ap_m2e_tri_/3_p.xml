<p>For the indirect protection study, immune sera from the vaccinated mice were combined with 3 Ã— LD
 <sub>50</sub> of the Cal/09 virus and groups of 5 BALB/c mice were inoculated as described above. Only the sera from AP/tri-stalk and AP-M2e/tri-stalk immunized mice possessed a strong protective activity against the homologous Cal/09 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f009">Figure 9</xref>B). In addition, the AP-M2e/tri-stalk immune sera significantly enhanced survival rates as compared to the tri-stalk and AP/tri-stalk groups, and it was the only vaccine candidate to protect animals against significant weight loss. These data suggest that the tri-stalk targeted antibodies are critical for the protection against a homologous influenza virus infection, and the antibodies targeted to M2e play a supporting role.
