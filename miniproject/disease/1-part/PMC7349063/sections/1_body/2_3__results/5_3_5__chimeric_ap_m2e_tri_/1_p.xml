<p>We conducted an additional challenge experiment with a high dose of homologous Cal/09 virus. For the direct protection study, groups of 9 BALB/c mice were vaccinated as described above, with an additional vaccination group immunized with an Alum-adjuvanted 3M2e protein. All vaccine constructs were very immunogenic, as showed by ELISA, with serum IgG antibody raised to the corresponding antigen present in each vaccine candidate, affirming the data obtained in at the previous experiments and confirming that the immunizations were successful (
