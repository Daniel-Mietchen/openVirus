<p>We also performed an in vivo passive transfer experiment. Immune sera, collected as described above, was mixed with 3 × LD
 <sub>50</sub> of rgH5N1 challenge virus and intranasally administered to groups of 6 naïve BALB/c mice. Sera from AP-M2e and AP-M2e/tri-stalk immunized mice possessed a strong cross-protective activity against heterosubtypic lethal rgH5N1 virus showing a 100% survival rate and no significant weight loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f008">Figure 8</xref>). AP/tri-stalk immune sera conferred partial protection against the rgH5N1 virus challenge, and mice from this group exhibited significantly decreased weight loss as compared to the negative control group. In contrast, sera from the tri-stalk immunized mice were not cross-protective, suggesting that the VLP delivery of the tri-stalk protein can significantly improve the breadth of antibody reactivity. Similar to the direct protection experiment, these data demonstrate that the M2e-based vaccines provide full protection against the rgH5N1 challenge, whereas the tri-stalk antigen can only partially protect mice against this virus.
