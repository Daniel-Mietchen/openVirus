<p>Levels of ADCC were measured by determining degranulation activity of mouse NK-cells under the influence of the immune sera. NK-cells recognize viral antigens on the surfaces of virus-infected cells and directly induce their clearance [
 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. MDCK cells expressing Cal/09 viral proteins were used as target cells capturing virus-specific antibodies from immune sera. The NK-cell degranulation induced by the Fc-domains of the captured antibody was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. All five vaccine prototypes induced significant degranulation by NK-cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f010">Figure 10</xref>), however, more distinct ADCC activity was seen for the AP/tri-stalk and AP-M2e/tri-stalk immune sera. Although the difference between the AP-M2e and AP-M2e/tri-stalk groups was not significant by the ANOVA test, a direct comparison of these groups using a non-parametric Mannâ€“Whitney U test revealed a strong significance (
