<p>Furthermore, we assessed the reactivity of the serum IgG antibody with a panel of full-length recombinant group 1 and 2 HA proteins (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f006">Figure 6</xref>). As the AP-M2e vaccination group had no HA-targeted antibody, sera from this group were not included in the cross-reactivity analysis. Chimeric cH6/1 HA contained an irrelevant head domain from avian H6N1 virus and a stalk originated from Cal/09 virus, perfectly matching the sequence of the tri-stalk protein. High levels of homologous cH6/1-binding antibody were observed in the AP/tri-stalk and AP-M2e/tri-stalk vaccination groups, with lower levels identified in the group vaccinated with tri-stalk protein alone (

Similarly, both chimeric VLPs elicited broad antibody responses against other heterosubtypic group 1 HA proteins (pre-2009 H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, and H11) whereas antisera from the tri-stalk vaccine group had weak cross-reactivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f005">Figure 5</xref>Bâ€“H), showing that proper presentation of the viral antigen on the VLP platform can significantly improve the cross-reactive potential of the induced antibody. In addition, AP/tri-stalk induced antisera cross-reacted substantially with group 2 H3, H4, and H10 HAs, but not against the H7 HA protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Some group 2 cross-reactivity was observed in the AP-M2e/tri-stalk vaccination group as well, however, it was lower than in the AP/tri-stalk group, suggesting that the addition of the 3M2e antigen to the AP/tri-stalk vaccine could reduce cross-reactivity of HA-binding antibody.
