<p>Female BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally immunized with one of the four protein antigens (tri-stalk, AP/tri-stalk, AP-M2e, AP-M2e/tri-stalk) combined with Alum adjuvant in a prime-boost schedule with two-week intervals between the three immunizations; the control group received PBS with Alum adjuvant. Two weeks after the last immunization mice (
