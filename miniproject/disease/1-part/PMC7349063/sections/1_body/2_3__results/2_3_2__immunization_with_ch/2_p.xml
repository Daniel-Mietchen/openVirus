<p>All vaccine prototypes induced high levels of homologous serum IgG antibody against the tri-stalk and 3M2e antigens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). Significant differences in the amount of tri-stalk binding antibody were observed, with chimeric VLPs exposing tri-stalk inducing higher antibody levels than the tri-stalk protein alone. Both VLP vaccines induced comparable levels of tri-stalk targeted antibody since both constructs carry identical viral antigen on the same delivery vehicle. However, coupling of the tri-stalk antigen to the AP-M2e VLPs slightly reduced the reactivity of antisera with anti-M2e antibodies. Furthermore, we examined the IgG1/IgG2a subclass profile of the induced serum antibody. The tri-stalk antigen predominantly elicited homologous antibody of the IgG1 subclass, suggesting the induction of Th2-biased immune responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Yet, coupling of the tri-stalk to either AP205 VLPs or AP-M2e VLPs significantly increased the proportion of the tri-stalk-reactive IgG2a antibody. Since the IgG1 levels between these three vaccine groups were comparable, the differences in the total IgG antibody were driven mainly by the IgG2a subclass. Similarly, although the majority of M2e-binding antibodies were of IgG1 subclass, some levels of M2e-reactive IgG2a antibody were also detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). For the 3M2e antigen, the differences in the immunogenicity between the two M2e-containing vaccines were driven by the IgG1 subclass antibody, further suggesting that the induction of IgG2a antibody is dependent on the VLP vehicle, rather than the antigen itself.
