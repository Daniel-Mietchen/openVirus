<p>Since aa 10â€“24 of M2e peptide vary between influenza virus subtypes, combining the M2e from different subtypes can increase the vaccine-induced cross-protection [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, a 3M2e protein, corresponding to three variants of the conserved M2e peptide, was expressed in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00197">Table S1</xref>). The 3M2e sequence was derived from the M2e of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, as well as H1N1 and H11N9 subtypes to cover a wider range of influenza viruses. Noteworthy, two of the M2e fragments comprising the 3M2e protein share high sequence similarity with the M2e from H3N2 viruses. In parallel, sequence of the 3M2e was genetically fused to the C-terminus of AP205 CP yielding in expression of stable chimeric AP-M2e particles. Phage AP205 VLPs and AP-M2e VLPs were expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as described in Materials and Methods section (
