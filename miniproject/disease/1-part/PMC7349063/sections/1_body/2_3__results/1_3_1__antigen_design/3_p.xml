<p>An N-terminally extended LAH of H1 HA stalk (referred to as tri-stalk protein) was expressed and purified using a three-step chromatography method as described in our previous study (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). This was done by chemical crosslinking via the SMPH linker between the VLPs and SATA-modified tri-stalk protein. Due to the crosslinking of subunits, derivatization of VLPs shows the typical VLP ladder with monomeric and multimeric subunits. Although some aggregation was observed, the chimeric particles were stable upon freezing at −20 °C and subsequent thawing as confirmed by SDS/PAGE and electron microscopy (
