<p>AP205 and AP-M2e VLPs: The gene encoding wild-type AP205 CP [
 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was introduced into the pETDuet-1 expression vector (Novagen, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The 72 aa sequence encoding the 3M2e protein was genetically fused to the C-terminus of AP205 CP; the final construct was designated as AP-M2e. AP205 and AP-M2e VLPs were produced in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells. The cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl). To the supernatant, ammonium sulphate was added to 40% saturation following incubation for 1 h at +4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in a minimal volume of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and subjected to thermal treatment (30 min at +55 °C) following cooling down to the RT and centrifugation. For purification of AP205 VLPs, supernatant was passed through a size-exclusion Sepharose 4 FF matrix (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) in buffer A. Selected fractions were loaded on an anion-exchange Fractogel TMAE (M) matrix (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in buffer A. Bound protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 M NaCl). Ammonium sulphate was added to the selected fractions to the concentration of 1.5 M. For final purification, a hydrophobic-interaction Fractogel Propyl (S) matrix (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), equilibrated with 50 mM NaHPO
 <sub>4</sub> (pH 7.3) and 1.5 mM ammonium sulphate buffer, was used. Bound protein was linearly eluted with 25 mM NaHPO
 <sub>4</sub> (pH 7.3) buffer. For purification of chimeric AP-M2e VLPs, soluble fraction was passed through a size-exclusion Sepharose 4 FF matrix in buffer A. Selected fractions were loaded on an anion-exchange Fractogel DEAE (M) matrix (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A. Bound protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient of buffer B.
