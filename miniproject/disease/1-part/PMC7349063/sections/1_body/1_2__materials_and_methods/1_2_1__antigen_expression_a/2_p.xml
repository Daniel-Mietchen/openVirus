<p>3M2e protein: The gene of a 3M2e protein, corresponding to a triplet 24 aa sequence of the M2e, derived from H1N1, H5N1 and H11N9 subtypes [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00197">Table S1</xref>), was synthesized and supplied by BioCat GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany), cloned in a pET24a(+) vector. The construct was originally designed for chemical coupling purposes and contained a 6His-Tag sequence along with the TEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminus and a cysteine separated by a rigid EAAAK linker at the C-terminus. The construct was expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells according to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. For purification, cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl) by sonication. Supernatant was passed through a 1 mL HisTrap
 <sup>TM</sup> FF crude column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) in lysis buffer containing 10 mM imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.5 M imidazole in lysis buffer. For the final polishing, the protein was passed through the Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mM NaCl.
