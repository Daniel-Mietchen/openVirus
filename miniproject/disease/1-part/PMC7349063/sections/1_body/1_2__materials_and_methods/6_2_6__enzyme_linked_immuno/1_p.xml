<p>For ELISA, EIA/RIA 96-Well microtitration plates (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) were coated with 50 μL of the recombinant proteins at a concentration of 2 µg/mL overnight at +4 °C. Plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) and blocked with 50 μL of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min at +37 °C. Three-fold dilutions of sera were prepared starting from 1:100 (for IgG and IgG1) or 1:10 (for IgG2a) and added to the coated wells (50 µL/well). The plates were incubated for 1 h at +37 °C and washed four times with PBST. Bound IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies were detected with 50 μL of horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) or primary rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) respectively, followed by the addition of secondary HRPO conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) for IgG1 and IgG2a antibody detection. Plates were incubated with primary antibody or the conjugates for 30 min at +37 °C and washed four times with PBST. The detection of antibody binding was performed with 3,3’, 5,5’;-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (1-Step Ultra TMB–ELISA Substrate Solution, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). The endpoint serum IgG antibody titers were determined as the last serum dilution with OD
 <sub>450</sub> value exceeding at least twice the mean OD values of the control wells (all the components except mouse sera). For negative specimens, the titers were assigned a value of 1:50 (for IgG and IgG1) or 1:5 (for IgG2a) for group comparison purposes. The log10-transformed antibody titers were used for statistical analyses.
