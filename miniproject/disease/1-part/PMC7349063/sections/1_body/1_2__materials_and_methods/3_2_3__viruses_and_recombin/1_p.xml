<p>Influenza viruses used in the experiments were PR8 (wild-type H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Saint Petersburg, Russia), Cal/09 (a mouse-adapted H1N1 A/California/7/2009 virus, Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza, Saint Petersburg, Russia), H3N2 (a mouse-adapted PR8-based reassortant H3N2 A/Philippines/2/1982 (X-79) virus, ISMMS, New York, USA), and rgH5N1 (a mouse-adapted PR8-based reassortant virus with HA and NA genes from H5N1 A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 virus, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA). For ICS analyses, H1N1 A/California/7/2009 virus was purified by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient. The viruses were propagated in eggs for 2 days at +37 °C and stored in single-use aliquots at −70 °C. All experiments with viruses were performed in a BSL2 conditions.</p>
