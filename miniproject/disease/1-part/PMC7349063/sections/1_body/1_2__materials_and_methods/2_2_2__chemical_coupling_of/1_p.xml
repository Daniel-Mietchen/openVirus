<p>To introduce a sulfhydryl group into tri-stalk protein, SATA reagent was added according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly, tri-stalk protein was combined with a 3.3-fold molar excess of SATA in DMSO and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Unreacted SATA was removed using Zeba™ Spin desalting column (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, lL, USA). Free sulfhydryl groups were generated by mixing the protein solution with 1/10 volume of deacetylation solution (0.5 M hydroxylamine, 25 mM EDTA in PBS, pH 7.2–7.5) and incubating for 2 h at RT. Hydroxylamine was removed by desalting. The sulfhydryl-modified tri-stalk was promptly used for chemical coupling to AP205 or AP-M2e VLPs. First, VLPs were mixed with a 10-fold excess of SMPH crosslinker (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) in DMSO and incubated for 30 min at RT. Residual crosslinker was removed by desalting. Subsequently, the amine-modified VLPs were combined with a 3-fold excess of sulfhydryl-modified tri-stalk protein and incubated for 30 min at RT; part of the unreacted tri-stalk protein was removed using Amicon-Ultra 4, 100K (Merck-Millipore, Cork, Ireland). Coupling efficiency was determined by SDS/PAGE. Single use aliquots of the conjugated proteins were stored at −20 °C.</p>
