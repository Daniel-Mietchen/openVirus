<p>T-cell-mediated immune responses were analyzed by ICS to gamma-interferon (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Murine splenocytes were isolated one week after the third immunization and red blood cells were lysed by ammonium-chloride potassium lysis buffer (ACK Lysing Buffer, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). For in vitro stimulation, 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells were incubated with either purified antigens (tri-stalk and 3M2e) at 1 µg/well or sucrose-gradient purified Cal/09 virus at an MOI of 1.0 EID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell for one h in 100 µL of CR-0, in 96-well microtitration U-bottom well plates (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Then, 50 µL of CR-30 (CR-0 with 30% FBS) was added, to the final FBS concentration of 10%. After 16–18 h, 50 µL of GolgiPlug solution (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA)—alone or with PMA (Phorbol myristate acetate as positive control)—were added at 1:250 dilution and the mixture was incubated for another five h. Samples were stained with ZombieAqua fixable viability dye, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD44, anti-CD62L antibody-conjugates for 20 min in a cool dark place (
