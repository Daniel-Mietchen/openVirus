<p>An in vivo cytotoxicity assay was performed as described by Durward et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] with modifications. Briefly, target cells were prepared from splenocytes of naïve BALB/c mice (1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> splenocytes in 10 mL complete DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) and loaded with either 200 µg of protein (tri-stalk or 3M2e) or an equal volume of PBS for one h at +37 °C, with occasional mixing. Next, cells were washed with PBS and stained with different concentrations of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) in PBS (60, 15 or 3.75 mM CFSE for 3M2e, tri-stalk and PBS control, respectively). Cells were then washed, resuspended in Hanks solution, and mixed in equal amounts to the final concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> cells/mL. Ten million prefiltered target cells were administered in 100 µL to anaesthetized BALB/c mice by retro-orbital injection. After 16–18 h, mice were sacrificed; splenocytes were harvested and assessed by flow cytometry. Gating strategy is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00197">Supplementary (Figure S3)</xref>. The ratio of peptide-loaded to control target cells was calculated as a normalized measure of protein-specific cytotoxicity between immunization groups. The ratio in placebo group samples (PBS) was assumed as survival at basal protein-specific cytotoxicity.
