<p>The functional activity of the induced antibody was assessed by ADCC assay, performed by measuring the levels of NK-cell degranulation activity. MDCK cells were used as target cells expressing viral antigens since it is known that HA and M2 proteins are expressed abundantly on the surface of influenza virus infected cells [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. MDCK cell monolayers, seeded in 96-well plates (tissue culture plate 96-well flat, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) the day before, were infected with Cal/09 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 3. Two h after inoculation, conditional medium was removed and 15 µL of serum samples were added in duplicates to the wells, followed by incubation at +37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 15 min. Then, 135 µL of CR-0 (2.5 mL 1 M Hepes, 5 mL Glutamax (Gibco), 5 mL antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco), 17 µL β-mercaptoethanol, RPMI-1640 (Gibco) up to 500 mL) with 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> murine splenocytes collected from naïve C57BL/6J mice were added to each sample and incubated overnight. After 16–18 h, supernatants were collected from the plate and stained with ZombieAqua fixable viability dye, anti-CD3, anti-CD49b, anti-CD45.2, anti-CD107a antibody- conjugates for 20 min in a cool dark place (

At least 100,000 events were measured using a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Data were analysed using FlowJo software (TriStar Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA). Gating strategy is shown in
