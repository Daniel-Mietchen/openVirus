<p>Data were analyzed with the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical significance of immunogenicity outcomes (the log10-transformed antibody titers, ADCC levels, virus/peptide-specific T-cell levels, or the in vivo killing activity of CTLs) and protection outcomes (AUC of weight loss values) were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test (for comparing ELISA endpoint titer values). Differences in the survival rates after challenge were analyzed by a log-rank Mantel–Cox test.</p>
