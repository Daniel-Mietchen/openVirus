<p>Direct protection: BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with three doses of each vaccine antigen at a dose of 25 µg of protein per mouse, two weeks apart (the number of animal is indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00197-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The proteins were diluted to 0.25 mg/mL in PBS and 100 µL of antigen were combined with 100 µL of Alum adjuvant (AlumVax Hydroxide 2% ready-to-use suspension, OZ Biosciences, Marseille, France). The control group received sterile PBS with adjuvant. Two weeks after the last immunization mice were bled via retro-orbital sinus to obtain serum samples. At day 45, mice were challenged intranasally with 50 µL of 3 × LD
 <sub>50</sub> of either PR8 or H3N2 virus, or 30 × LD
 <sub>50</sub> of Cal/09 virus. Weight loss and survival of the challenged mice were monitored daily for 14 days post-infection. Survival was defined as a 25% weight loss for PR8 and H3N2 viruses and 30% for the Cal/09 virus.
