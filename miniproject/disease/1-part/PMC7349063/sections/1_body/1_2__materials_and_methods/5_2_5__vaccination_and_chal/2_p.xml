<p>Passive transfer: An in vivo indirect protection assay was carried out as described previously [
 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Briefly, sera from immunized or naïve mice obtained during the direct protection experiment were mixed with PBS at a 1:1 ratio and heat-inactivated at 56 °С for 1 h. Then the sera were mixed 1:1 with rgH5N1 or Cal/09 virus, to reach the dose 3 × LD
 <sub>50</sub> and incubated at RT for 30 min. Naïve BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with a mixture of virus and sera at a volume of 50 µL and monitored for their survival rates and weight loss for 14 days post-infection (
