<p>However, despite the highly conserved nature, vaccines based solely on one conserved influenza antigen most often cannot provide complete protection against highly divergent heterosubtypic virus infections [

 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, although M2e vaccine prototypes have shown promising effects in animal models, the results do not always translate well to human studies, with high-dose associated adverse reactions, rapidly decreasing antibody titers or narrow cell-mediated immunity [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Vaccine candidates including several conserved epitopes might confer broader and longer-lasting protection against influenza virus infections. In the present study, we investigated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a panel of broadly protective influenza vaccine prototypes based on influenza HA stalk and M2e antigens integrated into bacteriophage AP205 coat protein (CP) VLPs expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> system. As the termini of AP205 CP are surface exposed, it is particularly tolerant to N- and C-terminal fusions. In addition, due to the interdimer disulfide bonds, AP205 CP VLPs are very stable, making them a particularly suitable platform for carrying foreign antigens [

The merging of genetic fusion and chemical coupling techniques to expose two different foreign influenza antigens on a single particle without compromising the trimeric conformation of the stalk protein is a perspective approach for a broadly-effective vaccine candidate that could protect against the constantly emerging influenza virus strains. Similar VLP vaccine candidates have employed a linear LAH epitope [

 <xref rid="B33-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; however, such strategy does not embrace the immunological advantages of conformational epitopes [
