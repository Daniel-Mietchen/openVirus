<p>Although influenza is considered to be a vaccine-preventable disease, the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines varies greatly across the risk groups and seasons, on average between 19â€“60% [

 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Currently licensed vaccines induce a strain-specific antibody response, hence vaccine effectiveness is significantly compromised by the persistent antigenic changes of influenza viruses [

Continuous antibody-mediated immune pressure and the lack of a proof-reading function for RNA polymerase errors result in accumulation of point mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase genes and in constant emergence of mutant variants affecting immune recognition. This process, characteristic to both influenza A and B viruses, is known as antigenic drift and it has the potential to cause local outbreaks and seasonal epidemics [

Moreover, sporadic reassortment of segmented influenza A virus genomes in a double-infected host cell can result in an antigenic shift, which can lead to a global pandemic by producing an unpredicted virus strain to which the immunologically naive human population is particularly susceptible. Interspecies transmissions of influenza A viruses from animal reservoirs have resulted in four pandemics since the beginning of the 20th century; the Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918 is considered to be the most lethal in history, with a mortality rate of over 50 million cases [
