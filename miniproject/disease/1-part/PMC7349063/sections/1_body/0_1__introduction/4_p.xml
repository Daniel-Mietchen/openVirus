<p>All these challenges indicate the need for more effective vaccination strategies aimed at inducing broad cross-protection not only against seasonal influenza variants but also zoonotic and emerging pandemic influenza strains. A number of conserved protein targets to elicit such cross-protective immunity have been under investigation for almost two decades, with long alpha-helix (LAH) from HA stalk and ectodomain of matrix protein 2 ion channel (M2e) being the most studied ones [

Antigen presentation on the surface of virus-like particles (VLPs) stands out as one of the most efficient techniques to enhance the exposure of such weak immunogens to the host immune system by displaying the antigens of choice in a symmetric, highly organized structure with a large number of repetitions [
