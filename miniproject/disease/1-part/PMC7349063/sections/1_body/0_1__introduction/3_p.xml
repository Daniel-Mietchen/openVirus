<p>Annual immunization with updated seasonal vaccine formulations is recommended [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but prediction mismatches between the vaccine strains and circulating viruses can dramatically decrease the vaccine effectiveness [

Furthermore, the components of commercially available influenza vaccines are mainly obtained by propagating viruses in embryonated chicken eggs which is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process with limitations for highly pathogenic avian-borne influenza virus vaccine preparations [

 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The capability to manufacture large amounts of strain-specific vaccine doses in the event of a sudden influenza pandemic is limited, which means that during the months of vaccine preparation, testing and distribution, society can be particularly vulnerable to the newly emerged virus strain [

 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, many of these approaches could not provide broad and durable protection from influenza virus drift and shift variants.
