<p>The combination of multiple conserved influenza antigens into a multivalent single-component AP-M2e/tri-stalk vaccine protected mice from high dose homologous influenza challenge and induced robust heterosubtypic immunity. Since persistent vaccine-induced immunity is a highly desirable feature of a broadly protective influenza vaccine, it should be noted that both the post-fusion LAH- and M2e-based vaccines are known to elicit long-lasting antibody responses [

The vaccine candidates can be further improved by changing their formulation for intranasal delivery since intranasal administration of VLPs with relevant mucosal adjuvants has been shown to induce strong and durable cross-protective immunity [

 <xref rid="B65-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that the AP-M2e/tri-stalk vaccine prototype might provide broad protection against seasonal and emergent influenza strains, thus replacing the current vaccination strategies.
