<p>Evolutionarily conserved influenza antigens could potentially provide broad-spectrum protection against highly variable influenza virus subtypes, while significantly reducing the time and costs of vaccine production. Furthermore, recombinant vaccines help to avoid potentially harmful influenza viruses grown in embryonated eggs or cell cultures and therefore attract significant research interest. Here we evaluated the antigenicity and protective potential of recombinant influenza vaccine prototypes, generated by combining the methods of genetic fusion and covalent coupling to present the otherwise poor immunogens HA tri-stalk and 3M2e on the surface of AP205 VLPs.</p>
