<p>Consequently, the tri-stalk antigen was capable to confer partial protection against lethal heterologous PR8 virus infection, with which the tri-stalk shares a high sequence similarity (

 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the protective immunity induced by the tri-stalk protein and AP/tri-stalk vaccines was substantially diminished when challenged with a group 2 virus. Even though the tri-stalk binding antibody had some level of cross-reactivity with the H3 HA protein, they were unable to protect mice against the H3N2 virus challenge, further indicating that the stalk-reactive antibodies afford little cross-protection between group 1 and 2 influenza viruses. Importantly, H3N2 viruses show the highest degree of antigenic drift when compared to other seasonal influenza viruses, posing the greatest risk of unmatched seasonal vaccine formulations and therefore the lowest seasonal vaccine effectiveness [
