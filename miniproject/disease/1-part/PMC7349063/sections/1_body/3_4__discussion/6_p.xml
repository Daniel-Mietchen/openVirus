<p>The study has several limitations. First, the performance of the vaccine candidates was assessed only by measuring immune responses and monitoring weight loss and survival upon a lethal influenza virus challenge. Assessment of virus replication in the mouse respiratory tract could provide additional evidence for the ability of the induced antibody and T-cells to clear the virus but would require a much larger number of mice for this study. Nevertheless, for the vaccines that do not induce neutralizing antibodies the assessment of vaccine efficacy only by a clinical endpoint is widely accepted [

Finally, the immunogenicity of the constructed VLPs was evaluated only in the presence of an adjuvant, yet there are multiple confirmations that VLPs contribute to robust and durable IgG responses themselves due to their highly repetitive and particulate properties [
