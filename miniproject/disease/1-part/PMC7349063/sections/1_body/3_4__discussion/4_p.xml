<p>Although many researchers highlight the necessity to create a multi-component vaccine including epitopes from both group 1 and group 2 viruses to achieve a complete cross-protection against type A influenza [

 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], here we bypass the issue of insufficient cross-protective efficacy by incorporating both an H1 derived tri-stalk and a conserved 3M2e protein in a single recombinant immunogen. Even though our M2e-based vaccine candidates predominantly induced antibodies of IgG1 subclass, M2e-specific IgG1 antibodies have been shown to result in significant protection against divergent influenza viruses, probably because the high level of IgG1 antibodies could compensate their low affinity to activated FcÎ³Rs [

Likewise, in this study, the addition of the 3M2e antigen to the AP/tri-stalk antigen increased the cross-protective efficiency of the chimeric VLPs to an impressive 100% when challenged with heterosubtypic group 1 and group 2 viruses. Unlike observed in previous studies [

 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], challenged AP-M2e/tri-stalk vaccinated mice did not experience significant disease symptoms. However, it should be noted that the H3N2 virus carries internal genes from the PR8 virus (including the M2e peptide) (
