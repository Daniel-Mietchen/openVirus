<p>An in vivo passive transfer-challenge experiment demonstrated that the induced cross-protection is mainly antibody-mediated but acts by different modes. The tri-stalk targeted antibodies elicited by the AP/tri-stalk immunization were able to partially protect mice against lethal heterosubtypic rgH5N1 virus challenge, whereas sera from the tri-stalk immunized mice failed to protect animals. The M2e-specific antibodies were even more effective, resulting in full protection against the clinical manifestations of the infection. In this study, only the levels of IgG antibody binding were studied as a measure of immunogenicity and cross-reactivity of the vaccine, without testing their neutralizing capacity, as we did not expect high levels of virus-neutralizing antibody. Although some anti-stalk antibodies can directly neutralize the influenza virus [

 <xref rid="B55-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Here, the ADCC assay demonstrated that the tri-stalk induced protection is mostly dependent on the antibody effector functions, thus preserving the protective potential in serum transfer experiments. In contrast, the M2e-based protection is mediated both by the antibody Fc-receptor effector mechanisms and by some T-cell based activity, which has been shown to correlate with better vaccine-induced protection in the elderly and to confer a durable protective efficiency [

 <xref rid="B59-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It remains to be investigated whether the M2e-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells possess direct cytotoxic activity, or if there are other immune cells with cytotoxic potential which are induced by the M2e-based vaccine candidates. Additional challenge experiment with a high dose of homologous H1N1 influenza virus emphasized the important role of tri-stalk targeted antibody as in this experiment the tri-stalk antibodies were the main mediators of protection. Although M2e-binding antibodies were also involved in mediating the protection, a passive serum transfer experiment showed that they were not sufficient to defend mice against the infection. It is therefore not surprising that the best protective effect could be achieved when these conserved antigens were combined in single vaccine preparation.
