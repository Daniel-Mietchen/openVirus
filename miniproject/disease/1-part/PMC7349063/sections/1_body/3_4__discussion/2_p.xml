 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], a great part of the stalk-specific antibodies have a group-specific binding profile, dependent on the structural divergence between group 1 and group 2 HAs [

Comparison of aa sequences of N-terminally extended LAH fragment of HA proteins used in this study revealed that the observed differences in cross-reactivity of the tri-stalk induced antibody also correlate with the conservation difference between the immunization antigen and HA proteins (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00197">Table S2</xref>). The HA stalk-targeted antibodies were cross-reactive and could efficiently recognize HA proteins from heterologous group 1 influenza viruses; notably, cross-reactivity with group 2 antigens was also observed in the AP/tri-stalk vaccination group, and to some extent—in the AP-M2e/tri-stalk vaccination group. In general, higher sequence identity was associated with increased cross-reactivity, with H7 LAH protein being the most distant from the tri stalk fragment, thus demonstrating the lowest cross-reactivity of the induced antibody. The delivery of the tri-stalk antigen using the AP205 VLP platform significantly improved the cross-reactivity of the HA-based antibody. Accordingly, the assessment of IgG antibody subclasses revealed that our vaccine candidates predominantly elicited the IgG1 antibodies, while the delivery of the virus antigens by the AP205 VLPs promoted switching to the IgG2a subclass. Mouse IgG subclasses play different roles in the antiviral immunity and their biological activities are dependent on the binding affinities to the activating and inhibitory Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs), with IgG1 subclass considered less protective than the IgG2 subclass [

 <xref rid="B50-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The vehicle-based shifting to IgG2a subclass might be linked to the VLP-packed RNA as removal of bacteriophage VLP RNA has been shown to result in a shift of the induced IgG isotypes from IgG2a/c to IgG1 [
 <xref rid="B51-vaccines-08-00197" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, even prevailing induction of IgG1 subclass of post-fusion LAH-specific antibodies can provide significant protection against lethal heterologous virus infection [
