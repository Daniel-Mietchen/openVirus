<p>India is an endemic zone of hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is associated with both sporadic and epidemic infections. West Bengal in India is an endemic zone of HEV and there have been several outbreaks of HEV. In an epidemiological study done in West Bengal, the presence of anti-HEV IgG antibody was found in 41.8% of patients with acute viral hepatitis and in 23% of healthy individuals, indicating a high prevalence of HEV [

Apart from hepatic manifestation, hepatitis E causes florid extrahepatic manifestations including acute pancreatitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuralgic amyotrophy, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis, and mixed cryoglobulinaemia. Viral infection is an important cause of acute myocarditis, and the spectrum of viruses known to cause myocarditis has changed in the past two decades. Myocarditis occurs due to a self-directed immune response between host-pathogen interaction that affects mainly younger adults. Acute myocarditis is uncommon in hepatitis E infection and has been reported in young adults in the literature. Despite several reported outbreaks of HEV in West Bengal, up to date, there is no reported case of HEV-induced myocarditis especially in the elderly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of hepatitis E-induced acute myocarditis, observed in an elderly woman from West Bengal, India.
