<p>After admission, her initial laboratory investigation revealed a haemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, a total leucocyte count of 13,000 cells/ÂµL, a serum sodium of 133 mmol/L, and a serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L. Serum procalcitonin was 0.61 ng/mL and C-reactive protein was 30 mg/L. Urine for culture and sensitivity was positive for the growth of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with 1 lakh CFU/mL. Her total bilirubin was 4.2 mg/dL with a direct fraction of 2.9 mg/dL and an indirect fraction of 1.3 mg/dL. Her liver enzymes were severely elevated; aspartate transaminase 2,451 U/L, alanine transaminase 904 U/L, and gamma-glutamyltransferase 116.5 U/L, suggestive of acute liver injury. Her coagulation profile was deranged with an international normalized ratio of 2.37 and an altered albumin globulin ratio. Serum amylase was 1,047 U/L and lipase was 38.1 U/L. Portal vein Doppler showed increased velocity in the splenoportal vein (17.2 cm/s). There was no thrombus in the inferior vena cava or the hepatic vein. Her direct Coombs test was negative. Her blood urea was 66 mg/dL, and serum creatinine was 2.1 mg/dL with normal electrolytes. To understand the exact aetiology of hepatic injury, a viral screen was sent. IgM anti-HEV came strongly positive with a very high titre. Other viral screens such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and dengue all came negative, and IgM for Leptospira was also negative. Her peripheral blood smear for malaria parasite and rapid malarial antigen tests were negative. Her routine urine showed 1+ protein and plenty of pus cells without any cast red blood cells. High-flow oxygen, diuretic, and bronchodilators along with supportive care for acute hepatitis-like vitamin K, ursodeoxycholic acid, and multivitamin were started with close monitoring of liver function. In view of plenty of pus cells in urine, one broad-spectrum antibiotic was started which further escalated to meropenem based on culture sensitivity report, but there was no improvement in her respiratory distress. She was restless and dyspnoeic. Repeat arterial blood gas analysis revealed type 1 respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and ECG showed sinus tachycardia, elevation of the PR segment, and dynamic ST-T changes. Chest X-ray was suggestive of pulmonary congestion. Urgent 2D echocardiography revealed generalized and global hypokinesia of myocardium; on diffusion image the myocardium seemed to be oedematous. All the four chambers of the heart were dilated, LV and RV size were enlarged, and the ejection fraction was 25%, suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). NT pro-BNP was markedly high (&gt;35,000 pg/mL) and creatinine kinase-MB fraction levels were increased (239.1 mg/dL, 17.42% of total CK). This was suggestive of myocarditis with acutely decompensated heart failure, and a low-dose cardioselective B1 adrenergic agent was started. Intravenous furosemide was added to optimize intravascular volume. Nitrate was given. Initially ivabradine was given, then a beta-blocker was added after spasm had subsided. She required non-invasive ventilation support using continuous positive airway pressure at 10 cm H
 <sub>2</sub>O to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation. Cardiology consultation was sought for and a coronary angiogram was done to rule out any coronary artery disease. No significant abnormalities were noted in the coronary angiogram.
