<p>Acute myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is a serious clinical complication mainly arising from infective (mainly viral/parasitic/bacterial) and non-infective aetiology (granulomatous inflammatory disease, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, toxin exposure such as alcohol, heavy metal poisoning, nutrient deficiency). Acute myocarditis often presents with acute life-threatening decompensated heart failure and leads to permanent damage of the myocardium, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. Systemic viral infection and immunological response targeting the myocardium secondary to viremia is an imperative reason for postviraemic myocarditis. The picornavirus family of RNA viruses – principally enterovirus, Coxsackievirus, ECHO virus influenza, and poliovirus – is mainly implicated as a causative agent for postviral myocarditis. In the literature, numerous other viral infections have been reported as reasons for myocarditis, including parvoviruses, adenovirus, H1N1 flu infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, rubella (German measles), varicella (chickenpox), mumps, measles, yellow fever, dengue, polio, rabies, hepatitis A and C, HIV, and Zika infection, and parvovirus B19 [

First, the viral infection generates direct damages to the myocardium (virus-mediated lysis of myocardial cells), and then host immune responses produce indirect lesions of the cardiac muscle by killing virus-infected (antiviral immunity) and -uninfected (autoimmunity) cardiomyocytes; some cases progress to dilated cardiomyopathy, and some may result in heart failure or sudden death [

Up to date, hepatitis E-mediated intense myocarditis has been accounted for in three peer-reviewed journals, of which two were from the Indian peninsula and other from the western hemisphere, and all patients were young adults aged &lt;40 years. The pathophysiology of postinfective myocarditis being immunogenic and depending on the host immune response, mostly young adults are affected. However, the non-infective aetiology of myocarditis has no age bar. Postinfective myocarditis in the elderly is rare. Viral myocarditis presents with various symptoms, ranging from negligibly symptomatic cases to fatal arrhythmia and cardiogenic shock, and may create chronic myocarditis and enlarged cardiomyopathy in a few patients [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which rely on traditional histological stains, remain the standard for diagnosis of myocarditis. Regardless of the endomyocardial biopsy yield being just 10–20%, endomyocardial biopsy findings remain the standard of care for diagnosing myocarditis [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cardiac MRI might be helpful for diagnosing myocarditis by documenting muscle oedema, hyperaemia, or fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The clinical diagnosis of myocarditis was established based on the clinical setting and finding of specific changes in ECG, global hypokinesia with dilatation of all four chambers of the heart along with reduced ejection fraction in echocardiography, elevated cardiac enzymes, and high NT pro-BNP. Normal coronary angiography ruled out ischemic cardiomyopathy. Endomyocardial biopsy was not performed as the patient's relatives did not give consent, understanding the inherent risk of the procedure at this age. HEV-induced acute myocarditis was the only apparent cause for this acutely decompensated heart failure. HEV being a self-remitting disease, the patient started to improve clinically over the next week. With the gradual resolution of liver enzymes and the disappearance of viremia, cardiac function also improved. Overall, clinical cardiac status and echo parameters significantly improved over the next 2 weeks. On the fourteenth day after admission, the patient's ejection fraction had improved to 50%, there was no dyspnoea, and she required no oxygen.
