<p>The session opened with an invited presentation by 
 <bold>Tanja Strive</bold> (CSIRO Health &amp; Biosecurity; Centre for invasive species solutions, Canberra, Australia) on the biological control of rabbits in Australia—“an ongoing co-evolutionary arms race”. Two self-disseminating viral biocontrol agents of European rabbits were discussed; myxoma virus (MYXV), which attenuated shortly after its release; and the calicivirus, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which appears to be evolving towards high levels of virulence to facilitate insect transmission from virus-laden carcasses. Dr. Strive highlighted that long-term management of rabbit populations will stem from increased research into rabbit caliciviruses, particularly in the context of recent increases in the genetic diversity caliciviruses in Australia and New Zealand.
