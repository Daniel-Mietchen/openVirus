 <bold>Alice Russo</bold> (University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia) presented data on comparisons of the viral prevalence and diversity of cane toads (
 <italic>Rhinella marina</italic>) found in their native range (French Guiana) and two introduced ranges (Australia and Hawaii). In the native range toads, multiple phylogenetically distinct viruses were detected that were not present in the Australian cane toads. These data provide a foundation for studies looking at the influence of viruses on cade toad invasion.
