<p>The theme of biological control of rabbits was continued with a presentation by 
 <bold>Janine Duckworth</bold> (Manaaki Whenua—Landcare Research, Lincoln, New Zealand), which detailed the effects of RHDV1 K5 release in New Zealand to control wild rabbits. In this study, it was shown that the Czech strain of RHDV1 (released in 1997) was active at all study sites prior to RHDV1 K5 release and that both virus strains were present post-release of RHDV1 K5. The average rate of spread of RHDV1 K5 was 3.5 km/month, with 64%–67% of rabbit carcasses testing positive to RHDV1 K5. This resulted in a 30%–40% reduction in rabbit numbers in the 6–8 weeks following RHDV1 K5 release.
