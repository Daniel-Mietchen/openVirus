 <bold>Joshua A. Hayward</bold> (Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Australia) presented the discovery and characterisation of a group of gammaretroviruses that were found in Australian and Asian bats and are closely related to the koala retrovirus (KoRV) [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00621" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Using a synthetic proviral molecular construct of one of these bat viruses (Hervey pteropid gammaretrovirusâ€”HPG), it was demonstrated that HPG can infect bat and human cells and displays morphological and enzymatic gammaretrovirus characteristics. These data, combined with serological evidence and the detection of HPG sequences in Australian bats, suggests that bats are reservoirs of KoRV-related retroviruses.
