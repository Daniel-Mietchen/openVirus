 <bold>Karla Helbig</bold> (La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia) spoke on the differential immune responses of New Zealand paua and Australian hybrid abalone to Haliotid herpesvirus 1 (HaHV-1), which causes abalone viral ganglioneuritis (AVG). The research showed that the HaHV-1-resistant p√§ua, upregulated differentially expressed genes in the haemocytes that are involved in extracellular matrix remodelling upon viral challenge. In contrast, these transcripts were absent in the HaHV-1-susceptible abalone.
