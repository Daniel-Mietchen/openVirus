<p>Agathe Colmant (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) presented a new host restriction mechanism of Bamaga virus, a newly discovered flavivirus that replicates in mosquitoes. Interestingly, replication in vertebrate cells was attenuated at 37 °C but restored at 34 °C, whereby the temperature-dependent restriction was observed after cell entry. Adaptive mutations that allowed replication at the higher temperature were mapped to residues close to a viral protease site suggesting that suppression of proteolytic processing prevents replication of Bamaga virus in vertebrate cells.</p>
