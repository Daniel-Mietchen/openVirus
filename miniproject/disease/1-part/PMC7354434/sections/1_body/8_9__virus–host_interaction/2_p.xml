<p>Alexander Khromykh (Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) presented two high-throughput methodologies used in elucidating determinants of flavivirus pathogenesis and evasion of host response. In the first approach, he used deep mutational scanning to identify viral protein function in replication and interactions with host factors [

These methods showed that adaptations on the ZIKV E protein determined adaptations to either mammalian or mosquito cells. In addition, E protein mutants were shown to have temperature-dependent restrictions.
