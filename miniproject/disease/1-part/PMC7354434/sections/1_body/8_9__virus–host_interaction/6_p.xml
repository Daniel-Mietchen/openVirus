<p>Robin Macdiarmid (Plant and Food Research, Auckland, New Zealand) presented on the reciprocal control of replication between a new ssDNA mycovirus and its host. The team identified and purified infectious viral particles of an exotic virus, named 
 <italic>Botrytis gemydayivirus</italic> 1, which represents a new genus and species. The virus is mechanically transmitted and infects the 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, a fungus that leads to disease in plant species including grapes. The new virus restricted the growth of its fungal host.
