<p>The final presentation was by 
 <bold>Greg Moseley</bold> (Monash University, Clayton, Australia) who provided for the first time, structural data from NMR and super-resolution microscopy, on how the rabies P protein interacts with STAT1 to block the antiviral interferon response. NMR analysis of the P protein and STAT1 complex revealed multiple contact points between the proteins with mutational analysis at these sites preventing STAT1 binding and IFN antagonism. Importantly, insertion of these mutations in a pathogenic field stain of rabies revealed significant attenuation of disease, highlighting the importance of this interaction. This work furthers our understanding of hostâ€“virus interactions that block the innate response to infection and may pave the way for possible novel vaccine strategies.
