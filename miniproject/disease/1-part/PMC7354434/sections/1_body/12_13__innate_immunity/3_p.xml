 <bold>Larisa Labzin</bold> (Institute of Molecular Bioscience, the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) discussed the detection of viral infection, and how the location of pathogen sensing could determine the strength of the responses. Using an adenovirus model, she showed that infection of macrophages with antibody-coated adenovirus triggers strong inflammasome responses from damaged lysosomes. She also went on to describe that antibody-coated adenoviruses that escape into the macrophage cytosol could initiate a second wave of inflammasome signaling, and that this was mediated by the intracellular Fc receptor TRIM21 and cGAS.
