 <bold>Ebony Monson</bold> (La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia) continued with the intracellular response theme, presenting data that supported an emerging role for lipid droplets in early antiviral responses. Lipid droplet size and number increased with virus infection (ZIKV, HSV-1 and influenza), and with treatment of DNA/RNA ligands. This increase in lipid droplet production correlated with decreased ZIKV replication and enhanced expression of interferon. Interestingly, this was dependent on EGFR signaling, as EGFR inhibitors increased ZIKV production and limited lipid droplet and interferon production. 
 <bold>Monson</bold> finished off her talk with some exciting work elucidating the proteome of purified lipid droplets and discussed the potential for localisation of antiviral factors to lipid droplets as an antiviral hub.
