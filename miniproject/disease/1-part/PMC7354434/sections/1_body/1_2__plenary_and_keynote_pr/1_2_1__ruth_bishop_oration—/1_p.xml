<p>The conference organisers were extremely fortunate in attracting 
 <bold>Ana Fernández-Sesma</bold> (Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, United States) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00621-f007">Figure 7</xref>) to present one of the meeting’s keynote addresses, the Ruth Bishop Oration. Professor Fernández-Sesma and her group are internationally recognised for their seminal work on innate immune responses to flavivirus infections, most notably the countermeasures employed by the dengue viruses (DENV) in escaping this first line of host defense. In this presentation, she highlighted work that identified how immune cells use their DNA-sensing machinery to detect intracellular damage generated early during DENV infection. Two of the crucial innate immune mediators playing a role in this sensing, and that are induced following exposure to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) and the stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING). Professor Fernández-Sesma presented evidence that DENV, and specifically the virus encoded protease cofactor NS2B, can efficiently dismantle this sensing mechanism by targeting the cGAS–STING pathway for lysosomal degradation. Her findings show that degradation of these factors, induced during dengue virus infection following leakage of mtDNA, results in the inhibition of type I IFN production and, consequently, antiviral responses. Evidence was also presented showing that other arboviruses may also target the cGAS–STING pathway. Interestingly, different DENV serotypes were shown to induce distinct immune profiles in infected primary cells, with infected and bystander cells both contributing to the overall immune response in DENV infection, by secreting different cytokines and chemokines. Extending these studies into a multidimensional analysis of DENV-2- and DENV-4-infected dendritic cells (DCs) revealed distinct infection kinetics and immune profiles in DCs that may contribute to pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses. It is turning out to be a complicated story, and one that Professor Fernández-Sesma’s team is focused on unravelling.
