 <bold>Richard Kuhn</bold> (Purdue University, Indiana, United States) presented a keynote lecture detailing his group’s recent re-examination of flavivirus structures solved by cryo-electron microscopy [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00621" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Kuhn hypothesised that flaviviruses do not have exact icosahedral symmetry, and that the icosahedral symmetry constraints previously applied to cryo-electron microscopy structures for these viruses may not provide the flexibility required for the large conformational rearrangements that occur during the virus lifecycle. When icosahedral symmetry constraints were excluded in the cryo-EM reconstruction of immature Kunjin virus, they found that the nucleocapsid core touched the inside of the viral lipid membrane at the “proximal pole” and was asymmetrically positioned within the lipid bilayer envelope. The outer glycoprotein spikes on the “distal pole” were either distorted or missing. In the asymmetric reconstruction of mature Kunjin virus, the core was re-positioned, concentric with the glycoprotein shell and there remained a distortion of the glycoproteins on one pole of the virion. This implies that the glycoproteins have a geometric defect that perhaps facilitates the transitions that occur during maturation. Kuhn suggested that this defect in number and arrangement of the glycoproteins may reflect the consequence of membrane budding.
