<p>Overall, the presentations at AVS10 showcase the breadth and quality of virology being undertaken in the Australasian region, spanning fundamental research, and translational, clinical and epidemiological studies. AVS10 consistently showcases the talent of our budding virologists. Our next meeting in December 2021 marks an auspicious occasion celebrating 20 years of AVG/AVS, and we are planning to hold the meeting in Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia, the location of the very first Australian virology meeting.</p>
