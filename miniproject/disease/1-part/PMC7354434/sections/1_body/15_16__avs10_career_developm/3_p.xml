<p>Mentoring is often considered an essential component of training and professional development. On this panel, one member believed strongly that their mentor was essential to their development and future independence. However, this was not identified as being essential for the majority of the panelists. Instead, panelists identified a strong advocate as being perhaps more important; someone who actively pushes you onto review panels, into speaking positions, chairing sessions, and positions of influence. Advocates are often already successful, have nothing to lose by passing on an opportunity to you, and they believe in you and the calibre of your work.</p>
