<p>In this session, 
 <bold>Allison Imrie</bold> (University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia) spoke of the emerging threat of dengue virus in Australia driven by increasing international travel to and from endemic countries, mainly Indonesia. The number of infections detected in Western Australia, mainly involving DENV serotypes 1 and 2, has been on the rise over the past decade, except for 2017/2018, when an unexplained decline occurred. The numbers have surged again in 2019. A prospective follow up of infected patients in Western Australia has been established to observe neutralization antibody responses against homologous and heterologous viruses from one-week post-infection to up to seven years. Data shows that although antibody-mediated neutralization persists against the autologous virus, it wanes over time for within-serotype homologous viruses, questioning the dogma of lifelong immunity against the infecting serotype.
