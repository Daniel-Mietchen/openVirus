 <bold>Grace Yan</bold> (University of NSW, Sydney, Australia) presented work on the utility of wastewater analysis of norovirus and adenovirus sequences and compared the findings with those from clinical samples during the same period in 2018/2019. She argued that data from clinical samples may be skewed towards more severe disease as only symptomatic patients seek treatment, while sampling from wastewater allows a better representation of circulating strains. The genotypes and strains identified from clinical samples demonstrated similar patterns but were not identical in abundance to genotypes and strains identified from wastewater samples. Sampling both sources for viral variants can provide better data for understanding the true prevalence of circulating enteric viruses.
