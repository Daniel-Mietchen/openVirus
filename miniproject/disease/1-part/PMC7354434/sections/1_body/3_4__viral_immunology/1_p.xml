<p>The invited speaker for this session was 
 <bold>Barbara Coulson</bold> (University of Melbourne, Australia), who gave an overview of her career in Rotavirus research. This was tightly woven with discovery of rotavirus by Ruth Bishop, Ian Holmes and others, and an outline of her role in the development of an antibody-based diagnostic test for rotavirus. Professor Coulsonâ€™s additional advances in rotavirus research included identifying that IgA in stool is protective against reinfection in children, as well as identification of the host receptors for rotavirus entry. The remainder of the talk focused on her research in mice, which has detailed the immunopathological process that leads to rotavirus induced diabetes. Her mouse model has shown that during the initial phase of rotavirus infection, rotavirus induces bystander activation, via TLR7, resulting in strong activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and strong upregulation of interferon-dependent gene expression with a skewed Th1-specific response, resulting in activation of pre-existing islet autoreactive lymphocytes.
