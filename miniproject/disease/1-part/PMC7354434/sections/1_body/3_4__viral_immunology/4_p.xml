 <bold>Andreas Suhrbier</bold> (QIMR Berhofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia) presented his novel findings surrounding the counter intuitive role of a high-fibre diet in the exacerbation of Chikungunya viral infection [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00621" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. High-fibre diets and their gut fermented by-products are known to reduce inflammation in non-infectious settings; however, Andreasâ€™s team has now demonstrated that high-fibre diets, which results in the production by gut microbiota of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, significantly enhanced viral driven cytopathic effects. Mice fed high-fibre diets were found to have enhanced edema around peripheral joints, which was underpinned by an upregulation of IL-17 and subsequent neutrophil recruitment.
