<p>Mosquito-borne flaviviruses cause a significant global health burden and have potential for pandemic emergence [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00621" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During her presentation, Dr. Hobson-Peters (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) described a recombinant platform for the rapid manufacture of chimeric virus particles for several major pathogenic flaviviruses, based on an insect-specific flavivirus (Binjari virus, BinJV). BinJV seems to be quite tolerant for exchange of its structural protein genes (prME) with those of pathogenic vertebrate-infecting flaviviruses such as Zika, (ZIKV), Dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) viruses. She described the successful production of BinJV chimeras displaying structural proteins of over 25 pathogenic flaviviruses, which are structurally and antigenically indistinguishable from the wild-type viruses. More importantly, the chimera viruses are completely replication-deficient in vertebrate cells but replicate efficiently in mosquito cells, providing a safe approach for antigen production. These constructions can be used in high-throughput diagnostic assays, e.g., microsphere immunoassays, ELISAs and virus neutralization assays and vaccine applications (see below), representing a simple, non-infectious to vertebrate cells, approach to generate chimeric flavivirus particles. As described above, multiple viruses from the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family (e.g., dengue virus, Zika virus, Yellow fever virus, etc.) continue to cause havoc worldwide. With close to 400 million cases of dengue infections per year and no dengue virus (DENV)-specific antiviral drug approved, vaccination is the most promising tool to control this arboviral disease. Although one tetravalent live-attenuated chimeric vaccine (CYD-TDV) is currently commercially available in some dengue endemic countries; poor efficacy in children and in seronegative individuals has been observed [
