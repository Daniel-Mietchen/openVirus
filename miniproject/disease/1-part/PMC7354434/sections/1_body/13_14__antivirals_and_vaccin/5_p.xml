<p>With close to 37 million people living with HIV-1 worldwide [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00621" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], HIV/AIDS continues to be one of the most important pandemics of the last 50 years. The widespread global access to antiretroviral drugs has led to considerable reductions in morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00621" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; however, no vaccine is currently available despite a myriad of studies and clever designs [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00621" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although it is clear that broad neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are needed to control HIV-1 replication, induction of bNAbs by HIV envelope glycoprotein-based vaccines has been difficult due to the high genetic variability of the virus. Here, Andy Poumbourios (Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Australia) described a protein engineering approach aimed at fixing soluble HIV-1 glycoprotein trimers in conformations corresponding to those sampled on virions. Mutations known to stabilise the trimer were combined with a glycosylation site mutation that exposes epitopes of bNAbs. One such mutant with intermediate thermostability and epitope exposure elicited broad neutralization activity in guinea pigs, suggesting that the approach is applicable to vaccine design.
