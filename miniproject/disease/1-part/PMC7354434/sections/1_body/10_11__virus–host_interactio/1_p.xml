<p>Invited speaker 
 <bold>Karyn Johnson</bold> (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) started off the session by summarizing and sharing new data on the role of host micro RNAs (miRNAs), now commonly-known regulators of gene expression, during virus infections. Karyn emphasised that miRNAs could exert both proviral and antiviral functions during virus infection. By using the natural 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>-Drosophila C virus (DCV) model system, she showed that miR-956, through its target Ect4, supports DCV replication [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00621" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Building on these findings, her group screened individual miRNA-knockout Drosophila mutant libraries for impact on infection with three different viruses: DCV, Flock House virus and Sindbis virus. She found that at least half of the miRNAs screened had an impact, either proviral or antiviral, on virus infections. Further, some of these miRNAs were common in their impact on the infections of three viruses. Her group is completing the screen and aiming to identify an impact pattern of miRNAs on the infection of diverse insect viruses.
