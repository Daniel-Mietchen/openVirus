 <bold>Alice McSweeney</bold> (University of Otago, New Zealand) presented her work on murine norovirus genome-linked protein VPg, which is encoded by all noroviruses and known to arrest host cell cycle at the G0/G1 interphase to benefit virus replication. Alice shared that the N-terminal region of VPg is essential but not sufficient on its own for cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, the VPg N-terminal region possesses a functional positively-charged amino acid motif (KGKxKxGRG) and has the ability to non-specifically bind RNA at low affinity.
