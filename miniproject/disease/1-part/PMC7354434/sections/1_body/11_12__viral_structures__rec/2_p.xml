 <bold>Svenja Fritzlar</bold> (Monash University, Clayton, Australia) investigated the late stages of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication cycle, which is currently not well characterised. A library of &gt;100 HCMV mutants was screened for viral mutants that showed typical viral assembly complex formation (a cytoplasmic megastructure associated with late stage HCMV infection), but which were unable to complete the viral lifecycle. In this way, she identified a subset of viral mutants and from this characterised a viral protein as crucial for HCMV egress. These proteins represent a set of novel antiviral targets for inhibiting HCMV spread.
