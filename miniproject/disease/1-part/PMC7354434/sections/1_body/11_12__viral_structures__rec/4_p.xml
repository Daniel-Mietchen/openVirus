 <bold>Thao Huynh</bold> (The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia) described a model for investigating the interactions between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and host proteins. Using a plasmid-free monomeric HBV (“1-mer”) transfection model which expresses cccDNA-like molecules, the viral genomic reservoir involved in HBV persistence, the researchers asked whether expected viral replication intermediates could be produced following the co-transfection of host factors known to modulate HBV infection (DDBI proteins). By co-transfecting these plasmids into hepatoma cells, including 1-mers from different viral genotypes, Huynh confirmed that this system produced the expected HBV replicative intermediates observed using more conventional in vitro models, but with the advantage of being able to detect cccDNA-like molecules usually absent in equivalent systems. Given the role of cccDNA in driving HBV persistence, this model may present opportunities for future development of novel therapeutics to cure chronic HBV infections.
