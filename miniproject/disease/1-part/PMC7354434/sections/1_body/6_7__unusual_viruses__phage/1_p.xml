<p>Invited speaker, 
 <bold>Peter Waterhouse</bold> (Laureate Fellow and Professor of Molecular Genetics at Queensland University of Technology, Australia) spoke on the interaction between Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and the model plant 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> including its wild relatives. The virus TYLCV has a DNA genome and belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Geminiviridae</italic>. It has a wide host range with a major economic impact on tomato production. Peter and team have utilised this virus to understand more deeply the differences between the laboratory strain of 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and its relatives collected recently from its endemic centre of origin, Australia. The team identified RDR3 encoded by the lab strain of the host plant as carrying a premature stop codon that conferred hyper-sensitivity to the TYLCV. By contrast, a Queensland ecotype of the plant that did not bear the mutation was highly resistant. Furthermore, RDR amplifies short interfering RNAs and adds a new player in RNAi mechanism. Using this approach, that maximises the useful differences between the 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> ecotypes, Peter’s team is exploring further mechanistic aspects of RNA interference (RNAi) and its impacts on virus–host plant interactions.
