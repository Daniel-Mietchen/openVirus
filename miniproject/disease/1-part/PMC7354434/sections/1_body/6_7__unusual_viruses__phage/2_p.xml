 <bold>Sassan Asgari</bold> (School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) described the discovery of a new negev-like virus, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> negev-like virus (AaINLV). The negeviruses are insect only viruses, with AaINLV isolated from 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> Aa23 cell line and in wild-caught mosquitoes. Sequencing, showed the AaINLV viral genome is a positive sense RNA molecule, containing 3 ORF’s, flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR’s). A report showing 
 <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic> is able to limit arbovirus (e.g., Dengue, Zika) infection in insects presented an opportunity to investigate 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (wAlbB) as an agent to limit or suppress infection of the newly discovered AaINLV. Surprisingly, initial investigation by real-time PCR found AaINLV to be present in high copy numbers in Aa23 cells in the presence of wAlbB, suggesting that no suppression of the virus is occurring. Further investigation added weight to the hypothesis that the longevity of association between AaINLV and wAlbB may be a factor in that both wAlbB and AaINLV have effectively learned to “live” with each other due to a long association, whereas, if introduced to each other in cell culture (i.e., short association), the virus and bacterium have to go through a period of “adjustment”.
