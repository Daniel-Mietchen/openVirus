 <bold>Kirsty Short</bold> (The School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) presented research demonstrating that a history of obesity reduces the immune response to influenza virus in an NLRP3-dependent manner. Obesity significantly increases the risk of death following an influenza virus infection. A novel mouse model was developed to study the long-term effects of obesity on antiviral immunity. Upon infection with influenza virus (A/Auckland/09(H1N1)), previously obese (PO) mice displayed increased viral replication, inflammation, body weight loss and pulmonary dysfunction compared to lean-fed mice. Cells in the lung lumen of PO mice also had an altered metabolic state compared to those of lean fed mice. Importantly, in mice deficient in the NLRP3 inflammasome, obesity had no long-term effect on susceptibility to influenza virus infection. The group propose that obesity can have long-term, NLRP3-dependent, effects on the metabolism of innate inflammatory cells such that they are impaired in their antiviral response.
