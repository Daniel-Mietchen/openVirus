<p>The Brazilian ZIKV strain KU365780 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] used in this study was isolated from a febrile patient in Joao Pessoa City, Paraiba State, Brazil, 18-05-2015 (provided by the Evandro Chagas Institute, Brazil). Viruses were propagated in C6/36 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> cells, maintained at 28°C in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma Life Sciences, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Following three passages in C6/36 cells, virus stocks were concentrated using Ultracel-100k filters (Amicon, Tullagreen, Cork Ireland) and frozen once at -80°C until further use. Virus stocks were titrated using a Cell Culture Enzyme-linked Immunosorbant Assay (CCELISA) based on the method of Broom et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Ten-fold serial dilutions of virus stocks were inoculated on C6/36 (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) cells grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine, 5% heat denatured FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies, USA) and maintained at 28°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 5 days. Monolayers were incubated at 28°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 5 days, and cells fixed at -20°C for 1 h in 80% acetone/20% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Plates were air-dried and antigen was detected using a 4G4 anti-Flavivirus NS1 monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatant (1:40 in PBS-Tween), Horseradish peroxidase (HRP-) conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA) (1:2000 in PBS-Tween), and 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Liquid Substrate System for Membranes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Staining was observed using an inverted microscope, and cell monolayers that stained blue were scored positive for infection. The 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined from titration end points as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and expressed as the CCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml in C6/36 cells.
