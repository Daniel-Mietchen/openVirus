<p>Percentage infection (number of positive bodies/total tested), dissemination (number of positive leg/wing samples per total tested), and transmission (number of positive saliva samples/total tested) were calculated at each dpi for each species under fluctuating and constant temperature regimes. Significant differences between percentages were detected using Chi-Square tests. The median and interquartile range (IQR) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism Version 7.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California USA, 2008). Log-transformed virus titres in mosquitoes with infected bodies and wings and legs were analysed using two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVAs) as a function of temperature, species, and their interactions, in IBM SPSS Statistics software version 23.0. Differences were considered statistically significant at

 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], with samples pooled across days and temperatures for each mosquito species to ensure maximum predictive power. The ZIKV staining density (ratio of ZIKV/DNA positive pixel area) within defined tissues in histological sections was analysed by two-way ANOVA as a function of temperature, days post infection and their interaction using GraphPad Prism Version 8.02. Post hoc comparisons of the main effects of days post infection were performed using Sidakâ€™s multiple comparison test.
