<p>Samples in which ZIKV failed to amplify were classified as negative. The presence of mosquito nucleic acid in negative samples was verified by amplification of the housekeeping genes RpS17 (

 <italic>aegypti</italic>; Genbank accession number AY927787.2) or RpS7 (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>; Genbank accession number XM_019671546). qRT-PCR for house-keeping genes were performed using the SuperScript III SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA) as per manufacturer’s recommendations. The reactions were performed in a 10 μL total volume containing SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq Mix, 2 × SYBR Green Reaction Mix, 200 nM of each RpS17/RpS7 primer (RpS17 F: 5′-TCCGTGGTATCTCCATCAAGCT-3′, R: 5′-CACTTCCGGCACGTAGTTGTC-3′; RpS7 F: 5’-CTCTGACCGCTGTGTACGAT-3’, R: 5’-CAATGGTGGTCTGCTGGTTC-3’), 1 μL of extracted sample and Ultrapure water (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA). Cycling was performed using the Rotor-Gene 6000 system (Corbett Research, NSW, Australia) with 1 cycle at 50°C for 5 min and 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 20 s. Melt curve analysis was performed to analyse the specificity of the reaction.
