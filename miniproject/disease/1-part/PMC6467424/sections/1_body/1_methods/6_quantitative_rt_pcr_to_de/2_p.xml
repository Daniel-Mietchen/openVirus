<p>ZIKV RNA from mosquitoes was amplified by one-step qRT-PCR using the TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, in a Rotor-Gene 6000 Version 1.7.87 system (Corbett Research, NSW, Australia). Primers and probe used in this study have previously been described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and were synthesized at Macrogen, Korea. The probe was labelled with FAM and BHQ1 at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The 20 μl reaction mixture consisted of 1 μl extracted sample, 4 × TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix, 400 nM of each primer, 250 nM of probe and Ultrapure water (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Reactions were run in triplicate, and a 10-fold serial dilution of linearized control plasmid DNA (3×10
 <sup>7</sup> to 3×10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μl), as well as negative controls (without template), were included in each run. The following thermal profile was used: a single cycle of reverse transcription for 5 min at 50°C, reverse transcriptase inactivation and DNA polymerase activation at 95°C for 20 s followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 60°C for 30 s (annealing-extension step). Data were analysed and quantified using the Rotor-Gene 6000 Version 1.7.87 software (Corbett Research, NSW, Australia). To calculate the total number of ZIKV RNA copies present in each mosquito body or body part, the measured ZIKV RNA copy numbers in 1μl were multiplied by the elution volume (i.e., 50 μl). Samples were scored positive for virus if ZIKV amplification occurred in at least two technical replicates and the number of copies was above the limit of detection of the standard curve.
