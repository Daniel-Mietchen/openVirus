<p>Nucleic acids were extracted from individual mosquito bodies or body parts using the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 200 μl Binding Buffer/poly A solution was added to each 2 ml screw cap vial containing the individual mosquito body or body parts. The samples were homogenized by shaking the tubes, containing zirconium silica glass beads (Daintree Scientific, St Helens, TAS, Australia), using a MiniBeadbeater-96 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, USA) for 90 s. Following the addition of 50 μl of Proteinase K, nucleic acids were extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted in 50 μl of RNAse/DNase-free Ultrapure water (Invitrogen). Samples were frozen at -80°C until further analysis.</p>
