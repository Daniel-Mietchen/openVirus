<p>This study has demonstrated that north Queensland 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> are more competent for a Brazilian strain of ZIKV than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, confirming that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is the primary vector of Asian lineage ZIKV. The risk of emergence of ZIKV in Australia is potentially high due to the presence of competent mosquito vectors, climatic conditions suitable for transmission, imported cases, and a large na√Øve population for ZIKV. However, our data were obtained under high-titre challenge conditions and should be viewed in the context of a recent study that shows low competence of north Queensland 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> under more typical viremic titres [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We also need to add the caveat that our estimates of vector competence were derived from a single experimental replicate. Additional replicates may yield different estimates due to stochastic variance inherent in vector competence experiments.
