<p>Our study demonstrates that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations from north Queensland are susceptible to a Brazilian epidemic ZIKV strain from Asian lineage, and able to transmit ZIKV from 10 dpi. We also show that Torres Strait 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> could be infected in high percentages, but only 10% could transmit virus by 14 days. Our results suggest that a high threshold titre of disseminated infection in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was required to overcome the salivary barrier and allow transmission. A recent report suggested that a threshold viral load of at least 10
 <sup>5.1</sup> TCID

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes had to be reached for transmission of the prototype African strain of ZIKV to occur [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The infectious titre of disseminated virus could therefore be a significant predictor of virus detection in saliva. A similar correlation between disseminated virus titre and transmission rate has been reported for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and DENV-1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], with high dissemination titres resulting in increased transmissibility by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>.
