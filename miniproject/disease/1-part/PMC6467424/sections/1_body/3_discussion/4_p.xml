 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes were poor vectors for the Brazilian strain of ZIKV. The ZIKV transmission percentages observed in our study are similar to those reported for French and Italian

However, the infection (10–18%) and disseminated infection (10–29%) rates reported in these studies were much lower than those observed in our study. Our results are strikingly different from a vector competence study in Singapore reporting that all

 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations from the Australian Torres Strait Islands have previously been shown to be highly susceptible to a Cambodian ZIKV strain, with a high prevalence (&gt;75%) of virus in saliva at day 14 post-infection [
