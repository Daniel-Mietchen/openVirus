To investigate the influence of viral evolution and mutations on the seasonality of influenza, we performed a genome-wide analysis of samples collected from 62 influenza A/H3N2-infected patients in Shanghai during 2016&#x02013;2017. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight segments of the influenza A virus revealed that there were two epidemic influenza virus strains circulating in the 2016&#x02013;2017 winter season (2016&#x02013;2017win) and 2017 summer season (2017sum). Replication of the two epidemic viral strains at different temperatures (33, 35, 37, and 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) was measured, and the correlation of the mutations in the two epidemic viral strains with temperature sensitivity and viral replication was analyzed. Analysis of the replication kinetics showed that replication of the 2016&#x02013;2017win strains was significantly restricted at 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C compared with that of the 2017sum strains. A polymerase activity assay and mutational analysis demonstrated that the PA I668V mutation of the 2016&#x02013;2017win viruses suppressed polymerase activity in vitro at high temperatures. Taken together, these data suggest that the I668V mutation in the PA subunit of the 2016&#x02013;2017win strains may confer temperature sensitivity and attenuate viral replication and polymerase activity; meanwhile, the 2017sum strains maintained virulence at high temperatures. These findings highlight the importance of certain mutations in viral adaptation and persistence in subsequent seasons.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Seasonal influenza is responsible for an average of approximately 1 billion infections worldwide, including 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually. Increasing evidence has suggested that seasonal influenza patterns are highly diverse in different zones, especially in Asia, where these patterns can exhibit semiannual or annual epidemic cycles. The complexity of this pattern has hindered the establishment of effective routine immunization programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. China can be divided into the following three regions according to the seasonality of influenza viruses: the northern provinces experience epidemics during winter, the southern provinces experience epidemics that peak during spring, and provinces at intermediate latitudes experience semi-annual epidemics. Shanghai belongs to the category of provinces at intermediate latitudes, and influenza A epidemics, particularly seasonal A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 viruses, usually appear between autumn and spring, with the influenza activity peaking after October<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Between 2014 and 2016, only sporadic influenza infections were reported during summer in Shanghai. However, in 2017, the number of infections increased substantially between May and September among inpatients at Ruijin Hospital. To further examine the influenza epidemics during the summer of 2017 in Shanghai, we compared virus samples obtained during the 2016&#x02013;2017 winter season in Shanghai with virus samples obtained during the summer season. An etiological and viral replication analysis was performed to investigate the effects of the mutations in the internal gene segments of the influenza A virus during 2017. The influenza A virus contains eight gene segments, namely, basic polymerase 2 (PB2), basic polymerase 1 (PB1), acidic polymerase (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and nonstructural protein (NS). Antigenic drift in the surface glycoproteins (e.g., HA and NA) can facilitate viral evasion of the host&#x02019;s immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Certain mutations in the polymerases may affect temperature sensitivity, which is characterized by restricted (&#x02265;100-fold) replication at a temperature of 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C or higher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The aim of this study was to compare the complete genome sequences of two sequential influenza epidemic viruses and to investigate whether the genetic differences in the two epidemic viruses were correlated with temperature sensitivity and viral replication. The results presented here suggest that the mutation in PA I668V may confer temperature sensitivity and attenuate the polymerase activity of the influenza virus, changing the seasonality and adaptation of the virus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical characterization of patients infected with the H3N2 influenza virus during 2016&#x02013;2017</title><p id="Par5">Sixty-two patients were diagnosed with a H3N2 influenza virus infection from Nov. 2016 to Sep. 2017: 28 patients in the 2016&#x02013;2017 winter season (from Nov. 2016 to Mar. 2017) and 34 patients in the 2017 summer season (from May 2017 to Sep. 2017). We divided all of the viral strains isolated from influenza-infected patients into two groups: the 2016&#x02013;2017win virus strains and 2017sum virus strains. The median age of the hosts of the 2016&#x02013;2017win strains was 66, with ages ranging from 19 to 94, while the median age of the hosts of the 2017sum strains was 70, with ages ranging from 33 to 90 years. Of the 62 patients, 33 (53.2%) were male and 48 (77.4%) were elderly (&#x02265;60 years). Influenza-like symptoms (i.e., temperature&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;38&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, cough, or sore throat) were observed in all patients who were subsequently diagnosed with influenza A by real-time RT-PCR. No significant differences were observed in gender, age, underlying condition, or outcome between the two groups.

Influenza seasons are determined by climate regions. Worldwide, influenza epidemics always follow low seasonal temperatures, suggesting that low temperatures may change seasonal crowding, viral survival in respiratory droplets and host susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, humidity may be a critical driver of influenza outbreaks. Absolute humidity has a regulatory effect on airborne influenza transmission, and this effect can be modulated by temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Generally, the northern and southern regions in China experience different influenza seasonality and evolutionary dynamics. Usually, the northern region experiences an influenza season during the winter months (with a median peak in Jan., ranging from Dec. to Jan.), while the southern region experiences influenza during the summer months (with a median peak from May to Jun.). Because Shanghai has a subtropical climate but is located in the intermediate-latitude region, the influenza seasonality in Shanghai is atypical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Between 2006 and 2016, the annual seasonality in Shanghai was irregular. Two influenza peaks were observed in 2008 and 2010, and only one epidemic occurred during the other years. However, in 2017, the following two influenza epidemics occurred in Shanghai: one epidemic between Nov. 2016 and Mar. 2017 and one epidemic between May 2017 and Sep. 2017. These epidemics were consistent with the influenza epidemics observed in Hong Kong and Guangdong in 2017. Although influenza epidemics occur frequently during summer in the southern region, the mechanism underlying summer influenza epidemics has not been elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In this study, we performed genomic and replication analyses for viruses obtained during both the winter and summer of 2017 in an attempt to investigate the evolution of the influenza virus during 2017 in Shanghai and the effects of mutations on viral replication in these two epidemic viral strains.</p><p id="Par14">The results of genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the 2017sum virus strains differed from the 2016&#x02013;2017win virus strains and that there were several amino acid substitutions distributed in different viral proteins. According to the phylogenetic tree of HA, the 2017sum virus strains emerged from the 2016&#x02013;2017win virus strains. Certain HA segments acted as intermediates during the transition from the cluster of the 2016&#x02013;2017win viruses to the cluster of the 2017sum viruses, indicating that certain segments of the 2017sum virus strains were already present in influenza viruses circulating in 2016. This tendency was consistent with the phylogenetic analysis of other segments.</p><p id="Par15">The influenza virus polymerase consists of three subunits, encoded by the PA, PB1, and PB2 segments, which also express several important viral proteins, such as PA-X and PB1-F2. Efficient nuclear import and assembly of the polymerase subunit RNP complex are critical steps in the viral life cycle and are closely associated with viral temperature sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In our study, genetic analysis revealed certain unique amino acid substitutions in each group of viral strains. In the PA protein, the 2017sum strains exhibited a V668I substitution located in the PB1 interaction domain. The 2017sum viral strains differed from the 2016&#x02013;2017win viral strains in regard to the K299R and K340R mutations in the PB2 protein. To further investigate the effects of these mutations on the influenza polymerase in the 2016&#x02013;2017win and 2017sum virus strains, we evaluated viral replication via a TCID<sub>50</sub> measurement, an HA assay and the vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA levels of the NP segment in MDCK cells infected with these two viral strains at different temperatures (33, 35, 37, and 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). Our data showed that replication of the 2016&#x02013;2017win viruses was significantly restricted at 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. A previous study demonstrated the role of the polymerase complex in determining the temperature range over which influenza viruses can replicate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Bradel Tretheway et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> showed that the human WSN polymerase complex lost activity at 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The shutoff temperature of most temperature-sensitive viruses is 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C or higher. These conclusions are consistent with our results for the 2016&#x02013;2017win strains. In this study, replication of the 2016&#x02013;2017win strains was similar to that of temperature-sensitive viruses, exhibiting high viral replication at 33&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and significantly low replication at 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p><p id="Par16">Furthermore, we demonstrated that the temperature sensitivity of the 2016&#x02013;2017win viruses was conferred by a mutation in the influenza polymerase PA subunit. Introducing a single substitution at residue 668 of the PA gene induced a strong attenuation of polymerase activity at 39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, whereas the substitutions at residues 299 and 340 of PB2 had little influence on the polymerase activity at different temperatures. The mechanism by which the PA I668V mutation suppressed polymerase activity at high temperatures was not elucidated. Temperature-sensitive mutations fall into two general classes: those generating thermolabile proteins and those generating defects in protein synthesis, folding or assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The PA amino acid 668 maps to a helix located in the C-terminal region of the PA protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that this mutation may belong to the latter class. Previous research has confirmed that this helix (residues 657&#x02013;716) is required for binding to the N terminus of PB1, suggesting that residue 668 may be involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions and may affect polymerase assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This finding is consistent with our results showing that polymerases of both the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses with the PA I668V residue exhibit reduced activity at high temperatures. The I668V mutation may regulate the PA-PB1 interaction or inhibit polymerase function.</p><p id="Par17">In addition, there was a decrease in the accumulation rate of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA in MDCK cells infected with the 2016&#x02013;2017win viruses at 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C compared with that in cells infected with the 2017sum and 2014 H3N2 viruses after 24&#x02009;hpi; this result was consistent with those from the TCID<sub>50</sub> measurement and HA assay. Combined with our genome-wide analysis, we found one mutation in the NS gene that might result in a decrease in the growth rate of the 2016&#x02013;2017win viruses. The N127S mutation identified in NS1 has not been reported previously; however, this position had been confirmed to be part of the PKR-binding site of the NS1 protein (position 123&#x02013;127)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The influenza virus NS1 protein plays a key role in blocking the activation of PKR during influenza infection and interacts with the viral polymerase to mediate the temporal regulation of vRNA synthesis during infection. Mutants of NS1 with mutations at position 123/124 or 126/127 do not bind PKR, and mutations at position 123/124 can result in the deregulation of vRNA synthesis, resulting in attenuated influenza virus replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. There has been no report regarding mutations at position 127 of NS1, but our data were consistent with the results of the analysis of mutations at position 123/124 of the NS1 protein. We hypothesize that the decrease in the RNA accumulation and TCID<sub>50</sub> value in cells infected with the 2016&#x02013;2017win viruses may result from the N127S mutation in the NS1 protein. Viruses with the N127S mutation may lose the ability to interact with the viral polymerase and exhibit low synthesis of vRNA at the early infection stage.</p><p id="Par18">In summary, the influenza A (H3N2) virus strains circulating in the 2016&#x02013;2017 winter season and 2017 summer season in Shanghai were clustered into two different groups according to a phylogenetic analysis. The 2016&#x02013;2017win virus strains were temperature sensitive and attenuated compared with the 2017sum virus strains, and the 2017sum viruses exhibited an adaptation to high temperatures. A mutation in PA (at position 668) appeared to be critical for replication and temperature sensitivity. Adaptation to high temperatures may be the result of the natural evolution of the influenza virus and could explain the second epidemic that occurred during the summer of 2017 in Shanghai. These data further enhance our understanding of the summer influenza epidemic in Shanghai and subtropical Asia and thus provide insights for the prediction of the next epidemic strain of influenza A (H3N2). Our research provides information on the temperature-sensitive signature and further insight into the function of the influenza A polymerase. Future studies investigating the functional properties of viral polymerases should be performed to fully understand the evolution of the influenza virus and pave the way for the prevention of new severe influenza pandemics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par19">The Research Laboratory of Clinical Virology of Ruijin Hospital collected human nasopharyngeal swab samples from residual samples that had been obtained for clinical respiratory virus detection.
