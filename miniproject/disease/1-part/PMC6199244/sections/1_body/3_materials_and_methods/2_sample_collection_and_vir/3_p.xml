 </sup>. We chose six isolates in this study for viral growth and replication kinetic assays: three isolates represented the 2016–2017win virus strains (2016–2017win02, 16, 21) and three isolates represented the 2017sum virus strains (2017sum10, 14, 18). The isolates from each group shared more than 99.9% identity in all eight segments. We used an influenza A (H3N2) viral strain isolated in 2014 as our control virus. This control virus strain, isolated in Ruijin Hospital in Dec. 2014, was highly homologous (&gt;99%) to the WHO-recommended vaccine strains A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) and was designated as 2014 H3N2. The whole-genome sequences of the 2014 H3N2 viral strains was determined and submitted to GISAID (accession number EPI1230942-EPI1230949).
