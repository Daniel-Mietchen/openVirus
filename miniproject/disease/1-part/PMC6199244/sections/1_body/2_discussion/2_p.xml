<p id="Par14">The results of genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the 2017sum virus strains differed from the 2016–2017win virus strains and that there were several amino acid substitutions distributed in different viral proteins. According to the phylogenetic tree of HA, the 2017sum virus strains emerged from the 2016–2017win virus strains. Certain HA segments acted as intermediates during the transition from the cluster of the 2016–2017win viruses to the cluster of the 2017sum viruses, indicating that certain segments of the 2017sum virus strains were already present in influenza viruses circulating in 2016. This tendency was consistent with the phylogenetic analysis of other segments.</p>
