<p id="Par18">In summary, the influenza A (H3N2) virus strains circulating in the 2016–2017 winter season and 2017 summer season in Shanghai were clustered into two different groups according to a phylogenetic analysis. The 2016–2017win virus strains were temperature sensitive and attenuated compared with the 2017sum virus strains, and the 2017sum viruses exhibited an adaptation to high temperatures. A mutation in PA (at position 668) appeared to be critical for replication and temperature sensitivity. Adaptation to high temperatures may be the result of the natural evolution of the influenza virus and could explain the second epidemic that occurred during the summer of 2017 in Shanghai. These data further enhance our understanding of the summer influenza epidemic in Shanghai and subtropical Asia and thus provide insights for the prediction of the next epidemic strain of influenza A (H3N2). Our research provides information on the temperature-sensitive signature and further insight into the function of the influenza A polymerase. Future studies investigating the functional properties of viral polymerases should be performed to fully understand the evolution of the influenza virus and pave the way for the prevention of new severe influenza pandemics.</p>
