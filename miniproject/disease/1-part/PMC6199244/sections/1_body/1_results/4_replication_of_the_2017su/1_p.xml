 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>). The final levels of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA in MDCK cells infected with the 2016–2017win, 2017sum and 2014 H3N2 viruses were relatively similar at 96hpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, the growth rates of the 2016–2017win viruses were lower than those of the 2017sum and 2014 H3N2 viruses, especially after 24hpi. There was an up to 1-log increase in the levels of the 2017sum viruses compared to those of the 2016–2017win viruses at 48 and 72hpi. The RNA levels of the 2017sum and 2014 H3N2 viruses peaked at 72hpi, while the RNA levels of the 2016–2017win viruses peaked at 96hpi. The HA titers of the 2017sum viruses at 35 °C and 37 °C were both higher than those of the 2016–2017win viruses. These data indicated that the 2017sum viruses had higher growth rates and could replicate more efficiently at 35 °C and 37 °C than the 2016–2017win viruses and that replication of the 2016–2017win viruses was attenuated.
