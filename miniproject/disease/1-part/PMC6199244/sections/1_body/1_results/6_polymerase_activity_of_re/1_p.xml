<p id="Par11">We assessed the effects of the viral polymerase in the 2016–2017win and 2017sum strains on the replication activity using a minireplicon assay. The pPolI-NP-luciferase plasmid produces a modified influenza virus NP viral RNA in which the NP-coding sequences are replaced by the luciferase gene

 </sup>. Upon co-transfection of 293T cells with the pPolI-NP-luc plasmid and plasmids expressing PB2, PB1, PA, and NP of the 2016–2017win and 2017sum strains, we observed that the polymerase activity of all of the 2017sum and 2016–2017win strains were higher at 33 °C than those at 37 °C and 39 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The polymerases reconstituted with the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP sequences of the 2016–2017win strain had significantly lower activities than those of the 2017sum strains at 39 °C, whereas the polymerase activities did not differ at 33 °C or 37 °C.
