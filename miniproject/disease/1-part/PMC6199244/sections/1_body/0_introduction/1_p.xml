<p id="Par2">Seasonal influenza is responsible for an average of approximately 1 billion infections worldwide, including 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually. Increasing evidence has suggested that seasonal influenza patterns are highly diverse in different zones, especially in Asia, where these patterns can exhibit semiannual or annual epidemic cycles. The complexity of this pattern has hindered the establishment of effective routine immunization programs

China can be divided into the following three regions according to the seasonality of influenza viruses: the northern provinces experience epidemics during winter, the southern provinces experience epidemics that peak during spring, and provinces at intermediate latitudes experience semi-annual epidemics. Shanghai belongs to the category of provinces at intermediate latitudes, and influenza A epidemics, particularly seasonal A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 viruses, usually appear between autumn and spring, with the influenza activity peaking after October
