  <title>Polymerase activities of the 2016–2017win, 2017sum and SC/09 viruses and their mutations.</title>
  <p>293T cells were transfected with a mix of PB2-, PB1-, PA-, and NP-containing plasmids from different virus strains plus a control plasmid and luciferase reporter plasmid. After transfection, 293T cells were cultured at 33 °C (
   <bold>a</bold>), 37 °C (
   <bold>b</bold>), and 39 °C (
   <bold>c</bold>). The polymerase activities were measured in cell lysates 24 h post-transfection. Data are expressed as the mean luciferase activity ± the standard error of the mean of triplicates. The P-values were statistically analyzed by paired 
   <italic>t</italic> test. *
