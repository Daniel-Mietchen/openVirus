HA recognizes sialic acid, a plasma membrane glycan that functions as the specific primary attachment factor (AF). Since sialic acid alone cannot fulfill a signaling function, the virus needs to activate downstream factors to trigger endocytic uptake. Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the receptor-tyrosine kinase family, was shown to be activated by IAV and transmit cell entry signals. However, how IAV&#x02019;s binding to sialic acid leads to engagement and activation of EGFR remains largely unclear. We used multicolor super-resolution microscopy to study the lateral organization of both IAV&#x02019;s AFs and its functional receptor EGFR at the scale of the IAV particle. Intriguingly, quantitative cluster analysis revealed that AFs and EGFR are organized in partially overlapping submicrometer clusters in the plasma membrane of A549 cells. Within AF domains, the local AF concentration reaches on average 10-fold the background concentration and tends to increase towards the cluster center, thereby representing a multivalent virus-binding platform. Using our experimentally measured cluster characteristics, we simulated virus diffusion on a flat membrane. The results predict that the local AF concentration strongly influences the distinct mobility pattern of IAVs, in a manner consistent with live-cell single-virus tracking data. In contrast to AFs, EGFR resides in smaller clusters. Virus binding activates EGFR, but interestingly, this process occurs without a major lateral EGFR redistribution, indicating the activation of pre-formed clusters, which we show are long-lived. Taken together, our results provide a quantitative understanding of the initial steps of influenza virus infection. Co-clustering of AF and EGFR permit a cooperative effect of binding and signaling at specific platforms, thus linking their spatial organization to their functional role during virus-cell binding and receptor activation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The plasma membrane is the major interface between a cell and its environment. This complex and dynamic organelle needs to protect, as a barrier, but also transmit subtle signals into and out of the cell. For the enveloped virus IAV, the plasma membrane represents both a major obstacle to overcome during infection, and the site for the assembly of progeny virus particles. However, the organisation of the plasma membrane&#x02013;a key to understanding how viral entry works&#x02014;at the scale of an infecting particle (length scales &#x0003c; 100 nm) remains largely unknown. Sialylated glycans serve as IAV attachment factors but are not able to transmit signals across the plasma membrane. Receptor tyrosine kinases were identified to be activated upon virus binding and serve as functional receptors. How IAV engages and activates its functional receptors while initially binding glycans still remains speculative. Here, we use super resolution microscopy to study the lateral organization of plasma membrane-bound molecules involved in IAV infection, as well as their functional relationship. We find that molecules are organized in submicrometer nanodomains and, in combination with virus diffusion simulations, present a mechanistic model for how IAV first engages with AFs in the plasma membrane to subsequently engage and trigger entry-associated membrane receptors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 636-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4915-388X</contrib-id><name><surname>Sezgin</surname><given-names>Erdinc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Sk&#x00142;odowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MEMBRANE DYNAMICS 627088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4915-388X</contrib-id><name><surname>Sezgin</surname><given-names>Erdinc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001320</institution-id><institution>Wolfson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3698-5599</contrib-id><name><surname>Eggeling</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009187</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3698-5599</contrib-id><name><surname>Eggeling</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009187</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0902418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3698-5599</contrib-id><name><surname>Eggeling</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009187</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3698-5599</contrib-id><name><surname>Eggeling</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104924/14/Z/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3698-5599</contrib-id><name><surname>Eggeling</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution>NCCR Chemical Biology</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4755-4778</contrib-id><name><surname>Manley</surname><given-names>Suliana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Research in S.M&#x02019;s lab is supported by the National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR) Chemical Biology.

During cell binding, IAV engages with low affinity attachment factors (AFs) as well as functional receptors to trigger cell entry by endocytosis. However, little is known about the lateral co-organization of both at the scale of an infecting virus, and how their organization relates to their functional role during virus infection.</p><p>The viral hemagglutinin (HA), a trimeric glycoprotein that covers ~ 90% of the viral surface, mediates the initial IAV-cell contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The most common AF for IAV is N-acetylneuraminic, or sialic, acid (SA), a highly abundant cell-surface glycan that within its glyosidic linkage encodes IAV species specificity. Human-pathogenic IAV strains preferentially bind &#x003b1;-2,6-linked SA, while avian-pathogenic viruses prefer to bind &#x003b1;-2,3-linked SA. This specificity can be attributed to the topology of the glycans, which more readily form contacts with receptor-binding domains of complementary HAs [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A common feature of glycan-protein interactions is their low affinity, which for HA-sialic acid lies in the millimolar range [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and should make it challenging for the virus to form stable interactions with cells. Although AFs are highly abundant, which could lead to stable adhesion, single-virus tracking showed that IAVs have some freedom to explore the cell surface [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, it remains largely unclear how an initial low-affinity interaction leads to a stable and specific but also dynamic virus-cell contact enabling a successful infection.</p><fig id="ppat.1008656.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1008656.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Sialylated IAV attachment factors are organized in nanodomains on A549 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Influenza virus is an enveloped particle that encapsulates its segmented (-)vRNA genome built of 8 viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The viral membrane harbors the two glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).

Since AFs cannot trigger endocytosis, an active signal-processing receptor must be engaged to allow viral entry. Receptor-tyrosine kinases were shown to be able to fulfill this function [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Specifically, it was shown that, among other receptor-tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was activated during and required for efficient IAV cell entry.

We found that AFs are organized in virus-sized clusters featuring a density gradient that decreases from a dense central core to the periphery. Using their experimentally-determined characteristics, we used simulations to investigate their role in virus-cell interactions. These simulations are in good agreement with live-cell virus tracking experiments, and together, they suggest that the spatial organization of AFs largely influences virus-cell interactions during the early phase of virus infection. We further show that AF nanodomains overlap nonrandomly with EGFR clusters thereby promoting AF-mediated EGFR activation. Interestingly, our results further suggest that pre-existing EGFR clusters are responsible for IAV-mediated receptor activation.

CBC analysis of SNA/EGFR colocalization reached an intermediate value, C<sub>A&#x0003e;0.3</sub> = 0.17.

It was previously hypothesized that IAV binding leads to a local concentration increase in EGFR proteins within plasma membrane clusters eventually leading to signal activation [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], an effect that was also observed before in BHK cells upon EGF stimulation [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we labeled unstimulated, EGF- or IAV-stimulated cells using anti-EGFR antibodies.

Surprisingly, we did not find evidence for a significant redistribution of EGFR after IAV stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). In addition, although we observed IAV colocalized with EGFR and pEGFR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s011">S10 Fig</xref>), we could not detect an effect on the cluster size or the number of molecules per EGFR cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s015">S14C Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>EGFR forms long-lived nanodomains in living cells</title><p>Since IAV stimulation did not affect EGFR organization, we hypothesized that pre-formed nanoclusters might be involved in IAV-induced EGFR activation. While IAV engagement of pre-formed EGFR clusters was previously hypothesized [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it remained unclear whether EGFR cluster lifetimes in the plasma membrane would be long enough to allow this type of interaction.

We used an EGFR variant that was previously shown to be fully functional in a mammalian cell expression system [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

We performed sptPALM on the dorsal as well as the ventral plasma membrane of live A549 cells in the absence of EGF, resulting in high-density protein diffusion mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Calculation of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) as a function of the lag time &#x1d6ab;<italic>t</italic> allowed us to determine the instantaneous diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic> along the trajectory.

Using our custom cluster identification analysis (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g002">Fig 2A&#x02013;2C</xref>), we found EGFR clusters with diameters ranging between 30 and 300 nm, confirming the organization of EGFR observed in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In addition, and because the cells were alive, we could use the time-resolved single molecule detection to quantify the temporal stability of EGFR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Such an approach was used previously to quantify polymerase 2 clustering in live cells and is referred to as time-correlated PALM (tcPALM) [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We selected regions identified by density-based clustering to perform tcPALM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>), and obtained a distribution of EGFR cluster lifetimes with an average of 140 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, dorsal). Notably, this lifetime only provides a lower estimate since the cluster might have existed before starting the acquisition and might also be present after the last cluster molecule was photobleached.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the initial phase of virus infection is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures such as adhesion inhibitors that catch viral particles before they can engage in the first virus-cell contact [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. After binding sialylated AFs on the cell surface, IAV must find and activate a functional receptor to enter and infect its target cell. While these two steps are crucial for IAV infection, it remained largely speculative how the virus manages to form a multivalent cell contact while retaining flexibility to explore the plasma membrane and engage with a functional receptor. Here we used super-resolution microscopy to study the organization of virus-interacting molecules at the scale of the virus-cell interface. We found that glycan AFs and receptors are organized in nanoscale domains and provide a model for how cell binding can translate into receptor engagement and activation. Our findings are summarized schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g006">Fig 6</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat.1008656.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1008656.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Model for IAV-mediated cell binding, receptor search and activation.</title><p>Using quantitative STORM imaging, we could show that SA-conjugated IAV AF as well as one functional receptor, EGFR, form nanodomains in the plasma membrane of A549 cells. While dense AF nanodomains constitute an attractive multivalent binding platform, their diversity in local AF concentration suggests a variety of different residence times for which IAV would stay bound within these domains. Using single-virus tracking, we observed a mixed diffusive&#x02014;confined motion, that could be simulated using our quantitative SA cluster information. These data suggest a receptor concentration-driven lateral search mechanism between SA enriched nanodomains. Eventually, since AF domains partly overlap with EGFR, IAV encounters a functional receptor that can be activated to signal cell entry. Our data further suggest that a stable preformed EGFR cluster population is activated during IAV stimulation, thereby possibly facilitating efficient signal transduction. EGFR clusters are stabilized by lipid rafts as well as cortical actin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1008656.g006"/></fig><p>From the illustration it becomes clear that microvilli are a dominant topographical feature of the dorsal side of the cell. However, due to their diameter, they are not involved in virus endocytosis. We thus concentrated our efforts on analyzing the area between the microvilli and could identify a population of differently sized AF nanodomains. Our virus-binding simulations indicated that such a clustered organization of AFs is advantageous and positively correlates with the efficiency of virus binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). A heterogeneous cluster organization might thereby broaden the binding capability of the cell surface and effectively provide the virus particle with a range of binding times to explore the cell surface as it was suggested before for Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN) [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Such a binding mode could be particularly relevant for influenza viruses, which have a large morphological variability and a spike protein with strain-dependent affinity and specificity.</p><p>Single-virus tracking of fluorescently-labeled IAVs on and inside target cells [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] revealed that after forming the initial cell contact, IAV particles explore the plasma membrane for on average 6 minutes before endocytosis [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More recently, multicolor imaging of IAVs together with clathrin showed that this period is important for the induction of clathrin-dependent endocytosis [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We performed single-virus tracking under conditions of limited endocytosis to restrict virus motion to the plasma membrane. We mostly found trajectories where random diffusion alternates with periods of spatial confinement. The estimated sizes of the confined regions was consistent with the area found for AF nanodomains using STORM. This result is in agreement with our basic hypothesis that virus plasma membrane motion is largely influenced by the local organization and density of available AFs. Although we cannot exclude that IAV confinement is induced by other factors such as mechanical trapping, our results allow a model to be formulated of how the clustered organization of AFs controls virus-cell binding early during infection.</p><p>Having formed a stable interaction with its host cell, IAVs enter the cell by endocytosis. EGFR was shown to be activated during and promote IAV-cell entry [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but how IAV engages with EGFR remained unclear. We found that EGFR localizes in clusters which colocalize with AF nanodomains. Regarding our results and those of others (reviewed recently in [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), the current view of the plasma membrane suggests a compartmentalization into highly heterogeneous nanodomains with different origin and function. Colocalization at the nanoscale is thus measured as spatial proximity or co-clustering. The observed overlap between IAV AF and receptor clusters thus suggests that the lateral organization of AFs and EGFR underlies similar but not identical principles. Importantly the observed organization would indeed allow IAV to bind EGFR while moving in and between AFs domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p>In the canonical activation model, EGFR binds its substrate EGF, undergoes dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation, thereby inducing a variety of signaling cascades [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, as shown here on A549 cells, an additional level of higher oligomeric EGFR clusters has been shown across different cell types. Their reported diameter ranges from 50 nm [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] over 100&#x02013;300 nm [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] up to near micrometer sizes [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], with molecule numbers between &#x0003c;10 [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] up to thousands [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Clustering was suggested to facilitate receptor activation which might play a role in tumor development [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further, the EGFR cluster size was shown to respond to activation [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggesting a lateral molecule redistribution. With respect to the clustered EGFR organization, we hypothesized two scenarios in which, during activation, EGFR either (1) assembles into activated clusters or (2) pre-existing clusters become activated. Hence, we tested the organization of EGFR under (un)stimulated conditions. While we observed a reduction of the clustered molecule fraction as well as the number of clusters per area upon EGF stimulation, an effect that was observed previously for Erb2 [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we did not detect a major redistribution in response to IAV attachment. This result speaks for the activation of pre-existing clusters and might also indicate a different activation mechanism. EGFR binds EGF with high affinity (nM), leading to fast EGFR activation (within 10 min [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) and internalization. IAV binds EGFR using sialylated glycans, a low affinity process that requires some degree of multivalency. Our colocalization experiments showed that IAVs also bind multiple EGFR clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s011">S10 Fig</xref>) indicating a different recruitment/activation mechanism. How IAV then eventually activates EGFR is still unclear and will be the objective of future investigation. What has been shown previously is that IAV-induced EGFR endocytosis is indeed slower compared to the EGF-induced activation, presumably due to the different mechanism of binding and activation [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Using STORM, we could not detect a change in cluster size and molecule composition following either stimulation. We hence conclude that intercluster spatial rearrangements below our resolution limit might eventually lead to cluster activation. Methods that are more sensitive to protein-protein distances below 20 nm such as FRET could be used to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Following our hypothesis of the activation of pre-formed EGFR clusters, we aimed to test if EGFR clusters exist long enough to allow their activation. We thus went on to probe the stability of EGFR nanoclusters by conducting live-cell sptPALM experiments. We found that the lifetime of EGFR nanodomains in both, the dorsal as well as the ventral side of the cell went up to 2 to 4 minutes. This time resembles the duration IAVs where shown to stay on the plasma membrane before onset of endocytosis (2&#x02013;3 min [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). While a long cluster lifetime would allow activation of pre-existing clusters, this observation raises the question for the stabilization of EGFR clusters. Hence, we tested the stability of EGFR clusters upon treatment with classical membrane domain-destabilizing conditions such as actin depolymerization (latrunculin A) and cholesterol extraction (methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin). As also observed before [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], our results suggest cluster destabilization following both perturbations indicated by an increased fraction of unclustered EGFR molecules. Interestingly, we found a stronger effect after cholesterol depletion, a condition that was previously shown to attenuate IAV replication [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Very long receptor cluster lifetimes were observed previously for class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, that form actin-stabilized domains [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. At this point, we can only speculate about the function of membrane receptor clusters [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It can be excitatory as shown for T-cell receptor [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and linker for activation of T-cell (Lat) [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] as well as LFA-1 [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] or CD36 [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These nanodomains render the cell highly sensitive to small amounts of signaling molecules and due to the high local receptor concentration allow a fast signaling response [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Such a function seems likely for EGFR clusters involved in IAV cell entry observed in our study. But their function can also be inhibitory as shown for the B-cell receptor [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] or its negative co-receptor CD22 [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Receptor nanodomains could even engage in modulating the signaling output. As EGFR sits at the top of a broad array of signaling cascades, an asymmetric distribution of receptors could enable cells to rapidly respond and process different stimuli [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we identified a complex compartmentalization of the cellular plasma membrane in A549 cells with both of the primary IAV-binding molecules, sialylated AFs and functional receptors, organized in nanodomains. Such an organization was observed for other membrane proteins and might indicate a general organization principle of the plasma membrane (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). We developed a functional model to link the lateral membrane organization to its role in virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Quantitative super-resolution microscopy has provided a versatile toolbox to study the structure-function relationship of the plasma membrane. Our study provides a first step in understanding the nanophysiology of virus infection. By relating organization to function within the virus-cell interface, our goal is to better understand how viruses use cellular structures. How membrane compartmentalization can modulate IAV cell and receptor binding as shown here will be complemented with functional studies investigating the involved signal activation in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Work with embryonated chicken eggs was conducted in the lab of Prof. Andreas Herrmann (Institute for Biology, Humbold-Universit&#x000e4;t zu Berlin, Germany) in accordance with European regulations and approved by the Berlin state authority, Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Gesundheit und Soziales.
