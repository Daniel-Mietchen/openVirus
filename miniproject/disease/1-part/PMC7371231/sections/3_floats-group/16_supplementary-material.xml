  <title>IAVs colocalize with EGFR and pEGFR on A549 cells.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were infected with IAV X31 (MOI = 100) at low temperature for 15 min, then fixed and immunostained using anti-H3N2 antiserum together with either anti-EGFR or anti-pEGFR (Y1068) antibodies. We analyzed images takes in widefield epi illumination (
   <bold>A</bold>) as well as two-color STORM (
   <bold>B</bold>). Using widefield epi illumination, we observed bright IAV spots that co-localize with EGFR clusters and pEGFR signal (arrow heads). Scale bar = 2 Î¼m. We quantified this colocalization and found that in both cases about 20% of IAVs colocalize with EGFR and pEGFR respectively. In the two-color STORM reconstructions, we could also observe IAVs that colocalize with EGFR or pEGFR. More specifically, due to the increased resolution, we could discriminate fully overlapping colocalization (
   <bold>B</bold>, arrow heads) as well as IAVs that associate with more than one (p)EGFR cluster (
   <bold>B</bold>, asterisk). Shown are overview images (left) as well as four magnified regions (right) for each overview.
