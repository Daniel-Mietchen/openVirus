  <title>Evolution of the confinement probability I
   <sub>conf</sub> as well as the particles distance from the origin for a simulated virus trajectory.
  </title>
  <p>The particle moves according to D
   <sub>free</sub> until it encounters an AF cluster (top panel, red circles). Due to the higher concentration of AF, the particles diffusion is slowed down to D
   <sub>conf</sub> and the particle is confined. Particle confinement is detected by an increase of the confinement probability (middle panel) as well as a plateau in the distance from origin plot (lower panel).
