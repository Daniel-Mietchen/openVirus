  <title>Confinement probability can robustly identify transient immobilization in IAV trajectories.</title>
  <p>To test the precision of the confinement probability, we simulated random trajectories that did not or did contain a confined region and calculated the confinement probability I
   <sub>conf</sub> for each trajectory. The confined region was chosen according to experimental data for the radius (r = 50â€“300 nm) as well as D
   <sub>conf</sub> (Figs 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g002">2</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g003">3</xref>). To identify a confined region, we had to set a threshold of I
   <sub>conf</sub>, which we set to 5 to allow high sensitivity. Our simulations (100 trajectories) show that at this threshold we have a chance of false identification (false positives) of ~10%, which drops to 0% at I
   <sub>conf</sub> &gt; 8 (
   <bold>A</bold>). For the simulations that did contain a confinement (example in 
   <bold>B</bold>), we found an average detection efficiency (true positives) of 90% across the entire simulation space (900 trajectories, color code in 
   <bold>C</bold>).
