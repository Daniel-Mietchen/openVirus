  <title>Molecule blinking correction for EGFR data.</title>
  <p>To estimate the number of emitting molecules from a STORM dataset and to avoid false clustering of individual molecules, we merged multiple localizations originating from the same molecule into a single localization. The merging procedure requires a gap distance as well as a gap time, within which localizations will be counted as originating from the same molecule. To calibrate these values, we imaged isolated labelled anti-EGFR antibodies under experimental conditions. Localizations originating from a single molecule could be grouped to determine their lateral spread (
   <bold>A</bold>) as well as the dark time between individual bursts (
   <bold>B</bold>). To ensure a high certainty of merging, the dark time cut-off was determined by the 99% quantile to 18 s. Using the experimentally determined spread of localization (
   <bold>A</bold>, 35 nm) and the dark-time cut off, localization bursts from the same molecule can now be combined into a single position. While each molecule is counted multiple times due to molecule blinking (uncorrected, 
   <bold>C</bold>), merging allows a more precise estimate of the molecule numbers while avoiding false clustering (corrected, 
   <bold>D</bold>).
