  <title>Experimental positive control for two-color STORM colocalization analysis.</title>
  <p>We used two differently labelled versions of SNA as an experimental colocalization positive control. This served us also as a nominator to better evaluate the degree of colocalization of our test molecule pair SNA/EGFR. A549 cells were labelled with two SNA variants, conjugated to Alexa 647 as well Alexa 555 (
   <bold>A</bold>). Both localization datasets were analyzed using CBC resulting in a colocalization value C
   <sub>A</sub> associated to each individual localization. A histogram of C
   <sub>A</sub> for one channel is shown in 
   <bold>B</bold>. We set the threshold to 0.3, above which localizations were counted as colocalized. 
   <bold>C</bold> shows one SNA dataset color coded according to C
   <sub>A</sub>. 
   <bold>D</bold> shows all localizations from the same dataset with C
   <sub>A</sub> &gt; 0.3.
