  <title>EGFR cluster size and molecule number do not change after IAV or EGF stimulation.</title>
  <p>EGFR cluster activation can be inhibited by the EGFR kinase inhibitor Gefitinib (
   <bold>A, B</bold>). A549 cells were infected with IAV X31 (MOI = 100) at 4°C for 15 min upon pre-treatment with 10 μM Gefitinib for 1h min at 37°C. The cells were fixed and immunostained using pEGFR (Y1068) antibodies to label activated EGFR. The cells were imaged using STORM and pEGFR cluster identified using DBSCAN. Following stimulation with EGF or IAV, we detected an increase in the number of pEGFR cluster per area (as also shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This effect could be inhibited by Gefitinib treatment (
   <bold>A, B</bold>). A549 were treated with infection medium (control) or infection medium containing IAV (MOI = 100) or 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min at 4°C. The cells were fixed and immunostained using anti-EGFR antibodies. Upon either stimulation, we could not detect a change in the size of the EGFR clusters or the amount of molecules per cluster (
   <bold>C</bold>).
