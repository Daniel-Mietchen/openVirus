  <title>Establishment of the experimental system.</title>
  <p>We first tested if our experimental system (virus and cells) is suitable for the intended experiments. Virus binding was tested at high MOI after low-temperature adsorption followed by immunostaining using anti-H3N2 antiserum. We found that our IAV strain could efficiently bind to A549 cells at high MOI (~100) (
   <bold>A</bold>). Individual cells are highlighted (dashed lines). IAV infection was performed at lower MOI (~1) to achieve a high contrast infection and avoid overinfection. Following infection, the cells were incubated for 8h, then fixed and immunostained using anti-NP antibodies. The infection was quantified as nuclear NP accumulation and analyzed using CellProfiler [
   <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] (NP/DAPI ratio) (
   <bold>B</bold>). We found that our influenza A H3N2/X31 virus could efficiently infect A549 cells at a titer of 8.3*10
   <sup>5</sup> focus forming units (FFU) per ml. A549 cells were either treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 30 min to reduce the concentration of available cell surface EGF receptors or 0.01U/ml neuraminidase for 3h at 37Â°C. Cells were infected with influenza A/X31 (MOI ~ 1) for 8h then fixed and immunolabelled for newly produced viral nucleoprotein (NP) (
   <bold>D</bold>). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Nuclear NP signal was quantified using automated image analysis with CellProfiler (
   <bold>E, F</bold>).
