  <title>Experimentally obtained localization precision σ for Alexa 647 and Alexa 750.</title>
  <p>Glass slides were washed, plasma cleaned and coated with Poly-L-lysine (0.01% in water) for 1h. Conjugated antibodies were diluted in PBS to a final concentration of ~10 nM and adsorbed to the coated glass slides. Individual molecules were imaged under experimental conditions. Localizations originating from single Alexa 647 (
   <bold>A</bold>) and Alexa 750 (
   <bold>B</bold>) molecules were aligned to allow the estimation of the average localization precision: σ
   <sub>x,y</sub> A647 = 12 nm and σ
   <sub>x,y</sub> A750 = 21 nm.
