  <title>IAV performs a receptor concentration-driven random walk on the plasma membrane.</title>
  <p>Based on our quantitative analysis of the AF distribution on A549 cells, we hypothesize a motion behavior that is driven by the local AF concentration. We simulate this behavior initially as a 2D random walk with free diffusion coefficient D
   <sub>free</sub> (
   <bold>A</bold>). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Next, we simulate AF clusters (red circles, r = 100 nm), which would, due to the increased SA concentration, lead to a temporal confinement (D
   <sub>conf</sub> &lt; D
   <sub>free</sub>). To identify confined regions within the simulated virus trajectories, we establish a confinement probability I
   <sub>conf</sub>. Accordingly, a free diffusing particle shows only fluctuation in of I
   <sub>conf</sub> (
   <bold>D</bold>), while the addition of temporal confinement leads to a clear increase that overlaps with stationary phases of the particle as visible in the XY displacement plot (
   <bold>E</bold>). We used the confinement probability to analyze experimental virus trajectories in particular the mixed type of trajectories (
   <bold>C</bold>) (see also 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s009">S8 Fig</xref>) (
   <bold>C</bold>). I
   <sub>conf</sub> shows a clear signature of temporal confinement (
   <bold>F</bold>) similar to the model prediction (
   <bold>E</bold>). As a further challenge for our model, we performed a subtrajectory analysis, thereby extracting the dwell time, D
   <sub>conf</sub> as well as the area of the respective temporal confinement in our virus trajectories. (
   <bold>G</bold>) shows an overlay of the perimeters of the extracted confined regions as well as the average radius (R). From our simulated data, correlation of D
   <sub>conf</sub> with the dwell time shows that a local increase in AF concentration (i.e. decreased diffusion) due to the encounter of an SA nanodomain leads to an increased local dwell time (
   <bold>H</bold>, red markers). We observed a similar behavior, when we tested the confinement dwell time in experimental virus trajectories (
   <bold>H</bold>, black markers).
