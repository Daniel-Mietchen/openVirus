  <title>Sialylated IAV attachment factors are organized in nanodomains on A549 cells.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Influenza virus is an enveloped particle that encapsulates its segmented (-)vRNA genome built of 8 viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The viral membrane harbors the two glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is responsible for binding sialic acid (SA) containing attachment factors on the host cell plasma membrane. Upon cell-binding, the virus needs to activate functional receptors to trigger endocytosis. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Confocal imaging of live A549 cells labelled with SNA (conjugated to JF549). The cells feature a non-uniform SNA distribution across the plasma membrane. Large finger-like protrusions can be observed on the dorsal side of the cell. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Confocal and STED live-cell imaging of A549 cells labelled with SNA (conjugated to StarRed) confirms the existence of finger-like protrusions as well as a population of smaller nanodomains with diameter of ~100 nm (
   <bold>C</bold>, right, inset). (
   <bold>D</bold>) To increase the resolution and focus on the small nanodomain we performed STORM imaging of A549 cells labelled with SNA (conjugated to Alexa647). Reconstructed STORM images confirm two major structural features (1) finger-like protrusions as well as (2) small nanodomains. Cell treatment with neuraminidase (NA, 0.01 U/ml for 2h) led to a strong reduction of the localization density due to the cleavage and hence decrease local concentration of SA (
