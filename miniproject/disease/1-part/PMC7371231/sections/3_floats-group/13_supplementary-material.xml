  <title>A clustered AF organization increases IAV binding probability.</title>
  <p>To estimate the effect of AF clustering on the efficiency of a virus to bind the target cell, we simulated two scenarios in a 1x1 Î¼m membrane area, (
   <bold>A</bold>) a varying cluster size and (
   <bold>B</bold>) a varying degree of clustering. For 
   <bold>A</bold>, we simulated a constant lateral concentration of AF (black) and added AF clusters (blue) at increasing size. In 
   <bold>B</bold>, we keep the total amount of AF constant and gradually shift molecules into clusters. In both cases, an approaching virus was simulated as a 2D projection of a small spherical IAV particle (contact area as red circles in 
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold>). A binding attempt was counted as successful if at least 10 AF molecules were found inside the contact area. 
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold> show the simulation result plotted as the binding probability out of 1000 simulations against the respective tested cluster parameter.
