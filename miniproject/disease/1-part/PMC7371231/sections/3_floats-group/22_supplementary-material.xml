  <title>EGFR expression level does not correlate with the EGFR cluster size but with the number of clusters per area.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were transfected with plasmids for EGFR-mEos3.2 24h before the imaging experiments. On the day of the experiment, the cells were fixed and and imaged. In order to assess the expression level, we took a snapshot of the pre-converted green mEos version before photoconversion and PALM acquisition. We performed the DBSCAN cluster analysis for different cells at various expression levels (
   <bold>A</bold>). We observed that the number of clusters per area increased at higher expression level, while the cluster radius was not affected (
   <bold>B</bold>).
