  <title>Single molecule diffusion coefficients from sptPALM of EGFR-mEos3 in A549 cells.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were transiently transfected with EGFR-mEos3. sptPALM imaging and analysis of single molecule trajectories revealed a wide range of diffusion coefficients. The left panels in 
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold> show the distribution of diffusion coefficients from sptPALM obtained at the dorsal (
   <bold>A</bold>) and the ventral plasma membrane (
   <bold>B</bold>). Molecules were classified as mobile (D&gt;0.5 μm2/s) or immobile (D&lt;0.5 μm2/s) respectively. Calculated MDS plots (
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold>, right panels) for both classes exhibit a rather linear dependence for the mobile fraction, while the curve saturates with increasing lag time for the immobile fraction, the latter indicating spatial confinement.
