  <title>EGFR-kinase activity is required for IAV-mediated EGFR activation and infection.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were infected with IAV X31 (MOI = 100) at 4°C for 15 min upon pre-treatment with 10 μM Gefitinib for 1h min at 37°C. The cells were fixed and immunostained using pEGFR (Y1068) antibodies to label activated EGFR (
   <bold>A</bold>) and nuclear DNA was labelled with DAPI. The cytosolic pEGFR signal was analyzed using ImageJ (
   <bold>B</bold>). To probe the infection efficiency, A549 cells were infected with IAV X31 (MOI = 1) for 8h upon pre-treatment with 10 μM Gefitinib for 1h min at 37°C. The cells were fixed and immunostained using anti-NP antibodies (
   <bold>A</bold>) and nuclear DNA was labelled with DAPI (
   <bold>C</bold>). The infected was quantified as nuclear NP/DAPI signal as analyzed with CellProfiler (
   <bold>D</bold>). EGFR nanoclusters are sensitive to actin- or lipid domain destabilization (
   <bold>E</bold>). A549 cells were incubated with latrunculin A (1 μM) or methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MCD) (40 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C, then fixed and stained using anti-EGFR antibodies.
