  <title>Nanoscale glycan organization in A549 cells.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were fixed, labelled using SNA and imaged with STED. We found a similar glycan organization of small clusters as well as protruding microvilli as visualized with STORM (
   <bold>A</bold>). A similar glycan organization was observed using SNA on MDCK cells (
   <bold>B</bold>). We also labelled A549 cells with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which unlike SNA, less specifically labels all sialylated glycans (
   <bold>C</bold>). Using WGA, we could reproduce the nanocluster compartmentalization of the cell surface as well as protruding hollow microvilli (arrow heads in 
   <bold>C</bold>, right panel).
