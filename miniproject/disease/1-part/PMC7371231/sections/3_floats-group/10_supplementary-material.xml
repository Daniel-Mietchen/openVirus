  <title>Nanoscale Ezrin organization in A549 cells.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) A549 cells were immunolabelled for the actin-binding protein Ezrin, which was shown to be enriched in microvilli [
   <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The cells were imaged using STORM. Microvilli are clearly distinguishable and resemble the large cluster population as observed on SNA-labelled cells and in scanning electron microscopy (SEM, inset). Scale bars: left panel: 2 Î¼m, right panel: 500 nm, inset: 200nm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Ezrin localization maps can then be used to set a threshold for the clusters size obtained from DBSCAN clustering to specifically analyze the non-microvilli cluster population in SNA localization maps (
