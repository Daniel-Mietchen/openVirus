  <title>EGFR is immobilized after chemical fixation.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EGFR-mEos3.2 24h before imaging. On the day of the experiment, the DMEM growth medium was exchanged for Leibovitz medium and the cells were transferred into the microscopes sample holder and imaged using TIRF illumination for 10 min per field of view. Individual EGFR proteins could be localized and tracked over several frames. 
   <bold>A</bold> shows a rendering of all localizations from a single field of view. 
   <bold>B</bold> shows the trajectories of three EGFR molecules around a nanocluster (boxed area in 
   <bold>A</bold>). We detected an immobile protein fraction of about 45%. Following PFA fixation, the EGFR mobility was strongly reduced leading to smaller clusters (
   <bold>C,</bold> rendered image; 
   <bold>D</bold>, trajectories in boxed area) and an immobile protein fraction of &gt;95% (
   <bold>E</bold>). To relate the amount of immobilization, we also tracked localizations stemming from gold fiducials immobilized on the glass slide (Bkgd in 
   <bold>E</bold>).
