<p>The same data was then used to construct a map of all detected localizations, which revealed a non-homogeneous distribution with proteins clustered into nanodomains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Using our custom cluster identification analysis (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g002">Fig 2Aâ€“2C</xref>), we found EGFR clusters with diameters ranging between 30 and 300 nm, confirming the organization of EGFR observed in fixed cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In addition, and because the cells were alive, we could use the time-resolved single molecule detection to quantify the temporal stability of EGFR clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Such an approach was used previously to quantify polymerase 2 clustering in live cells and is referred to as time-correlated PALM (tcPALM) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We selected regions identified by density-based clustering to perform tcPALM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>), and obtained a distribution of EGFR cluster lifetimes with an average of 140 seconds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, dorsal). Notably, this lifetime only provides a lower estimate since the cluster might have existed before starting the acquisition and might also be present after the last cluster molecule was photobleached.
