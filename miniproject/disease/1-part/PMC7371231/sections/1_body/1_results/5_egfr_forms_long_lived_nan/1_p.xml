<p>Since IAV stimulation did not affect EGFR organization, we hypothesized that pre-formed nanoclusters might be involved in IAV-induced EGFR activation. While IAV engagement of pre-formed EGFR clusters was previously hypothesized [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it remained unclear whether EGFR cluster lifetimes in the plasma membrane would be long enough to allow this type of interaction. To estimate the lifetime of EGFR clusters, we turned to live-cell microscopy experiments using A549 cells expressing EGFR tagged with the photo-convertible protein mEos3.2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We used an EGFR variant that was previously shown to be fully functional in a mammalian cell expression system [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Photoactivation of only a small subset of EGFR-mEos3.2 molecules allowed us to localize individual molecules which can then be tracked over consecutive frames, and renewed by further photoactivation (single-particle tracking, sptPALM) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We performed sptPALM on the dorsal as well as the ventral plasma membrane of live A549 cells in the absence of EGF, resulting in high-density protein diffusion mapping (
