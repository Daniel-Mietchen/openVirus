<p>To quantify the lateral organization of AFs from our STORM localization data, we used an algorithm based on the detection of local density differences. To facilitate the analysis, we developed a workflow (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>) that allowed us to extract geometrical properties of the clusters as well as an estimate of the number of AF molecules (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). To identify and exclude the large microvilli cluster population, we first performed cluster identification on the ezrin localization maps (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s005">S4B Fig</xref>). We found that the large ezrin clusters had dimensions of 10–50 nm across the short and 0.5–2 μm along the long axis (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). After filtering, we identified a heterogeneous population of small clusters with a mean area of 0.016 μm
 <sup>2</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Since the cluster area was at the same scale as the projected two-dimensional area of a spherical IAV (0.0079 μm
 <sup>2</sup> for r = 50 nm), we took a closer look at the density of molecules within each cluster. To define a local density, we counted the number of nearest neighbor localizations within a distance of three times the localization precision (3σ ~ 30 nm) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we found that AF clusters have an average 10-fold enrichment compared to the local background while some reach an even 20-fold increase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). As a control, we used simulations to test the effect of localization precision on local concentration; however, this accounts at most for an enrichment of &lt; 8-fold (
