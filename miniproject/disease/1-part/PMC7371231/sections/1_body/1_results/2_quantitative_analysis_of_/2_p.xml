<p>Following the identification of AF domains, we wanted to understand whether their observed organization would have an impact on virus binding compared to a homogeneous distribution. We constructed a virus binding simulation in which we gradually redistribute AF molecules from a random into a clustered organization, keeping the total number of molecules constant. In parallel, we simulated a stable population of clusters within a background of free individual molecules and vary the number of molecules per cluster. In both cases, we simulate a spherical virus particle and project its size as a landing spot on the simulated molecule surface. Binding is counted as successful if the virus contacts at least 10 AF molecules. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s008">S7 Fig</xref>, we find a positive correlation between AF clustering and virus binding indicating that nanoclustering enhances the probability of efficient virus adhesion.
