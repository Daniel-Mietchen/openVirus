<p>Our next goal was to investigate the lateral organization of IAV AFs at the scale of the virus-cell interface, in fixed cells to avoid motion blurring. We initially confirmed that our cell fixation protocol successfully immobilized plasma membrane molecules (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s003">S2 Fig</xref>), then performed STORM and STED in parallel to image the plasma membrane at the scale of small spherical H3N2/X31 virions (average diameter of 120 nm [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s004">S3A Fig</xref>) imaging of fixed A549 cells supported our observations made on live cells that SNA stains a variety of small nanostructures on the flat parts of the plasma membrane. We also found a similar distribution on MDCK cells, which are highly susceptible for IAV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s004">S3B Fig</xref>). As an SNA-independent control, we used wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a general SA-binding lectin. WGA labelled A549 cells at higher density, while again highlighting microvilli and nanoscale clusters (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s004">S3C Fig</xref>). Finally, we labeled cells using antibodies against ezrin, an actin-binding protein. Ezrin is highly enriched in microvilli [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and confirmed that the large finger-like structures are indeed microvilli (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s005">S4A Fig</xref>). Since microvilli are not actively involved in endocytosis [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we focused on the population of smaller AF clusters.
