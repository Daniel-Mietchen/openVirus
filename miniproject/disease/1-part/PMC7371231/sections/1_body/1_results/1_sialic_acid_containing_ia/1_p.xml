<p>To examine the spatial organization of IAV AFs within the plasma membrane of permissive epithelial cells, we sought to selectively label sialic acid moieties which are preferably recognized by human-pathogenic IAVs, such as H3N2/X31 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] used here. For this purpose, we used the plant lectin 
 <italic>Sambuccus nigra</italic> agglutinin (SNA), which labels α-2,6-linked SA, to serve as a primary IAV AF label (

We then used STED microscopy to more carefully study the smoother regions of the plasma membrane between the microvilli. On live A549 cells, we detected a strong heterogeneity of SNA cell surface labelling including small clusters at the scale of 100–200 nm (
