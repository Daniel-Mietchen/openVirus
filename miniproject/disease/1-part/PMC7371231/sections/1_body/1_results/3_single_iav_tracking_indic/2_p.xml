<p>To test whether our model is consistent with the motion of IAV, we performed single-virus tracking on live A549 cells. We considered physiological conditions (37°C) as well as conditions that suppress virus endocytosis (4°C, dynasore treatment) to prolong the particles’ residence time on the cell surface. The trajectory analysis revealed different modes of movement, which we classified into four types: (1) confined, (2) ballistic, (3) drifting and (4) mixed (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since this type of movement follows a successful virus internalization, we expected to see it decrease in frequency after blocking endocytosis. Indeed, the fraction of ballistic trajectories dropped from 30% to below 5% when we imaged at low temperature or in the presence of 40 μM dynasore [
