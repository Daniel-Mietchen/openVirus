<p>If AF domains of different lateral concentrations coexist in the plasma membrane, as observed using STORM, these regions could serve as binding platforms for diffusing viruses. According to our simple diffusion model, the local AF concentration dominates

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>), which in turn determines the particles dwell time inside the confined regions. To test in experiments whether

 <sub>
  <italic>conf</italic>

 </sub> (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>), finding that they are indeed inversely related as predicted by our diffusion model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). Subtrajectory analysis further allowed us to estimate the spatial dimensions of the confined regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). We found an average radius of 104 nm corresponding to a median area of 0.057 Î¼m
 <sup>2</sup>, which is only slightly larger than the SNA cluster size found using STORM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In summary, the lateral organization of AFs, characterized using STORM, has a predicted effect on virus mobility, consistent with live-cell IAV tracking data.
