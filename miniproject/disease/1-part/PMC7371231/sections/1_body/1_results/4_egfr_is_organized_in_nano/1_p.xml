<p>How does IAV-glycan binding translate into cell entry? To study the nanoscale spatial relationship between AFs and functional receptors, we focused on the previously identified IAV receptor EGFR [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Initially, we verified that our IAV strain (H3N2/X31) binds to and depends on EGFR for cell infection in our experimental system. We found that about 20% of IAVs colocalized with EGFR (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s012">S11 Fig</xref>). We then investigated the lateral organization of EGFR in A549 cells using fluorescently labelled anti-EGFR antibodies. In our infection experiments, the cells were pre-incubated with serum-free infection medium (30 min) before viruses were added, a common procedure for influenza virus infection. To reproduce these conditions, we also performed a serum-free pre-incubation before the cells were fixed and immunolabelled for EGFR.
