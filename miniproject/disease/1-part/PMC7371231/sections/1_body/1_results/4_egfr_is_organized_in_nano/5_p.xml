<p>To better understand how IAV binding leads to EGFR activation, we examined the properties of individual EGFR clusters. It was previously hypothesized that IAV binding leads to a local concentration increase in EGFR proteins within plasma membrane clusters eventually leading to signal activation [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we labeled unstimulated, EGF- or IAV-stimulated cells using anti-EGFR antibodies. After EGF stimulation, we observed a decrease in the clustered molecule population as well as the number of clusters per area (both by on average 20%) (
