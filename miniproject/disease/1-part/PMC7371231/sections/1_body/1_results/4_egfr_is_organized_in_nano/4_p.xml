<p>When an infecting IAV encounters an EGFR cluster, we would expect EGFR to become activated. Thus, we wanted to measure the cellâ€™s EGFR response to IAV stimulation. Notably, in order to keep the signal at the plasma membrane, endocytosis was slowed down by stimulating the cells on ice. We used an antibody that recognizes a phosphorylated tyrosine (Y1068, pEGFR) previously shown to be involved in IAV-induced EGFR activation [

Following stimulation with either EGF or IAV, we observed an increased number of pEGFR clusters per area on the plasma membrane (
