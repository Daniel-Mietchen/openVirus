<p>After blink correction and cluster identification, we found that in the absence of EGF stimulation 30â€“60% of EGFR molecules reside in clusters, which were sensitive to actin- and lipid raft destabilizing drugs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s012">S11E Fig</xref>). The EGFR clusters had an average diameter of 29 nm and were composed of 6 molecules (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), consistent with previous estimates using electron microcopy [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and FRET [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since IAVs bind to AFs on the cell surface, we hypothesized that SNA and EGFR should occupy the same regions on the plasma membrane to enable IAV-EGFR interactions. To test this hypothesis, we performed two-color STORM imaging (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) using A549 cells co-labeled with SNA and anti-EGFR antibodies. Indeed, we found that EGFR clusters overlap with SNA-labeled membrane domains. However, since sialylated AFs are much more abundant than EGFRs, their colocalization could occur simply by chance. To examine this possibility, we analyzed our data using coordinate-based colocalization (CBC) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which estimates the spatial correlation of two localization datasets (

 </sub>. To contextualize the extent of colocalization in our SNA/EGFR dataset, we performed a positive control experiment using SNA conjugated with two different fluorophores (denoted SNA/SNA). As a negative control and to take differences in molecule density into account, for each two-color field of view in SNA/EGFR, we simulated a random dataset at the same density (denoted SNA/random). Finally, we define localizations with C
 <sub>A</sub>&gt;0.3 as colocalized (annotated C
 <sub>A&gt;0.3</sub> below) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s014">S13 Fig</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008656.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, the negative control SNA/random reaches C
 <sub>A&gt;0.3</sub> = 0.035, a baseline level only accounting for random colocalization, while the experimental positive control SNA/SNA reaches a much higher value, C
 <sub>A&gt;0.3</sub> = 0.27. CBC analysis of SNA/EGFR colocalization reached an intermediate value, C
 <sub>A&gt;0.3</sub> = 0.17. These analyses reveal that the spatial overlap between EGFR and SNA is not complete and yet also not random, indicating that both molecules share a common population of membrane compartments.
