 <sup>5</sup> A549 cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated 25 mm round glass slides. For SNA imaging, the cells were washed in pre-warmed PBS and fixed for 10 min in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Alpha Aesar). The cells were blocked in blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS) and incubated in 50 μg/ml SNA diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min. The cells were washed 3 times in PBS and post-fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. For EGFR labelling, the cells were washes, fixed and blocked as described above then incubated with anti-EGFR primary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 647. For two-color imaging, the cells were incubated with unconjugated primary anti-EGFR antibodies for 1h at RT. The cells were washed three times in PBS and further incubated with a solution of 5 μg/ml Alexa 750-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse, Life Technologies) and 5 μg/ml Alexa 647-conjugated SNA. The cells were washed 3 times in PBS and post-fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. A549 cells in
