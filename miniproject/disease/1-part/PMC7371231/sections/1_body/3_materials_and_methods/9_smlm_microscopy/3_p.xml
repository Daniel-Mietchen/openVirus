<p>PALM imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axio Observer D1 inverted microscope, equipped with a 100x, 1.49 NA objective (Zeiss). Activation and excitation lasers with wavelengths 405 nm (Coherent cube) and 561 nm (Crystal laser) illuminated the sample in total internal fluorescence (TIRF) mode. We used a four color dichroic 89100bs (Chroma), fluorescence emission was filtered with an emission filter ET605/70 (Chroma) and detected with an electron-multiplying CCD camera (iXon+, Andor Technology) with a resulting pixel size of 160nm. For each region of interest, typically 10000 images of a 41x41 Î¼m2 area were collected with an exposure time of 30 ms. Photoactivatable proteins were activated with 405 nm laser intensity &lt; 0.5 W/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, chosen to maintain a sparse population of activated molecules for localization, and excited with 561 nm laser intensity of ~1 kW/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. Image stacks were analyzed using ThunderStorm[
