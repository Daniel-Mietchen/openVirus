<p>EGFR single- and two-color STORM imaging were performed using a recently developed flat-field epi illumination microscope [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Briefly, two lasers with wavelengths of 642 nm (2RU-VFL-P-2000-642-B1R, MPB Communications) and 750 nm (2RU-VFL-P-500-750-B1R, MPB Communications) were used to switch off fluorophores on the sample, while a 405 nm laser (OBIS, Coherent) controlled the return rate of the fluorophores to the fluorescence-emitting state. A custom dichroic (ZT405/561/642/750/850rpc, Chroma) reflected the laser light and transmitted fluorescence emission before and after passing through the objective (CFI60 PlanApo Lambda Ã…~60/NA 1.4, Nikon). After passing the respective filter (ET700/75M, Chroma or ET810/90m, Chroma), emitted light from the sample was imaged onto the sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2, Andor). Axial sample position was controlled using the pgFocus open hardware autofocus module (
