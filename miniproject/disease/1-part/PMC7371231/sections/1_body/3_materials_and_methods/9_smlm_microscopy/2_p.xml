<p>SNA single color imaging was performed on a modified Olympus IX71 inverted microscope. A 641 nm laser (Coherent, CUBE 640-100C) and a 405 nm laser (Coherent, CUBE 405-100C) was reflected by a multiband dichroic (89100 bs, Chroma) on the back aperture of a 100x 1.3 NA oil objective (Olympus, UplanFL) mounted on a piezo objective scanner (P-725 PIFOC, Physik Instrumente). The collected fluorescence was filtered using a band-pass emission filter (ET700/75, Chroma) and imaged onto an EMCCD camera (IxonEM+, Andor) with a 100 nm pixel size and using the conventional CCD amplifier at a frame rate of 25 fps. Laser intensity on the sample measured after the objective was 2â€“4 kW/cm
