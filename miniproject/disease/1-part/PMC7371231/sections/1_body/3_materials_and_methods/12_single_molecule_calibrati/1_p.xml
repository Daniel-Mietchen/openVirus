<p>In order to measure the localization precision of our system and calibrate the grouping parameters, we performed STORM imaging on isolated dye molecules. 25 mm round glass slides (Menzel, # 1.5) were plasma cleaned for 10 min and coated with poly-L-lysine solution (100 Œºg/ml in ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O, the slides were dried and incubated with 10‚Äì50 pM dye-conjugated SNA or anti-EGFR antibodies respectively. After 15 min, the slides were washed once and then imaged under experimental conditions. Localization maps were filtered and drift-corrected using gold fiducials. Individual localizations were first grouped with 
 <italic>gap = 0</italic> and search radius 30 nm, to merge individual blink events, then grouped again with a gap time equal to the total acquisition time (15k frames). This allows to quantify the spread of localizations along x and y

 </sub>). All localization processing was performed using custom written MatLab (MathWorks) scripts.
