<p>IAV H3N2/X-31 were incubated with 50 μM of the lipid dye DiD (Life Technologies) for 2h at RT. To remove the free dye, viruses were either pelleted (50.000 g for 5 min) or purified using a NAP5 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare). DiD-labelled viruses were diluted in infection medium (DMEM, 0.2% BSA) to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml (protein content) and viral aggregates were removed using a 0.2 μm sterile filter. Labeled viruses were added to A549 cells grown in 35 mm poly-L-lysine coated glass bottom petri dishes (MatTek Corp.) and allowed to attach on ice for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with 2 ml pre-warmed, serum and phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 100 mM Hepes. Unless otherwise stated, the cells were kept either at 4 or 37 deg throughout the experiment. For the perturbation experiments, the cells were pre-incubated in DMEM supplemented with 50 μM nocodazole (Sigma) or 40 μM dynasore (Sigma) for 30 min. The drugs were kept present throughout the experiment. Low temperature incubation was achieved using a custom build microscope temperature chamber. DiD was excited with 633 nm laser light, which was reflected on the sample by a 488/633 nm dichroic mirror. Emission light was collected using a 60x PlanApo VC oil-immersion objective (Nikon) and imaged onto an EMCCD camera (Andor iXon, Andor Technology). Images were recorded at 2 frames per second for 10 min. Image stacks were processed and the trajectories were build using ParticleTracker for ImageJ [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] implemented into our custom analysis pipeline. Briefly, the algorithm takes a segment of the trajectory and determines if the particle moved according to a given free diffusion coefficient (

 </sub>) within the segment, i.e. if the particles stays in a predicted region. This is translated into a confinement probability

 </sub>. Since the identification depends on the length of the segment

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we optimized S using simulated trajectories resulting in S = 5 s for our analysis.
