<p>Unconjugated 
 <italic>Sambuccus nigra</italic> agglutinin (SNA, VectorLabs) or anti-EGFR antibodies (Sigma) were diluted to 0.6 mg/ml in 100 μl PBS (supplemented with 50 mM NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>). AlexaFluor 647 NHS ester (Life Technologies) or Star Red NHS ester (Abberior) was added at a final concentration of (150 μM) and the solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 100 μl PBS were added and the solution was applied to a NAP5 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with PBS. 300 μl fractions were collected in a 96-well plate and analyzed by ultraviolet—visible spectroscopy (Nanodrop2000, ThermoFisher). Peak protein fractions were collected and the degree of labelling calculated. The labelled lectin and antibody fractions were stored at 4°C until further use.
