<p>Live cell STED measurements were done with Abberior STED microscope (Abberior Instruments, Germany) as previously described in [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The microscope is equipped with a titanium-sapphire STED laser (MaiTai HP, Spectra-Newport). The labelled Abberior Star Red- labelled SNA was excited using 640 nm pulsed diode laser (Picoquant, Germany) with an average excitation power of 5–10 μW at the objective (UPlanSApo 100x/1.4 oil, Olympus). Depletion was achieved using tunable pulsed laser at 780 nm. The microscope was operated using Abberior’s Imspector software. Fixed-cell STED measurements (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s004">S3 Fig</xref>) were performed on a Leica SP8 STED microscope. The microscope was equipped with a HC PL APO 100x objective, a white light laser for excitation and a 592 nm depletion laser.
