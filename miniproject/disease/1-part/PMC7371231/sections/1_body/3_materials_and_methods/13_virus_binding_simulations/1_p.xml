<p>We simulated a flat patch of cell surface (1x1 Î¼m
 <sup>2</sup>) including 
 <italic>n</italic> attachment factor molecules at random positions. For the analysis of the degree of clustering (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s008">S7B Fig</xref>), the simulated molecules were gradually shifted into clusters, while 
 <italic>n</italic> was kept constant. To analyze the impact of the cluster size (i.e. the number of receptors per cluster), we simulated a constant concentration of attachment factor molecules and added receptor clusters at the indicated size (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s008">S7A Fig</xref>). A virus attempting to attach was simulated as s two-dimensional projection of a spherical 100 nm virus particle. The virus center was randomly placed onto the simulated surface and the number of attachment factor molecules within a radius of 50 nm was counted. More than 10 molecules were counted as successful binding. Matlab scripts to run the simulation are available at GitHub (
