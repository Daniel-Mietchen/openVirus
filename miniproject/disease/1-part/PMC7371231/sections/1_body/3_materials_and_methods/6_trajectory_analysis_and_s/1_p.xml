<p>Random brownian particle trajectories were generated using the script package 
 <italic>msdanalzer</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] incorporated into a custom MatLab routine. Single virus trajectories were analyzed as described above. Trajectory and sub-trajectory analysis was performed using 
 <italic>msdanalzer</italic> to retrieve diffusion coefficients from mean square displacement (MSD, &lt;r
 <sup>2</sup>&gt;) vs. lag-time (Δt) plots. MSD vs. lag-time plots were fitted according to the type of motional behavior, which was either free diffusion (&lt;r
 <sup>2</sup>&gt; = 4D
 <sub>free</sub>Δt) or, for sub-trajectory analysis, confined (sub)diffusion (&lt;r
 <sup>2</sup>&gt; = &lt;r
 <sup>2</sup>&gt; (1-A
 <sub>1</sub>exp (−4A
 <sub>2</sub>D
 <sub>conf</sub>Δt/&lt;r2&gt;)). We found for IAV a mean free diffusion coefficient D
 <sub>free</sub> = 0.041 μm
 <sup>2</sup>/s.
