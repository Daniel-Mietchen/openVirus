<p>Using D
 <sub>free</sub> as well as a time step (Δt = 0.5 s), the displacement of a freely diffusing particle follows a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation given by σ = sqrt(4D
 <sub>free</sub>Δt). Temporal confinement was introduced by generating a sub-trajectory using D
 <sub>conf</sub>. For the dwell time simulation, we generated random trajectories that run into a confinement region characterized by D
 <sub>conf</sub> with a diameter of 50–300 nm according to the size of SNA clusters from STORM measurements (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s018">S1 Movie</xref>). Confined regions were identified using the confinement probability I
 <sub>conf</sub> and the time the particle spends confined with I
 <sub>conf</sub> &gt; threshold was taken as the dwell time. D
 <sub>conf</sub> was varied as shown in
