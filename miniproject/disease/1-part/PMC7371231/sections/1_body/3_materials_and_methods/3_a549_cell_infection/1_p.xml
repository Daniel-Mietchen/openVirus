 <sup>5</sup> cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated 25 mm round glass slides. For infection experiments (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s002">S1 Fig</xref>), the cells where either incubated in serum-free medium for 30 min (control) or in DMEM supplemented with 100 ng/ml human EGF (R&amp;D Systems) for 90 min to remove EGFR from the cell surface. Cells were infected with IAV X-31 (MOI ~1) in infection medium (DMEM, 0.2% bovine serum albumine (BSA)) for 30 min before the medium was changed and the cells were further incubated for 8 h in infection medium. The cells were washed in pre-warmed PBS and fixed in freshly prepared 4% PFA (Alpha Aesar) for 10 min at room temperature. We controlled that our fixation protocol could successfully immobilize plasma membrane molecules in A549 cells (

After a 25 min fixation/blocking step in PBS supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% BSA, the cells were incubated with the primary antibody (anti influenza nucleoprotein (NP), Millipore) for 1 h. The cells were washed three times 10 min in PBS before further incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse, Alexa 555 conjugate, Life Technologies) for 1 h. Finally, the cells were washed in PBS, stained with DAPI (0,2 Î¼g/ml in PBS for 10 min) and mounted on standard microscope slides with Mowiol (Carl Roth). The slides where imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope. Ten overview images (20 x magnification) were acquired for each condition and nuclear NP signal was quantified using Cellprofiler [
