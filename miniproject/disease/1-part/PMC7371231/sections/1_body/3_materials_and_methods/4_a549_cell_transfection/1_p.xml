 <sup>5</sup> cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated 25 mm round glass slides. The cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EGFR-mEos3.2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers guidelines. EGFR-mEos3.2 was cloned from EGFR-GFP, a gift from Alexander Sorkin (Addgene plasmid # 32751). Using our transfection protocol, we tested the EGFR clustering at different expression levels. We observed that the cluster density per area, but not the cluster size was dependent on the expression level (
