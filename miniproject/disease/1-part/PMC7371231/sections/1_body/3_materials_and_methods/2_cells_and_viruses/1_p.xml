<p>A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) were kindly provided by Dr. Thorsten Wolff (Robert-Koch Institute Berlin, Germany). A549 cells were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were passaged every 3–4 days. The cells were not polarized. We refer to the dorsal and ventral membrane as the upper cell surface as well as the part of the cell attached to the substrate. One day prior to the experiment, the cells were detached from the cell culture flask using 0.5% Trypsin/EDTA for about 10 min. The cells were diluted in fresh DMEM and 3*10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated 25 mm round glass slides (Menzel, # 1.5). Influenza A (H3N2) X-31 was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day old chicken eggs (Lohmann Tierzucht GmbH, Germany) as described previously [

All chemicals if not otherwise stated where purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell culture media were purchased from Life Technologies. For the NA treatment, we use the Neuraminidase from
