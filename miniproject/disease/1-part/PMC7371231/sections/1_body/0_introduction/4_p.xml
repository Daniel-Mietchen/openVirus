<p>Over the last decades, electron microscopy has provided a detailed structural picture of isolated influenza virus particles [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, imaging and quantitative analysis of heterogeneous cellular structures and their dynamics at the nanoscale remains challenging. Super-resolution microscopy represents an excellent tool to study cellular organization at the scale of an infecting viral particle (&lt;100 nm) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Here, we combined two complementary approaches, which together provide a versatile toolbox to meet this challenge [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We used single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques known as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and (fluorescence) photoactivated localization microscopy ((f)PALM) together with live-cell stimulated emission depletion (STED) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] microscopy to image molecular organization and track single molecules within the plasma membrane of IAV host cells [
