<p>We quantitatively analyzed the spatial organization of IAV AFs as well as EGFR on the surface of human alveolar epithelial cells. We found that AFs are organized in virus-sized clusters featuring a density gradient that decreases from a dense central core to the periphery. Using their experimentally-determined characteristics, we used simulations to investigate their role in virus-cell interactions. These simulations are in good agreement with live-cell virus tracking experiments, and together, they suggest that the spatial organization of AFs largely influences virus-cell interactions during the early phase of virus infection. We further show that AF nanodomains overlap nonrandomly with EGFR clusters thereby promoting AF-mediated EGFR activation. Interestingly, our results further suggest that pre-existing EGFR clusters are responsible for IAV-mediated receptor activation. We provide a novel view on the initial events of influenza virus infection and offer new insights into the functional role of the spatial organization of cell surface AFs and receptors.</p>
