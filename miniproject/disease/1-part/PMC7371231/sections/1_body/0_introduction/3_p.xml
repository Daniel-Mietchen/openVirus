<p>After binding, IAVs enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis was shown to constitute the major [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since AFs cannot trigger endocytosis, an active signal-processing receptor must be engaged to allow viral entry. Receptor-tyrosine kinases were shown to be able to fulfill this function [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Specifically, it was shown that, among other receptor-tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was activated during and required for efficient IAV cell entry. However, how IAV finds and activates EGFR has remained speculative. While molecular and structural information is available for both HA-SA [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], much less is known about their spatial co-organization within the plasma membrane, and how it could enable EGFR activation during IAV cell infection.
