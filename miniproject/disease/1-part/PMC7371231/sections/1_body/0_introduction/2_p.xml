<p>The viral hemagglutinin (HA), a trimeric glycoprotein that covers ~ 90% of the viral surface, mediates the initial IAV-cell contact (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The most common AF for IAV is N-acetylneuraminic, or sialic, acid (SA), a highly abundant cell-surface glycan that within its glyosidic linkage encodes IAV species specificity. Human-pathogenic IAV strains preferentially bind α-2,6-linked SA, while avian-pathogenic viruses prefer to bind α-2,3-linked SA. This specificity can be attributed to the topology of the glycans, which more readily form contacts with receptor-binding domains of complementary HAs [

Although AFs are highly abundant, which could lead to stable adhesion, single-virus tracking showed that IAVs have some freedom to explore the cell surface [
