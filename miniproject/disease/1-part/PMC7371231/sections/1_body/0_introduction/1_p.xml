<p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause severe respiratory tract infections in humans, often leading to seasonal local epidemics as well as periodic global pandemics [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During cell binding, IAV engages with low affinity attachment factors (AFs) as well as functional receptors to trigger cell entry by endocytosis. However, little is known about the lateral co-organization of both at the scale of an infecting virus, and how their organization relates to their functional role during virus infection.
