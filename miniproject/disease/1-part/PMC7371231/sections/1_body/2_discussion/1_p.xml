<p>Understanding the initial phase of virus infection is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures such as adhesion inhibitors that catch viral particles before they can engage in the first virus-cell contact [

While these two steps are crucial for IAV infection, it remained largely speculative how the virus manages to form a multivalent cell contact while retaining flexibility to explore the plasma membrane and engage with a functional receptor. Here we used super-resolution microscopy to study the organization of virus-interacting molecules at the scale of the virus-cell interface. We found that glycan AFs and receptors are organized in nanoscale domains and provide a model for how cell binding can translate into receptor engagement and activation. Our findings are summarized schematically in
