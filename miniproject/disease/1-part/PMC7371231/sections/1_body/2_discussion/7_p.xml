<p>In summary, we identified a complex compartmentalization of the cellular plasma membrane in A549 cells with both of the primary IAV-binding molecules, sialylated AFs and functional receptors, organized in nanodomains. Such an organization was observed for other membrane proteins and might indicate a general organization principle of the plasma membrane (reviewed in [

Quantitative super-resolution microscopy has provided a versatile toolbox to study the structure-function relationship of the plasma membrane. Our study provides a first step in understanding the nanophysiology of virus infection. By relating organization to function within the virus-cell interface, our goal is to better understand how viruses use cellular structures. How membrane compartmentalization can modulate IAV cell and receptor binding as shown here will be complemented with functional studies investigating the involved signal activation in the future.
