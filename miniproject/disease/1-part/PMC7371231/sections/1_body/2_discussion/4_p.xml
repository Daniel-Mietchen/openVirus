<p>Having formed a stable interaction with its host cell, IAVs enter the cell by endocytosis. EGFR was shown to be activated during and promote IAV-cell entry [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but how IAV engages with EGFR remained unclear. We found that EGFR localizes in clusters which colocalize with AF nanodomains. Regarding our results and those of others (reviewed recently in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), the current view of the plasma membrane suggests a compartmentalization into highly heterogeneous nanodomains with different origin and function. Colocalization at the nanoscale is thus measured as spatial proximity or co-clustering. The observed overlap between IAV AF and receptor clusters thus suggests that the lateral organization of AFs and EGFR underlies similar but not identical principles. Importantly the observed organization would indeed allow IAV to bind EGFR while moving in and between AFs domains (
