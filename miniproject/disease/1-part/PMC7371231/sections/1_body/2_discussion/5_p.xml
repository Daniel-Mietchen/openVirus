<p>In the canonical activation model, EGFR binds its substrate EGF, undergoes dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation, thereby inducing a variety of signaling cascades [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, as shown here on A549 cells, an additional level of higher oligomeric EGFR clusters has been shown across different cell types. Their reported diameter ranges from 50 nm [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] over 100â€“300 nm [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] up to near micrometer sizes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], with molecule numbers between &lt;10 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] up to thousands [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Clustering was suggested to facilitate receptor activation which might play a role in tumor development [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further, the EGFR cluster size was shown to respond to activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggesting a lateral molecule redistribution. With respect to the clustered EGFR organization, we hypothesized two scenarios in which, during activation, EGFR either (1) assembles into activated clusters or (2) pre-existing clusters become activated. Hence, we tested the organization of EGFR under (un)stimulated conditions. While we observed a reduction of the clustered molecule fraction as well as the number of clusters per area upon EGF stimulation, an effect that was observed previously for Erb2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we did not detect a major redistribution in response to IAV attachment. This result speaks for the activation of pre-existing clusters and might also indicate a different activation mechanism. EGFR binds EGF with high affinity (nM), leading to fast EGFR activation (within 10 min [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) and internalization. IAV binds EGFR using sialylated glycans, a low affinity process that requires some degree of multivalency. Our colocalization experiments showed that IAVs also bind multiple EGFR clusters (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008656.s011">S10 Fig</xref>) indicating a different recruitment/activation mechanism. How IAV then eventually activates EGFR is still unclear and will be the objective of future investigation. What has been shown previously is that IAV-induced EGFR endocytosis is indeed slower compared to the EGF-induced activation, presumably due to the different mechanism of binding and activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Using STORM, we could not detect a change in cluster size and molecule composition following either stimulation. We hence conclude that intercluster spatial rearrangements below our resolution limit might eventually lead to cluster activation. Methods that are more sensitive to protein-protein distances below 20 nm such as FRET could be used to test this hypothesis.
