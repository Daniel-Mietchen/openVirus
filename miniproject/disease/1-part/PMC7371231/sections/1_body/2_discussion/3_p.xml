 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] revealed that after forming the initial cell contact, IAV particles explore the plasma membrane for on average 6 minutes before endocytosis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More recently, multicolor imaging of IAVs together with clathrin showed that this period is important for the induction of clathrin-dependent endocytosis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We performed single-virus tracking under conditions of limited endocytosis to restrict virus motion to the plasma membrane. We mostly found trajectories where random diffusion alternates with periods of spatial confinement. The estimated sizes of the confined regions was consistent with the area found for AF nanodomains using STORM. This result is in agreement with our basic hypothesis that virus plasma membrane motion is largely influenced by the local organization and density of available AFs. Although we cannot exclude that IAV confinement is induced by other factors such as mechanical trapping, our results allow a model to be formulated of how the clustered organization of AFs controls virus-cell binding early during infection.
