<p>From the illustration it becomes clear that microvilli are a dominant topographical feature of the dorsal side of the cell. However, due to their diameter, they are not involved in virus endocytosis. We thus concentrated our efforts on analyzing the area between the microvilli and could identify a population of differently sized AF nanodomains. Our virus-binding simulations indicated that such a clustered organization of AFs is advantageous and positively correlates with the efficiency of virus binding (

A heterogeneous cluster organization might thereby broaden the binding capability of the cell surface and effectively provide the virus particle with a range of binding times to explore the cell surface as it was suggested before for Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008656.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Such a binding mode could be particularly relevant for influenza viruses, which have a large morphological variability and a spike protein with strain-dependent affinity and specificity.
