<p id="Par16">A clinical triad of ‘fever, rashes and arthralgia’ is suggestive of CHIK fever. Fever is typically abrupt in onset and usually lasts for 4–5 days. It may be either high grade or low grade and can be associated with chills and rigor. In a study by the authors involving 150 patients with CHIK, fever subsided within 2 days in 43.8% of patients and in 3–5 days in 49.2% [
