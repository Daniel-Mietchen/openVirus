<p id="Par13">After subcutaneous inoculation through the bite of an infected mosquito, CHIKV disseminates through the lymph nodes and microvasculature. The entry of the virus into the lymph nodes is facilitated by the Langerhans cells. The primary sites of viral replication are the liver, spleen and lymph nodes, thus allowing an efficient viraemia. The acute phase of the illness involves viral replication followed by an efficient inflammatory response in the target tissues utilizing macrophages (the main component) along with neutrophils, lymphocytes and NK cells. The resulting rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at the infection site, local tissues and systemic circulation is responsible for the systemic manifestations, such as fever, myalgia and arthralgia [

Persistence of the virus or its products in the target cells and the resultant accumulation of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), contribute to persistent symptoms and chronic arthritis.
