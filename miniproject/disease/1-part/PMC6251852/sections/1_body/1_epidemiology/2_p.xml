<p id="Par8">The first recorded CHIK outbreak in India was in Kolkata in 1963. This was followed by epidemics in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in 1964–1965 and in Barsi in 1973 [

After a gap of 32 years, the virus re-emerged in 2006 and wreaked havoc in India by causing an epidemic that involved more than a million people across 16 states, ranging from the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat to more northern regions such as Delhi. A mutation found in the E1 protein of CHIKV (A226V) removes the requirement of this virus for cholesterol in the cell membrane (cholesterol dependence) for virus fusion, resulting in better viral uptake, replication and transmission by

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Additional adaptive mutations have also been identified in CHIKV that involve E2 and E3 substitutions; these enhance the initial infection of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> midgut by CHIKV leading to greater vector competence [
