<p id="Par7">Historically, CHIK was described as early as 1779 by Dr. David Bylon who himself had contracted the disease. The earliest detailed description of CHIK in the literature was given by Robinson [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and Lumsden [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] in 1952 regarding an outbreak in the Makonde plateau along the border of Tanzania. Outbreaks were subsequently reported from the Philippines (1954, 1956 and 1968), Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A distinctive feature of CHIKV is that it causes explosive outbreaks before apparently disappearing for several years to decades. Also, unlike dengue fever, with CHIK the dearth of asymptomatic infections leads to high attack rates which often overwhelms the health care system, as exemplified by the resurgence of CHIK in 2005 in the islands of Madagascar, Mauritius and Reunion Island [

 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic>,
 <italic> Ae. africanus</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It was subsequently introduced into Asia where it is transmitted from human to human mainly by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and, to a lesser extent, by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> through an urban transmission cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Humans act as vertebrate amplification hosts and reservoirs during epidemics, while monkeys, rodents and birds serve as reservoirs during the inter-epidemic periods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Four different lineages have been identified based on genotypic and antigenic characteristics: The West African lineage, the East, Central and South African (ECSA) lineage, the Asian lineage and the Indian Ocean (IO) lineages, with the latter being monophyletic descendants of the ECSA [
