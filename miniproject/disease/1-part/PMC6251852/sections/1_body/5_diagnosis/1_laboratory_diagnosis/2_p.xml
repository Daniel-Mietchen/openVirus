Also, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein, would show moderate to marked elevation in CHIK, unlike dengue and other viral fevers. Mild elevations in liver enzymes, such as like serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, are seen in CHIK infections. Similar patterns were observed by the authors in their study on 150 cases of CHIK in a tertiary care hospital [
