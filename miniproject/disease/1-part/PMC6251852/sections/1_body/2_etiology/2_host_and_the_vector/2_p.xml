<p id="Par12">The persistence of the CHIKV virus in urban cycleÂ is thought to be the result of the continuous introduction of CHIKV to immunologically naive populations. Vertical transmission from an infected mother to her infant has been described during the epidemic in the Reunion Islands. The greatest risk for this transmission appears to be during birth [

Possible explanations for this phenomenon seems to be variations in herd immunity, genomic alterations in the virus and ecological factors associated with urbanization, migration and deforestation. Outbreaks are most likely to occur in the post-monsoon period when the vector density is very high, a factor which accentuates the transmission.
