  <p>Generalized additive models-estimated relationships between dengue fever cases and influencing factors; 
   <bold>a</bold> Pearl River Delta (PRD), A1: Population density (Pop), A2: Urban land ratio (ULR), A3: Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), A4: Humidity (Hum), A5: Temperature (Temp), 
   <bold>b</bold> Border of Yunnan and Myanmar (BYM), B1, Urban land ratio (ULR), B2: Road density (Road), B3: Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), B4: Temperature (Temp), B5: Water land ratio (WLR), B6: Precipitation (Pre). The solid line shows the smooth fitting curve for the logarithm of dengue fever cases. The dashed line represents the 95% confidence intervals. The x-axis represents the actual values of the independent variables. The y-axis indicates the logarithm of dengue fever cases fitting values. Edf represents the estimated degrees of freedom. The y-axis is labelled s (a, edf), where a indicates the name of the variables and edf represents the estimated degrees of freedom of the smooth function, which is used to represent its relationship with dengue fever cases
