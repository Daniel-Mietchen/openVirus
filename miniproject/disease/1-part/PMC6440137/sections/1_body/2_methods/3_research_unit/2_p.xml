<p id="Par33">where 
 <italic>n</italic> is the number of grids in the study area, 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub> represent the number of DF cases in grids 
 <italic>i</italic> and 
 <italic>j</italic>, respectively, and 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> is the matrix of spatial weight. Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> is generally tested by the 
 <italic>Z</italic>-score/
 <italic>P</italic>-value, and the value varies from − 1 to 1. A higher Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> (larger 
 <italic>Z</italic>-score and proper 
 <italic>P</italic>-value) indicates greater similarity among attributes between adjacent spatial grids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which reveals that the DF epidemic is clustered in the region, whereas a low negative value indicates dissimilarity between adjacent grids and shows that the DF epidemic is discretely distributed in the region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this study, Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-scores of the DF cases with different grid sizes were used to assess the optimal grid scales of the regional DF epidemic. Spatial autocorrelation analysis above was performed using ArcGIS 10.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).
