<p id="Par36">The first step is to build the single factor model by using the spline smoothing function of the GAM, and then the goodness of fit of single factors is statistically analyzed. Next, the variables that did not pass the significance test in the single factor analysis are removed. Then, variables with strong collinearity are sorted into groups, and one variable in each group and other variables without strong collinearity are selected to build the GAM until all permutations and combinations are considered. Finally, the optimal GAM is selected according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), with a better model corresponding to smaller AIC values [
