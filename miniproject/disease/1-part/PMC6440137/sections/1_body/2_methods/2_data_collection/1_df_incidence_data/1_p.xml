<p id="Par30">Records of observed DF cases from 2010 to 2014 were obtained from the China Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, and the data included age, gender, occupation, date of onset, and type of diagnosis. In this study, only local cases were used to analyse the spatial-temporal characteristics of the local epidemic and the relationship between the pattern of the epidemic and local variables (environmental and socioeconomic). The DF cases were spatially located with geocoding (
