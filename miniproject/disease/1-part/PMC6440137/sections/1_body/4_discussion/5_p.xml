<p id="Par48">As for the regional environmental factors, the overall vegetation coverage in the BYM is relatively high. Therefore, the NDVI fitting curve of the more serious epidemic areas is shifted to the left compared with that in the PRD. Furthermore, the terrain within the BYM is complex, including large numbers of mountains and valleys. Therefore, regional differences and vertical changes in climate are obvious [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The coefficient of variation of the environmental factors in the BYM is also slightly higher than that in the PRD. Meanwhile, the risk of DF tends to be higher in Dehong and Xishuangbanna Prefectures due to their higher annual average Temp and Pre, thus providing a favorable living environment for the
