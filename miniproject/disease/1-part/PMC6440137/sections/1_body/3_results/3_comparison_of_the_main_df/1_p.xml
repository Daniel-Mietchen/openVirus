<p id="Par41">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the nonlinear characteristics between the DF epidemic and the independent variables were obvious. In terms of the PRD, the DF epidemic was more serious in areas (grids) with a higher socioeconomic status, especially in the areas with 440 &lt; Pop &lt; 3500 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A1) and ULR &gt; 0.4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A2), while the DF epidemic tended to be stable in areas with a Pop &gt; 3500 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A1). Compared with Pop and ULR, the nonlinear characteristics between environmental factors and the DF epidemic were more obvious. Among the factors, an ‘M’ relationship was observed between NDVI and the DF epidemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A3), and the DF epidemic was serious when the NDVI was between 0.17 and 0.76, especially from 0.17 to 0.4. Similar to the NDVI, Hum also had an ‘M’ relationship with DF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A4), and the DF epidemic was relatively serious when Hum in the region was 79.2–82.5%. In contrast to the pattern observed for the above factors, the DF epidemic showed a clear “break” when the Temp of the region was 19–23 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A5), while the DF epidemic was more severe when Temp was below 18.5 °C (limited distribution) or above 23.7 °C (wider distribution).
