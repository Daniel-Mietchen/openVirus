<p id="Par43">In terms of spatial distribution, Guangzhou-Foshan, as well as Dongguan and Shenzhen, were areas with serious DF epidemics in the PRD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). These areas appeared to have high ULR (&gt; 0.4), high Pop (&gt; 430), and moderate NDVI (0.17 &lt; NDVI &lt; 0.76). In addition, DF epidemics were more serious if the Hum was moderate (approximately 79.5% or 81.5%) and the Temp was higher than 23.7 °C. In comparison, DF epidemics in the BYM were relatively scattered throughout the Dehong and Xishuangbanna Prefectures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). These areas have ULRs ranging from 0 to 0.5, developed road networks (road density &gt; 2 km/km
 <sup>2</sup>), and moderate NDVIs (0.39 &lt; NDVI &lt; 0.61). DF epidemics were more acute in areas with Temp &gt; 17.8 °C, Pre at moderate levels (170–190 mm), or water bodies (ratio of approximately 0.15–0.2).
