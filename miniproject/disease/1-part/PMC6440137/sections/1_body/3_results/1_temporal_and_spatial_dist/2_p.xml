<p id="Par38">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> lists the Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> values of the DF cases at different grid scales in the PRD and BYM, which were calculated by Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). The PRD showed better clustering of DF epidemic cases at the 4 km × 4 km grid scale, whereas the BYM showed better clustering at the 3 km × 3 km scale. Furthermore, all Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> values in the PRD were greater than those in the BYM, which indicated that the DF epidemic of the PRD was highly aggregated, while that of the BYM was relatively decentralized. In terms of the spatial distribution mapped in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, the DF cases in the PRD presented an aggregative distribution cantered in the Guangzhou-Foshan region, whereas cases in the BYM were mainly concentrated in Dehong and Xishuangbanna Prefectures. These results demonstrate that DF cases in the BYM and the PRD showed significant characteristics of spatial aggregation.
