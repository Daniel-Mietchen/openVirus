<p id="Par40">Regarding the variance explained by the single factor in the optimal GAM (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), socioeconomic factors explained more of the variance (&gt; 54%) than environmental factors (&lt; 54%). Among the socioeconomic factors, Pop and ULR explained the greatest variance in the DF epidemic in the PRD, whereas the ULR, followed by road density, explained the greatest variance in the DF epidemic in the BYM. For environmental conditions, NDVI ranked first in the two regions, followed by Hum-Temp (PRD) and Temp-WLR-Pre (BYM). These results show that the factors affecting the DF epidemic were generally similar but presented slight differences between the PRD and BYM.
