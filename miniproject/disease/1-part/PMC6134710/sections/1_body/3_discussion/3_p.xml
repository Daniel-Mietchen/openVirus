<p id="Par28">In addition to CHIKV risk assessment, vector competence for DENV-2 transmission was also evaluated. The reason DENV-2 was chosen for the vector competence study was related to the increasing concern that a new serotype will arrive in Madeira. Dengue secondary infection might lead to severe clinical symptoms and potential fatalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our results underline a significantly higher dissemination efficiency of DENV-2 in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Funchal when comparing to Paúl do Mar. However, we observed no significant differences in transmission rate between the two populations or in the number of virus particles in mosquito saliva. This suggests that higher dissemination of DENV-2 in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> may not be correlated with the higher transmission in saliva. It would be interesting to verify if this result can be found with another serotype [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> densities favourable to arbovirus transmission as illustrated by the 2012 dengue outbreak caused by DENV-1. Funchal was the central hotspot for DENV-1 transmission, and no DENV-1 cases were observed in Paúl do Mar [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similar viral midgut infection and dissemination rates were observed in other studies with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from the Americas, Australia and, surprisingly, from Africa, even using different methodologies than the one used in this study [
