<p id="Par17">Two 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from Madeira were used in vector competence assays: the Funchal population, collected in the major urban area and island’s capital city, and Paúl do Mar population collected in the most western point of the species distribution on the island, 
 <italic>c.</italic>42 km away from Funchal, and considered a rural area. Mosquito eggs were collected in 2014 using widely distributed ovitraps [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and hatched in insectaries. The larvae were split as 200–300 individuals per pan and fed with yeast tablets. Emerging adults were maintained in cages at 28 ± 1 °C with a 14 h light/10 h dark photocycle, 80% relative humidity, and supplied with a 10% sucrose solution 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The F1 generation was used for experimental infections.
