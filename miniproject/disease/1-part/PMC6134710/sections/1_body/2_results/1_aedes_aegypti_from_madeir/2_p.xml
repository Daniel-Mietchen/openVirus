<p id="Par23">To measure the ability of CHIKV to cross the mosquito midgut barrier, dissemination rate (DR) was assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 14 dpi. According to the results, 100% DR was reached at 6 dpi for the Paúl do Mar population and 14 dpi for the Funchal population. No difference of DR was detected between the two populations [Chi-square test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; 3 dpi (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.29, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.59); 6 dpi (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.08, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.30); 9 dpi (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.02, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.31)]. The intensity of viral dissemination was evaluated by estimating the number of viral particles in head homogenates. Virus in heads was detectable from 3 dpi in both populations. The number of viral particles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) varied significantly throughout the time course in both populations [Kruskal-Wallis test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; Funchal (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 21.80, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 3, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001); Paúl do Mar (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 12.72, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 3, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005)]. When taking into account sequential method of Bonferroni, allowing to adjust the significance level of each test to the number of tests run, both 
 <italic>P</italic>-values remain significant. Significant differences were found at 6 dpi between the two populations (Mann-Whitney U-test: 
 <italic>Z</italic> = 2.62, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.009). The maximum number of CHIKV was detected at 6 dpi with 5.77 ± 0.53 log
 <sub>10</sub> ffu/ml for the Funchal strain and 5.42 ± 0.75 log
 <sub>10</sub> ffu/ml for the Paúl do Mar strain.
