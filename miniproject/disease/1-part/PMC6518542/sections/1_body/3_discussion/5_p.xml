<p>Understanding the seasonal pattern and the climatic drivers of influenza virus is of significant importance for predicting epidemic timing and optimizing interventions. Influenza vaccine has not been included in the national immunisation programme in China and the average national vaccination coverage was just around 1.5–2.2% between 2004 and 2014 [

Differences in seasonality by subtype/lineage indicated that except for the winter influenza epidemics, the summer–autumn peak of A/H3N2 should also be considered in vaccination campaign in Panzhihua. Moreover, since the influenza B strain included in TIV did not match the dominant circulating strain in five of the nine vaccination years, it is suggested to use quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) to provide broad protection against all circulating lineages. Our study found some statistically significant changes in positive rates for individual subtypes/lineages since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Therefore, year-round influenza surveillance is needed to be strengthened to monitor on-going changes.
