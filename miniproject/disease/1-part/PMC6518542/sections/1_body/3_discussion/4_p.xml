<p>It is suggested that novel antigenic variants might interrupt the circulation of the resident viruses, possibly through competition for susceptible hosts [
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We found some statistically significant changes in positive rates for individual subtypes/lineages during the pandemic and post-pandemic years. However, periodicity changes were not detected for influenza virus in Panzhihua, which was identified in Chengdu in southwestern China (unpublished data). The interaction between the novel pandemic strain and other resident influenza viruses, virus virulence variation and host susceptibility might be related to the changes in positive rates of influenza subtypes/lineages.
