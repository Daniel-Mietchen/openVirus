<p>There are some limitations in this study. First, our data focused only on patients with ILI from sentinel hospitals. A random sample of people with influenza-like symptoms from both hospitals and the community might be more appropriate. Second, the relationship between seasonal activity of influenza virus and some other seasonal drivers, such as virus interaction, host susceptibility, social behaviour and so on, remains to be verified. Third, virus culture and rRT-PCR assay might have different sensitivity of influenza virus detection [
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the subtype/lineage distribution and seasonality are unlikely to be changed [
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our wavelet analysis results showed that the periodicity of influenza subtypes/lineages were consistent during 2006â€“2015 in Panzhihua, except for seasonal A/H1N1 which were not detected after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
