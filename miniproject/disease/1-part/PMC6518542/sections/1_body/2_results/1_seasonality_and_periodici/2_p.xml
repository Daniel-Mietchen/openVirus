<p>To describe the seasonality of each subtype/lineage in Panzhihua, 184, 40, 214, 87 and 186 influenza cases of A/H3N2, seasonal A/H1N1, A/H1N1pdm09, Victoria and Yamagata were analysed (
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Individual subtypes and lineages generally demonstrated the annual or semi-annual cycles. During 2006–2015, A/H3N2 exhibited an annual cycle with a peak in August–September. Wavelet analysis showed that the annual cycle was statistically significant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2a</xref> and Fig. S1). Both annual and semi-annual cycles were observed for seasonal A/H1N1 during 2006–2009 and this virus was not detected after 2009 (Fig. S1). A/H1N1pdm09 emerged in Panzhihua in October 2009 and demonstrated an annual cycle (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with a peak in November (Fig. S1) 2009. During the post-pandemic years, A/H1N1pdm09 generally demonstrated an annual cycle with a peak occurring in January–February, which was statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) during 2013–2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2a</xref> and Fig. S1). Victoria lineage exhibited an annual cycle (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with a peak in March in most surveillance years (
