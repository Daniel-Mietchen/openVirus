<p>Overall, 59.4% and 40.3% of influenza-positive cases during the 10-year surveillance were type A and B, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Compared with those in the pre-pandemic period, statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) decrease of positive rates in the pandemic was observed for seasonal A/H1N1 and Yamagata, while an increase of positive rate was seen for A/H3N2. Similar positive rates between pre-pandemic and pandemic years were observed for Victoria. After the pandemic, seasonal A/H1N1 was not detected in Panzhihua and the positive rate of A/H1N1pdm09 became significantly lower than in the pandemic (
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was not any difference in positive rates of Victoria and Yamagata between the post-pandemic and the pre-pandemic seasons, while the positive rates of A/H3N2 in the post-pandemic years were significantly higher than in the pre-pandemic period. The predominant influenza subtypes/lineages observed in Panzhihua are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. There were at least two subtypes/lineages co-circulating each year. One of influenza A subtypes or one of B lineages predominated in most years, except in 2012 and 2013 when an influenza A subtype and a B lineage were codominant. Influenza A subtypes generally co-circulated in most years, although A/H3N2 were not detected in 2008 and 2010 and A/H1N1pdm09 were not detected in 2015. Two influenza B lineages co-circulated in many years, except in 2013–2015 when Victoria were not detected and in 2010 and 2012 when Yamagata were not detected.
