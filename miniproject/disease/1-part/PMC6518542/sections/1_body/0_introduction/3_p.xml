<p>Currently, influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (A/H3N2) and the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A/H1N1pdm09), as well as two influenza B lineages, B/Victoria/2/1987-like (Victoria) and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like (Yamagata), co-circulate in human population [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A/H1N1pdm09 emerged in 2009 and caused the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. After the pandemic, A/H1N1pdm09 replaced the pre-existing seasonal influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (seasonal A/H1N1) [

 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The epidemic peaks of influenza type A and B have been reported to coincide less frequently in the tropics/subtropics than in temperate regions [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, epidemiological studies on the seasonality of individual influenza A subtypes and B lineages are limited; and the relationship between epidemics of individual subtypes/lineages and climate conditions is poorly understood. Moreover, it has been 9 years since the 2009 pandemic but the epidemiological characteristics of A/H1N1pdm09 during the post-pandemic period and the impact of the pandemic on the seasonal activity of the resident influenza subtypes/lineages remain to be explored.
