<p>Epidemiological analyses and experimental studies have indicated that cold temperature and low levels of absolute humidity (AH) are strongly associated with influenza epidemics in temperate regions [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the tropics/subtropics, however, the climatic drivers of influenza epidemics are inconsistent. Increased seasonal activity of influenza virus was reported to be associated with higher humidity and/or precipitation in some areas, while no significant association or contradictory effects were observed in other locales [
