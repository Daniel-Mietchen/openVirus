<p>Type A and B influenza viruses have caused significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden worldwide [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Influenza virus has an annual cycle, with a peak occurring in winter in temperate regions [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, seasonal activity of influenza virus in the tropics/subtropics has not been well characterised. The annual or semi-annual cycles, year-round activity, as well as periodicity transitions have been identified [
