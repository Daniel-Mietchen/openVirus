<p>The objectives of this study were to characterise and compare the temporal distribution of influenza subtypes/lineages during the pre-pandemic, pandemic and post-pandemic years, as well as to examine the relationships between influenza epidemics and meteorological factors in a subtropical city in detail. Since the diverse seasonal patterns of influenza virus in the tropics/subtropics, analysing surveillance data with greater spatial resolution (i.e. at the city level rather than on a national scale) is important for understanding viral global persistence and for developing local prevention and control measures. In this study, epidemiological and virologic data were collected during 2006–2015 in Panzhihua. Panzhihua is located in Sichuan Province in subtropical southwestern China. It covers an area of 7434 km
 <sup>2</sup> and is the first industrial city in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The seasonality and distribution of A/H3N2, seasonal A/H1N1, A/H1N1pdm09, Victoria and Yamagata were characterised; and the relationship between seasonal activity of influenza virus and climate variables was assessed. We also calculated the frequency of influenza B vaccination mismatches.
