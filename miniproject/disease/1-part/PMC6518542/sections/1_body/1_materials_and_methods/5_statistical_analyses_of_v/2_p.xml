<p>Correlations of seasonal activity of influenza subtypes/lineages with monthly mean temperature, VP and RH, as well as monthly total amount of precipitation and sunshine hours were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation. Stepwise multiple linear regression models were also used to avoid possible collinearity.
