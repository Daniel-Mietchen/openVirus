<p>Wavelet analysis which has been used previously for various infectious diseases data [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was applied to characterise seasonality. Wavelet analysis is able to identify periodicities in time-series data and help track variations in periodicity over time [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The sowas package [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] implemented in MATLAB R2016b (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) was applied to conduct wavelet analysis. To take into account the increase in the number of specimens and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, time series were square root-transformed prior to analysis, according to previous studies [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].
