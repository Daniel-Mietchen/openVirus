<p>Weather conditions during 2016 seemed more favourable for mosquitoes and arboviral transmission than in 2014 because of the more abundant rainfall and higher humidity. Yet, contrastingly, the only change in mosquito density observed in 2016 occurred in one of the untreated communities (Arboleda), in which densities were lower than in 2014. Longterm data (since 2013) show that mosquito density in that particular location has decreased over time (data not shown). The results also seem to indicate that ZIKV detections in that location were less clustered in time (weeks) than CHIKV detections in 2014, when average mosquito density was 30% higher. Significant effects of rain and humidity on

 <italic>et al</italic>.,
