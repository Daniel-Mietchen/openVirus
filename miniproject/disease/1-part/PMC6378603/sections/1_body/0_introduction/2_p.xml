<p>The best strategy for the prevention of epidemics of these arboviruses, other than the use of effective and safe vaccines, is to maintain 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> densities below the minimum number of mosquitoes required for local transmission, or below a mosquito density threshold (Focks 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). The policy of waiting for a declaration of a dengue epidemic in order to implement 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> control has not worked well in the past. Modelling studies suggest that an introduced arbovirus can cause an outbreak if the number of mosquitoes exceeds a threshold or critical level and, in turn, the number of mosquitoes required to cause an outbreak depends on herd immunity, ambient temperature and the frequency of virus introductions (Focks 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Generally, fewer mosquitoes are required if herd immunity is low or non‐existent, temperature is high, and viruses are frequently introduced. The introduction of CHIKV and ZIKV into naïve human populations in the Americas provides an opportunity to learn more about the mosquito density threshold required to prevent rampant outbreaks. The DENVs have been circulating in the Americas for decades and are hyperendemic in many countries (Gubler, 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and hence it is more difficult to establish such thresholds as populations have varying levels of herd immunity. A density threshold that is established according to newly circulating arboviruses is expected to represent a conservative estimation of the maximum mosquito densities required to prevent DENV outbreaks in endemic areas because the densities of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> necessary to cause outbreaks are likely to be higher.
