<p>A longitudinal study of the impact of mass trapping using AGO traps on the density of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in southern Puerto Rico, begun in October 2011, provided an opportunity to document and compare mosquito densities and incidences of arboviruses in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> following the invasions of CHIKV in 2014 and ZIKV in 2016. The AGO trap is a black plastic container with a volume of approximately 19 L that contains 10 L of water and a small hay packet as an attractant, and a sticky glue board that captures gravid females of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> seeking a place to lay eggs (Mackay 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Recently, the surveillance trap‚Äêbased presence of CHIKV in female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and mosquito density were found to be 10 times higher in adjacent communities without AGO control traps than in communities with such traps (Barrera 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). An investigation into the prevalence of CHIKV antibodies in the residents of these communities revealed 50% protection in areas with mass trapping (Lorenzi 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The aims of the present study were to elucidate whether 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> densities were associated with ZIKV infection rates in female adult mosquitoes, how differences in weather parameters between years might influence mosquito densities and the presence of arboviruses, and whether natural infection rates of mosquitoes with CHIKV and ZIKV differed in the same locations with and without vector control.
