<p>In total, 6591 and 6585 trap‐week mosquito samples were collected across all four sites in 2014 and 2016, respectively. The total number of female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> collected was 40 220 in 2014 and 37 242 in 2016. The GEE analyses did not detect significant differences between years in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> density (Wald χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.29; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) or RH (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 3.6; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.058), but did find significant effects of site (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 577.1; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), the interaction years*sites (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 46.8; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), rainfall (Wald χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.29; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) and temperature (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 7.6; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The interaction of years*sites was significant, indicating that the density of female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in Arboleda was lower in 2016 than in 2014, but similar at the other three sites in 2014 and 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figs 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Mosquito densities in untreated sites were 5.5–9.5 times greater than in treated sites (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Average densities in treated sites were below two females/trap/week throughout the study periods (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
