<p>Accumulated rain during the second and third weeks before sampling significantly influenced mosquito density, although increases in mosquito density following rainfall in treated areas were small (Figs

 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The results of a GLM analysis comparing rainfall per week between years (χ

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and sites (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 11.5; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) were significant. The year 2016 was wetter than 2014 and the greatest rainfall occurred in Villodas in both years (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figs 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The interaction term years*sites was not significant (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.5; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Daily air temperature varied significantly among sites (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 37.6; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but not between years (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) and the interaction term was not significant (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.7; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Daily RH varied significantly between years (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 18.4; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), suggesting that 2016 was more humid than 2014 and reflecting more rainfall in 2016. Relative humidity also varied among sites (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 14.7; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and the interaction term was not significant (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 2.0; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Arboleda showed the lowest air temperature and Villodas demonstrated the highest RH in both years (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Rainfall recorded during the first part of the year was lower in 2014 than in 2016 at all three meteorological stations (Figs 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
