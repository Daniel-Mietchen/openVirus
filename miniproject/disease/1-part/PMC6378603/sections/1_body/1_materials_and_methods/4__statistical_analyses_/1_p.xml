<p>Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to test the null hypotheses of no statistical differences in the density of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females/trap/week between years (2014, 2016), between sites (two untreated, two treated), and their interaction (years*sites). The following weather variables were also included in the analysis: accumulated rainfall (2 and 3 weeks before sampling), and average daily temperature and RH (during the 3 weeks before sampling). Data for accumulated rainfall in the second and third weeks before sampling were used because rainfall within 7 days of sampling should not have any impact on the number of adult mosquitoes captured other than indirect effects mediated by RH on adult survival. For temperature and RH, the average of each during the previous 3 weeks was used as these variables may influence the longevity and survival of adult mosquitoes. The test used a negative binomial distribution of mosquito abundance, log link and autoregression order one for repeated measures. Changes in weather variables (weekly rainfall, average daily temperature or RH) between years, sites and their interaction were evaluated using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a normal distribution and identity link. For the latter tests (GLM), untransformed weather variables describing weekly (rainfall) or daily (temperature, RH) values were used. PooledInfRate Version 4.0 was used to calculate and compare virus infection rates (IRs) or, more properly, viral RNA detection from mosquito pools (Biggerstaff, 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Infection rates were reported as per 1000 mosquitoes. Any pair of IRs (e.g. CHIKV vs. ZIKV IR per site) was considered not significantly different (Î± = 0.05) if the confidence interval of the difference included zero. A vector index (VI) (Jones 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) was used to calculate the expected number of infected mosquitoes/trap/week as the product of the proportion of infected mosquitoes multiplied by the average mosquito density multiplied by 1000.
