  <p>Evolution of the pathogenicity of influenza virus as a function of dietary selenium intake in mice. Influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 (H3N2) virus was inoculated in mice that were previously fed with selenium adequate or deficient diet for four weeks. This virus induces mild pneumonitis in selenium-adequate mice but a severe lung pathology in selenium deficient mice [

   <xref rid="B124-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Various parameters, including the time of lung inflammation, the number of immune cells, the nucleotide mutations of the isolated influenza viruses, the oxidation status of glutathione (reduced/oxidized), the GPX and SOD enzymatic activities in the lung, were evaluated and compared between selenium adequate (left column) and deficient (middle column) mice. The low and high virulent H3N2 viruses are represented in blue and yellow respectively. The virus recovered from selenium-deficient mice was inoculated in selenium-adequate mice to evaluate its pathogenicity. Consistent with the observations made with coxsackie virus, the mutations of the influenza viral genome increased the pathogenicity of the virus, which can now induce severe lung pathology even in selenium adequate mice [
