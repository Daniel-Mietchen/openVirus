  <p>Gene structures and amino acid sequences of the selenoproteins present in the viral genomes of molluscum contagiosum virus subtype 1 (MCV1) (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) and of fowlpox virus (FPV) (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) in comparison with their respective human orthologs, GPX1 and GPX4 [
   <xref rid="B175-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>,
   <xref rid="B176-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Location of the typical features of a selenoprotein gene (coding sequence, TGA codon and SECIS element) in human 
   <italic>GPX1</italic> gene in comparison with those of MCV1 
   <italic>GPX</italic> gene. For clarity reasons, the introns of human gene have been removed, but the position of splice sites is indicated by a dashed bar. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Amino acid sequence alignment of human GPX1 (P07203) with MCV1 GPX (Q98234). Identical and similar amino acids in both sequences are highlighted in black and grey, respectively. The selenocysteine amino acid (U, in one-letter code) is highlighted in yellow. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Comparison of the location of selenoprotein gene features in human 
   <italic>GPX4</italic> gene with those of FPV 
   <italic>GPX</italic> and Canarypox virus (CPV) 
   <italic>GPX</italic> genes. The replacement of the TGA (selenocysteine) codon by a TGC (Cysteine) one in CPV 
   <italic>GPX</italic> gene is indicated in green. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Amino acid sequence alignment of human GPX4 (P36969) with FPV GPX (Q70H87) and CPV GPX (Q6VZR0). In-frame SECIS elements in the C-terminal region of FPV GPX are highlighted in red.
