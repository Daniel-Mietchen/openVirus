  <p>Balance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their scavenging systems in human. This equilibrium can be unbalanced during viral infections, resulting in oxidative stress. The main ROS producing systems include the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, the phagocytic cell NAPDH oxidases (PHOX), the NADPH oxidases/dual oxidases (NOX/DUOX) and the xanthine oxidase (XO). The main ROS scavenging systems include the catalase, the superoxide dismutases (SODs), the peroxiredoxins (PRXs), the glutathione peroxidases (GPXs), the thioredoxins (TRXs) and the balance between reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG). The viruses for which an oxidative stress has been reported are herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), influenza viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [
