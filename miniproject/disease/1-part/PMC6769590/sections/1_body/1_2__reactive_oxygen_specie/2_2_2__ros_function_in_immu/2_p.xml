<p>In addition to microbicidal activity, ROS also act as signaling mediators during cell death/apoptosis but also in processes that control cellular proliferation and differentiation. The family of NADPH oxidases (NOX) and Dual Oxidases (DUOX), referred to as NOX/DUOX, are homologs to PHOX and expressed in a variety of tissues, including colon, kidney, thyroid gland, testis, salivary glands, airways and lymphoid organs. A clear role for cytoplasmic ROS generated by NOX2 as well as DUOX1 has been shown in T cell receptor signaling as well as downstream activation and differentiation of T cells [
