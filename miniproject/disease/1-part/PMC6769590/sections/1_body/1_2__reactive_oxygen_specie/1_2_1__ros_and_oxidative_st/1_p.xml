<p>The term “reactive oxygen species” (ROS) refers to series of side-products derived from molecular oxygen (O
 <sub>2</sub>) generated during mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in every respiring cells (

 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. ROS consist of radical and non-radical oxygen species formed by the partial reduction of molecular oxygen. They include superoxide anion radical (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•−</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), and hydroxyl radical (HO
 <sup>•</sup>). At low concentration, ROS are also essential molecules in physiological processes such as cell signaling, proliferation, tumor suppression, and maintenance of the immune system. Oxidative stress arises when an imbalance between ROS and the cellular antioxidant defense system occurs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-02101-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This could be due to an increase in ROS levels or a decrease in the cellular antioxidant capacity. Oxidative stress leads to direct or indirect ROS-mediated damage of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, and this phenomenon has been implicated in many pathological conditions including carcinogenesis [
