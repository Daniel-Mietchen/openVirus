<p>The production of ROS can be assessed indirectly either by using redox-sensitive dyes that are oxidized by ROS into quantifiable fluorescent products, such as 20,70-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA) or by quantification of cellular oxidation products such as oxidized DNA (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine), lipids (malondialdehyde, F2-isoprostane, 7-ketocholesterol, and 7-hydroxycholesterol), proteins (carbonyl, 4-hydroxynonenal or glycated oxidation products). Many enzymatic assays are also available to evaluate the antioxidant function of the organisms [
