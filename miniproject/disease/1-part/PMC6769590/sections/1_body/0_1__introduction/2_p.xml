<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during viral infections with both beneficial and deleterious consequences for the cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-02101-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The viruses associated with ROS production are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and influenza viruses [
