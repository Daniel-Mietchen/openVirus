<p>HIV genome is highly compact and contains three genes encoding viral structural proteins (
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic>), two genes for essential regulatory elements (
 <italic>tat</italic> and 
 <italic>rev</italic>) and at least four genes encoding accessory regulatory proteins (
 <italic>nef</italic>, 
 <italic>vpr</italic>, 
 <italic>vpu</italic> and 
 <italic>vif</italic>). As in any retrovirus, the RNA viral genome is reverse-transcribed in dsDNA that is then integrated in the host genome by the viral integrase. HIV-1 infects immune cells that harbor the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor belonging to the chemokine receptor family (CCR5 and CXCR4) [
 <xref rid="B126-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Therefore, cells infected by HIV-1 are CD4 T-lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. The replication but also the latency of the virus is extremely variable from one cell type to another.
