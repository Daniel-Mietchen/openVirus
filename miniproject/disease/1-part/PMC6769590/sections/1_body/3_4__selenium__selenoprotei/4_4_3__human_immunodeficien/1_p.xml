<p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an enveloped, linear, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic> (Group VI), genus 
 <italic>Lentivirus</italic>. Two types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2 [
 <xref rid="B126-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Given that HIV-1 is more virulent and more infective than HIV-2, HIV-1 has spread worldwide while HIV-2 is mostly confined to West Africa [

 <xref rid="B126-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. HIV affects more than 35 million people worldwide and causes the death of about 1.5 million patients per year (

HIV infection is now considered as a chronic disease that requires intensive treatment and can present a variable clinical course. No vaccine is available until now, but an effective medication in decreasing the viral load and increasing the number of CD4 T-lymphocytes has been developed and is referred to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [
 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. This treatment consists in the combination of three or more drugs that target different aspects of HIV replication [
