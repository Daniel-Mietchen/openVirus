<p>The field awaits further investigations to understand the role of selenium and selenoproteins during HIV infection at the molecular level. The only 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data available reported a modification of the pattern of selenoprotein expression in response to HIV infection in lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="B142-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] but these experiments were performed before the complete characterization of the selenoproteome. The impact of selenium status on viral genome mutations and in particular the shift to more virulent viruses has not yet been tested for HIV as it has been done for coxsackie and influenza.
