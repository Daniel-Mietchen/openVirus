<p>Lentiviruses are characterized by a long incubation period after the primo infection that is highly variable from one patient to another. During this time, humans infected with HIV are under chronic oxidative stress. The redox status of the patient is strongly disturbed in HIV infected patients as revealed by the decrease of antioxidant defense (selenium, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase) and the increase in ROS production (hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde, and clastogenic factors) [

 <italic>In vitro</italic>, increasing oxidative stress enhances the replication of HIV through the activation of NF-kB. Several mechanisms have been reported to explain the cellular enhancement of ROS production in HIV infection. Most of them imply the following viral proteins: Gp120, Tat, Nef, Vpr, and Retrotranscriptase (RT), as reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A dramatic consequence of this chronic oxidative stress is the fatal decrease in the number of CD4 T-cells by apoptosis, and ultimately a failure of the immune system leading to death.
