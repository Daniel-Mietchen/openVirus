<p>The work from Beckâ€™s laboratory extended this novel concept that host nutritional status (especially selenium deficiency) is an important virulence factor in a viral family other than enteroviruses, as shown in

 <xref rid="B124-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Indeed, a rapid change in the pathogenicity of the virus in selenium deficient host has been also reported for influenza virus similarly to what was found for coxsackie virus. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-02101-f004">Figure 4</xref>, mice were fed with a diet either deficient or adequate in selenium for 4 weeks. Then, influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 (H3N2), a strain that induces mild pneumonitis in normal mice, was inoculated to both groups of mice. Interestingly, at all-time points post-infection a clear difference in pathology was observed between the two groups of mice [

 <xref rid="B124-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The virus was much more virulent in selenium deficient mice, although with a similar virus titer than the selenium adequate mice. In addition, the sequencing of the HA, NA and M genes of viruses isolated from selenium-adequate and selenium-deficient mice demonstrated a strong impact of selenium status on virus mutation.
