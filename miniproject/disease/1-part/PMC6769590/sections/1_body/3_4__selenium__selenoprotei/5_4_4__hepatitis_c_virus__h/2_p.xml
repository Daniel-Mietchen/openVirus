<p>The infection by HCV is another well-documented example of virus-induced generation of ROS. The nucleocapsid protein of HCV, and to a lesser extent NS3, NS5A, E1, E2 and NS4B, are involved in generating oxidative stress in the liver [

In parallel, the plasma levels of selenium together with erythrocyte GPX activities were significantly lower in HCV-infected patients than in healthy controls. An inverse correlation of selenium levels with viral load was also observed [
