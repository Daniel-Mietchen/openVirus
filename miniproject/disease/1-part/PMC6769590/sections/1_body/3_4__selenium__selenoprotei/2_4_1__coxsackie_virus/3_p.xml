 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-02101-f003">Figure 3</xref> the work from Beck and co-authors showed that a non-virulent stain of CVB3 (designated CVB3/0) that do not lead to myocarditis, although replicating, is able to evolve in a virulent strain when inoculated in selenium deficient mice [
