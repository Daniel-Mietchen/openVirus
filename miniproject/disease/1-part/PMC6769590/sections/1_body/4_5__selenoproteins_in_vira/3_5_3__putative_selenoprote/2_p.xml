<p>Perhaps, the most advanced study concerns a putative GPX protein coded in the third reading frame of the envelope (Env) gene of HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="B241-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. Indeed, it contains the typical catalytic triad selenocysteine (U), Glutamine (Q) and Tryptophan (W) and this putative HIV-GPX protein has been predicted to adopt the overall GPX fold, as deduced from computerized calculations [
 <xref rid="B233-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. In addition, it appears that the HIV-GPX gene is conserved in laboratory strains of HIV-1, as well as in long-term non-progressor isolates, but most of HIV isolates from patients with progressive disease presented deleterious mutations (mostly premature stop codons). In order to grasp the cellular function of this putative HIV-GPX in mammalian cells, the corresponding coding sequence has been fused to a mammalian SECIS element and transfected in mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B234-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>]. The expression of the HIV-GPX seems to have an anti-apoptotic activity, by conferring cytoprotection against exogenous or endogenous ROS. Indeed, several viral proteins are known to induce apoptosis via redox-sensitive effects during HIV-1 viral cycle. Therefore, the presence of a HIV-GPX could be pertinent in the long-term non-progressor patients. Note that these experiments were performed before the emergence of the HAART.
