<p>These two examples of selenoprotein gene snatching from eukaryotic genomes in the viral genomes of fowlpox and molluscum contagiosum viruses lead to the careful investigation for further examples of selenoprotein genes sequences with viral genomes. The first analysis searched for GPX modules within viral genomes where an in-frame UGA codon would be in an amino acid environment close to the catalytic site sequence of eukaryotic GPXs. Several candidates with sequence identities greater than 25% were found in the genomes of HIV-1, HIV-2, HCV, coxsackie virus B3 and measles viruses [

Despite these in silico data that GPX-related features are present in a number of RNA viruses, no RNA structure similar to the SECIS element can be evidenced. Additionally, no biochemical data demonstrated the expression of viral selenoproteins in any of these cases. It is possible that viruses have developed somewhat unique mechanisms for Sec insertion, as suggested in [
 <xref rid="B195-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>], but this remains purely hypothetical in the absence of further experimental proofs.
