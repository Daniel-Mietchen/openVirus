<p>Another putative viral selenoprotein gene has been reported in the -1 reading frame of the NS4 region of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). JEV belongs to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, which also includes dengue fever virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus (WNV). The gene named NS4-fs encodes a potential 104 amino acid sequence with three predicted selenocysteine residues, i.e., three in frame UGA codons [
 <xref rid="B191-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. This putative selenoprotein displays 30.3% identity and 45.8% similarity with an aligned family of ferredoxin with cysteine instead of selenocysteine. Noteworthy, these three UGA codons are highly conserved, as they are present in all of the 15 full genomic JEV sequences analyzed. A 3D structure of the protein has been modeled [
 <xref rid="B191-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>] where the selenocysteine residues are proposed to maintain the conformation of the [Fe
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>] cluster center. Interestingly, ferredoxin usually acts as an electron transfer agent in biological redox reactions, and this may somehow be important for JEV infection or replication. Again, in this example, neither SECIS elements were found nor any biochemical evidence of selenoprotein expression was provided.
