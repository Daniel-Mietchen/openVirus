<p>The fact that at least two selenoproteins are encoded by viral genomes suggests that these proteins provide a substantial advantage for viruses. Similar to molluscum congatiosum GPX1, the fowlpox GPX4 may provide survival benefits for the virus. These two proteins are, so far, the only proven examples of genetically encoded viral selenoproteins.</p>
