 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and most of them are involved in a redox reaction [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Among the selenoproteome, the GPXs are major components of the mammalian antioxidant defense. In humans, eight GPXs paralogs have been identified, five of them contain a selenocysteine residue in the catalytic site (GPX1â€“GPX4, GPX6), and three have a cysteine instead (GPX5, GPX7 and GPX8). Among the selenoenzymes, GPX1 and GPX4 are ubiquitously expressed and represent two of the most abundant selenoproteins in mammals. GPX1 is only cytoplasmic while GPX4 is localized in cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and nuclear cellular compartments. GPX3 is a glycosylated protein secreted in the plasma mostly by the kidney, and its enzymatic activity is commonly used to evaluate the selenium status of the organism as its level fluctuates with selenium intake. GPX2 has initially been described as a gastrointestinal-specific enzyme but is present in other epithelial tissues (lung, skin, liver). Finally, the recently characterized GPX6, is only found in the olfactory epithelium and embryonic tissues. The role of the GPXs is to reduce hydrogen peroxides and organic hydroperoxides before they cause oxidative damage by reacting on cellular components. GPXs use GSH as a cofactor which is subsequently recycled by glutathione reductases [

 <xref rid="B83-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] the different GPXs have overlapping enzymatic activities but they exhibit strong substrate specificities. For example, GPX4 is thought to be specialized in the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides while GPX1 is involved in the regulation of H

 <sub>2</sub> metabolism.
