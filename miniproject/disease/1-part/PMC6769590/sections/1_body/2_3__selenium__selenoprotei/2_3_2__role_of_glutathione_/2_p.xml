<p>The individual role of GPX members has been revealed by gene inactivation in mice. Interestingly, while the inactivation of 
 <italic>Gpx4</italic> gene is embryonically lethal [
 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], mice deficient in 
 <italic>Gpx1</italic> or 
 <italic>Gpx2</italic> genes are perfectly healthy, fertile and show no increased oxidative stress as compared with wild-type (WT) animals in normal growth conditions [

  <sup>-/-</sup>

 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This data suggests that GPX1 has a major role in protecting cells against strong oxidative stress but plays a limited role during normal development and under physiologic conditions. GPX2 appears to have a dual role in cancer, behaving either as a protector of carcinogenesis or a promoter of tumor growth, as revealed by various models [
