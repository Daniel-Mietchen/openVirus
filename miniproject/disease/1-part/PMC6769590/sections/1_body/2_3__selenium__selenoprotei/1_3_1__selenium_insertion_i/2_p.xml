<p>It is now well admitted that the biological activity of selenium comes from its insertion into selenoproteins as a rare amino acid, selenocysteine [

Many reports have evidenced a prioritized regulation of the selenoproteome in response to selenium depletion that maintains the expression of essential selenoenzymes at the expense of others. Upon a normal diet, tissue concentration of selenium in the human body ranges from highest levels to lowest: Kidney, liver, spleen, pancreas, heart, brain, lung, bone and skeletal muscle [

Interestingly, in animals fed with a low selenium diet, selenium levels are drastically reduced in most tissues, including the normally selenium-rich ones kidneys and liver, but are maintained in very few tissues such as the brain and neuroencrine glands [
 <xref rid="B71-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This phenomenon, described at the scale of organism, tissue, or cell lines, is referred to as selenium or selenoprotein hierarchy [
