<p>Food is the primary source of selenium intake for mammals, but only five molecules (selenocysteine, selenomethionine, selenoneine, selenite, and selenate) constitute the bioavailable selenium in food intake [

A repeated daily intake above 400 μg leads to selenosis and eventually death. However, in certain regions of China, continual intakes of ~1000 µg Se/day are not associated with adverse effects other than fragile hair and fingernails due to keratin disruptions. Importantly, the concentration of selenium measured in the soil and water determines its levels in the living organisms and crops growing in these territories, and notably the components of human food chain, including microorganisms, plants, cereals, vegetables, fruits, farm animals, etc. The importance of selenium as a trace element in human health has been evidenced in a selenium-deprived area of China named Keshan, which then provided the name to the disease, as described in
