<p>The process of selenocysteine insertion relies on a translational mechanism that is unique in many aspects. Selenocysteine was the first addition to the genetic code and is therefore referred to as the 21st amino acid. This amino acid is encoded by the UGA codon, which is normally a stop codon [

 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, the cell has evolved a dedicated machinery to recode UGA as selenocysteine in selenoprotein mRNAs while maintaining its use as a stop codon in other cellular mRNAs [

 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], together with their interacting protein partners allow the co-translational incorporation of a selenocysteine amino acid in selenoproteins. This mechanism is rather inefficient (between 1 and 5%), and mostly results in a truncated protein, the UGA codon being read as a stop codon [
