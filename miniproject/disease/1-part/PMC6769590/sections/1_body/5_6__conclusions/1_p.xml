<p>During viral infections, there are many ways that the host metabolism could be affected, leading to a dysregulation of redox homeostasis. The viral pathogens induce oxidative stress via the increase generation of ROS and the alteration of cellular ROS scavenging systems. As part of antioxidant defense, selenoproteins, such as GPXs, TXNRDs and those located in the ER, play an important role in controlling oxidative stress. Selenium deficiency creates a weakening of the defense against infectious diseases by reducing selenoprotein expression. However, nutritional status of the host can also lead to viral genome mutations from a benign or mildly pathogenic virus to a highly virulent one under oxidative stress that could further spread in hosts with adequate selenium intake. The molecular mechanism leading to the site-specific genome evolution of the virus toward more pathogenic strains awaits further experiments, especially to understand the implication of the selenoproteins. </p>
