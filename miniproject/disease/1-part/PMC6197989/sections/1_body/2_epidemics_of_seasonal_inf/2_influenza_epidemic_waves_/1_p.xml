<p id="p0050">At the time of writing this review, the major lineages of influenza viruses responsible for influenza epidemics in Taiwan are the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A viruses and the Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B viruses. The peak circulation of these viruses is usually detected during the winter months (December to February), although summer outbreaks occasionally occur 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We summarized the circulating viruses and summer epidemics from 2000–01 to 2017–18 in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The dominant lineages in the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons were the influenza B and H1N1 viruses, respectively, those in 2002–03 and 2003–04 were H3N2 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and in 2004–05 H3N2 co-circulated with influenza B viruses 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In the subsequent period from 2005–06 to 2008–09, the H1N1 subtype prevailed (except for the co-circulation of H3N2 and influenza B viruses in 2006–07) 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The 2009 pandemic was caused by the novel A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, which was generated by reassortment of several influenza viruses. This new H1N1 virus continued to be the dominant influenza virus in the two subsequent winters 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and replaced the previous seasonal H1N1 virus to become the new seasonal H1N1 virus. Although influenza B viruses circulated in 2011–12, a summer epidemic of H3N2 occurred in 2012 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Subsequently, H3N2 dominated the following three flu seasons in 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15. Notably, three summer H3N2 epidemics in 2005, 2007, and 2012 followed the circulation of influenza B viruses during the winters of 2004–05, 2006–07, and 2011–12, respectively. Thus, new antigenic variants that generate in summer might be the progenitors of epidemic strains the following winter
