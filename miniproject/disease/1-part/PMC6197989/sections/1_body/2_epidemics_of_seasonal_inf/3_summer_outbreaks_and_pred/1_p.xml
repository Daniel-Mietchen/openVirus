<p id="p0055">In addition to Taiwan, summer influenza outbreaks have been reported in Okinawa (Japan), Hong Kong, Mexico, Pakistan, and Vietnam 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The circulating subtypes in Okinawa are similar to those in Taiwan and Hong Kong; however, the sources and migrations of summer epidemics remain unknown 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. With the rapid development of sequencing technologies, phylodynamic and phylogeographic methods have become widely used frameworks for analyzing viral evolution and epidemiology from large-scale sequences; these methods combine multidisciplinary perspectives such as population genetics, evolutionary and epidemiological modeling, and phylogenetic theory 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Such phylodynamic models have been applied to investigate the interactions between epidemiological and evolutionary processes 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and the global migration patterns of H3N2 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and to identify how the H1N1 pandemic spread globally in 2009 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. A phylogeographic analysis based on sequences in a publicly available database was performed to simulate the spatiotemporal migrations of summer epidemics in Taiwan 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The results indicated that the 2005 summer epidemic originated in Korea and spread first to Hong Kong and subsequently to Taiwan. Additionally, the researchers suggested that the 2007 summer epidemic had originated in the western United States before migrating to the eastern United States and subsequently spreading to multiple Asian countries, including Taiwan. Although predictions generated using these methods may have been compromised by the availability of published sequence data in some time spans or countries 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, advancements in deep-sequencing technologies and computational analytics may improve understanding of the global spread of influenza viruses.
