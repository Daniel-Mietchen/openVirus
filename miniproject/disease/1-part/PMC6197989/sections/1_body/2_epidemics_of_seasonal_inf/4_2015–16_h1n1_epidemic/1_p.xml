<p id="p0060">In Taiwan, a most recent and serious seasonal H1N1 epidemic occurred in 2015–16, causing 163 deaths and 1663 severe infections (including influenza infection cases with pulmonary complications, neurologic complications, myocarditis, invasive bacterial infections, or pericarditis that required intensive care or resulting in death) from July 2015 to March 2016 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. It not only caused significant morbidity and mortality, but also resulted in 65 deaths and 676 severe cases in the age group of 50–64, those of robust immunity. Similar H1N1 outbreaks were also reported in other regions; for example, more than 39,000 infections and 2500 deaths occurred in 2015 in India 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, and in all federal districts of Russia, the rate of morbidity due to influenza and acute respiratory infection rapidly increased in the 2015–16 flu season and was higher than the epidemic threshold by 20% 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The longstanding A/California/7/2009 H1N1 vaccine strain utilized since 2009 was replaced by a newly recommended vaccine strain (A/Michigan/45/2015) in the following 2017 southern and 2017–18 northern hemisphere influenza seasons

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. This suggests that selection of strains for vaccines against seasonal influenza viruses must be improved. Establishing a real-time monitoring system of genetic changes (e.g., Nextflu 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>) combined with rapid antigenic analysis can enable more effective selection of vaccine strains.
