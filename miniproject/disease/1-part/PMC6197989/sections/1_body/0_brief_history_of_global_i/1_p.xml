<p id="p0010">There are four types of influenza viruses: types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A, B and C viruses infect humans. Of these types, only type A viruses have caused pandemics, resulting in considerable impact on human health globally. Influenza B causes seasonal epidemics while influenza C causes mild human infections with minimal public health impact. The most well-known pandemic in human history was the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, when an H1N1 virus that was believed to have originated from birds adapted to humans resulting in more than 50 million deaths worldwide. In 1957, another pandemic known as the “Asian flu” caused by an H2N2 influenza A virus resulted in another million deaths. In 1968 the aforementioned H2N2 virus acquired a novel haemagglutinin and PB2 gene segment from avian influenza virus origin to cause another pandemic that was first detected in Hong Kong and then spread to other regions in Asia and globally. In 1977, an H1N1 virus almost identical to seasonal H1N1 viruses circulating in the 1950s re-emerged and led to epidemics worldwide. Since that time, the two influenza A viruses, H1N1 and H3N2, have circulated worldwide as the major human influenza A seasonal flu viruses resulting in annual epidemics or endemics. In 2009, a new strain of H1N1 emerged and caused the most recent pandemic in human history. This new H1N1 virus was initially called a “swine-origin” influenza virus because its gene segments are derived from swine influenza viruses. The 2009 pandemic virus replaced the previous seasonal H1N1 viruses that was active for three decades prior to 2008 and since then has co-circulated in humans with influenza A H3N2 and influenza B viruses.</p>
