 <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, the establishment of an island-wide laboratory-based surveillance network has facilitated influenza epidemiology monitoring in Taiwan since 2000. The seamless collaboration between clinical virology laboratories at the medical centers that constitute this network enables the control of diseases and their pathogens. These laboratories can promptly identify viruses from clinical specimens through molecular analysis and virus genome sequencing, thereby generating massive genomic data-sets for molecular and evolutionary analytics. In addition, this network enables the management of newly emerging infectious diseases such as the 2003 SARS outbreak and 2009 H1N1 outbreak.
