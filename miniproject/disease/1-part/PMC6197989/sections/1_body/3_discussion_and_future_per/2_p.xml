<p id="p0075">Although at the time of writing, no locally acquired H5N1 disease in humans had been reported in Taiwan, this avian influenza virus is a constant threat to public health. Several imported cases of human infection with an avian influenza A virus (H7N9) have been reported in Taiwan since 2013

 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and zoonotic and potentially pandemic virus continues to cause concern. Because of these zoonotic threats, the Taiwanese government has undertaken considerable efforts to prevent these viruses from being imported and spread throughout poultry in the islands. For example, the government enforced a ban on slaughtering live poultry in traditional wet markets in June of 2013, although birds were already mostly butchered in the 79 licensed poultry slaughterhouses around the island. Additionally, the government has established surveillance systems and early diagnostic technology to monitor both human seasonal and avian influenza virus throughout Taiwan. In particular, advances in cell culture, reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR), sequencing technologies (such as the next-generation sequencing) and computational modeling should all contribute to help in our understanding of influenza epidemics.
