  <p>Part of the original manuscript (in Japanese) describing the 1918 influenza pandemic in Taiwan reported by a Japanese medical officer, Arai Megumi, published in the Journal of the Formosan Medical Association, 1919. (The image was provided by the Formosan Medical Association.)</p>
  <p>The author of the report discussed the possible origins of the infectious agent that caused the pandemic in Taiwan, including import from elsewhere. By the author's investigation, the outbreaks in Northern Taiwan were initiated in mid-October from Keelung (a harbor city northeast of Taipei) and the adjacent towns, then spread to Taipei city in late October. According to the report, the outbreak resulted in schools being closed in Taipei city in early November, and 22% of the population in the city possibly infected by the agent of influenza. In addition, compared to the average mortality in the city, the death count was increased more than 2- fold in November, from an average of 7 in previous years, to 17.3 per day in 1918.</p>
