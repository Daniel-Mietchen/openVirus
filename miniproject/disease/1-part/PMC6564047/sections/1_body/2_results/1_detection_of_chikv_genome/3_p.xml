<p>The sensitivity of CHIKV-CZC-LAMP using CHIKV genome at the end points of the reaction (45 minutes) was &lt;50 PFU CHIKV per reaction, showing 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 54%-100%) at 50 PFU of CHIKV, and 33% (95% CI: 4%-78%) at 5 PFU of CHIKV. Addition of blood to the CHIKV genome had no inhibitory effect on sensitivity of the RT-LAMP, showing 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 54%-100%) at 50 PFU of CHIKV, and 50% sensitivity (95% CI:12%-88%) at 5 PFU CHIKV (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was also determined using the same RNA templates, and was revealed to be &lt;0.5 PFU CHIKV per reaction (
