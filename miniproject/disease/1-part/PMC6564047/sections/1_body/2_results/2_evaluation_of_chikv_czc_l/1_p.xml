<p>The feasibility of established CHIKV-CZC-LAMP for patient sample diagnosis was validated at Flavivirus Laboratory using both RNA and serum samples of patients with chikungunya collected and kept at the Fiocruz. RNA and serum from healthy individuals (n = 4) were also tested as healthy endemic controls. All the RNA samples were tested by qRT-PCR, and the Ct values were determined (

Among 33 CHIKV qRT-PCR positive samples, 23 RNA samples and 19 serum samples were positive for CHIKV-CZC-LAMP, showing 70% (95% CI: 0.51–0.84) sensitivity for RNA samples and 58% (95% CI: 0.39–0.75) sensitivity for serum samples. No positive reaction was observed in the 4 endemic healthy control RNA and serum samples, demonstrating 100% specificity (95% CI: 0.40–1.00) (

The results were correlated with the analytical sensitivity of the CHIKV-CZC-LAMP using RNA from CHIKV, which was 33% at 5 PFU, corresponding to 30.60 of Ct value of qRT-PCR (
