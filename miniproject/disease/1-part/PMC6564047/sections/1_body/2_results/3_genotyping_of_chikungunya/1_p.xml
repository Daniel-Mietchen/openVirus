<p>The amplified products by CHIKV-CZC-LAMP from clinical samples, and CHIKV-SL10571 and -S27 laboratory strains, were sequenced with MinION (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). After mapping the reads to the reference sequence of CHIKV SL11131, the mapped read number of each nucleotide was retrieved, and consensus sequences were generated based on the population. The population for the major nucleotides was interpreted as a consensus of sequence although the presence of viral quasispecies could not be excluded. Because the clinical samples were sequenced with the recent version of R9.4, the average length of read and outputs were much higher in those samples than laboratory strains CHIKV-SL10571 and -S27 strains which were sequenced with the earlier version R7.0. (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007480.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The lack of 3→ 5 exonuclease activity in

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported that sequence accuracy of the current version of the MinION R9.4 flowcell with 2D chemistry is 97% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] which is still of course low compared to the conventional Sanger-sequence or other next generation sequencers. Nevertheless, the high sequence coverage renders enough discriminative power for single nucleotide variations (SNVs) calling with high confidence. The obtained consensus sequences were aligned, and phylogenetic trees were constructed based on 117 nucleotides of the LAMP target region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007480.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The sequences from two laboratory strains, CHIKV-SL10571, and African prototype CHIKV-S27 showed a 100% match with deposited sequence data, demonstrating the proof-of-concept of our analysis. For the chikungunya patient samples from Rio de Janeiro, the obtained sequences all clustered within ECSA genotype in the phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007480.g002">Fig 2</xref>), confirming the circulation of the ECSA genotype in Rio de Janeiro during the epidemics in 2016 and 2018.
