<p>Since the clinical features of chikungunya are similar to other mosquito-borne febrile diseases, including Dengue fever, Zika fever and malaria, the differential diagnosis of these diseases based on clinical signs is difficult in endemic regions. Definitive diagnosis of chikungunya is based on serology, virus isolation, or genome detection by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) from patient-derived samples. However, these laboratory diagnostic techniques are expensive and require well-equipped facilities that are not generally available in remote areas and thus are seldom performed in routine clinical practice.</p>
