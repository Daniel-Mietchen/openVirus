<p>The obtained FAST5 data from MinION were converted into fastq file formats using albacore.1.2.6 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). MinION sequence data have been submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under the following DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA) accession number: DRA007513. The local BLASTN program was employed with obtained reads as queries against CHIKV SL11131 (AB455493) reference at position of 10,317–10,472, which corresponds to the region between F2 to B2 region of LAMP reaction (E value &lt;1e-5, identity &gt;90%). All the blastn hit regions were clipped and aligned to CHIKV SL11131 by Bowtie2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and IGV and IGVtools [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] were used to visualize and obtain count data from bam files. The obtained count data were analyzed by MicroSoft Excel (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007480.s001">S1 Table</xref>), and consensus sequences were constructed. For further sequence analysis, the F2 and B2 regions were omitted, since during LAMP amplification those sequences would be replaced by the primer sequence completely. For the remaining 117 bp region (10,336–10,452), the population for the major nucleotides was interpreted as a consensus of the sequence, if the proportion of the main allele was supported by more than 70% of the total coverage. For bi-allelic loci, a non-primer allele was considered as a genuine allele taking into account for the primer effect, that partially replaced the original mutation into the primer sequence (LF/LB and F1/B1). The consensus sequences were aligned, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by a Neighbor joining (NJ) -based method with the reference CHIKV sequences [
