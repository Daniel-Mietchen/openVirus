<p>In summary, a one-step, easy gene amplification assay for CHIKV genome detection was successfully developed. The assay was evaluated with RNA and serum samples from 16 CHIKV serology positive patients during recent chikungunya outbreaks in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In combination with MinION sequencing technology, we also identified the CHIKV genotypes with a laptop computer. The developed CHIK-CZC-LAMP diagnostics and MinION sequencing workflow will certainly contribute to future outbreak analysis in resource limited settings.</p>
