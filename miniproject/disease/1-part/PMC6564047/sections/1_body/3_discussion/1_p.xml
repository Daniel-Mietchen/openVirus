<p>The present study describes the development of a one-step, easy and “user-friendly” gene amplification assay for the rapid detection of CHIKV, named CHIKV-CZC-LAMP. The analytical sensitivity of CHIKV-CZC-LAMP was &lt;50 PFU per reaction both from purified RNA and RNA sample pulsed with human blood. This sensitivity of the CHIKV-CZC-LAMP was not as high as the standard qRT-PCR method which showed higher sensitivity, detecting &lt;1 PFU per reaction [

However, improvement on the sensitivity by selection of different primer sets will be expected to allow detection of relatively low viral load samples. In the current study, we used already established primer sets [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have recently been reported, which need to be comparatively validated. Also, a second set of reaction accelerating primers (stem primes) could increase the sensitivity of the amplification [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The viral titer has variation based on the individuals or the viral genotypes. It has been reported that high viral load of CHIKV (10
 <sup>7</sup>−10
 <sup>9</sup> viral particles/ml) was detected in the patient’s blood in a recent outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which will be easily detected in our LAMP-MinION system. After 5 days of the onset of symptom, additional serological assays are recommended, since the viral genome amount is expected to be low at this point [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The negative results by our system in some CHIKV-infected patients who had relatively low viral load may be caused by delayed onset of symptoms after CHIKV infection. The undetectable RNA samples showed Ct value of &gt;23.95 in qRT-PCR, which is estimated to be about 500 PFU virus per reaction, demonstrating that CHIKV-CZC-LAMP could detect only high viral titer samples in the early phase of the CHIKV infection. Therefore, we propose that our system can be combined with a serological diagnostic test. Nevertheless, the developed CHIKV-CZC-LAMP could be considered to be superior to a qRT-PCR method in terms of feasibility as there is no need for significant technical skills or expensive equipment. In addition, it has the advantages of easy transportability and low cost. This system will also be useful for diagnosis not only of chikungunya but also other established and newly emerging infections of RNA viral diseases in the field setting as a point of care test.
