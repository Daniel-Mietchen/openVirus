<p>In Brazil, the first autochthonous cases of the Asian and ECSA genotypes were reported in 2014 in Oiapoque and Feira de Santana, respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In 2016, an outbreak of chikungunya was reported in Rio de Janeiro, and ECSA genotype was reported in this epidemic [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, we decided to evaluate our CHIK-CZC-LAMP combined with MinION portable sequencer using samples from chikungunya patients in Rio de Janeiro, to determine if on-site diagnosis and on-site genotyping was feasible or not. It was demonstrated that molecular diagnosis and on-site sequencing from clinical samples in resource-limited region was possible. The sequence data obtained from the chikungunya samples revealed that those were the ECSA genotype, which was consistent with the previous report [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a proof-of-concept, laboratory CHIKV strains (SL10571 and S27) were also sequenced and showed absolute match with the sequences deposited in GenBank. The reliability of LAMP diagnosis is also complemented by sequencing, as the LAMP method is known to cause frequent non-specific amplification induced by primer dimers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We confirmed the sequence of CHIKV genome in the samples, demonstrating that the obtained sequence information gave us definitive and reliable information from epidemic clinical samples.
