 <p>Importantly we would like to thank all the cattle keepers for providing access to their herds and the MINEPIA veterinary center staff and delegates without whom this study would not have been possible. The authors would like to thank the Welcome Trust (WT094945) for the original funding that made the study possible and BB thanks the BBSRC for support through the Roslin Institute Strategic Programme Grant (BB/J004235/1).</p>
