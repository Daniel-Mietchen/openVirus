<p>Finally, we were interested to compare the performance of the tests in different age groups. The cattle were classified as young (&lt;2 years old), adult (≥2 but &lt;5 years old), and old (≥5 years old) based on the age and or dentition collected at the time of the sampling. The estimates based on the two tests and 13 sub-populations run as a single model are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> with the test parameters further highlighted in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Again both tests appear to perform very consistently across the different age groups although the specificity seems to drop slightly in the old class for both tests for reasons that are not clear but which are reflected in higher levels of misclassification/lower agreement in this age class. It is also reassuring that seroprevalence generally increases with age group as one would expect for a vector borne infectious disease (
