<p>An initial NGS analysis was conducted comparing the four different combinations of tests/cut-offs to identify the best combination for the rest of the analysis. The data was subset into 13 different populations based on the administrative Divisions (NWR) or sub-Divisions (VD) used in the sampling design. The posterior estimates for the test parameters and the different population prevalences are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. From this the specificities are all very high with narrow 95% BCIs but as might be expected using the lower cut-off for the PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> in particular results in lowered specificities. The sensitivities are all lower than the specificities and have a much higher uncertainty around the estimates reflecting the relatively small number of positives in the sample (for all cut-offs used). Interestingly, all sets of four prevalence estimates for each population are very consistent across the test combinations. Overall the combination with the ELISA cut-off set at 40pp or lower and the PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> at 80 or greater were considered the optimal cut-offs as they produced on average the highest sensitivity and specificity estimates for both tests (
