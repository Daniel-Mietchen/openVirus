 <sub>

 </sub> is a vector of probabilities of observing the individual combinations of test results. Conditioning on the (latent) disease status, these probabilities can be specified using the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the tests and the prevalence (p) in subpopulations. As an example, for two tests the probability of observing both tests positive in the
