<p>The covDp and the covDn are the covariances between the two tests when the animal is diseased and when it is not diseased, respectively. The covariance between the test outcomes for infected subpopulations satisfies (Se
 <sub>1</sub>-1)
 <sup>*</sup>(1-Se
 <sub>2</sub>) ≤ covDp ≤ (min(Se
 <sub>1</sub>,Se
 <sub>2</sub>)-(Se
 <sub>1</sub>Se
 <sub>2</sub>)) and for the non-infected subpopulation, (Sp
 <sub>1</sub>-1)
 <sup>*</sup>(1-Sp
 <sub>2</sub>) ≤ covDp ≤ (min(Sp
 <sub>1</sub>,Sp
 <sub>2</sub>)-(Sp
 <sub>1</sub>Sp
 <sub>2</sub>). Therefore, for instance, a uniform ((Se
 <sub>1</sub>-1)(1-Se
 <sub>2</sub>), (min(Se
 <sub>1</sub>,Se
 <sub>2</sub>)-(Se
 <sub>1</sub>Se
 <sub>2</sub>))) prior distribution can be used for covDp.
