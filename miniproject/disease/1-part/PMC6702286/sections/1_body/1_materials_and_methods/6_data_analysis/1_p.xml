<p>Hui and Walter (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) introduced a latent class approach to the evaluation of diagnostic tests in the absence of a “gold-standard.” The Hui-Walter paradigm requires two (or more) tests evaluated in two (or more) populations. This model assumes that: (i) the prevalence of the disease is different within each population; (ii) the tests have the same properties across populations; (iii) and the tests must be conditionally independent given the disease status.
