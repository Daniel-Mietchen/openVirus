<p>The competitive ELISA was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer and all the samples were run once. In brief, 50 μl of sample diluted 1:1 with the supplied kit buffer was added to each test well of the recombinant RVF nucleoprotein precoated plate and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The plate was washed and 100 μl of the supplied anti-RVF-NP conjugate added and incubated for a further 30 min at 21°C and washed. 100 μl of supplied substrate solution supplied was added and incubated for a final 15 min at 21°C before adding the stop solution. The plate was read at 450 nm. To control the validity of each plate, the mean value of the two negative controls (ODNC) was calculated and the plate was considered valid when OD
 <sub>NC</sub> &gt; 0.7. For a valid plate, the mean value of the two positive controls divided by OD
 <sub>NC</sub> should be &lt;0.3. For each sample the competition percentage was calculated by dividing (OD
 <sub>sample</sub>/OD
 <sub>NC</sub>) × 100. The manufacturers suggest if the value was ≤ 40% the sample was considered positive. A value &gt;50% was a considered a negative result and values in between 40 and 50% indicated an inconclusive result.
