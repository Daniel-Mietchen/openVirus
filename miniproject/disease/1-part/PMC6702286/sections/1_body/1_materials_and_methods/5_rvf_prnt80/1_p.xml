<p>RVFV strain ZH501 (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) was propagated in a mosquito cell line (C6/36, ATCC) as previously described (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Briefly, C6/36 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and maintained at 28Â°C in a 1:1 mixture of EMEM (Wisent) and ESF-921 (Expression Systems, Woodland, CA, USA) supplemented with 2.5% FBS, 25 mM HEPES and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Vero E6 cells were used to determine the titers of RVFV as previously described (
