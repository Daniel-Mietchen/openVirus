<p>A number of tests have been developed to detect IgM and IgG antibodies in different species including a new commercial multi-species ELISA from ID.Vet (Montpellier, France) (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). There are currently no validation studies in African cattle populations. It is well-recognized that diagnostic tests developed and validated in one population behave differently when used in different settings (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This is important for surveillance activities or risk factor evaluation in order for estimates at the population level to be correctly adjusted for the test imperfections and reliable estimates generated for evidence based decision making. Using population based serum banks from studies in Cameroon we are able to estimate test performance in naturally infected populations with a range of coinfections that may impact performance and thus get more reliable point estimates as well as capturing the variation and thus the uncertainty of these estimates.
