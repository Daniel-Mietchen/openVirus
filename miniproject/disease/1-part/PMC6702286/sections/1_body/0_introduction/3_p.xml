Within the Central African region, livestock and human cases of RVF have been reported in the savanna of northern Cameroon, Chad, and within forest areas in the Central African Republic. Livestock seroprevalences of 9–20% within goat herds of northern Cameroon (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) have been reported. Most recently, in a large sample across Cameroon prevalence estimates of 13.5% (11.4–15.7) for cattle and 3.4% (2.3–4.7) for small ruminants were produced (
