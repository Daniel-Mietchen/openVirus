<p>Hui and Walter (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) developed a no gold standard model to estimate test sensitivity and specificity in the absence of a gold standard test under certain assumptions. These assumptions are that each test performs the same in each population, that the tests are conditionally independent (i.e., if a sample is positive in one test this does not influence the probability it will be positive on the other test conditional on its true status) and that the prevalences are different in each of the sampled populations (or the problem can become mathematically non-identifiable). Applying the model in a Bayesian framework and making some adjustment for the possible conditional dependence between tests (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) allows us to estimate the test parameters (sensitivity and specificity) as well as the population prevalence.
