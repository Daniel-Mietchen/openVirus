<p>The aims of this study were to estimate the test performance of two RVF diagnostic tests in a naturally infected population and to assess the stability of these estimates in different geographical regions and age groups. In particular we were interested in understanding how the ID.Vet test performed as it has wide potential use as a simpler screening serological test for low and middle income settings (LMICs). Secondly to describe the seroprevalence of RVF exposures in cattle in the NWR and VD of Cameroon in 2013.</p>
