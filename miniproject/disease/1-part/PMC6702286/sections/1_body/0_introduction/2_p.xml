 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are the main vectors of the RVF virus (RVFV), and it can be transferred vertically from female mosquitoes to their eggs in some species of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genera (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Sheep, goats, and cattle are the domestic species most affected but clinical signs are usually mild and inapparent in adult animals but can lead to major outbreaks of abortions and death in neonates during epidemic periods which result in direct significant economic losses (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The disease can also affect other wild animals such as buffalo, as well as spill over into humans (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). RVF is transmitted between animals and to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito vector. The disease in humans can also result from direct contact with infected tissues, blood or body fluids (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A rise in RVFV prevalence in domestic ruminants can sometimes precede epidemics in humans (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and similarly a decline in herd immunity in the inter-epidemic periods coupled with extensive flooding appears to facilitate these explosive outbreaks. Symptoms of the disease in humans can vary, ranging from flu-like symptoms to more severe conditions such as meningoencephalitis, haemorrhagic fever, or death (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The case fatality rate for patients developing the haemorrhagic form of the disease can be as high as 50% (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).
