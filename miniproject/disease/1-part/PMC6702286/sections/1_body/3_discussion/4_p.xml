<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that RVF virus is circulating in Cameroon and the Central African region more widely. Further, the results presented in this paper suggest that the seroprevalence of RVF in cattle varies across the study sites between 2 and 12% with the exception of Ngoketunjia in the NWR where it was particularly high at near 20%. This Division is to the south of the Region and includes a large dam and swamp areas where cattle are grazed and it would be consistent with much higher vector populations. There is also a clear pattern of increasing seroprevalence with age across the 13 sub-populations over the two sites consistent with viral circulation although no clinical disease has been reported. This may be because at the time of the study there was no animal surveillance for abortions. These estimates appear consistent with those recently reported from Cameroon for the Adamawa Region in 2018 (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). They do not report seroprevalences in cattle for the NWR. From discussions with local health personnel there is also very limited diagnostic exploration of human febrile illnesses which may lead into cases being missed. Given that there appears to be viral circulation, screening of high risk human groups such as slaughterhouse workers or veterinarians for evidence of exposure should be prioritized to provide further evidence for the need to include screening for RVF in febrile cases. Furthermore, RVF outbreaks have been associated with dam construction in West Africa and El Nino events in East Africa and changes in habitat that favor mosquito populations are a potential risk for triggering epidemics (
