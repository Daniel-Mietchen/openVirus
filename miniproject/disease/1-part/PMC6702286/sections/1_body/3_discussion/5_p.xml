<p>In conclusion we have demonstrated that both the ID.Vet ELISA and PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> have comparable performances in cattle from Cameroon. This supports the use of the ELISA as a relatively low cost easy to use surveillance tool for the African context. The results also suggest that RVF virus is endemic and circulating in Cameroonian cattle and it is interesting that no clinical reports exist for cattle or humans. The results here and from other studies in Cameroon suggest that human screening of febriles illnesses should be considered by hospitals where malaria has been ruled out.
