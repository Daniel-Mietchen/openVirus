<p>Overall, compared with the outbreaks in other Chinese provinces, in Guangxi, we observed a higher proportion of backyard poultry exposure, which could lead to an increase in the risk of avian influenza infection. This difference was mainly due to the fact that most of the patients we studied lived in rural areas. Preference for fresh chicken meat results in poultry farming in rural areas, while the raising and slaughtering increased the frequency of exposure. Our findings were consistent with previous research in that touching sick or dead poultry was the most important risk factor for HPAI A(H7N9) infection.
