 </sup> There were few A(H7N9) cases in Guangxi before 2017, but the number of cases rapidly increased in 2017. Some of the cases were even HPAI infections. This study was to explore the cause of the first A(H7N9) outbreak in Guangxi and compare it with other regions. We investigated the epidemiological characteristics of patients infected with A(H7N9) and the detection of H7 using live poultry markets (LPMs) surveillance; the relationship between detection of H7 and the increased number of cases is also explored.
