<p>The case-fatality was higher than those reported in other provinces and previous epidemic. It has been proven that initiation of anti-viral therapy within 48 h of the onset of the illness, could reduce the risk of death.

 </sup> However, the mean time between illness onset and anti-viral treatment in our study was 5 days, which was more than 48 h. Furthermore, for the death cases in our study, the times from illness onset to first medical service, to initiation of anti-viral treatment, and to diagnosis, were longer compared to the recovery cases (though, these differences were not significant). Therefore, enhancing early identification and timely initiation of anti-viral treatment is crucial to reduce the mortality of patients infected with A(H7N9). Another possible reason for the higher case-fatality rate observed was that six of the 14 cases that resulted in death in our study were patients infected with HPAI A(H7N9).
