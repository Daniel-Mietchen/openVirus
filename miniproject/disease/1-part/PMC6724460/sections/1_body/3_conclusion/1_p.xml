<p>Dengue remains a serious public health problem and constitutes a threat to the Brazilian population. The tropical climate of Brazil favors the proliferation of dengue and the four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) that circulate in Brazil. Vector control is still the most effective means of protection against the spread of the disease but remains ineffective against the numerous epidemics occurring every year in Brazilian cities. Serological diagnostic tests also need to be improved because cross-reactions with other arboviruses often occur.</p>
