To organize the information contained in the scientific articles identified with the descriptors, the articles were fully read, and the objectives, study type, location, period, methods, importance and results were identified. Published scientific reports such as letters, original articles and brief communications to national and international journals were included in the search according to the descriptors and peer reviewed. After preanalysis, scientific literature identified in more than one database that was accounted for as a single work, congress abstracts, theses, dissertations and articles that included no data for the state of Ceará were excluded. A total of 191 articles were identified in the databases; 133 articles were excluded according to the exclusion criteria, and 58 articles were included in the study (
