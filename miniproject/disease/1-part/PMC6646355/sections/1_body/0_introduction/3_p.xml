 </sup>, but limited experimental and theoretical studies have left much to be desired. In particular, it has been common practice to estimate the parameters from model fitting without considering that all parameters might not be accurately estimated from the limited data sets

 </sup>. Moreover, the number of parameters that can be estimated might not be similar for all datasets. The parameter estimation from model fitting without thorough analysis on the available data set and related estimable parameters may not be reasonable for ZIKV transmission dynamics. Given the lack of detailed analysis on the current parameter estimates, the key epidemiological parameters of ZIKV transmission, including the basic reproduction number, still remain uncertain. In addition, there is a lack of detailed evaluation on potential ZIKV control strategies. Such studies based on prior analysis of parameter estimation and validation could inform future data collection strategy, including those involving prevention measures, such as outbreak planning or assessment of potential countermeasures, thereby helping to decrease the potentiality of this infectious disease to become a pandemic.
