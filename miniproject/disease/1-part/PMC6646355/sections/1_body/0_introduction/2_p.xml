 </sup>. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for this disease, and at this moment the illness cannot be prevented by medications or vaccines. Because of the absence of treatment and vaccines, the immediate control strategy of ZIKV will rely on the control of mosquito and/or human-mosquito contacts. It is thus critical to get insights into the transmission dynamics of ZIKV in the population and properly evaluate potential control strategies.
