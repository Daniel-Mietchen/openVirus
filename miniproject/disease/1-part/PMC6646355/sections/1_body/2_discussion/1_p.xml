 </sup>, to identify parameters that can be estimated from the available limited data set. Using the estimated parameters by this technique, we also computed the basic reproduction number for ZIKV transmission dynamics and performed analysis and simulation of the models to investigate the disease outcomes and the effectiveness of prevention programs on controlling ZIKV infections.
