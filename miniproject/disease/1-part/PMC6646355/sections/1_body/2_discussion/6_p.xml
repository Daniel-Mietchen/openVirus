<p id="Par27">We acknowledge some limitations of our study. In this study, we modeled the island situation in which humans and mosquitos usually have close proximity to one another. While our study is relevant to many settings that share characteristics of our population, including military units, college campus, nursing homes, boarding schools, and other rural communities, these results may not be generalizable to other conditions where uniform mixing between humans and mosquitos is not the case. Secondly, we did not consider the seasonal variation in transmission in our analysis as a result of climate factors. However, the outbreaks ended before there was a substantial seasonal change in rainfall or temperature and hence might have very less influence on disease transmission. If the outbreaks had ended because of seasonality rather than the depletion of susceptible populations, it would reduce the estimated proportion of the infected population. Our parameter estimates and related confidence intervals are based on limited data sets, thus there might be some quantitative difference between our predictions and the real scenarios. Our results on prevention programs are based on the parameter sets averaged over islands. However, we acknowledge that the same parameters may not provide reasonable outcomes for all islands, or even for the same island at different time points. We have also ignored potential stochastic effects in ZIKV transmission, which may be important, particularly during the early phase of the infection. The estimates may be improved by incorporating stochastic effects in our model

 </sup>. However, our data contain entire epidemic periods, rather than only initial growth, thereby reducing the stochastic effects. Further study with stochastic modeling is necessary to accurately evaluate the stochastic effects on ZIKV dynamics of these islands.
