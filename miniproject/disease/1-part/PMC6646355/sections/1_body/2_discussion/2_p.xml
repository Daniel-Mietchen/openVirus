<p id="Par23">Implementing our technique to seven island data (six French Polynesia and one Yap), we identified that these data sets do not contain sufficient information to estimate more than three parameters in islands of French Polynesia and more than two parameters in Yap island with a reasonable degree of certainty attached to the estimates. Note that previous studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> used some of these island data to estimate up to six parameters. However, the previous study
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> used the stochastic approach with a Bayesian fitting procedure and whether this approach experiences similar effects is not known. Importantly, our analysis also showed that the number of estimable parameters and the estimated values varies from island to island, suggesting that the same set of parameters cannot be estimated from every island and thus attempting to estimate the same parameters across all islands may not provide reasonable information about the ZIKV transmission dynamics. Identification of parameters that can be estimated as done in our study may help to obtain important information about parameters related to ZIKV transmission dynamics. As a result, our method provides reasonably small confidence intervals implying more reliability to the estimated parameters (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) while assuring significantly well model fitting to the island data. Compared to a previous study
