<p id="Par16">Using the estimated parameters in Eq. (

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, with a value ranging from 2.03 in Australes to 3.20 in Yap island (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Based on the parameter estimates, the range of 
 <italic>R</italic>

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The model predicts

 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 in each island, and there were ZIKV epidemics, which is consistent with the observations in the data collected.
