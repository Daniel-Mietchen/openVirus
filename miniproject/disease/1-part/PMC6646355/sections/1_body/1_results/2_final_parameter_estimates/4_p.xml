<p id="Par12">Note that we estimated parameters based on cumulative data as it provided a simple model formulation. In addition, we also computed the weekly new infection predicted by the model and compared them with the experimental weekly raw data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, right column). The model predictions from these final parameters estimated provide excellent agreement with the experimental weekly data from each of the 7 islands considered. To observe whether these final parameter estimates are affected when weekly raw data are used for fitting as in the early epidemics of Ebola virus
