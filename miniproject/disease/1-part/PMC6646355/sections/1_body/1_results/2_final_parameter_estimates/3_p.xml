<p id="Par11">In order to investigate whether the final estimated parameters are affected by the choice of values at which the fixed parameters are set, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the fixed parameters on the estimated parameters. In this analysis, we randomly chose 200 different values for each ‘fixed’ parameter from the uniform distribution of the values over the range of estimate in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Then for each of 200 sets of fixed parameters, we estimated the free parameters through data fitting. We obtained that the estimated parameters are less sensitive to these fixed values (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>), showing the robustness of our final parameters. This observation is aligned with the fact that fixing the less sensitive parameter at a reasonable value would not significantly affect the estimated parameters.
