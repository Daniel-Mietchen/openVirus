<p>The need for new strategies to control influenza infections has led to the investigations of antibody therapy potential. Such an approach is based on neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAB) expression and delivery into the host pre- or post- exposure to the pathogen (

There are several clinical trials testing mAB efficacy against infectious pathogens, including the TNX-355 (Ibalizumab) which has been successfully approved for the use in HIV-infected patients and Palivizumab for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections [
