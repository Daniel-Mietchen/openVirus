<p>Above all, we emphasize the therapeutic capacity of novel monoclonal antibodies in combating influenza infection, and speculate that, in addition to the use of effective antivirals, passive immunotherapy against both influenza A and B viruses might be the way forward for influenza virus management amongst all classes (be it high- or low-risk) of patients. We envisage that the involvement of passive immunization will culminate in an accelerated relief through any of the mechanisms previously described, and this provides allowable time for the full activation of the adaptive immune system via the conventional antigen-presenting mechanisms. Additionally, infected persons who were passively immunized could develop a natural immunity to the specific viruses and this immunity could be long-lasting giving protection to other antigenically-matched strains [
