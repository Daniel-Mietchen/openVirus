<p>Rapid influenza virus evolution and yearly vaccine reformulations make the stockpiling of vaccines for future use a complicated issue. This subsequently delays preparation against any unforeseen epidemics. Therefore, lots of research now focuses on the development of novel broadly protective vaccine platforms, with hopes of enhancing both immunogen delivery and consequent immune response to select antigens. Some of these platforms include virus-like particle vaccines (VLP), synthetic virus vaccines, epitope vaccines, antigen-presenting cell inducible vaccines, COBRA vaccines, nanoparticle-based vaccines, and viral-vectored vaccines (
