<p>Management of ongoing influenza infection currently requires the use of antiviral drugs. Two drug classes approved for the control of influenza infections include the adamantanes (Amantadines and Rimantadines) and NA inhibitors (Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Laninamivir, and Peramivir). Whereas Adamantanes target the ion channel M2, which is involved in the release of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes in the host cell, NA inhibitors act by competitively engaging viral NA protein that is otherwise responsible for newly generated virion dissemination [

 <xref rid="B78-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, influenza viruses resistant to both the adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors have emerged rapidly [

 <xref rid="B87-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Additionally, lack of data suggesting antiviral efficacy against highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI), i.e., H5N1 remains an important issue in areas with possible spillover events from avian into humans [
 <xref rid="B88-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. It is imperative to note that there are still NA inhibitor-sensitive influenza A viruses in circulation, and this drug class can be extremely helpful in the management of an outbreak or even, a pandemic in the absence of highly efficacious vaccines.
