<p>Virus-like particles are non-infectious multimers of viral surface glycoproteins that have the propensity to self-assemble [
 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. VLPs are designed to maintain their native viral structure, but without their complete set of genetic materials. A typical influenza VLP has the HA, NA, and the matrix protein 1 (M1). Typically, plasmid constructs of the HA, NA, and M1 are used to transfect cells: resulting in formation of the capsid displaying surface proteins HA and NA [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. VLPs have been proposed to be efficient vaccines against a range of viruses including human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis E virus (HEV) as discussed by Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although these examples have completely different “biologies” when compared with the influenza virus, rapid advances and need for a new vaccine platform are generating some promising data for influenza VLPs. For instance, to overcome challenges raised by rapid influenza evolution Gao et al. attempted to generate VLPs with HBV backbone containing matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) together with the epitope of highly conserved nucleoprotein (NP) [

 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Another approach for generation of VLPs is via combination of distinct HAs. Such technique has been described by Kapczynski et al. who upon co-expression of three different clade H5 HAs, a single NA protein and retroviral gag protein managed to generate triple-clade VLPs that were shown to protect chickens against lethal challenge [

For heightened immunity (involving both innate and adaptive), VLPs may be adjuvanted with various Toll like receptor (TLR) ligands, as demonstrated with the modified salmonella flagellin acting as a TLR5 ligand described by Wang et al. which resulted in highly specific immunoglobulin response [
 <xref rid="B41-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Also, a GPI-anchored CCL-28 that was incorporated into the VLPs boosted IgA secreting cell migration, which increased murine mucosal immunity to both drifted and homologous influenza A (H3N2) viruses, as well as the longevity of protection [
 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. VLPs thus provide a platform for improved formulation of multivalent (containing heterologous epitopes) influenza vaccine.
