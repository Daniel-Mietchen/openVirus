<p>Antigenic shift also allows influenza viruses to escape pre-existing immunity [
 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This mechanism is reliant on the ability of the eight genomic fragments of influenza viruses to reassort with genomes of other influenza viral subtypes. It occurs when two or more of these distinct viruses infect a common host and generate novel viral subtypes or strains [

 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, antigenic shifts (principally underlying influenza A virus pandemics) and antigenic drifts (underlying vaccine mismatches against seasonal influenza A and B viruses) and a wide host-range (for influenza A viruses) all contribute to the recurring cases of influenza all year round [

 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, antigenic drifts and shifts are particularly reasons for why there is an immediate need for highly efficacious intervention. We review here vital influenza management strategies, novel vaccine and antiviral development approaches with deliberation on those with prospects.
