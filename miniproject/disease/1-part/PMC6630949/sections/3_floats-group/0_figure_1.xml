  <p>Mechanisms of antibody protection via passive immunization. This figure outlines the possible mechanisms by which antibodies could mediate instant protection when administered either as a prophylaxis or treatment. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Broadly neutralizing antibodies interact with HA interfering with the virus attachment to host cell. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Opsonized infected host cells attract natural killer (NK) cell destruction via the process of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Opsonized virus particles activate their phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) via the process of antibody-mediated cell phagocytosis. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Virus infected cells displaying the surface proteins of replicating viruses attract the assembly of the classical complement proteins forming a membrane attack complex that destroys the cell by osmosis in a process called antibody-dependent cell lysis (ADCL).
