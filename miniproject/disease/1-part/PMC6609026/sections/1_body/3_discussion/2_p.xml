<p>Factors that could alter viral RNA levels or affect the accuracy of measurement when testing is delayed include release of intra-cellular viral nucleic acids [

In this study we found that HIV RNA in samples stored in their primary tubes was unexpectedly stable. Even after prolonged storage at 30°C, the variation between test 1 and 2 in clinical samples was on average well within acceptable variation [
 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the vast majority of samples, RNA levels were within 0.5 log copies/mL of each other. These findings support earlier studies which suggest that HIV RNA could be more stable in clinical samples than is implied by the strict timelines indicated in manufacturer’s kit instructions [

 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These findings suggest that intact virus particles in plasma are quite stable, as viral RNA remains protected by its capsid and nucleoproteins. EDTA added to the tubes may well further contribute to RNA stability. Its mode of action is to chelate calcium and other metal ions and this inhibits many cellular enzymes which might otherwise have degraded virus particles and free RNA [

 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is for this reason that EDTA is preferred to other anticoagulants for molecular testing in blood.
