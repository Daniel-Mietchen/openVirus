<p>Viral load test manufacturers advise that plasma separation should be performed within 24 hours of sample collection to ensure a reliable test result. In large ARV programmes such as that in South Africa where VL testing is centralised, a significant proportion of samples from rural areas reach laboratories beyond this recommended time interval and it is unknown to what extent a delay in testing compromises results. The fact that, in this study only 56% of samples had been tested within 24 hours of sample collection demonstrates this very challenge. For this reason, research is ongoing into the use of alternative sample types, such as dried blood spots (DBS) or plasma separation cards. However, these approaches have drawbacks: only small amounts of blood can be collected which reduces assay sensitivity, and with DBS, the sample is contaminated with viral nucleic acids from cellular elements, which makes results difficult to interpret [

This could create challenges in workflow and ultimately prolong turnaround times in a busy VL laboratory. Testing of liquid plasma remains the sample of choice. Thus there is an urgent need to determine for how long viral RNA is stable after collection. In this study we set out to investigate this in routine diagnostic samples. 1194 clinical samples with a range of initial RNA levels, from undetectable to &gt;6 log copies/mL were studied.
