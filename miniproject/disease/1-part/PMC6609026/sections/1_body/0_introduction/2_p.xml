<p>Currently manufacturers of high throughput VL platforms recommend that whole blood samples should be centrifuged within 6 to 24 hours of collection and plasma should either be frozen at—80°C or tested within 24 hours of sample collection [

 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In resource-limited settings, this is often not achievable. Samples may reach the laboratory more than 24 hours after collection and are generally stored at 4°C in their primary tubes until testing. The extent to which these pre-analytical factors compromise accuracy of results is unknown. Past laboratory simulation studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that performed a meta-analysis of these laboratory studies, have suggested that viral RNA decay may be slower than previously thought and that testing can be performed for some time beyond the recommended 6 to 24 hour cut off without compromising accuracy.
