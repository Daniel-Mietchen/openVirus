<p>Immediately after plasma was aspirated from the primary tube for test one (and the testing process began), the primary tubes were visually inspected. Those with sufficient (&gt;1 mL) residual plasma were selected and stored at 4°C, 20°C or 30°C for a pre-determined interval of 72, 96 or 168 hours. Approximately 30% of PPT and 20% of EDTA samples had enough residual plasma for a second test. After storage at the specified temperature and time, primary tubes were re-centrifuged (3,273g for 10 minutes), 1mL of residual plasma was manually pipetted from the tube and the VL was repeated. The second VL result was captured as test 2. A figure illustrating the study plan is included in supplementary digital content,
