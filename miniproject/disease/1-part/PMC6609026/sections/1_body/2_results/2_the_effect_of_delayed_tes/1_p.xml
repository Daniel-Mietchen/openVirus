<p>Overall, 86.6% (95%CI 83.7–89.2%) of all test 2 VL results were within 0.5 log copies/mL of test 1. This VL concordance rate was similar, at 84.0% (95%CI 79.7–87.7%) for the subset of samples where the first VL test had been performed within 24 hours of sample collection (within the current recommended optimal testing interval). As no significant differences were detected between the 2 data sets, only the results of the complete data set are reported here. A viral load concordance rate of 90.3% (95%CI 86.9–93.1%) was observed for the PPT samples overall, whereas the 2 VL readings were within 0.5 log copies/mL in 81.4% (95% CI 76.1–85.9%) for EDTA samples. There was no rising trend in the proportion of samples with a viral load difference of &gt;0.5log copies/mL between tests 1 and 2, with increasing time or temperature of storage. (

 </bold>) Variability was slightly greater in samples in EDTA tubes, but otherwise trends were similar (as determined by median and IQR of log viral load change in the different time/temperature storage categories).
