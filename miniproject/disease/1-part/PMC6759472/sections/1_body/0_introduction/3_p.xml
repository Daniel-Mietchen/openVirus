<p>In recent years, ZIKV has been recognized as the cause of severe neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults (

Therefore, ZIKV stands as an emerging virus with multiple routes of transmission, capable of crossing the BBB independently of the route of infection. Here, we aimed to characterize the role of the BBB in the onset of ZIKV infection of the CNS, and to characterize possible differences in neurovirulence according to viral strains from the African and Asian lineages, using both
