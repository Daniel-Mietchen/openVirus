<p>Mouse brain microvessels were isolated as previously described (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Andras et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, brains were homogenized in cold isolation buffer (102 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl

Then, 26% dextran (MW, 150 kDa) in isolation buffer was added to the filtered brain homogenate, mixed, and centrifuged at 5,800 ×

 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4°C) and re-resuspended either in 200 μL of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with protease inhibitors for immunoblotting, or in PBS for RNA sequencing.
