<p>Zika virus strains R103451 (ATCC VR-1848, Honduras 2015, ZIKV-H), PRVABC9 (ATCC VR-1843, Puerto Rico 2015, ZIKV-PR), and MR 766 (ATCC VR-1838, Uganda 1947, ZIKV-U) were obtained from ATCC and propagated in C3/36 mosquito cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Supernatants were collected three to four days post-infection (dpi), clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 Ã— 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and concentrated using centrifugal filters with 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off (EMDMilipore). Virus was tittered by plaque assay using Vero cells with a 0.7% agarose overlay. Foci of plaques were detected at 3 dpi, following fixation with 10% paraformaldehyde solution and staining with 1% crystal violet.
