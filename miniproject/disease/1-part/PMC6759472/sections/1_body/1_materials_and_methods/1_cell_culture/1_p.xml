<p>C6/36 cells (
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> clone, mosquito cells) and Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). C6/36 cells (ATCC, CRL-1660) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 28°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were cultured in DMEM containing GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Primary human BMECs (Cell Systems, ACBRI 376) were cultured in pre-coated plates with Attachment Factor (Cell Systems) and with Cell Systems Medium, pre-formulated with 10% serum and supplemented with CultureBoost containing animal derived growth factors (Cell Systems), at 37°C with 5% CO
