<p>A total of 32 animals were infected with different strains of ZIKV (ZIKV-H, ZIKV-PR, ZIKV-U) or vehicle to characterize the impact of infection on transcriptome of brain microvessels. Each group was composed of 8 animals, 4 males and 4 females. Animals were sacrificed at 2 dpi and whole brain tissue was submitted for microvessel isolation, as described above and elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Total RNA was isolated using the iPrep PureLink Total RNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA quantitation and quality analyses were performed using Qubit RNA HS Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit (Agilent Technologies). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. To evaluate fragment average and quantify libraries, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies), and a qPCR-based KAPA library quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems) were employed. Libraries were pooled into 20 pM final concentration and submitted to the sequencing reaction using the MiSeq Reagent kit (Illumina) and the MiSeq Sequencing System (Illumina). Reads were trimmed to remove low quality base at the ends and assembled using the CLC Genomics Workbench platform (Qiagen). The total gene hit counts and reads per kilobase million (RPKM) were calculated using the same platform. Gene expression data were compared between groups using the DESeq2 algorithm (
