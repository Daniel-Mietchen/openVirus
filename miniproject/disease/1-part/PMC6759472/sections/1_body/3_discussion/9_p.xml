<p>By studying different strains of ZIKV, we aimed to determine possible differences in viral tropism that lead to brain infection and neuropathogenesis. We found no significant difference between African and Asian strains regarding viral replication kinetics, viral burden, and neurotropism, with approximately 40â€“50% of infected animals having detectable ZIKV RNA in their brain tissue (
