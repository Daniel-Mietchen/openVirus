<p>In conclusion, our results indicate that ZIKV penetrates the brain parenchyma early after infection resulting in brain infection of approximately 40â€“50% of infected immunocompetent mice. However, increased permeability of the BBB does not appear to be the major mechanism for CNS entry of ZIKV, though changes in TJ protein expression and strain-dependent disturbances in BBB permeability were observed.</p>
