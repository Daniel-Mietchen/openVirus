<p>Infections of BMECs with other neurotropic flaviviruses, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Palus et al., 2017</xref>) and West Nile virus (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Roe et al., 2012</xref>) were also reported as not resulting in disruption of endothelial barrier function. On the other hand, WNV-induced alterations of the BBB 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> were shown to be transient and regulated by the interaction of the host with viral factors, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; e.g., viral RNA) (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cain et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Puerta-Guardo et al. (2019)</xref> described 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> endothelial cell permeability alterations induced by NS1 proteins of different flaviviruses, including ZIKV. Our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies revealed that significant changes in BBB permeability for NaF (molecular weight 376 Da) occurred only among animals infected with the Honduras strain. In addition, a clear trend between the presence of the neuroinfection and increased BBB permeability was observed in mice infected with ZIKV-H but not ZIKV-U or ZIKV-PR, indicating strain-specific effects (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> permeability results may be explained by the limitations of measurements of endothelial permeability with fluorescent dextran polymers. Another possibility may be lack in our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model other components of neurovascular unit, such as astrocytic foot processes and contributing microglial cells. Indeed, astrocytes are a critical component of the BBB microenvironment, and secreted products from activated microglial cells contribute to the infectious process (
