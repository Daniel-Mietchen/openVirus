<p>Brain infection was detected in 3 out of 6 mice infected with ZIKV-H or with ZIKV-PR, and in 5 out of 6 mice infected with ZIKV-U. Mean levels of ZIKV RNA showed tendency to be slightly lower in ZIKV-H-infected animals (2.8 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) compared to ZIKV-PR (1.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) and ZIKV-U (1.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/10
 <sup>6</sup> cells); however, the differences were not significant (
