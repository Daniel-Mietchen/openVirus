<p id="Par19">To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection. With clinical manifestation and radiological findings compatible with OP, a differential diagnosis should be considered among patients with influenza H7N9 infection at the second or third week after the initial viral infection, especially in patients with clinical condition deteriorated after controlling of primary influenza pneumonia. And a steroid dose of methylprednisolone 1.5â€‰mg/kg maybe suggested for treatment of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection. Our case provide clinical insight into refractory respiratory failure with lung involvement due to avian influenza H7N9. OP should be considered on the differential diagnosis of patients with fever and respiratory failure after severe influenza A H7N9 infection, where steroids might be useful.</p>
