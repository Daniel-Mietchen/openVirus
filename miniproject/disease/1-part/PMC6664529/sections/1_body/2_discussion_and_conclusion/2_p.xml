<p id="Par16">OP was originally described by Davison et al. in 1983 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (1), and in 1985, Epler et al. described the same entity as the term “bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia” (BOOP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Now, for avoiding confusion with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), the term organizing pneumonia (OP) is preferred [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In fact, OP is an non-specific inflammatory response from human body towards acute lung injuries. It can be with idiopathic nature, namely cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), or be associated with different clinical settings, such as infections (bacteria, virus, fungus or parasite), drugs (antibiotics, antiepileptics, immunomodulators), connective tissue disease, vasculitis or lung/marrow transplantation. Considering symptomatology, physical signs, laboratory and pulmonary function tests, radiologic or histomorphological findings, there is no obvious difference between COP and secondary OP, excepting the latter may have higher mortality [
