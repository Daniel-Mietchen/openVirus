 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, 13 previously published cases and the current case of OP associated with influenza virus infection were reviewed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. With available information, the age range was 24-year-old to 97-year-old with 64% (9/14) female. Influenza A constituted the majority (93%,13/14), with 8 cases were identified to H1N1, and the current case, H7N9. The other one case was OP complicated with co-infection of influenza B and Streptococcus. Respiratory failure associated with OP was reported in 64% (7/11) patient. Fever (27%, 3/11), dyspnea (36%, 4/11), cough (27%, 3/11) were the most common symptoms reported. Especially, clinical condition deteriorated after controlling of primary disease can be found in 64% (7/11) patients. GGO and consolidation were the main findings on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), shown in 50%(6/12) and 67%(8/12) of cases, with release of primary opacity associated with influenza infection in some cases. Autopsy were applied at about two weeks and most transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) or open lung biopsy (OLB) were applied over three weeks. Steroid was the main treatment, varying from prednisolone 30 mg/day to methylprednisolone 500 mg/day pulse therapy, with or without tapering. Most patients react well to the treatment with clinical and radiological improvement, excepting the relapsing of OP in our case.
