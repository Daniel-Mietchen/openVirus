Chest x-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moxifloxacin 400&#x02009;mg daily was administered for two days. And his condition deteriorated with dyspnea and severe respiratory failure, and the blood gas analysis showed PaO<sub>2</sub> was 58&#x02009;mmHg under oxygen mask with a FiO2 of 0.8. He was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) supported with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and intubated 3&#x02009;h later. Mechanical ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32&#x02009;cm H<sub>2</sub>O, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20&#x02009;cm H<sub>2</sub>O and FiO<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 could not maintain the oxygenation. As his PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio less than 50&#x02009;mmHg lasted for 3&#x02009;h, the venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was established. The microscopic examination, culture and galactomannan detection from serum and bronchial-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for virus PCR, fungal, and the culture for bacteria and the microscopic examination for bacteria and tuberculosis were done at ICU admission. The nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza H7N9 virus of sputum specimen turned out to be positive and oseltamivir phosphate was initiated (150&#x02009;mg twice daily for 2&#x02009;weeks after the PCR of the virus were negative for two consecutive tests.). As the PCT rose to 4.84&#x02009;ng/ml, and the galactomannan detection was positive (2.52 from serum sample and 1.21 from BALF sample), vancomycin, imipenem cilastatin and caspofungin were applied.

The patient turned to high fever in the following days. Repeated PCR for H7N9 virus were tested and show continuous negative in the lower respiratory samples after a week of ICU admission. Advanced antibiotics and antifungal agents were administered, no positive pathogenic result was emerged, and PCT level remained downtrend. The chest CT on day 17 shows bilateral GGO with aggravating consolidation on new areas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), compatible with organizing pneumonia (OP). Considering no underlying cause of OP existed other than virus infection, therefore, OP associated with H7N9 influenza virus infection was suspected. Methylprednisolone 80&#x02009;mg (1&#x02009;mg/kg) daily was applied on day 17 for 5&#x02009;days with tapering.

Methylprednisolone 80&#x02009;mg daily was applied at the beginning as a suspicion of the relapse of OP. And chest CT on day 33 revealed progression of consolidation especially in the lower lobe. As the patient&#x02019;s respiratory failure and condition did not improve after 5&#x02009;days of daily use of methylprednisolone 80&#x02009;mg, histological examination was done via open lung biopsy (OLB) on day 35, and OP was confirmed with the presence of intraluminal plugs of granulation tissue within alveolar ducts and surrounding alveoli associated with chronic inflammation of the surrounding lung parenchyma. The therapy of steroid was changed to methylprednisolone 120&#x02009;mg (1.5&#x02009;mg/kg) for 5&#x02009;days, 80&#x02009;mg for 7&#x02009;days, 40&#x02009;mg for 7&#x02009;days.

Influenza A constituted the majority (93%,13/14), with 8 cases were identified to H1N1, and the current case, H7N9. The other one case was OP complicated with co-infection of influenza B and Streptococcus. Respiratory failure associated with OP was reported in 64% (7/11) patient. Fever (27%, 3/11), dyspnea (36%, 4/11), cough (27%, 3/11) were the most common symptoms reported.

GGO and consolidation were the main findings on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), shown in 50%(6/12) and 67%(8/12) of cases, with release of primary opacity associated with influenza infection in some cases. Autopsy were applied at about two weeks and most transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) or open lung biopsy (OLB) were applied over three weeks. Steroid was the main treatment, varying from prednisolone 30&#x02009;mg/day to methylprednisolone 500&#x02009;mg/day pulse therapy, with or without tapering.

In a clinical study including 111 cases confirmed H7N9 virus infection, 76.6% were admitted to an ICU and 27% died. The median time from the exposure to disease onset was five days, then, 6.8&#x02009;days to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In dead cases, the median time from disease onset to death was 14&#x02009;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Half of the patients required mechanical ventilation and 21% need ECMO for severe respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, refractory severe respiratory failure caused by OP secondary to avian influenza H7N9 virus infection was first reported in this case.</p><p id="Par16">OP was originally described by Davison et al. in 1983 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (1), and in 1985, Epler et al. described the same entity as the term &#x0201c;bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia&#x0201d; (BOOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Now, for avoiding confusion with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), the term organizing pneumonia (OP) is preferred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In fact, OP is an non-specific inflammatory response from human body towards acute lung injuries. It can be with idiopathic nature, namely cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), or be associated with different clinical settings, such as infections (bacteria, virus, fungus or parasite), drugs (antibiotics, antiepileptics, immunomodulators), connective tissue disease, vasculitis or lung/marrow transplantation. Considering symptomatology, physical signs, laboratory and pulmonary function tests, radiologic or histomorphological findings, there is no obvious difference between COP and secondary OP, excepting the latter may have higher mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">OP has been linked to multiple influenza viral infections including influenza A and B, but this is the first report of avian influenza H7N9-associated OP with relapse occurrence and severe respiratory failure. The main clinical features of our avian influenza H7N9-associated OP is similar to the cases of influenza A cases. In these cases reported, OP onset mostly at the second to third week in the course of influenza, and occurred after the releasing of primary virus infection; And the OP is complicated with respiratory failure, and no evidence of other pathogen was found; And the main findings on HRCT for this kind of OP were GGO and consolidation. Biopsy were done via TBLB or OLB at the third week. In cases with influenza associated OP, other than common findings of OP, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), alveolar hemorrhage and edema and bronchiolitis can also be found, showing the lung injury of primary virus infection. However, in our case, the patient present with high fever as a main manifestation of OP, and had a relapse of respiratory failure associated with OP. A differential diagnosis of OP should be considered at the second to third week after the primary infection among patients with influenza H7N9 infection. Furthermore, there was no clear evidence of bacterial and fungus infection during the beginning of hospitalization. However, the levels of PCT and galactomannan showed significant increase after the patient was established with ECMO. The OP may also be caused by the nosocomial infection which was frequently complicated with severe influenza pneumonia.</p><p id="Par18">The majority of patients with OP show rapid responding to steroids. The introduced initial dose is prednisone 0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x02009;mg/kg, with tapering over 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;month. However, up to one-third patients may relapse in tapering period. For the current patient with avian influenza H7N9-associated OP, methylprednisolone 80&#x02009;mg (1&#x02009;mg/kg) daily was applied for 5&#x02009;days with tapering in the beginning of suspicion of OP. The patient showed rapid clinical and radiological improvement and was extubated on the fifth day of steroids applying. However, the patient deteriorated with high fever and refractory hypoxemia 10&#x02009;days later. With the confirmation of histological examination, steroid dose was increased to methylprednisolone 120&#x02009;mg (1.5&#x02009;mg/kg) daily for 5&#x02009;days. And OP was finally controlled without relapsing in follow-ups. Insufficient initial dose of steroid may contributed to the relapsing of OP before final diagnosis. Therefore, Post avian influenza H7N9 infection OP may responsive to a brief course (weeks) of moderate-to-high dose prednisone therapy.</p><p id="Par19">To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection. With clinical manifestation and radiological findings compatible with OP, a differential diagnosis should be considered among patients with influenza H7N9 infection at the second or third week after the initial viral infection, especially in patients with clinical condition deteriorated after controlling of primary influenza pneumonia. And a steroid dose of methylprednisolone 1.5&#x02009;mg/kg maybe suggested for treatment of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection. Our case provide clinical insight into refractory respiratory failure with lung involvement due to avian influenza H7N9. OP should be considered on the differential diagnosis of patients with fever and respiratory failure after severe influenza A H7N9 infection, where steroids might be useful.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ARDS</term><def><p id="Par4">Acute respiratory distress syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GGO</term><def><p id="Par5">Ground-glass opacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p id="Par6">Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OLB</term><def><p id="Par7">Open lung biopsy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OP</term><def><p id="Par8">Organizing pneumonia</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>No acknowledgement.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors made substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; reviewed and approved the final manuscript; and contributed significantly to this study.
