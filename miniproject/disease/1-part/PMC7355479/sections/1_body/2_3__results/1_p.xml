<p>The distribution of AIV HA serotypes was presented as the diversity of subtypes and ranged from three (H5, H9 and H12) in household chickens to ten (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H9, H12, H13 and H16) in migratory birds. Moreover, we also detected five subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H9 and H12) in resident wild birds, 7 (H1, H2, H4, H5, H9, H10 and H12) in nomadic ducks and eight (H1, H2, H4, H5, H8, H9, H12 and H13) in household ducks. In general, the H5 serotype was highly prevalent in all study locations (
