<p>The grouping of the HA sero-subtype distribution by the sampling site demonstrated that both hoars were the most infected hub by H5 and H9 in comparison to other sites. The following was found: 39.1% (9/23) in Hakaluki haor vs. 100% (17/17) in Tanguar haor vs. 100% (1/1) in Chattogram for H5 and 52.2% (12/23) in Hakaluki haor vs. 58.8% (10/17) in Tanguar haor vs. 100% (1/1) in Chattogram for H9 in migratory birds; 100% (1/1) in Hakaluki haor vs. 100% (3/3) in Tanguar haor vs. 62.5% (20/32) in Chattogram for H5 and 0% (0/1) in Hakaluki haor vs. 33.3% (1/3) in Tanguar haor vs. 31.3% (10/32) in Chattogram for H9 in resident wild birds; 86.7% (13/15) in Hakaluki haor vs. 69.6% (16/23) in Tanguar haor vs. 0% in Chattogram for H5 and 33.3% (5/15) in Hakaluki haor vs. 39.1% (9/23) in Tanguar haor vs. 0% in Chattogram for H9 in nomadic ducks; 50% (11/22) in Hakaluki haor vs. 76.9% (10/13) in Tanguar haor vs. 61.5% (8/13) in Chattogram for H5 and 18.2% (4/22) in Hakaluki haor vs. 53.8% (7/13) in Tanguar haor vs. 53.8% (7/13) in Chattogram for H9 in household ducks. It was found that sero-subtypes H1, H2, H3, H4, H6, H8, H10, H12, H13 and H16 were detected across the study sites in different bird types (
