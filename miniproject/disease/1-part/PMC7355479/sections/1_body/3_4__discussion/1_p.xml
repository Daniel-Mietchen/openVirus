<p>In the present study, multiple AIV HA sero-subtypes were detected in migratory birds, household ducks and nomadic ducks [
 <xref rid="B26-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which corroborates that waterfowl are the natural reservoir for a wide range of AIVs [
 <xref rid="B7-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,

 <xref rid="B12-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The highest HA sero-subtype diversity was observed in migratory birds, consistent with the fact that AIV diversity is driven by this group, which introduces new AIVs through migration. The finding that eight different HA serotypes circulated in resident wild birds in Bangladesh further suggested that resident wild birds may have been infected with AIVs from aquatic birds (migratory birds and household ducks) when they roosted at the same roosting sites of wetlands of Hakaluki and Tanguar Hoars and Chattogram. The resident birds are suggested to have played a role as accidental hosts of AIVs. The presence of multiple HA sero-subtypes in resident birds is supported by several previous studies from different parts of the world [
 <xref rid="B27-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The detection of fewer numbers of HA sero-subtypes in domestic chickens, which is similar to other studies [
 <xref rid="B5-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], is consistent with the fact that these birds are not yet identified as enzootic or natural hosts for a wide range of AIVs. However, the low number of sera from household chickens which were subjected to the serotype-specific analysis may lead to an underestimation of diversity which mandates further studies.
