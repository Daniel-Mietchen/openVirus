<p>The diversity of different subtypes varied among different wetlands. It was found that H2, H5 and H9 sero-subtypes were the most prevalent in Tanguar Hoar, whereas H1, H9, H6 and H12 sero-subtypes were predominantly found in Hakaluki Hoar. In Chattogram, H5, H9 and H12 sero-subtypes were frequently found among different bird types. These disparities of HA sero-subtypes can be partially explained by the variation of sampling location, mixing of bird types and the susceptibility to AIVs. The discrepancy is supported by a previous study [
 <xref rid="B35-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The common detection of H5 and H9 sero-subtypes in all sampling sites suggested that these subtypes are established in Bangladesh, whereas other subtypes may be more transient and potentially introduced by exotic migratory birds. AIV antibodies corresponding to multiple HA subtypes were frequently detected in individual birds in the present study. Moreover, previous studies reported more than one AIV subtype infecting individual wild ducks [

 <xref rid="B37-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These previous results, along with the sero-typing results in the current study, indicate that wild birds can be infected with more than one AIV subtype throughout their lives. The co-infection with more than one AIV subtype further increases the risk of virus reassortment. In the present study, multiple sero-subtypes were found in a single sample, which indicated that bird groups were exposed to multiple subtypes during their lifetime. However, the potential for cross-contamination of HA serotypes in the HI testing of the serum samples could have occurred, although the high cut-off HI titre was used to confirm the sero-positivity of different HA serotypes. Sero-surveillance offers estimates of the immunity of populations against preventable diseases such as AIV, and it is important to evaluate the immunity level of populations against certain diseases [
 <xref rid="B38-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, the correlation between the strength of an HI result and the possible time since a bird was infected is not straightforward. In general, HI titres decrease over time, but sometimes sub-clinical infection raises the antibody titre again, and reservoir species may also have some degree of immunity but still infect other susceptible species. The results of the present study therefore suggest that AIVs could spill over to resident or domestic birds from migratory birds and potentially spill back to migratory birds (for some HA sero-subtypes) from the resident or domestic birds. Therefore, it is likely that the AIV ecology in birds in Bangladesh allows for evolution (e.g., through reassortment), and it is important to identify warning signs which may point to the emergence of a potentially virulent AIV strain in domestic birds and highly transmissible AIVs to humans [
 <xref rid="B39-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, further studies are required to investigate the direction and extent of AIV exchange between wild and domestic birds. In addition, future molecular studies are required to determine the evolutionary patterns of AIVs in the country.
