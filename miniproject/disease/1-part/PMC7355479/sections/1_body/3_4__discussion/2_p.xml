<p>Irrespective of bird groups, H5 and H9 HA sero-subtypes were the most commonly detected sero-subtypes, which suggested that the birds at the study areas were in close contact (e.g., common roosting places), allowing the transmission of AIVs. This possibility is strongly supported by several reports [
