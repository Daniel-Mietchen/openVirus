<p>Avian influenza (AI) has pandemic potential, causes significant economic losses in poultry in Bangladesh and is of great concern to public health. The current study underlines the importance of sero-surveillance in wild and domestic birds. In the present study, the diversity of HA sero sub-types ranged from minimum in household chickens to maximum in migratory birds. In general, the prevalence of all HA sero-subtypes was higher in migratory birds in comparison with other bird types. Little variation of HA subtype patterns was observed in different sites and over the sampling years. Furthermore, the prevalence of the H5 sero-subtype was high in all locations. The findings of the present study showed a high diversity of HA subtypes circulating in diverse wild bird species (both migratory and resident). The findings also suggest expanding the current host range of the AIV reservoir, which may increase the probability of AIV reassortment and the emergence of novel strains. Continuous surveillance efforts for AIVs are recommended to fully understand the ecology and evolutionary patterns of HA subtypes in wild and domestic birds.</p>
