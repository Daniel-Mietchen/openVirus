 <xref rid="B23-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], virological or molecular studies do not capture the full temporal picture of AIV circulation and ecology. The viral shedding period in chickens and ducks is longer (up to 2 weeks), but still limited in time [
 <xref rid="B21-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, a sero-epidemiological study of avian influenza (AI) is justified to explore the exposure status of AIVs belonging to a broad range of hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes. Hence, the current study was conducted to understand the distribution and diversity of HA sero-subtypes of AI in different bird species including domestic and wild birds in Bangladesh.
