<p>Migratory wild birds visiting the Hakaluki (Moulavibazar) and Tanguar Hoar (Sunamganj) wetlands were sampled. Bangladeshi resident wild birds at roosting sites in the area of Hakaluki and Tanguar haors and Chattogram were sampled as well. Domestic birds such as household chickens, ducks and nomadic ducks (a group of free range ducks raised at the bank of waterbodies) were randomly sampled, at the rate of one bird per household (flock size: five to ten birds for chickens; four to ten birds for ducks) and five birds per nomadic flock (200 to 1000 birds per flock). All resident and migratory wild birds were caught using mist nets under the permission of the Wildlife Division of the Department of Forestry, Bangladesh.</p>
