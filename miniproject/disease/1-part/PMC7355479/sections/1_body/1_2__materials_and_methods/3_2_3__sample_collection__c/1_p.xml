<p>Blood samples were collected from each individual bird as previously described [
 <xref rid="B11-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Serum samples were initially evaluated using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) (AI Multi-screen kit; IDEXX Laboratory Inc., Westbrook, ME, USA, lot: AM688) according to the manufacturer’s instructions [
 <xref rid="B24-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and samples were considered as reactive when a sample had a mean value of 40% inhibition or more. Of the 2985 serum samples tested, 942 were c-ELISA AI antibody reactive. From the c-ELISA reactive samples, 170 (41 migratory birds, 36 resident wild birds, 38 nomadic ducks, 47 household ducks and 7 household chickens) were randomly selected for a haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. The HI test used a panel of inactivated AIV HA antigens (H1–H16) for this study, provided by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), to determine the distribution of AIV HA sero-subtypes infecting birds as previously described [

 <xref rid="B25-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sera showing inhibition at dilutions of 1:16 or greater against four haemagglutination units of AIV antigen were considered reactive for the antibody of migratory or resident aquatic wild birds as was previously reported [
 <xref rid="B24-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], whereas sera showing inhibition of 1:64 or more against four haemagglutination units of AIV antigen were considered reactive for domestic chickens and ducks as was previously reported [
 <xref rid="B25-vetsci-07-00073" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
