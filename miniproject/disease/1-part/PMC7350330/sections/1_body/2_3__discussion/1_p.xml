<p>Mosquito-based ZIKV and DENV surveillance in KPP was conducted in areas where Zikaâ€“human cases were reported recently. Among the four endophilic mosquito genera caught, the majority were 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (40.8%). Only female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were subsequently tested for ZIKV and DENV, as they are considered the major vectors to transmit these viruses. A total of 488 mosquitoes were captured from 86 trap-days (5.7 mosquitoes/trap). This is considerably high since mosquito collections were performed within 72 h after receiving information about human cases of ZIKV from the local hospitals. Local regulations required all houses with confirmed DENV or ZIKV cases to be sprayed with an adulticide within this time period. Surprisingly, both ZIKV and DENV infected mosquitoes were found in adulticide sprayed houses (index houses).
