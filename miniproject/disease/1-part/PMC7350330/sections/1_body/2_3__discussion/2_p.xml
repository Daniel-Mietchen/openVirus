<p>ZIKV was detected in two 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> samples from the same mosquito specimen collected from a Zika index house. Based on a sequence analysis of the E gene, which has been used to classify ZIKV into African and Asian lineages, the ZIKV detected in this study was of the Asian lineage [
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Analysis showed the ZIKV sequence was 100% identical to previous human cases of ZIKV reported in Thailand during 2016–2017 [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This confirms that the same ZIKV lineage was still circulating in Thailand. The Asian lineage is presently responsible for various global outbreaks, including outbreaks in Thailand [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. No virus was detected in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> specimens but this may be due to the low number of specimens (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) collected in this study. Since the mosquito traps were set inside houses, it was not surprising that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was collected less frequently since it is more exophilic than 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a recent report from Thailand, both 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were screened for ZIKV and ZIKV was detected in female, male and larvae of field-caught 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> collected around active ZIKV patients’ houses [
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. That study also did not detect ZIKV in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic>
