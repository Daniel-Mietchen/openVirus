<p>This study demonstrates the importance of entomological surveillance for public health programs and to provide guidance to mosquito-borne disease prevention and control. The entomological surveillance is crucial for the planning, implementation, and monitoring of vector control programs. Both adult and larval control measures should be conducted focusing on index houses which can serve as major hubs for transmission of the virus during an outbreak. In this study, disease vectors and infected mosquitoes were captured in index houses although vector control, including adulticide and larvicide application, was performed in homes within 24 h after cases of human disease were confirmed. Therefore, a surveillance system for efficacy of vector control operations (e.g., mosquito sentinel, larval bioassay, etc.) is warranted. This system will provide a warning to local public health officers regarding the effectiveness of the current vector control program.</p>
