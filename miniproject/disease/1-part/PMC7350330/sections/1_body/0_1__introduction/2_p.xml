<p>DENV has been postulated to have emerged about 1000 years ago in an infectious cycle involving non-human primates and mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The first human case of DENV (DENV-1) was isolated in Japan in 1943 [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Afterwards, outbreaks of four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) have been reported globally [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold during the past five decades, with 50–100 million new infections estimated to occur annually in more than 100 endemic countries. These infections generally occur in tropical and sub-tropical regions [
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although more recently, DENV has been reported from previously unaffected, more temperate areas such as France, Croatia, Portugal and other European countries [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. DENV incidence in Thailand has been reported since the 1950s [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and several major outbreaks with high morbidity have been documented since then. According to the WHO, during 2004–2010, Thailand was ranked sixth among the 30 most highly dengue-endemic countries in the world [
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. One of the largest DENV epidemics in Thailand was in 1987 with 174,285 cases and 1008 deaths. Recently, more than 72,000 dengue cases with a fatality rate of 0.13% were reported in 2018 to the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. All four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) are reported to circulate in Thailand with a recurrent circulation of each serotype [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The Department of Disease Control—part of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), Thailand—reported that the major DENV serotypes causing illness in 2017 were DENV-1 and DENV-4. In 2018, DENV-1 remained the dominant serotype and the incidence of DENV-4 decreased.
