<p>Mosquitoes are vectors of various flaviviruses, which are enveloped, positive-sense single stranded RNA viruses (Family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, Genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>). The most important mosquito transmitted flaviviruses are the dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses. Among them, DENV, ZIKV and JEV circulate widely in Southeast Asia, including Thailand [

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, with 
 <italic>Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti</italic> serving as the major vector and 
 <italic>Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus</italic> as a secondary vector; whereas JEV and WNV are predominantly transmitted by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes [

DENV infections can be classified as dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) according to the severity of symptoms. DHF and DSS can be fatal if appropriate treatments are not provided, making the disease a significant public health concern, especially in endemic areas. Due to the self-limiting nature of the illness and low mortality rates, infection with ZIKV has generally caused less of a significant public health impact than dengue, since its first identification. Although typically milder than infection with DENV, there are two severe ZIKV disease complications of note: Guillain–Barre syndrome and meningoencephalitis. After the Brazilian ZIKV outbreak in 2015, public health scientist noted Guillain–Barre syndrome and a drastic increase in the number of infants with microcephaly born to mothers with the ZIKV infection meningoencephalitis, causing widespread alarm, especially among pregnant women [
