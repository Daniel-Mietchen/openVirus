<p>ZIKV was first isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest, Uganda in 1947 and later from a pool of 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> mosquitoes collected in the same forest [

 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In 1975, Moore et al. reported the first ZIKV isolation from a patient with febrile illness from Nigeria, as well as the isolation of the virus from specimens collected in 1968 [

 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Starting in 2009, active ZIKV circulation has been identified in Cambodia [

 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The first report of ZIKV in Thailand was in 2013 from reports of infections in Canadian, German and Japanese travelers returning from the Southern part of Thailand [

 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Later, a retrospective investigation by the Thai MOPH confirmed autochthonous ZIKV cases in several different provinces across Thailand during 2012â€“2014, indicating wide-spread distribution of ZIKV in the country [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ZIKV isolated from this study was from the Asian lineage and is closely related to an isolate from the 2013 French Polynesia outbreak [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00442" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the Bureau of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Disease Control, Thai MOPH, in 2016 and 2017, more than 1600 confirmed ZIKV-infected cases were reported from different regions across the central, north, east and west of Thailand [
