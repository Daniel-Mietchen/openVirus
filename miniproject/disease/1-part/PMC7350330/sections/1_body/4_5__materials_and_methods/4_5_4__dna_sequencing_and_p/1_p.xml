<p>For nucleotide sequencing, the total RNA extracted from the ZIKV and DENV real-time RT-PCR positive samples were subjected to the RT-PCR with sequencing primers (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00442-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) using a SuperScript
 <sup>®</sup> III One-Step RT-PCR System with a Platinum
 <sup>®</sup> Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, Bio-Rad). The reaction mixture contained 1× reaction mix, 0.4 μM of each forward (ZIKENVF or D1) and reverse primer (ZIKENVR or D2), 1 μL of SuperScript
 <sup>®</sup> III RT/Platinum
 <sup>®</sup> Taq Mix, and 5 μL of the total RNA in a final volume of 25 μL. The thermal cycling conditions were set as a reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by an initial denaturation of cDNA at 94 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 54 °C for 30 s, and an extension at 68 °C for 45 s, followed by a final elongation step at 68 °C for 10 min. The PCR products of 365 bp and 511 bp, for ZIKV and DENV, respectively, were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under a gel documentation system (Gel Doc
 <sup>TM</sup> XR+ imaging system, Molecular Imager
 <sup>®</sup>, Bio-Rad). The PCR products were extracted from gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified DNA was sequenced using the forward and reverse primers. Sequencing chromatograms were inspected and processed using BioEdit 7.0.4.1. [

Nucleotide sequences were queried against the NCBI database using BLAST and aligned with published reference sequences using ClustalW in BioEdit. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA, version 7.0.21) [
