<p>BG Sentinel traps (Biogents AG, Regensburg, Germany) baited with 1 kg of dry ice and BG-lure containing ammonia, lactic acid and caproic acid, were used to collect mosquitoes. Traps were placed inside 34 houses, including houses with ZIKV reported cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) and neighboring houses within a 50 m radius of Zika index houses (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25). Based on the feeding behavior of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, traps were continuously operated to collect daytime biting mosquitoes for 8 h (0800–1600). Mosquito collection was conducted no longer than 72 h after receiving information about human cases of ZIKV from the local hospitals. Mosquito samples in each trap were stored in a cooler containing dry ice for transportation to the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) Entomology laboratory in Bangkok, where the samples were further processed. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified to species under the stereomicroscope [
