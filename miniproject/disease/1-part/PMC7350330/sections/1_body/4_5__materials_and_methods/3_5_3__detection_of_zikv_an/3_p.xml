<p>The real-time RT-PCR detection of ZIKV and DENV was done using a ZDC Multiplex RT-PCR Assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The real-time RT-PCR reaction contained 1× iTaq
 <sup>TM</sup> Universal Probes One-Step Reaction Mix, 0.6 μL of iScript
 <sup>TM</sup> Reverse Transcriptase, 1× ZDC Multiplex PCR Assay Mix and 5 μL of the total nucleic acid in a final volume of 25 μL. The thermal cycler (CFX96TM Real-Time System) with conditions of 50 °C for 15 min, 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 40 s and 68 °C for 30 s was set.
