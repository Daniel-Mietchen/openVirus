<p>The presence of ZIKV and DENV in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes collected from houses recently sprayed with adulticide has implications for public health and vector control measures in areas at risk for flavivirus transmission. Since there are no effective vaccines or specific therapeutic treatments for DENV and ZIKV infections, vector control is the only effective tool to mitigate disease transmission. Vector surveillance before and after vector control is essential to validate the efficacy of the control measures employed. Our study suggests that a single application of non-residual adulticide alone may not be sufficient to reduce the risk of further spread of ZIKV by controlling the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vector. Routine entomological surveillance is essential for the planning and implementation of an effective vector control program.
