<p>A partial envelope sequence of R012 (MN527290) was compared with other ZIKV strains using multiple sequence alignment. The genetic relationship was analyzed by construction of a phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00442-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The result showed that the R012 sequence belonged to the Asian lineage ZIKV clade (nucleotide sequence identity â‰¥ 96%) and the alignment is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-09-00442">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. In addition, the E gene sequence was 100% identical to the sequence from a ZIKV detected in a citizen from Thailand, reported in 2016 (MG548660.1), from patient serum collected in 2017 from Thailand (MK237998.1), and the sequence from a ZIKV-infected Japanese tourist, who visited Thailand in 2017 (LC369584.1) [
