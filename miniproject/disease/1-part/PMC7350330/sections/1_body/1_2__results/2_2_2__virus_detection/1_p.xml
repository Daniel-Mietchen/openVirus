<p>A total of 282 samples from 141 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> females (130 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 11 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>) were screened for ZIKV and DENV. Each female mosquito was separated in two parts (head-thorax and abdomen) to determine virus dissemination. Both samples were tested from each mosquito. ZIKV and DENV RNA was detected only in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> collected from houses that had recent human cases of ZIKV. No ZIKV or DENV RNA was detected in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from surveyed households within a 50 m radius from detected human cases. A TaqMan
 <sup>Â®</sup> real-time RT-PCR and ZDC multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay detected a ZIKV genome in three samples (R012, R013 and R015) from two 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females (1.4%, 2/141). A partial ZIKV envelope gene was amplified from two samples from the same mosquito (R012, head-thorax and R013, abdomen) by a conventional RT-PCR. DNA sequencing was performed and analyzed by a BLAST search; sequences were identified as ZIKV and shared 100% sequence identity. Four 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> females (2.8%, 4/141) were DENV positive by real-time RT-PCR. Analysis of partial capsid/prM sequences identified three DENV-1 (R248, R251 and R290) and one DENV-4 (R097). The DNA sequences obtained from this study were submitted to the NCBI database and the accession numbers were assigned as MN527290 for R012 (ZIKV), and MN527286, MN527287, MN527288 and MN527289 for R097, R248, R251 and R290 (DENV), respectively.
