  <p>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of Zika virus (ZIKV) partial envelope gene (331 bp). The E gene sequences of ZIKV (R012) found in this study are indicated with black circles. Accession numbers of all reference sequences are provided in the phylogenetic tree. Bootstrap values &gt; 50% are indicated at nodes. A scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions per site. A sequence of Spondweni virus was used as an outlier.</p>
