 <caption>
  <p>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of dengue virus (DENV) partial capsid/prM gene (395 bp). All DENV capsid/prM sequences found in this study were indicated with black circles. All accession numbers of reference sequences are provided in the phylogenetic tree. Bootstrap values &gt; 50 are indicated at nodes. A scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions per site. Yellow fever virus was used as an outlier.</p>
