<p>The three ZIKV outbreaks in the French West Indies provided an ideal situation to look for ways to improve prediction of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases using historical data. Indeed, CHIKV outbreaks had been observed in the same locations about two years before ZIKV, CHIKV is also transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, and both viruses spread in a region where the populations were immunologically naive at first. Furthermore, all epidemics were observed by the same routinely operating GP-based surveillance networks, and the three locations benefit from a mature public health system, with easy access to medical consultation and individual means of protection. Last, pest control is done in routine, with additional intervention showing limited efficacy in this context [
