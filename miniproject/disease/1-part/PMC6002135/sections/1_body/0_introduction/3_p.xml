<p>Here, we show that past outbreaks of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases can substantially improve the epidemiological assessment of diseases transmitted by the same vector from early surveillance data. We introduce a hierarchical statistical model to analyze and extract information from historical data and obtain 
 <italic>a priori</italic> distributions for required epidemiological parameters [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The method is illustrated with ZIKV outbreaks in the French West Indies between December, 2015 and February, 2017, using historical data regarding CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics in French Polynesia and the French West Indies between 2013 and early 2015. We assess the improvement in predictability of several operational indicators using different choices of 
 <italic>a priori</italic> distribution and according to epidemic progress.
