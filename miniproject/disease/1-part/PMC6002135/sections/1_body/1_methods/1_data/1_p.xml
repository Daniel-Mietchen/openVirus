<p>Surveillance data on the 2015–2017 ZIKV epidemics in Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint-Martin was collected by local sentinel networks of general practitioners and reported weekly by the local health authorities (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Cases of ZIKV infection were defined as “a rash with or without fever and at least two signs among conjunctivitis, arthralgia or edema”. We obtained numbers of suspected cases by week for each island, extrapolated from the number of active sentinel sites (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and 20 cases in Saint-Martin). Following this description, we defined the “
 <italic>S</italic>”(-tart) of the epidemic as the first week above this threshold, the “
 <italic>P</italic>”(-eak) date when incidence was the highest, and the “
 <italic>E</italic>”(-nd) of the epidemic as the third consecutive week below the threshold (to ascertain the downwards trend). The time interval from “
 <italic>S</italic>” to “
 <italic>E</italic>” corresponds to the period of “high epidemic activity”.
