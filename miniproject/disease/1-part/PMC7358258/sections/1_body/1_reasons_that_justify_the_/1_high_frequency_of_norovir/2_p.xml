<p>However, it is highly likely that the reported incidences of NoV infection and disease grossly underestimate the true values. In low-income countries, reliable methods used to detect NoV, such as those based on molecular biology, are frequently not available, and most of the diarrhoeal cases, even among those hospitalized, remain aetiologically undefined. The same is true for most of the cases that are too mild to be hospitalized or seen in the emergency room that occur in industrialized countries. On the other hand, even in studies specifically devoted to analyzing NoV epidemiology, asymptomatic cases may not be identified unless systematic periodic stool examination is performed.</p>
