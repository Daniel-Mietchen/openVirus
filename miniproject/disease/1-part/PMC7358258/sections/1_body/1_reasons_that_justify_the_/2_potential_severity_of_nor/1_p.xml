<p>Although NoV infection can remain asymptomatic in 20–30% of cases or lead to a mild disease (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), spontaneously resolving in 2–3 days in the majority of patients (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), severe AGE is not rare. NoV is the cause of 10–20% and 1–15% of emergency room visits and hospitalizations in middle/high-income countries and in low-income countries, respectively. Moreover, more than 3% of patients with a NoV diarrhea episode can die, as shown by the evidence that among the 677 million cases diagnosed in 2010 worldwide, 213,515 died (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As expected, the risk of severe NoV AGE is increased in children &lt;5 years old and in elderly individuals. Moreover, immunocompromised patients are at increased risk. This population is a third group of subjects for whom the availability of a vaccine might be very important, although their condition limits a relevant immune response and protection. Forty-three percent of deaths that occurred in 2010 occurred in children &lt;5 years old (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Moreover, in elderly people, dehydration leads to intensive care unit admission, and in some cases, death is relatively common (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Finally, in immunocompromised patients, such as those with solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, NoV infection can become chronic and last from weeks to years. This chronicity leads to prolonged virus shedding and gastrointestinal disease that can become increasingly debilitating and lead to death (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A study of 123 deaths associated with NoV infection revealed that 10 of these cases occurred in patients immunocompromised because of chemotherapy or transplantation (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
