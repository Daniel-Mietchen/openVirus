<p>All the above-mentioned factors explain both the difficulties in finding an effective universal vaccine and the frequent AGE outbreaks due to the same NoV genotype. This last problem has been clearly evidenced with NoV GII.4, the most frequent cause of AGE outbreaks. Since the 1990's, every 2â€“3 years, a new GII.4 variant has emerged, causing at least 7 NoV AGE epidemics in different geographic areas (

Among those recently identified, the most common are some viruses derived by a recombination process, such as GII.P16-GII.4 Sidney, GII.P16-GII2, GII.P4 New Orleans-GII.4 Sydney, GII.P12-GII.3 and GI.P6-GI6, which were associated with significant outbreaks in the USA, Asia and Europe (
