<p>Genetic analysis of the entire genome or individual virus genes has led to the identification of seven NoV genogroups. Moreover, studies of the sequences that encode for the capsid protein VP1 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase have shown that in each genogroup, several genotypes are included. Presently, over 30 genotypes have been identified. Genogroups I (GI), II (GII), and IV (GIV) are defined as the human NoVs because the NoV AGEs that occur in humans are exclusively due to strains included in these serogroups (

An analysis of 16,635 sequences of NoV specimens collected between 2005 and 2016 in Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa from outbreak investigations and sporadic AGE cases revealed that 91.7% belonged to genotype GII, 8.2% to GI and &lt;0.1% to GIV (

Moreover, genotypes included in a single genogroup can have slight but important differences in antigenic characteristics. Finally, single genotypes may frequently experience point mutations and recombination events that produce antigenically different variants (
