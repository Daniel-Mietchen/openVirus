<p>The availability of an immune marker able to indicate whether an individual is protected from an infection and related disease can significantly contribute to the development of a vaccine by benefiting evaluation of potential vaccine efficacy. Unfortunately, no reliableimmune correlate of protection from NoV infection and disease valid for all the people has been identified. The use of total serum NoV-specific antibody levels was debated. After infection, NoV-specific antibody concentrations tend to increase in most patients (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and in an epidemiological study, serum NoV-specific antibody levels were inversely correlated with protection from NoV AGE development (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, in general, pre-infection antibody levels were not associated with protection (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).
