<p>The development of this bivalent vaccine has subsequently continued with the implementation of several studies. A phase II trial (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) involving 454 adults was planned to evaluate what dosage of each antigen could offer the best balance of tolerability and immunogenicity. It was found that a vaccine containing 15 μg of GI.1 VLP and 50 μg of GII.4 VLP was the best solution, as, compared to a 50 μg/50 μg preparation, it was followed by a lower incidence of adverse events (64 vs. 73%) and a higher GII.4 response, although the response to GI.1 was slightly lower. However, in both cases, immune responses to vaccination were rapid, peaking by days 7–10 and persisting through day 28.
