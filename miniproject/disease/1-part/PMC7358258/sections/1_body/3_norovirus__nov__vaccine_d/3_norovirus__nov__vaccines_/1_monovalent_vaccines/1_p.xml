<p>An intranasal vaccine containing a GI.1 VLP adjuvanted with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) was initially prepared. It was found to induce virus-specific serum antibodies in the majority of vaccine recipients. Moreover, when adults that received two doses of this vaccine were challenged with the virus included in the vaccine and compared with previously unvaccinated subjects, it was shown that the risk of NoV infection and of developing AGE were significantly reduced in vaccine recipients compared to those in controls (61% vs 82%: p=0.05 for infection; 37% vs 69%: p=0.006 for disease) (

In particular, it was shown that the immune response to the vaccine was strictly dose dependent and that the frequency of NoV-specific IgG- and IgA-secreting B cells in peripheral blood and the level of antibodies produced by these cells in culture were significantly higher in adults that received 100 μg of GI.1 VLP than in those given 50 μg (
