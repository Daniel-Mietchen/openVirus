 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies in animal models have shown that this trivalent vaccine could induce high levels of NoV- and RV-type specific serum antibodies with high avidity (&gt;50%) and intestinal antibodies. Moreover, cross-reactive antibodies against NoV and RV types not included in the vaccine, cell-mediated immunity for both viruses and mucosal antibodies that inhibited RV were detected (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) in which the addition of RV VP6 was made to a bivalent NoV vaccine based on GI.4 and GII.4-2006a VLPs. In BALB/c mice, immunization with suboptimal doses of VLPs, alone or in combination, was not capable of evoking NoV-specific antibody production. In contrast, co-administration of VP6 led to the development of a significant immune response with high levels of homologous and heterologous antibodies.
