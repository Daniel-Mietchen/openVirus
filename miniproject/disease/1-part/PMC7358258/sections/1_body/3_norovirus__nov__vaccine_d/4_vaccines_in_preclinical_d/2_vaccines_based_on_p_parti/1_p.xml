<p>NoV vaccines based on P particles can be effective in preventing NoV infection. This fact is suggested by a comparative study (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>) in which a group of neonatal animals that received an intranasal preparation of VLPs or P particles, both derived from GII.4 strain VA387, and a group of controls previously infected with the same virus were utilized. Subsequent challenge with GII.4 revealed that the risk of diarrhea was lower in vaccinated animals than in those with natural infection (82.9%), although the risk was slightly higher in animals given VLPs (46.7%) than in those receiving P particles (60%).
