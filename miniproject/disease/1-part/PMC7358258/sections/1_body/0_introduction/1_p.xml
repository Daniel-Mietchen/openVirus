<p>Soon after its identification in 1972, norovirus (NoV) has been indicated as one of the most common causes of outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and sporadic acute diarrhea episodes in subjects of any age (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The development of effective rotavirus (RV) vaccines and their introduction in the official pediatric immunization schedules has made, at least in countries where these vaccines have been largely used, the epidemiologic relevance of NoV even more evident (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Several studies have highlighted the enormous medical, social and economic problems caused by NoV disease and the need for the development of adequate preventive measures against this virus. However, the development of specific antivirals, theoretically useful to interrupt outbreaks or to avoid infection in subjects at increased risk, has been very difficult if not totally impossible for many years due to the lack of adequate cell lines for viral culture and successful animal models for drug evaluation. Although recent advances in culturing human NoV lead us think that, in the future, effective anti-NoV drugs will become available, it is clear that only the availability of safe and effective vaccines can face and definitively solve all the problems related to NoV infection (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This perspective is strongly highlighted by the decision of the World Health Organization that stated in 2016 that the development of a NoV vaccine should be considered an absolute priority (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Unfortunately, the development of an effective NoV vaccine has proven extremely difficult, and only in recent years, some preparations have been tested in humans in advanced clinical trials (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In this paper, reasons that justify efforts to develop a NoV vaccine, difficulties encountered during NoV vaccine development, and NoV vaccine candidates will be discussed.
