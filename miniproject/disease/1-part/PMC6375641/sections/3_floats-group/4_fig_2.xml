  <p>Panels A to E show the average number of RNA copies within each competition group for outbreak isolates (black bars) and COAV997-5nt (grey bars) quantified by qRT-PCR in the bodies of singly and dually infected mosquitoes at 14 dpi. Number of samples is shown at the top of each column in parentheses. Statistical significance is indicated as “ns” for P&gt;0.05 and double asterisk for P≤0.01 as determined by Mann-Whitney test.</p>
