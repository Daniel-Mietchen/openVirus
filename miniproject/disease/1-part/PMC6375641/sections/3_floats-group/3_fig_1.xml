  <title>Percentage of 
   <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> bodies (A) and expectorants (B) positive for each outbreak isolate and/or COAV997-5nt viral RNA following competition.

   <italic>Cx</italic>. 
   <italic>tarsalis</italic> bodies and cell-culture amplified expectorants were analyzed by concurrent qRT-PCR for the presence of viral RNA. Columns indicate the percentage of infected mosquitoes containing RNA for either the outbreak isolate (black color), COAV997-5nt (grey color) or both virus strains (grey with black stripes) within each competition group. The number of samples positive within each competition group was included in parentheses at the top of each column.
