  <title>RNA profiles of dually infected HOFIs.</title>
  <p>Sera from six dually challenged HOFIs per competition group obtained between 1–7 dpi (x-axis) were analyzed by qRT-PCR for quantification of outbreak (black bars) and COAV997-5nt (grey bars) RNA. Bars with each competition group in panels A to E show the mean viral RNA copies as log
   <sub>10</sub> in HOFI sera (y-axis) with standard deviations expessed as error bars. Degree of statistical significance between RNA copies from outbreak and COAV997-5nt virus was determined by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test and indicated for each day with an asterisk (* P ≤ 0.05); no asterisk included for P &gt; 0.05 (no significance). Panel F shows the percent survival on 0–14 dpi.
