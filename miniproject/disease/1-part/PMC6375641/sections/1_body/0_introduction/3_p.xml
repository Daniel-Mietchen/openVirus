<p>Adaptive changes in arboviruses typically appear to be driven by viral diversification within mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], with subsequent expectoration of unique virus populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] followed by purifying selection in vertebrate hosts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Studies with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), for example, have shown that epizootic strains of VEEV originated from enzootic strains, but possessed less than 2% genetic diversity encoding for increased replicative phenotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Enzootic isolates of WNV collected between 2007–08 from different regions of California possessed less than 0.2% genetic diversity and demonstrated increased replicative fitness compared to an isolate made during the initial introduction of WNV into California in 2003 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Included in this study was a spring isolate from 2008 preceding the epidemic in Los Angeles that exhibited elevated fitness and virulence similar to the NY99 phenotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As a follow-up to these findings, five WNV isolates made during epidemics from 2004–2012 were assessed herein to determine if increased replicative fitness may facilitate amplification and thus be predictive of future outbreaks.
