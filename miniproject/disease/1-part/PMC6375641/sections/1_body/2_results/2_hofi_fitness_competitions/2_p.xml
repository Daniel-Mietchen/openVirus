<p>Following serial blood collection between 1 and 7 dpi, the RNA of the outbreak strains and COAV997-5nt were quantified in HOFI sera using concurrent qRT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Based on RNA loads, all challenged HOFIs developed dual viremias indicating replication of both outbreak isolate and COAV997-5nt, albeit to varying levels. To determine which virus exhibited higher replicative fitness on each dpi, the mean RNA copy numbers from outbreak and COAV997-5nt viruses from HOFIs in each group were analyzed by a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (
