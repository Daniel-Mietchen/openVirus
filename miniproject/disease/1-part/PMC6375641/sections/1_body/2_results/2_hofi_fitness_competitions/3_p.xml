<p>With the exception of SAYO-05-912, outbreak isolates showed higher levels of replication on 2 and 3 dpi compared to COAV997-5nt as indicated by greater mean number of RNA copies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3A and 3C–3E</xref>). In addition, the duration of viral RNA shedding was longer for GRLA-04-1624, KERN-07-291, GRLA-11-6246 and SAYO-12-772 when compared to COAV997-5nt (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3A and 3C–3E</xref>) in concurrently-inoculated HOFIs. In contrast, the SAYO-05-912 outbreak isolate exhibited neutral fitness compared to COAV997-5nt between 2–6 dpi, as indicated by similar RNA copy numbers (P ≥ 0.05) and the persistence of detectable RNA from both virus strains in sera through 6 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Mortality following acute WNV infection was low and without significant differences among the virus competition groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). There were no deaths recorded among birds in the GRLA-04-1624 and SAYO-12-772 competition groups; one HOFI each died in groups SAYO-05-912 (7 dpi), GRLA-11-6246 (6 dpi) and KERN-07-291 (7 dpi) following competition against COAV997-5nt (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Overt neurological signs were not observed for any of the challenged HOFIs. Across all competition groups, replication of the outbreak strains and COAV997-5nt peaked on 3 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3</xref>). When comparing the means of peak replication of all outbreak isolates to COAV997-5nt, a significantly (P = 0.008) greater RNA load of 4.1±0.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> RNA copies was observed for outbreak strains compared to 2.6±0.4 log
 <sub>10</sub> RNA copies for COAV997-5nt (
