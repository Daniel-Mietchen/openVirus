<p>Interestingly, the level of COAV997-5nt replication was lower in mixed infections during the current study (

Because HOFIs for the three sets of competitions were trapped near Bakersfield within the same vineyards and were all hatch-year birds, the mean RNA loads from COAV997-5nt were compared with regard to year of capture (
