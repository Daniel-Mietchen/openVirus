<p>Mortality in HOFIs during the current five outbreak competitions was not different from mortality rates observed with COAV997 and COAV997-5nt infections alone and combined [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and was decreased compared to several enzootic California isolates evaluated from 2007–08 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and to the WNV NY99 strain in HOFIs collected during 2003 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although virulence and mortality rates were not elevated in HOFIs in the current competitions, WNV outbreak isolates (except for SAYO-05-912) replicated to higher RNA copy numbers compared to COAV997-5nt. The magnitude and duration of RNA present in sera potentially indicated a commensurate viremia which would be important for oral mosquito infection and subsequent transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Interestingly, peak RNA loads were significantly lower for both COAV997-5nt and outbreak isolates in HOFIs that were trapped in 2012 compared to RNA loads in HOFIs collected from the same sites in 2010–11 when co-infected with the same stock of COAV997-5nt, wild type WNV of similar fitness, and using the same challenge protocol [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This may be due to decreased competence of the local HOFI population as a consequence of rising natural resistance against WNV and/or a result of host-pathogen co-evolution previously observed in HOSPs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Following invasion of the NY99 genotype into North America in 1999, high avian virulence and mortality were hallmarks of WNV infection, with HOFIs developing viremias up to 8 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU per mL sera [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. With the emergence of the WN02 genotype; however, the host competence indices of HOSPs for NY99 significantly decreased over time, with lower viremia and mortality rates compared to infection with more recent SW03 and WN02 genotype isolates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Between 2003 and 2012, there was a 22% WNV infection prevalence in dead California HOFIs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and a decline in population abundance since the arrival of WNV in the state [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], possibly increasing selection pressure on these birds for resistance. This could be one reason for observing reduced HOFI competence for WNV in the current study. Our competition model has the advantage of revealing fitness differences among WNV strains through intra-host competition, therefore minimizing the confounding effects of differences in host immune response. This also presented a limitation of our study, because we used a single moderately competent avian host and vector species in our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> competition model without inclusion of low- or high-competence hosts and vectors.
