<p>The goal of the current study was to evaluate the replicative fitness of WNV isolated during five California outbreaks from 2004 to 2012 by competition against COAV997-5nt in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic> and HOFIs. Our findings demonstrated that isolates from four out of five outbreaks replicated more efficiently in HOFIs compared to COAV997-5nt (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3</xref>), but mortality and viral RNA loads were significantly lower compared to previous WNV isolates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], presumably due to decreased competence of HOFIs trapped during 2012 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Similar to our previous study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], competition in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic> resulted in varying numbers of singly and dually infected mosquito bodies, but infection and expectoration rates were not dominated by one virus strain over the other (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g002">2</xref>). Similar to our previous findings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the amount of viral RNA found in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic> bodies was not a reliable determinant of viral fitness, because RNA copy differences between outbreak and COAV997-5nt viruses were either not significant or not proportionate to the virus that infected greater numbers of bodies and expectorants (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g002">2</xref>). Salivary glands are the final site of WNV replication within 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic> and secretion of infectious virus in the expectorant determines potential WNV transmission during subsequent blood feeding on susceptible hosts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although significantly greater COAV997-5nt than KERN-07-291 RNA copy numbers were found in mosquito bodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), equal numbers of females expectorated either KERN-07-291 or COAV997-5nt viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating equal transmission, despite greater COAV997-5nt replication. It is possible that the higher infection rate and subsequently larger sample size may have resulted in this difference compared to other groups. Overall, competitions in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic> did not result in the complete displacement of the outcompeted virus as both strains were retained and transmitted within all mosquito groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">Fig 1</xref>).
