<p>Infection, sampling and qRT-PCR assay methods essentially followed Worwa et al. [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Outbreak and reference viruses were competed within dually infected hosts, with wild type and the labelled COAV997-5nt clone detected by concurrent qRT-PCR assays. Briefly, equal concentrations of plaque forming units (PFU) of COAV997-5nt (8.34 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU per mL stock) and each outbreak isolate (stock titers in
