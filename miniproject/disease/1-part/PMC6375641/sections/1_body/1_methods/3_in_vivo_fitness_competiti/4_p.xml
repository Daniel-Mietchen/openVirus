<p>Mosquito bodies were homogenized twice for two minutes at 24 Hz using a Tissue Lyser (Qiagen, USA) and the suspension clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 × g and 4°C for 10 minutes. 
 <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> expectorants were amplified by one passage in Vero cell culture to enhance detection of low amounts of viral RNA. Nucleic acids were extracted from HOFI sera, mosquito homogenates and amplified expectorants using a MagMAX-96 Viral RNA isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). A previously described qRT-PCR assay was utilized for specific detection and quantification of viral RNA in mixed competition samples based on five nucleotide polymorphisms in the envelope gene region of COAV997-5nt [
