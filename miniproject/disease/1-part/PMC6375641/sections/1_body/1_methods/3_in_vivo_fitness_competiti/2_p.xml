<p>Fitness competitions in mosquitoes were performed using the KNWR laboratory-adapted colony of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic>, established in 2002 from collections made at the Kern National Wildlife Refuge, Kern County, California, which were reared in an insectary at 22째C with a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) hours. Females were transferred to a BSL-3 insectary and sugar starved for 24 hours prior to exposure to an infectious blood meal containing 7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU per mL of each competition group. Blood meals were composed of heparinized WNV seronegative chicken blood spiked with 8 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU per mL of a 1:1 mix of outbreak isolates and COAV997-5nt, thereby diluting the virus mixture 10-fold in the blood meal. Sugar starved females were allowed to feed for 1 hour in the dark on pre-warmed blood meals offered through a Hemotek membrane system (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, Lancashire, UK). Five fully engorged females were frozen at -80째C immediately following blood meal exposure and were used for infectious blood meal analysis. The remaining blood-fed females were maintained at 26째C, 12:12 (L:D) and 60% humidity and daily offered a 10% sugar solution on cotton pads. After 14 days, all surviving females were anesthetized using triethylamine (Fisher Scientific, USA) to collect expectorants and then bodies as described previously [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Expectorants were collected from 32 females per group using the capillary tube method. The remaining females were immediately frozen at -80째C and used to enhance sample sizes to estimate viral infection and numbers of RNA copies of each virus.
