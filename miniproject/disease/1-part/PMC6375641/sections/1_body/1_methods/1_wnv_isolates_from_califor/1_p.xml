<p>Isolates of WNV were made from mosquito pool homogenates collected as part of the California Mosquito-Borne Encephalitis Virus Surveillance Program that had tested positive for WNV RNA by qRT-PCR [

Supernatant from the selected mosquito pool homogenates was propagated once in African Green Monkey kidney cells (Vero cells; ATCC no. CCL-81) to generate sufficient material for all competition studies. The location, collection date, mosquito species, Ct value of the original mosquito pool homogenate, and infectious titer following Vero cell culture amplification were summarized in
