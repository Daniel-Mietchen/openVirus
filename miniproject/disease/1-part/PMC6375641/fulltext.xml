Epidemics of WNV are difficult to predict due to the multitude of factors influencing transmission dynamics among avian and mosquito hosts. Typically, high levels of WNV amplification are required for outbreaks to occur, and therefore associated viral strains may exhibit enhanced virulence and mortality in competent bird species resulting in increased mosquito infection prevalence. In our previous study, most WNV isolates made from California during 2007&#x02013;08 showed increased fitness when competed in House Finches (HOFI, <italic>Haemorhous mexicanus</italic>) and <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> Coquillett mosquitoes against COAV997-5nt, a genetically marked recombinant virus derived from a 2003 California strain. Herein, we evaluated the competitive fitness of WNV strains isolated during California epidemics in 2004, 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2012 against COAV997-5nt. These outbreak isolates did not produce elevated mortality in HOFIs, but replicated more efficiently than did COAV997-5nt based on quantification of WNV RNA copies in sera, thereby demonstrating increased competitive fitness. Oral co-infections in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>tarsalis</italic> resulted in similar virus-specific infection and transmission rates, indicating that outbreak isolates did not have a fitness advantage over COAV997-5nt. Collectively, WNV isolates from outbreaks demonstrated relatively greater avian, but not vector, replicative fitness compared to COAV997-5nt, similar to previously characterized non-outbreak isolates of WNV. Our results indicated that ecological rather than viral factors may facilitate WNV amplification to outbreak levels, but monitoring viral phenotypes through competitive fitness studies may provide insight into altered replication and transmission potential among emerging WNV strains.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>West Nile virus (WNV) is the cause of the largest mosquito-borne epidemic in the United States in recent history, with over 46,000 reported human cases to date, including &#x0003e;2000 deaths. Since the detection of WNV in California in 2003, repeated outbreaks have been associated with explosive WNV amplification in local mosquito and bird populations. Along with climatic and ecological factors, vector-host-pathogen interactions are potential drivers of WNV epidemics and warrant study. Here, we evaluated the competitive fitness of five WNV isolates made during Californian outbreaks from 2004&#x02013;2012 by co-infection of <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> mosquitoes and House Finches against a 2003 founding virus strain. Results indicated that competitive fitness in HOFIs was greater for four of the outbreak isolates, but coincidentally elevated mortality was not observed and viral RNA loads were lower compared to previously studied enzootic strains of WNV. Mosquito competitions resulted in levels of infection and transmission that did not differ among strains.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-AI55607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6878-9787</contrib-id><name><surname>Reisen</surname><given-names>William K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Swiss Foundation for Grants in Biology and Medicine</institution></funding-source><award-id>PASMP3-137034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Worwa</surname><given-names>Gabriella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PBBEP3-128345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Worwa</surname><given-names>Gabriella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded, in part, by grant RO1-AI55607 from the US National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/">https://www.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>, WKR), grant PBBEP3-128345 from the Swiss National Science Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>, GW) and grant PASMP3-137034 from the Swiss Foundation for Grants in Biology and Medicine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx">www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>, GW).

Outbreaks of WNV in North America generally have occurred during the warm summer and fall months, when transmission spills over to include humans and other susceptible mammals [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since its invasion of California in 2003 [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], WNV has not only adapted to and persisted in diverse habitats [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but also has caused several epidemics, impacting public, veterinary and wildlife health [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Most regions of California now have experienced either year-round or repeated seasonal WNV activity [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Epidemics have been associated with intense WNV amplification and historically have followed a three-year pattern of introduction, rapid amplification and then subsidence [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Factors linked to WNV outbreaks have included above average temperatures and drought conditions, leading to enhanced virus transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Warming temperatures increase vector blood feeding frequency and shorten the extrinsic incubation period of the virus and in California are linked with reduced rainfall that results in increased domestic irrigation and mosquito production from urban drainage systems.</p><p>Rapid amplification also may relate to phenotypic differences between enzootic and epidemic isolates of WNV that enhance avian host and vector infection, facilitating transmission[<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. High titer avian viremias, associated with elevated mortality in certain avian hosts, are required to produce efficient mosquito infection [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and have been a hallmark of WNV epidemics in North America [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Avian virulence in American crows has been related to single nucleotide polymorphisms in the NS3 and NS1-2B proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After the 2004 WNV epidemic in Los Angeles, elevated passerine seroprevalence and corvid de-population were associated with limited WNV transmission during successive years [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the progressive loss of passerine flock immunity and corvid population recovery led to WNV resurgence in 2008 and again in 2011 [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Alternatively, decades of pathogen-host co-circulation may have led to a trade-off between a reduction in avian susceptibility as previously shown for House Sparrows (HOSPs; <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>) and increased WNV virulence leading to stable host competence [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interestingly, the competence of several <italic>Culex spp</italic>. populations from California for the NY99 strain of WNV did not change significantly during WNV outbreak years compared to non-outbreak years [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggesting that epidemics were not linked to changes in vector competence.</p><p>Adaptive changes in arboviruses typically appear to be driven by viral diversification within mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], with subsequent expectoration of unique virus populations [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] followed by purifying selection in vertebrate hosts [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Studies with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), for example, have shown that epizootic strains of VEEV originated from enzootic strains, but possessed less than 2% genetic diversity encoding for increased replicative phenotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Enzootic isolates of WNV collected between 2007&#x02013;08 from different regions of California possessed less than 0.2% genetic diversity and demonstrated increased replicative fitness compared to an isolate made during the initial introduction of WNV into California in 2003 [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Included in this study was a spring isolate from 2008 preceding the epidemic in Los Angeles that exhibited elevated fitness and virulence similar to the NY99 phenotype [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As a follow-up to these findings, five WNV isolates made during epidemics from 2004&#x02013;2012 were assessed herein to determine if increased replicative fitness may facilitate amplification and thus be predictive of future outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>WNV isolates from California epidemics</title><p>Isolates of WNV were made from mosquito pool homogenates collected as part of the California Mosquito-Borne Encephalitis Virus Surveillance Program that had tested positive for WNV RNA by qRT-PCR [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. One homogenate each was selected from outbreak years 2004, 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2012 from regions of California with high transmission activity (<xref rid="pntd.0007135.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and increased incidence of human cases.

Our findings demonstrated that isolates from four out of five outbreaks replicated more efficiently in HOFIs compared to COAV997-5nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g003">Fig 3</xref>), but mortality and viral RNA loads were significantly lower compared to previous WNV isolates [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], presumably due to decreased competence of HOFIs trapped during 2012 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Similar to our previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], competition in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>tarsalis</italic> resulted in varying numbers of singly and dually infected mosquito bodies, but infection and expectoration rates were not dominated by one virus strain over the other (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g002">2</xref>). Similar to our previous findings [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the amount of viral RNA found in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>tarsalis</italic> bodies was not a reliable determinant of viral fitness, because RNA copy differences between outbreak and COAV997-5nt viruses were either not significant or not proportionate to the virus that infected greater numbers of bodies and expectorants (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g002">2</xref>). Salivary glands are the final site of WNV replication within <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>tarsalis</italic> and secretion of infectious virus in the expectorant determines potential WNV transmission during subsequent blood feeding on susceptible hosts [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although significantly greater COAV997-5nt than KERN-07-291 RNA copy numbers were found in mosquito bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), equal numbers of females expectorated either KERN-07-291 or COAV997-5nt viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating equal transmission, despite greater COAV997-5nt replication. It is possible that the higher infection rate and subsequently larger sample size may have resulted in this difference compared to other groups. Overall, competitions in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>tarsalis</italic> did not result in the complete displacement of the outcompeted virus as both strains were retained and transmitted within all mosquito groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>Mortality in HOFIs during the current five outbreak competitions was not different from mortality rates observed with COAV997 and COAV997-5nt infections alone and combined [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and was decreased compared to several enzootic California isolates evaluated from 2007&#x02013;08 [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and to the WNV NY99 strain in HOFIs collected during 2003 [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although virulence and mortality rates were not elevated in HOFIs in the current competitions, WNV outbreak isolates (except for SAYO-05-912) replicated to higher RNA copy numbers compared to COAV997-5nt. The magnitude and duration of RNA present in sera potentially indicated a commensurate viremia which would be important for oral mosquito infection and subsequent transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Interestingly, peak RNA loads were significantly lower for both COAV997-5nt and outbreak isolates in HOFIs that were trapped in 2012 compared to RNA loads in HOFIs collected from the same sites in 2010&#x02013;11 when co-infected with the same stock of COAV997-5nt, wild type WNV of similar fitness, and using the same challenge protocol [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This may be due to decreased competence of the local HOFI population as a consequence of rising natural resistance against WNV and/or a result of host-pathogen co-evolution previously observed in HOSPs [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Following invasion of the NY99 genotype into North America in 1999, high avian virulence and mortality were hallmarks of WNV infection, with HOFIs developing viremias up to 8 log<sub>10</sub> PFU per mL sera [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. With the emergence of the WN02 genotype; however, the host competence indices of HOSPs for NY99 significantly decreased over time, with lower viremia and mortality rates compared to infection with more recent SW03 and WN02 genotype isolates [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Between 2003 and 2012, there was a 22% WNV infection prevalence in dead California HOFIs [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and a decline in population abundance since the arrival of WNV in the state [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], possibly increasing selection pressure on these birds for resistance. This could be one reason for observing reduced HOFI competence for WNV in the current study. Our competition model has the advantage of revealing fitness differences among WNV strains through intra-host competition, therefore minimizing the confounding effects of differences in host immune response. This also presented a limitation of our study, because we used a single moderately competent avian host and vector species in our <italic>in vivo</italic> competition model without inclusion of low- or high-competence hosts and vectors.</p><p>Collectively, the competitive fitness of outbreak WNV isolates associated with five California epidemics between 2004 and 2012 was not markedly different compared to enzootic wild type isolates [<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] indicating that additional ecological and environmental factors were necessary to trigger WNV amplification to epidemic levels. Similar to the 2012 WNV epidemic in the Dallas-Fort Worth area which was not tied to increased WNV virulence[<xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], above-average temperatures and reduced rainfall may have enhanced transmission by mosquitoes and warrants further study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Brian Carroll and Amy Jobe from the Arbovirus Field Station in Bakersfield, CA for trapping House Finches and providing care and husbandry prior to transfer to UC Davis.
