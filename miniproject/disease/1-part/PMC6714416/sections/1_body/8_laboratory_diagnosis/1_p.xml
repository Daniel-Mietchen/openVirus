<p>As ZIKV infection presents with atypical features, mimicking other arboviral infections, clinical assessment alone is unpredictable and definitive diagnosis is based on laboratory parameters. Patients presenting with acute onset fever, cutaneous exanthema, myalgia, or arthralgia after recent (previous 2 weeks) trip to a ZIKV endemic region should be assessed simultaneously for ZIKV infection.[
