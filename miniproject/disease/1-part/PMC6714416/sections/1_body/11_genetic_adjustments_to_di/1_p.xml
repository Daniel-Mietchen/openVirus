<p>The published research of 1991 dealt with genetic isolation of A. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquito phenotype, showing resistance to flavivirus infection.[
 <xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] Detection of resistant versus susceptible mosquito phenotypes may demonstrate genetic disparity. The induction of strains that are nonsusceptible to infection and also do not cause viral dissemination into the mosquito breeding sites may serve as a probable mode to alleviate the ZIKV transmission. Although, this is still a conceptual idea, inherited adjustment of wild type
