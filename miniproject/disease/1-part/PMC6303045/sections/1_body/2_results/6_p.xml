<p>In comparison, we also investigated and compared the performance of the stacking model with imbalanced and balanced datasets. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207777.g004">Fig 4</xref> only showed the average performance containing all types. (Details can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207777.s003">S3 File</xref>) It suggested that the stacking model with imbalanced datasets comprehensively presented slight better performances over balanced datasets by all three different feature generation methods except for the sensitivity on five epitope-based method. It was implausible that the evenly distributed datasets negatively contributed to the performance of the model. This was probably due to the small-scale balanced samples we extracted for training and testing, which was not a lot to learn for classifiers. Indeed, the insufficient antigenic data in different periods would set obstacles on the performance of the model. Even though, our stacking model has successfully predicted antigenic relationship between strains based on limited data. Moreover, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207777.g005">Fig 5</xref> showed the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve with a significant proportion of area under curve (AUC) of 0.915 by the stacking model. The AUC value illustrated the matching degree with the experiment data ranging from 0 to 1 and the larger of the value, the better of the matching level. These outcomes demonstrate that the stacking model built upon epidemics and pandemics not only performs better than models using other classifiers in the experiments, but also achieves comprehensive improvement compared with the results of single models in
