<p>Since the occurrence of 1918 Spanish pandemic, the influenza H1N1 has been evolving and circulating up to now. The rapid mutations of the antigenicity of influenza A virus are unceasingly causing other epidemics or pandemics that severely threaten public health. In this work, we analyzed and compared the mutation patterns of HA1 protein from six periods defined by the characterization of epidemics and pandemics. The moving average position information entropy and Pearson Correlation Coefficient were applied on mutation patterns analysis. Due to the scarce data of strains in period 1, the analysis of mutation patterns of period 1 was excluded. The results in

But the overall variation trend indicates the distinct patterns of epidemics or pandemics in different periods, which is in accordance with update of influenza vaccines every year [
