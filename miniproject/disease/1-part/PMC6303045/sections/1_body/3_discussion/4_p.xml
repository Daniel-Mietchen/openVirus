<p>Even if we could obtain good performance on the prediction results based on different influenza epidemics and pandemics, there are still some space on the improvement of specificity and sensitivity. For example, the sensitivity is low in some of the constructed models, especially for the prediction of Type II. (See in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207777.s003">S3 File</xref>) One crucial factor is the limited antigenic data we can collect and the imbalanced classes of similar and distinct pair of strains. We may bring in penalty mechanism or assign unequal weight distribution on samples in the training process to tune the bias towards the minority class. Nevertheless, this stacking model validates its feasibility and reliability on the prediction of antigenic variants of H1N1 influenza A virus. The analysis also raises the perspective of how to select a proper model when predicting the antigenic variants for influenza viruses in different types with few antigenic data available. The model based on the chronological evolutionary paths of H1N1 that caused epidemics and pandemics with closest possible genetic relations could provide a suitable choice to target antigenic variants. Meanwhile, the stacking model built on diverse epidemic and pandemic periods of antigenic data would capture more comprehensive mechanisms behind antigenic variation. Our future work moves towards the improvement of these models and the identification of potential virulent sites that can distinguish the formation of epidemics and pandemics caused by influenza H1N1 viruses.
