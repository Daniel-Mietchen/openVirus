<p>Hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay is the primary method to determine the antigenicity of influenza viruses and quantitative antibody titers for vaccine selection [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, HI assay is a labour-intensive and time-consuming method, which prompts the development of computational techniques for the prediction of antigenic similarity between antisera and antigens to identify the antigenic variants. The phylogenetic trees combined with antigenic cartography remains prevailing in antigenic analysis. Smith et al. constructed an antigenic map to determine the antigenic evolution of influenza A H3N2 virus from 1968 to 2003 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lorusso et al. used antigenic cartography to analyze the antigenic properties of 2008 H1 viruses and demonstrated that the viruses in the different phylogenetic clusters are also antigenically divergent [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The antigenic patterns and evolution of human influenza A (H1N1) viruses were investigated by Liu et al., who inferred the antigenic clusters from a large-scale sequence data covering the whole epidemic history of H1N1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Bedford et al. and Du et al. constructed the maps of the global circulation patterns of seasonal flu strains and antigenic evolution, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These previous works depicted the evolutionary paths of influenza and provided the foundation for computational models of antigenicity prediction. Sequence-based methods and imputation-based methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] are the most common methods for antigenic prediction. For example, Ren et al. applied random forest regression and support vector regression to identify antigenicity-associated sites in the hemagglutinin protein of A/H1N1 seasonal influenza virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Yin et al. detected the potential critical virulent sites in past pandemic strains using rule-based methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Besides, one of the most crucial factors for the success of influenza vaccination is the timely determination of emerging influenza virus antigenic variants. Sun et al. provided a novel, experimentally validated, computational method for determining influenza virus antigenicity based on HA sequences [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Yao et al. proposed a joint random forest method for predicting influenza H3N2 antigenicity from hemagglutinin sequence data [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Qiu et al. incorporated the structural context of HA protein to calculate the antigenicity for influenza virus A/H3N2 with an accuracy of 0.875 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. By building a universal model for all HA subtypes of influenza A viruses based on conserved antigenic structures, Peng et al. achieved an accuracy of 0.77 for predicting antigenic variants of avian influenza H9N2 viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, Richard Neher et al. showed the antigenic differences measured by serological data are well described by antigenic changes along the path connecting viruses in phylogenetic trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It allows predicting antigenicity from HA sequences by mapping on the trees. Luksza and Laessig developed a fitness model for haemagglutinin that predicts the evolution of the viral population, which maps the adaptive history of influenza A and suggests guidance for vaccine selection [
