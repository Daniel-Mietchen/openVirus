<p>Influenza is an infectious disease that poses significant threat to public health worldwide, especially H1N1 of influenza A virus, which caused several pandemics in history, e.g. the 1918 Spanish flu, leading to millions of deaths [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Except for the pandemics, epidemics also cause about 250,00 to 500,000 deaths per year around the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the most important proteins that characterize influenza A viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HA is responsible for binding the virus to host cells with sialic acid on the membranes [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and NA functions as a tetramer that cleaves sialic acid from cells and virion glycoproteins to prevent clumping of released viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the accumulation of antigenic shift or drift within HA proteins results in new strains of virus which can not be inhibited effectively by antibodies originally targeted at previous strains and thereby causes new epidemics or pandemics. HA protein cleaves into two chains, namely, HA1 and HA2. HA1 mutates much more frequently than HA2 and is subject to strong selection for novel variations [
