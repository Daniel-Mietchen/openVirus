<p id="Par7">Influenza vaccination is recommended each fall for all persons aged 
 <underline>&gt;</underline> 6 months in the U.S. and should continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating in the community. Previously unvaccinated children aged 6 months through 8 years require two doses 1 month apart. Since influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) to prevent medically attended illness varies from year-to-year by vaccine strain, age, prior immunity, and immune function, some vaccinated individuals can become symptomatic with influenza virus infection. However, several studies have reported influenza vaccine effectiveness in reducing illness severity, including reducing severe illness in persons aged 
 <underline>&gt;</underline> 65 years [

 <underline>&gt;</underline> 65 years compared to unvaccinated individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. One study reported that duration of ICU hospitalization was reduced a half-day in patients aged 50–64 years who had received influenza vaccination compared with unvaccinated patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A study across all age groups in Spain reported influenza VE of 58% in reducing the risk of severe influenza requiring hospitalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A Southern Hemisphere study reported influenza VE of 82% in reducing influenza-associated ICU admissions among adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] while a study in Spain showed an adjusted influenza VE of 23% in preventing ICU admission and death [
