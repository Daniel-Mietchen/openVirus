<p id="Par12">A recent meta-analysis reported that influenza antigen detection tests that produce rapid results had very high specificities (&gt; 98%), but sensitivities were highly variable compared with RT-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) without an analyzer device had only moderate sensitivity (53–54%), RIDTs that utilize an analyzer device (digital immunoassays) had moderately high sensitivity (77–80%), and rapid influenza molecular assays (nucleic acid detection) had high sensitivity (92–95%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Low sensitivity of RIDTs for detecting influenza virus in ICU patients has been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Recently, a systematic analysis of rapid influenza molecular tests from 29 studies reported pooled sensitivity and specificity of 87.9% and 97.4%, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Therefore, antigen detection assays, such as rapid influenza diagnostic tests and immunofluorescence assays, are not recommended for hospitalized patients with suspected influenza because of their lower sensitivities, unless molecular assays are not available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Negative results for influenza based on tests with low sensitivity (e.g., RIDTs, immunofluorescence assays) should not be used to make clinical decisions. Instead, negative test results should be followed up with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other influenza molecular assays to confirm results, and antiviral treatment should continue until results are available.
