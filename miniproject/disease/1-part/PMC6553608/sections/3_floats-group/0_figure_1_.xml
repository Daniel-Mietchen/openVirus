 <caption>
  <p>PB2 phylogeny of a stratified sample of all influenza subtypes. Tips in the circular neighbour-joining tree are coloured by host: blue, avian; pink, swine; orange, human; green, canine; brown, equine; purple, bat. The rings from inner to outer are: host-type, haemagglutinin subtype (H-type), neuraminidase subtype (N-type) and continent of isolation. The tree shows (clockwise) bats at the root, the avian—Eurasian lineage with many subtypes, human seasonal H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 spread through all the continents, H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 swine influenza, the H1N1 pandemic swine influenza lineage in humans and swine, and the avian—Americas lineage with many subtypes.</p>
