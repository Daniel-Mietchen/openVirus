<p>Phylogeographic studies indicated that the HA multi-basic cleavage site was estimated to have been inserted into an LPAI H7N9 lineage circulating in the Yangtze River Delta region around May 2016, which later went on to reassort with one of the other H7N9 clades in the Pearl Delta region and H9N2 [
