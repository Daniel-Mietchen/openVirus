<p>A nationwide vaccination programme for poultry in China was begun in September 2017 by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] with subsequent testing of post-vaccination immunization, and also continued surveillance. The overall post-vaccination rate of immunization was in excess of 80% (the target was 70%) although there was a considerable variation between provinces. Only a few (11 out of over 80 000 in December 2017) samples from birds or their environment tested positive for H7N9, and there were only three human cases of H7N9 in the time period (September 2017â€“June 2018) expected to show a sixth wave of human infection, compared with over 700 the previous year. The risk of spread of H7N9 to surrounding countries in Southeast Asia is still considered to be moderate via live bird trade, but low for poultry products and negligible for onward spread via wild birds [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. The small number of positive poultry samples found in the winter of 2017/2018 and near-absence of a sixth seasonal burst of zoonotic infections suggest that the policy of mass poultry vaccination has been successful in reducing the prevalence and risk of infection from H7N9 viruses.
