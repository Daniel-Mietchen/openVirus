<p>In this brief history of bird flu, we have seen that current avian influenza virus strains have been circulating and diversifying in wild bird populations for at least the last 100 years. Wild migratory birds can transport IAV along their migration routes, and contact between wild and domestic avian populations sometimes results in transmission between the two. Direct transmission of the virus from wild birds to humans appears to be very rare (or non-existent), presumably due to the low frequency of contact between the two populations; however, transmission from domestic avian species to humans does occur, especially in live bird markets in Asia. It is clear that H5 and H7 viruses have the capacity to evolve (on multiple occasions) an HPAI phenotype, probably as result of transmission in high bird density settings and the susceptibility of chicken and other domestic Galliformes species. In recent years, one such H5 lineage has become widely established in Asian domestic bird populations. Both H5 and H7 HPAI viruses have been sporadically transmitted to humans from domestic poultry, and (for H5 at least) been transmitted back into wild populations. However, because HPAI does not necessarily kill its anseriform hosts, reassortment with co-circulating LPAI viruses can occur, furthering evolution of the virus, while the low severity symptoms allow the long-range and intercontinental transport of the disease.</p>
