<p>Looking to the future, we should expect the emergence of more HPAI strains. Experience teaches that this has previously occurred somewhere in the world approximately once or twice per decade; and the fundamental driver of leaving H5 and H7 LPAI viruses uncontrolled in a host-dense environment until de novo mutation into HPAI forms occurs has not been removed. Also, it seems quite possible that HPAI H5 will continue to circulate and diversify, especially for clade 2.3.4.4 because it does not necessarily cause severe clinical signs in its wild hosts and is therefore capable of silent spread. Hence increasing biosecurity and vaccination in domestic poultry are likely to be important strategies to keep outbreaks in these populations to a minimum. Ongoing avian influenza virus spill-overs into human cases suggest that zoonotic bird flu is a continued threat to human health; however, the apparent success of the H7N9 vaccination programme in China suggests that it is possible to control virus circulation in domestic birds and thus vastly reduce the number of human infections and the risk of ongoing human to human spread. Therefore, if we continue the disease surveillance programmes in avian, human and other domestic animal populations, and control avian influenza in domestic avian populations, then we can surely reduce the risks of a new human avian influenza pandemic.</p>
