<p>In some senses, the dynamics of human influenza in humans and avian influenza in birds are similar—both can be thought of as stratified into layers with different connectivity: age for humans—with locally moving children and long-range moving adults; and domestic and wild species for birds—with domestic birds moving via trade and Anseriformes by long-range migration. However, unlike human IAV, where reassortment between the few dominant subtypes is rare, reassortment is a common feature for avian IAVs, especially in wild bird populations. Consequently, avian IAVs are far more diverse and more easily generate novel strains than the more specialized human viruses.</p>
