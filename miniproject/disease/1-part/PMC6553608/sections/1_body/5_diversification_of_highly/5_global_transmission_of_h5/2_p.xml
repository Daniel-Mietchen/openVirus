Both phylogeographic analysis of sampled sequences and knowledge of bird migration patterns indicated that the virus was transported by migrating wild Anseriformes from the eastern Asia region, up to the summer breeding grounds in the north by the East Asian flyway, and then down into Europe via the East Atlantic flyway or to North America via Beringia (Pacific and Central flyways) [
