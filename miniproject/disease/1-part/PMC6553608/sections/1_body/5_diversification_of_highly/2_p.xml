<p>Since its first detection in 1996, the HPAI H5N1 Gs/Gd virus lineage has undergone reassortment of internal protein-coding segments and diversification of the HPAI H5 gene into ten major clades [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. In clade 2, there are several sub-lineages that are notable for the number of birds they have infected, their geographical spread, and spill-over to humans, including 2.1.3 (Indonesia), 2.2.1 (Egypt), 2.3.2 (Southeast Asia), 2.3.4 (widespread) [

Although the H5 HA is paired with an N1 NA for most outbreaks and continued circulation, sub-clade 2.3.4.4 is unusual for HPAI H5 Gs/Gd in that it has been undergoing frequent reassortment with LPAI strains since 2008. In the process, sub-clade 2.3.4.4 HAs have acquired N2, N5, N6 or N8 NAs, and these viruses are collectively known as H5NX [
