<p>In Asia from 2014 onwards H5NX lineages continued to circulate in wild and domestic bird populations, and as well as H5N8, two different H5N6 reassortant lineages were detected in Sichuan and Jiangxi provinces of China, respectively in 2014 [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Both of these lineages spread within poultry in China [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C197" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>], and to wild bird populations [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. One of the lineages, having acquired internal protein-coding segments from H5N1/H7N9 lineage viruses, and a neuraminidase N6 with a stalk deletion (a poultry adaption), has also caused sporadic human infections [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. Clade 2.3.4.4 viruses generally, and especially H5N6, seem to be successful in poultry populations in China and have spread to other Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam, Laos and Korea [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. It is also likely that H5N6 has been transmitted on the East Asian–Australian flyway by wild migratory birds [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>], since Japan has been bombarded with H5N6 reassortants [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>], and it is also possible that H5N6 was introduced into The Philippines via wild birds for the first time in the summer of 2017 [
