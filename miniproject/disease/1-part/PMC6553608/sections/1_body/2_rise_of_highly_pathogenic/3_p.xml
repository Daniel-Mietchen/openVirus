<p>Over 20 years ago, phylogenetic analysis of HA sequences indicated that HPAI strains had independently evolved on separate occasions from ancestral LPAI viruses [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This has since been confirmed by many detailed sequencing analyses of outbreaks where direct LPAI precursors have been identified, even down to individual poultry sheds (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]). Dhingra 
 <italic>et al.</italic> performed a meta-analysis of H5 and H7 outbreaks from 1959 to 2015 and found 39 independent LPAI to HPAI transition events [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], and the majority of these (37 out of 39) were associated with commercial poultry farming. As HPAI in poultry has a rapid onset and high mortality rate, farm outbreaks can be short lived, partly because a large percentage of the birds die in a few days, but also because HPAI is a notifiable disease with mandatory control measures, including culling remaining birds and movement bans to limit the spread to neighbouring areas [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, on some notable occasions HPAI outbreaks have caused major losses in domestic birds (see [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for a review up to 2008). Apart from the widespread HPAI H5s originating in Asia from 1996 onwards, and the associated H7s which are described in detail next, other outbreaks resulting in huge impacts (i.e. the death or destruction of more than 1 million birds) include: Pennsylvania, USA 1983 (H5N2) [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], Italy 1999 (H7N1) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], The Netherlands 2003 (H7N7) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] and British Columbia, Canada 2004 (H7N3) [
