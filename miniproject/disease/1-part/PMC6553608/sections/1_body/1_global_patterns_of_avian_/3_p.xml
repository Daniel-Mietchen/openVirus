<p>Transmission between places and host species can be inferred by phylodynamic and phylogeographical analyses [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and these techniques are particularly suitable for understanding avian influenza systems since they make use of the fast-evolving viral sequence data to reveal dispersion patterns (see 
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="RSTB20180257BX2">box 2</xref> for details). Phylogeographic analyses have revealed the role of migratory wild birds in the intra-continental circulation of LPAI in North America [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Similarly phylogeographic techniques have also been used to show the effects of HPAI H5N1 transportation by different bird species across Asia [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] and that the spread of LPAI H9N2 strains in Asia was a combination of long-range distribution by wild birds coupled with more localized spread via the domestic bird trade [
