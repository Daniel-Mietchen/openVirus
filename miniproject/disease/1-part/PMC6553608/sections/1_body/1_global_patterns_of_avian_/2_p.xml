<p>Water fowl, especially Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans) and Charadriiformes (gulls, terns and sandpipers), are thought to be the natural reservoir of IAV [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and infection in these host species is not only typically low pathogenic but can be asymptomatic [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It has also been shown that migratory birds may carry HPAI as well as LPAI viruses asymptomatically over long distances [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For example, remote sensing and phylogenetic analyses showed that the distribution of H5N1 viruses in Eastern Asia followed wild bird migratory flyways in the time period 2003–2012 [
