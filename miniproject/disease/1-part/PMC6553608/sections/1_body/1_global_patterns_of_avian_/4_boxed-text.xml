  <title>Inference of transmission routes using phylodynamics and phylogeography.</title>
 </caption>
 <p>Viral sequence data sampled over a period of time, spatial locations and different host species can be used to infer transmission patterns (e.g. [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>–
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180257F3">figure 3</xref>). Typically for IAV, time-scaled phylogeny reconstruction is often performed using the programme BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] in which trees and relaxed molecular clock models used to represent the relationship between genetic distance and time, and other parameters, are jointly inferred. 
 </p>
 <p>To infer transmission rates between discrete locations or hosts, or to model subtype changes (for example, the change of NA subtype with respect to a tree made from HA sequences), phylogenetic analysis with discrete traits can be used [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], where transitions from one state to another are inferred along the phylogeny as a continuous time Markov chain model [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] (e.g. H5N1 in Asia [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and H7N3 in North America [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). Discrete trait analyses can be extended by parameterizing the transition rate matrix as a log–linear function of various potential covariates in a generalized linear modelling framework, to identify the host species or environmental factors associated with the observed spatial spread [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>–
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. When the additional feature of interest is continuously distributed, e.g. location as latitude and longitude, Brownian random motion walks can be used to model the diffusion of the trait along the tree corresponding to the dispersal history of the pathogen [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The impact of environmental factors on virus dispersal can be estimated by correlating the distances along branches of the trees with the ‘resistances’ resulting from the diffusion path through landscapes of environmental variables using R package SERAPHIM [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].
 </p>
 <p>In addition to trait-based approaches, BASTA [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and MASCOT [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] make use of structural coalescent approximations [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] to reconstruct evolutionary trees while considering the size of the different sub-populations involved in the meta-population, improving inference of the migration rates between sub-populations. Finally, by combining epidemiological data and recent phylogenetic inference techniques, several methods such as SCOTTI [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], Outbreaker [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and Beastlier [
  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] are now able to reconstruct, with some success, the transmission tree of only partially observed epidemics.
