Since then, three other human IAV pandemics have occurred: H2N2 in 1957 (Asian flu), H3N2 in 1968 (Hong Kong flu), and H1N1 again in 2009 (swine flu). In each case, IAV strains bearing segments coding for antigenically novel NA and/or HA surface protein(s) rapidly spread through a human population with no or little prior immunity. The relationship between fowl plague, avian influenza and human influenza was not apparent before the 1950s, but by 1967 Pereira, Tumova &amp; Webster suggested that the human H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic viruses might have had an avian origin on the basis of antigenic cross-reactivity [
