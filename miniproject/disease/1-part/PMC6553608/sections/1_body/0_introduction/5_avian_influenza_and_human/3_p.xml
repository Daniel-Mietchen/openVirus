<p>As soon as IAVs were sequenced (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), phylogenetic analyses started to show how avian and human viruses were related, and how this relationship could vary according to the segments involved. Such studies unambiguously confirmed the avian virus origin of the human 1957 and 1969 pandemic glycoprotein genes [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The complete sequences of 1918 human H1N1 viruses are also available (e.g. A/Brevig Mission/1/18 (H1N1)) despite this pandemic pre-dating the identification of IAV as the causative agent [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], having been obtained direct from tissue samples of victims [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, it has been difficult to infer the host species of the ancestor(s) of the 1918 pandemic virus, since there are only three partial sequences of HA or NP from contemporary avian isolates (obtained from museum samples collected between 1915 and 1919) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and most of the earliest other avian and swine virus sequences are from samples from the 1930s [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although the human 1918 H1N1 sequences form a group with the contemporaneous classical swine H1N1 lineage, analysis of the polymerase gene sequences and time-scaled phylogenetic studies indicate that these 1918 human IAV segments probably do have an avian origin [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
