 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180257F1">Figure 1</xref> shows a phylogenetic tree from 8809 nucleotide sequences of segment 1, which encodes the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) subunit of the viral polymerase, with major hosts and subtypes marked. The sequences in the tree are a stratified subsample (one or two per host-type, subtype, country or state and year) of all the virus isolates with complete genome sequences in Genbank, obtained through the Influenza Virus Resource database [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (approx. 40 000 in July 2018) and represent the known diversity of IAV. Details of the sequences as well as the alignments files and tree files for all internal segments can be found in the electronic supplementary material. Major lineages for avian, swine, human, equine and canine hosts can be observed, although cross-species transmissions are quite common. As indicated in the figure, reassortment of the surface protein-encoding segments is rife in avian virus lineages [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and present to some extent in swine lineages [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but is generally uncommon for the human, equine and canine lineages.
