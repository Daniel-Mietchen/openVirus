<p>Severe non-bacterial outbreaks with high mortality rates in domestic birds have been recorded since the late 1800s (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these outbreaks were termed ‘fowl plague’, and it was not until 1955 that Schafer determined that ‘fowl plague virus’ (FPV) was indeed a type of IAV, with similar internal antigens to human and swine influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Sequencing studies performed many years later resulted in the identification of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strains responsible for these outbreaks as H7 subtype IAVs, including A/chicken/Brescia/1902 (H7N7) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], A/FPV/Weybridge/1927 or A/FPV/Dutch/1927 (H7N7) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and A/chicken/FPV/Rostock/1934 (H7N1) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 1959, an antigenically different HPAI H5 subtype was found in a chicken farm in Scotland (represented by A/chicken/Scotland/1959 (H5N1) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), while in 1961 an H5N3 strain was isolated from a wild common tern

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Because of the highly pathogenic phenotype of these first H5 and H7 isolates, it was parsimonious to consider all H5 and H7 viruses to be similarly virulent. However, this was reconsidered after the isolation of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5 and H7 strains from ducks in the 1950/1960s and from turkeys in the 1960s/early 1970s (e.g. A/turkey/Ontario/77332/66 (H5N9) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and A/turkey/Oregon/71 (H7N3) [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Since then, an enormous variety of LPAI and HPAI H5 and H7 subtypes have been isolated from domestic and wild birds, as well as the viruses bearing the majority of all other possible combinations of H1–H16 and N1–N9 surface glycoproteins [
