 <p>HA is synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum as a precursor HA0 polypeptide, assembled into a trimer, glycosylated and transported to the cell surface. At this point, it can be incorporated into budding virus and is active as a receptor binding molecule. However, it is incapable of promoting membrane fusion and thus virus entry into the next cell, until a post-translational cleavage event has taken place to separate the HA1 and HA2 domains and liberate a fusion peptide at the new N-terminus of HA2 (

In LPAI strains of virus, cleavage is performed extracellularly by host proteases present on mucosal surfaces, after a single basic residue. By contrast, HPAI strains have an expanded multi-basic sequence that allows intracellular processing via ubiquitous furin-like proteases; this has the consequence of expanding the tissue tropism of the virus and facilitating systemic disease [

  <xref rid="RSTB20180257C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This phenomenon is well established for H5 and H7 HAs, but for reasons that are unclear, has not been seen outside of the laboratory for other HA subtypes.
