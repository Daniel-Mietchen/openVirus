  <p>Tree shrews show weight loss post inoculation with influenza B viruses but ferrets do not. Tree shrews did not show an increase in body temperature greater than 0.5 °C above pre-inoculation (
   <bold>a</bold>) and up to 10% body weight loss (
   <bold>c</bold>) post inoculation with influenza B viruses. Ferrets inoculated with B/Guangzhou/12/2016 showed a mean body temperature increase of over 1 °C at one day post inoculation and at other timepoints temperatures were approximately 0.5 °C above pre-inoculation (
   <bold>b</bold>). Ferrets did not lose weight post inoculation with either virus (
   <bold>d</bold>). Body temperature and weight were measured daily after inoculation with 1.0 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>TCID
   <sub>50</sub> of virus intranasally. The body temperature at 0 day was the average of five days before infection. ●Yamagata strain B/Guangzhou/12/2016 (Y12), ○Victoria strain B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 (V0215)
