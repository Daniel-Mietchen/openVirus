<p id="Par20">The tree shrew (
 <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>), is a small non-primate mammal that has been used as an animal model to study viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Tree shrews are a potentially promising model for the study of IBVs as they are more closely related to primates compared to ferrets, which are commonly used in influenza virus research [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Tree shrews are also smaller than ferrets, easier to handle and more cost-effective. Unlike mice, tree shrews display symptoms including fever, rhinitis and mild pneumonia post inoculation with IAVs, and show a distribution of α2,3-linked and α2,6-linked sialic acids in their respiratory tract similar to humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As such, here we conducted a study to determine if the tree shrew is a useful animal model for the study of IBV infection. We compared the tree shrew to two animal models commonly used in influenza research; ferrets and mice, using two strains of IBVs from Yamagata and Victoria lineages that were isolated from clinical specimens. Overall, we found the tree shrew to be sensitive to IBV inoculation, displaying a clear symptomology, viral shedding and seroconversion, thus demonstrating their utility as a model for future studies of IBVs.
