<p id="Par23">Animals were divided into four groups; Group One comprised of ten tree shrews and ten ferrets. These animals were implanted with transponder microchips (IPTT-300, Bio Medic Data Systems Inc., Seaford, Delaware) to allow daily monitoring of body temperature for 5 days prior to intranasal inoculation with 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of V0215 (five ferrets and five tree shrews) or Y12 (five ferrets and five tree shrews) in 250 μL of phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS). After inoculation, body weight and temperature were measured daily and nasal washes were collected using 1 mL of PBS at 2, 4 and 6 days post inoculation (DPI) to measure viral titers. Serum were collected 21 DPI to measure influenza-specific antibody titers. Seroconversion of the animals was tested by HI assays [
