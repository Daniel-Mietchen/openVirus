<p id="Par36">As one of the major causes of seasonal influenza, IBV seriously threatens human health. As vaccines and antiviral compounds are the main interventions against IBV, it is essential to have animal models that replicate human disease to use in their development. We previously inoculated mice with IBVs isolated from clinical samples and identified two IBVs capable of causing lethal infections in mice without adaptation; the Victoria-like virus B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 (V0215) and the Yamagata-like virus B/Guangzhou/12/2016 (Y12). In this current study, we used these viruses to compare IBV infection in tree shrews to ferrets and mice, to determine if tree shrews could be a model for future studies of IBVs.</p>
