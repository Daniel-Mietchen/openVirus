<p id="Par30">In our previous study we isolated IBVs from patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As part of this study, we used 8 IBV strains to inoculate mice and we discovered two IBVs, V0215 and Y12, that caused severe disease without prior adaptation. In this current study we compared the susceptibility of tree shrews to ferrets and mice infected with V0215 and Y12 to determine the utility of tree shrews as models for future IBV studies. V0215 and Y12 replicated in all three animal models with peak viral titers evident on 2DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There were no significant differences in titers between V0215 and Y12 inoculated ferrets, however, viral titers were significantly higher in tree shrews and mice inoculated with Y12 compared to V0215 at both 2 and 4DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b, c). There were no significant differences in peak viral titers in ferrets and tree shrews inoculated with Y12 at 2 and 4DPI, although viral titers were detected at 6DPI in tree shrews but not in ferrets. There was no mortality in tree shrews or ferrets and no significant differences in body temperature were observed in tree shrews or ferrets inoculated with either virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b). Mean tree shrew body weight decreased post inoculation until 7DPI, with an overall mean weight loss of 10% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Weight loss was not detected in inoculated ferrets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Mice inoculated with either V0215 or Y12 began to lose weight at 2DPI and all mice were killed by 8DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). There were no significant differences in weight loss or mortality between mice inoculated with V0215 or Y12 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
