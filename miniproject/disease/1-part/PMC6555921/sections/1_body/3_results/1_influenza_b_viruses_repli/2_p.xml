<p id="Par31">Seroconversion was observed in all tree shrews and ferrets. The antibody titer in ferrets and tree shrews inoculated with V0215 was significantly greater compared to Y12-inoculated animals (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), indicating that the immunogenicity of V0215 was greater than Y12 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Interestingly, HI titers measured in ferrets inoculated with either V0215 or Y12 were greater compared to tree shrews inoculated with those same viruses.
