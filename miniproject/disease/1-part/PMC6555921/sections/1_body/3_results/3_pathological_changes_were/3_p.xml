<p id="Par35">After inoculation with Y12, interstitial pneumonia was observed in all but two mice (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Of those 15 mice inoculated with V0215, 9 mice showed severe pneumonia; five at 4DPI and four at 6DPI. Four mice showed pneumonia of moderate severity; three at 2DPI and one at 6DPI. Two mice showed pneumonia of mild severity at 2DPI. Of mice inoculated with Y12, 1 of 15 was killed at 5DPI. Three mice showed severe pneumonia, two at 4DPI and one at 6DPI. Five mice showed moderate pneumonia; two at 2DPI, two at 4DPI and one at 6DPI. Overall, V0215 appeared to cause a more severe disease in mice compared to Y12.
