<p id="Par34">Histopathology of respiratory tissues obtained from ferrets revealed rhinitis and pneumonia in both V0215 and Y12 inoculated ferrets at 2, 4 and 6DPI. A mild tracheitis characterized by few desquamated cilia was only evident in one Y12 inoculated ferret at 2DPI (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). A moderate rhinitis characterized by hyperemia and inflammatory cells in the submucosal layer of the nasal turbinate was observed in Y12 inoculated ferrets at 2 and 4DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d and j, respectively) and in a V0215 inoculated ferret at 2DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). Severe rhinitis was also observed in a Y12 inoculated ferret at 6DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>p) and V0215 inoculated ferrets at 4 and 6DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>g and m, respectively). Interstitial pneumonia characterized by pulmonary interstitial thickening filled with inflammatory cells was observed in both V0215 and Y12 inoculated ferrets. Severe pneumonia was also observed in a V0215 inoculated ferret at 2DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c), although in inoculated ferrets examined at 6DPI, evidence of inflammation was mild (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>i and o). Moderate pneumonia was observed in Y12 inoculated ferrets at 2, 4 and 6DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>f, l and r, respectively). Overall, there were no obvious differences between ferrets inoculated with V0215 or Y12.
