<p id="Par33">Histopathology of respiratory tissues obtained from tree shrews inoculated by IBVs revealed rhinitis and pneumonia in all animals, evident as submucosal hyperemia and focal edema and the presence of inflammatory cells (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Evidence of mild rhinitis in six of nine tree shrews inoculated with V0215 was also evident (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Two tree shrews showed evidence of moderate rhinitis and one showed severe rhinitis. Tracheitis, characterized desquamated cilia and incrassate epithelium, was evident in one mild case and one moderate case in nine tree shrews inoculated with V0215 and three mild cases in nine tree shrews inoculated with Y12. Pneumonia was also evident as pulmonary interstitial thickening filled with inflammatory cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Five mild cases, one moderate case and one severe case of pneumonia were observed in seven tree shrews inoculated with V0215. Two mild, three moderate and two severe cases of pneumonia were observed in nine tree shrews inoculated with Y12. Overall, it appeared that Y12 caused more severe disease in tree shrews compared to V0215.
