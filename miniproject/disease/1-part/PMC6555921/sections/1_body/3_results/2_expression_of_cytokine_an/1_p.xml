<p id="Par32">Inflammation was observed in tissues of the respiratory tract obtained from tree shrews, ferrets and mice inoculated with either V0215 or Y12. Increased amounts of IL-6, IL-10, IP-10, TNF-α and TGF-β mRNA were detected at 2, 4 and 6DPI in tissues of the respiratory tract obtained from tree shrews (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). V0215 elicited significantly greater expression of IL-6 and IP-10 mRNA at 2DPI compared to Y12 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and d). In ferrets, amounts of IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 mRNA were increased whilst IL-10 mRNA amounts were not appreciably increased post inoculation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). It should be noted that only one ferret per timepoint was used for cytokine analysis, meaning interpretation of this dataset is limited. In mouse lungs, increased amounts of IL-6, IL-10, IP-10 and TNF-α mRNA were detected at 2, 4 and 6DPI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Y12 elicited a significantly greater expression of IL-6 at 2 and 4DPI, IL-10 at 2 and 6DPI, IP-10 at 2, 4 and 6 DPI and TNF-α at 6DPI compared to V0215 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
