<p id="Par41">Our data shows that two human IBVs, Y12 and V0215, which cause lethal infections in mice, can replicate and cause pathological changes in the respiratory tract of ferrets and tree shrews. Further, we observed that tree shrews display clinical signs such as fever, weight loss and nasal exudates following IBV inoculation that were either absent or milder in ferrets. In conjunction with their ease of handling, small size and cost effectiveness, the tree shrew model represents a viable animal model for the study of human IBVs.</p>
