<p>Virus infections and the resulting diseases are major challenges that our society faces today (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). One important determinant of the outcome of an infection is the innate immune response, particularly the type-I interferon (IFN) response (“the IFN response” for short). The IFN response is a highly optimized and general response that provides a critical first line of defense against a wide variety of virus infection (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Failure to mount an effective IFN response against virus leads to systematic infection, while excessive IFN production leads to pathogenicity, severe symptoms or even fatality (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It has been shown that the ability to evade host IFN response is an important determinant of viral replication (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), transmission (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and host species range of viral infection (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Viruses that lack the ability to evade the innate immune response are not able to infect and replicate in a host (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This demonstrates that the IFN response plays a crucial role in protecting hosts from virus invasion.
