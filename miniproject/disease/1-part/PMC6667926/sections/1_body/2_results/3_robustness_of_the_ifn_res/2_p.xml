<p>We first focused on one particular parameter that relates to the host tissue environment in our model: the diffusion coefficient of viruses and IFNs, i.e., the radius of the cell-cell edges (contacts) in the GR network. Due to differences in the viscosity of the fluid in the tissue and the layout of target cells, the ratio of the IFN diffusion over the virus diffusion and thus the ratio of the numbers of target cells they reach may differ in different tissue compartments. Below, we evaluate how the effectiveness of the overall IFN response changes with changes in these ratios. In the analysis, we varied the radius of the IFN diffusion in the protection layer (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>F</italic>
 </sub>; defined in Methods), and assumed that the individual-cell effectiveness of the IFN signaling, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>F</italic>
 </sub>, is constant. In this way, when the radius of IFN diffusion increases, the average degree of nodes in the protection layer (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>F</italic>
 </sub>) increases; however, the protection rate per contact decreases. We explored how the final fraction of infection 
 <italic>R</italic>(âˆž) changes with the ratio of the radius of IFN diffusion over the radius of virus diffusion, 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>F</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>/r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub>. We found that there exists an optimal ratio, such that the total fraction of infection is minimized (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>). Although the exact optimal ratio is parameter dependent, generally it occurs when the ratio is &gt;1, i.e., the radius of IFN diffusion is similar or larger than the radius of virus infection. In general, when 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>F</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub>, there exists a wide range of ratios of IFN diffusion over virus diffusion that the IFN can suppress the virus infection below a very small fraction (blue areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that as long as the IFN response is effective and diffuses similarly or faster than viruses, the IFN response is in general robust against variations in the IFN diffusion.
