<p>In the analysis above, we assumed in the model that the host cells are a homogenous population of cells; whereas in reality, viruses typically infect a wide range of host cells and the host cells likely exhibit widely different levels of susceptibility to infection, e.g., as a result of heterogenous expression of receptors for viral infection (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). To evaluate the consequences of heterogenous host cell susceptibility to infection, we modified our model simulation to assume that each cell has a susceptibility drawn from a gamma distribution (instead of being the same), while keeping the rate of protection by IFNs, φ, constant (see Methods). The simulation results using ER and GR networks show that in general, the more heterogenous the host cell susceptibility (i.e., lower 
 <italic>k</italic> values), the lower the final fraction of infection 
 <italic>R</italic>(∞) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,C</xref>). This is because when host cell susceptibility is extremely heterogenous (e.g., the shape parameter 
 <italic>k</italic> = 0.1 in the gamma distribution in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), the infection is driven a small fraction of highly susceptible cells. For the remaining large fraction of cells, they are much less likely to be infected than protected. Overall, this leads to a small fraction of cells being infected, yet the fraction of protected cells 
 <italic>P</italic>(∞) remains similar across simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, the IFN response is effective to suppress viral infection when the susceptibility of host cells is heterogenous.
