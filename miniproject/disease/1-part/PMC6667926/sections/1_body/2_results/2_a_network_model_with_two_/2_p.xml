<p>We simulated the model and found that strikingly, over a large parameter range of virus infectivity (measured by 
 <italic>R-</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub>), IFN protection of susceptible cells works much more effectively in the GR network than in the ER network. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, the IFN response halts infection such that the total number of infected cells are kept at very low levels for a much wider range of virus infectivity. IFN protection also leads to a much lower total number of protected cells in the GR network than in the ER network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This conclusion holds true as long as the individual-cell effectiveness of the IFN signaling (measured as 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>F</italic>
 </sub>; defined in Methods) is sufficiently high, e.g., when 
 <italic>R</italic>

  <italic>I</italic>
