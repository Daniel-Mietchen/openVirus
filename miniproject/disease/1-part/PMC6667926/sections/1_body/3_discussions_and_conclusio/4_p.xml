<p>Overall, our results suggest that considering the topology of the spreading process is critical to the understanding and prediction of the impact of collective IFN response arising from host cells. Therefore, experimental studies that examine the contact structure and topology for an infection process would help to parameterize the model to make precise predictions. Here our work considered two distinct scenarios of the topology of the spreading process, i.e., the random (ER) network and the spatial (GR) network. An actual infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> may involve both spatial and non-spatial contacts. For example, it has been shown HCV mostly spread to neighboring cells, forming clusters of infected hepatocytes in the liver; while it is also able to have a long-range dispersal to hepatocytes through blood flow (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Similar patterns of foci of infection are also observed for influenza virus (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Further work is warranted to consider network structures that incorporate both spatial spread and random spread, and evaluate the effectiveness of IFN response in those settings.
