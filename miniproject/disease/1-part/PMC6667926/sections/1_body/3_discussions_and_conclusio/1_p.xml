<p>Here, we use a multiplex network approach to show how the collective host cell IFN response can effectively and robustly halt/suppress virus spread especially when viruses spread spatially. For a wide variety of viral infections, including influenza infection (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), HIV infection (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), mosquito borne viral infection, such as dengue (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and zika (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), the site of entry is at the epithelium where target cells for infection are spatially arranged. The spread of viruses is thus expected to be a spatial process, i.e., infected cells only further infect a finite number of neighboring cells. We found that in this case, IFNs diffuses and signal to susceptible cells further away from infection, which builds up an outer layer of protected cells to contain infection locally. We also found that the collective IFN response is highly effective and robust against variations in parameter values that represent heterogenous host environments. This we argue is a property that allows the IFN response to be a general response employed by different types of host cells in peripheral tissues to respond to a wide variety of viruses to prevent viral establishment and invasion of a host at the initial site of the infection.
