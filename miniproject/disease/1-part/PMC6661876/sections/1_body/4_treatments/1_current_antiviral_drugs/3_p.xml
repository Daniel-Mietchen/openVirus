 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0012_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] obtained 29 samples sequenced by NGS successfully from 11 patients diagnosed with H7N9 infection, and found that Neuraminidase (NA) R292K, basic polymerase 2 (PB2) E627K and D701N were the three most dynamic mutations. The NA R292K mutation is associated with oseltamivir resistance. Due to the constant variability of the virus and emergence of oseltamivir-resistant strains, it is very important and urgent for us to explore new antiviral drugs.
