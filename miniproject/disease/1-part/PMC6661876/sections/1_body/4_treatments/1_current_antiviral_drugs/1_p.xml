<p>At present, there are two main types of anti-influenza drugs. One is the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), which were developed in the 1990s. NAIs are sialic acid analogs that competitively bind to active sites on the NA molecule to inhibit the release of influenza virus progeny from the cell surface. Three FDA-approved NAIs are oseltamivir, peramivir and zanamivir.[

 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0012_ref_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] performed a multicenter, retrospective study about 478 patients hospitalized with H7N9 infection during 2013â€“2017 in China. The results showed that the median duration of H7N9 RNA detection from onset was 15.5 days. Delayed NAI treatment after &gt; 5 days of onset were independent risk factors for prolonged H7N9 RNA shedding. However, there was no significant difference in H7N9 RNA shedding duration between NAI combination treatment and monotherapy or between standard-dose and double-dose oseltamivir treatment.
