<p>In February 2018, Xofluza (Baloxavir marboxil, previously known as S-033188), a new anti-influenza drug developed by Shionogi, was approved for sale in Japan. Barofavir is a small molecule prodrug that is a Cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor.[

Therefore, this is currently a new drug that can inhibit the proliferation of influenza virus. Recently, Koshimichi

 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0012_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] published a phase III clinical trial of Xofluza (CAPSTONE-1 study). The results of this study showed that the median time for alleviation of symptoms was significantly shorter in the baloxavir group than in the placebo group (

The overall adverse events rate of baloxavir was lower (20.7%). On October 24, 2018, the U.S. FDA approved it for the treatment of uncomplicated acute influenza patients aged 12 years and older, who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. This is the first anti-influenza drug with a new mechanism of action approved by the FDA in the past 20 years.
