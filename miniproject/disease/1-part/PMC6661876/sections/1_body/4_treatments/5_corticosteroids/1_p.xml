<p>The application of corticosteroids in influenza virus pneumonia has always been controversial. A multicenter, retrospective study about 478 patients performed by Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0012_ref_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that corticosteroid therapy was associated with prolonged H7N9 RNA shedding. Early corticosteroids therapy appeared more strongly associated with mortality than late administration. More patients receiving steroids had acquired pneumonia and a trend to a longer duration of ventilation.[

 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0012_ref_025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, Martin-Loeches 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0012_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] had performed a study on 220 patients admitted to an ICU and had got different results. Cox regression analysis adjusted for severity and potential confounding factors indicated that early use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with mortality but was associated with an increased rate of HAP.
