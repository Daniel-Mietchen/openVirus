<p>After infected with IVs, viral replication can directly cause damage to patient’s cells and tissues. Most importantly, IVs can induce inflammatory factor storms, leading to systemic inflammatory reactions, which can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock and multiple organ failure. During viral replication in the host, viral RNA are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), mainly Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, TLR7/8 and RIG-I, triggering different pathways to induce production of a large amount of inflammatory cytokines. The higher level of proinflammatory cytokines has been documented to be associated with disease severity and lung damage. Patients infected with H5N1 could induce a strong cytokine response, with significantly elevated levels of interleukin IL-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. However, patients infected with H7N9 are mainly expressing IL-6 and IL-8.[
