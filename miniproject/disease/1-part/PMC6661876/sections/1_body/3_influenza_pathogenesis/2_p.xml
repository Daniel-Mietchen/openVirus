<p>Besides the innate immune response, evidences revealed that uncontrolled adaptive immune response was also involved in the disease pathogenesis. It has been found that, in patients infected with H1N1, the level of circulating influenza specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> but not CD8
 <sup>+</sup>T cells is positively correlated to the disease severity. [

 <sup>+</sup>γδT subset), but not CD4
 <sup>+</sup>Th and CD8
 <sup>+</sup>Tc cells at the early stage of infection, and IL-1β and/or IL-23 were sufficient to induce IL-17A production by γδT cells. In addition to secreting IL-17A, γδT cells secreted interferon (IFN)-γ and expressed an activation-associated molecule, natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) and an apoptosis-associated molecule, FasL. These findings would play an important role in the prevention and treatment of influenza in the future.
