<p>It was rational to speculate that H7N9 viruses in the “sixth wave” (October 2017 to September 2018) might be as aggressive as the fifth wave. Surprisingly, only three H7N9 human cases have been reported since 1st October, 2017. To control and eradicate both the H7N9 low and highly pathogenic viruses, a series of actions had been taken in China, such as closing live poultry markets, culling poultry, and establishing the platform for influenza research and early-warning and standard bioinformatics analyses for monitoring virus evolution.[

The results showed that this bivalent H5/H7 inactivated vaccine had controlled H7 influenza viruses efficiently. The obvious decreased prevalence of the H7N9 viruses in poultry and human suggested that the vaccination of poultry had played a main role in preventing the H7N9 virus infection in poultry, not only in chicken but also in duck, and even eliminated the “sixth wave” H7N9 virus infection in human.
