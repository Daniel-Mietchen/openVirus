<p>During October 2017 to 2018 winter, H1N1 became the main influenza virus type in mainland China once again. According to the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of influenza epidemics in the Chinese mainland in 2017 was 456,718, with an incidence rate of 33.1/100,000. The intensity of influenza activity caused by H1N1 was higher than recent years. The popular dominant viruses were mainly the Yamagata strain of influenza B and influenza A (including H3N2 and H1N1). There were differences in peak trends and epidemic durations between the regions. However, the monitoring results showed that there were no differences in the virus transmission, the severity of the disease and the variation of drug resistance compared with before.</p>
