<p>The main detection methods of influenza virus mainly include viral nucleic acid detection, viral antigen detection, virus isolation culture and serological detection. The most common method is influenza virus nucleic acid, which is always detected by multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory specimens (throat swab, nasal swab, nasopharyngeal or tracheal extract, sputum). Viral nucleic acid detection is the most specific and sensitive method, and can distinguish between virus types and subtypes. In addition, some new virus detection technologies have been developed.</p>
