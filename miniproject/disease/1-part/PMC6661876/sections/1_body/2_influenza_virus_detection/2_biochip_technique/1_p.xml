<p>Rapid identification of infections with specific subtypes of influenza virus is critical for treatment and pandemic control. Wang

 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0012_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found that the application of RT-PCR coupled with membrane-based DNA biochip can detect and discriminate the type (A and B) and the subtype (human H1N1, human H3N2, avian H5N1 and avian H7N9) of influenza viruses in circulation in China. PCR products were analyzed by a membrane-based biochip. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were 95.5% and 100%, respectively. This method could allow a rapid, reliable and inexpensive detection and differentiation of human-infecting influenza viruses.
