<p id="p0060">Considerable research progress was made in recent years for developing non-insecticidal vector control strategies 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Several of these strategies rest on the maternally inherited endosymbiotic 
 <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic> (commonly shortened to 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>), which is a common bacterium in a broad range of arthropods, including many mosquito species. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> types isolated from mosquitoes are divided into two supergroups referred as A and B 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Experimental strains of mosquitoes were developed by manipulating 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to induce infertility between a 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected male mosquito and an uninfected female mosquito or one having a natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from a different supergroup, through an early arrest of mosquito embryonic development by cytoplasmic incompatibility. Release in the field of both male and female 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-modified mosquitoes intends to replace the wild population with these mosquitoes that are more resistant to arbovirus infections 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Indeed, transfer of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> into 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, which is naturally uninfected with the bacteria, has been shown to limit the ability of the mosquito to become infected and to transmit DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In the same manner, replacement in 
 <italic>A. polynesiensis</italic> of its natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> type (A supergroup) by an exogenous one (B supergroup) has been shown to reduce the susceptibility of the vector for DENV infection 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Another strategy consists of releasing only 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-modified male mosquitoes to reduce or suppress the wild mosquito population, with the supplementary benefit of also suppressing the nuisance of mosquito bites.
