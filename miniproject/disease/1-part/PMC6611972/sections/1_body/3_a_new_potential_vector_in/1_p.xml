 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic>
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. 
 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic> Meigen 1830, commonly known as 
 <italic>A. nocturnus</italic> Theobald 1903 in the Pacific region, is a member of the 
 <italic>vexans</italic> group belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, sub-genus 
 <italic>Aedimorphus</italic>. This species lays its eggs at the base of plants, on blades of grass or on the ground in land subjected to periodic flooding such as floodplains, grassy ponds and marshes, where they are frequently associated with 
 <italic>C. annulirostris</italic>
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Breeding sites may also be ditches along roads, particularly those rich in leaves and twigs, which keep the soil moist, but also in artificial containers and coconut shells 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. 
 <italic>Aedes nocturnus</italic> was first described as a probable separate species from 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic> in the Pacific, although the differences from typical 
 <italic>vexans</italic> appeared very limited 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Due to the lack of biological, behavioural and genetic data on the Pacific populations of 
 <italic>vexans</italic>, the species was formally synonymized with 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic>
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The distribution of this species in the Pacific in the middle of the twentieth century suggested that it may have been originally brought into the South Pacific by natives or Europeans 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The presence of 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic> in FP was discovered in 2004 on the island of Moorea (Society Islands) during sampling of mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Its introduction in FP has been suggested as probably related to horticultural imports from Hawaii, where the species has been described since 1962 and with which regular commercial air flights operate
