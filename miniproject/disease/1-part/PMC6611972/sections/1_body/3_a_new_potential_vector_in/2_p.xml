<p id="p0050">A Tongan population of 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic> was shown to be able to transmit RRV despite poor susceptibility 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and an Italian population of the species was demonstrated to be susceptible to CHIKV 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Recently, experimental infections in wild-caught American mosquitoes showed moderate to high susceptibility to ZIKV and low ability to transmit the virus

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The authors also highlighted the importance of field factors, arguing that high mosquito population densities may counterbalance weak vector competence. In FP, the current distribution and abundance of 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic> are not known and its propagation is not monitored. The role of 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic> as a potential vector at risk for arboviruses in FP is especially important because the adults are known to be able to fly long distances
