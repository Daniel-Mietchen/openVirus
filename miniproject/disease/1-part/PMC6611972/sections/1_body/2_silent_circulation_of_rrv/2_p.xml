 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and more particularly 
 <italic>A. polynesiensis</italic> may be efficient vectors of RRV in FP. Vector competence for RRV has been demonstrated for several populations of these two species, including an FP population of 
 <italic>A. polynesiensis</italic>

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. An additional argument for 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. polynesiensis</italic> to have sustained RRV transmission in FP is the observation that among all FP archipelagos, RRV antibody prevalence was higher for the inhabitants of Austral-Gambier and Marquesas Islands 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, despite 
 <italic>C. annulirostris</italic> never having been indexed in the latter archipelago
