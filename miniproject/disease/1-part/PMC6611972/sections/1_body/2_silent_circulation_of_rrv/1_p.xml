<p id="p0035">Several mosquito species may have contributed to the silent circulation of RRV in FP. One of the most probable vectors is 
 <italic>Culex annulirostris</italic> Skuse 1889 (
 <italic>sitiens</italic> group), known to be a major vector of RRV in Australia where the virus is endemic 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. 
 <italic>C. annulirostris</italic> was initially considered as having been introduced into FP with the settlement of the first Polynesians, but it may be a native species 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. 
 <italic>C. annulirostris</italic> is abundant and distributed in most of the FP archipelagos, mostly in rural areas. The larvae of this nocturnal species grow more particularly in marshes and river mouths 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Two other members of the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genus were suspected of being potential vectors of RRV in FP 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> Say 1823, a member of the 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> group, was undoubtedly introduced through commerce by Europeans in the nineteenth century. Suited to urban environments, this species is now widely distributed in the five FP archipelagos 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. 
 <italic>Culex sitiens</italic> Wiedemann 1828, a member of the 
 <italic>sitiens</italic> group, was described in the late twentieth century in FP 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Wastewaters and brackish waters are preferred sites for the larval development of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sitiens</italic>, respectively 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. After RRV was isolated from wild-caught specimens, these two nocturnal species were suspected as possible vectors of RRV 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, experimental oral infections of Australian and American populations of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> found either poor susceptibility or refractoriness to RRV infection 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In the same manner, 
 <italic>C. sitiens</italic> showed low susceptibility to RRV infection 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Nevertheless, field conditions and particularly substantial densities of mosquitoes may compensate for poor viral susceptibilities and initiate an outbreak
