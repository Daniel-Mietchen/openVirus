<p id="p0025">Differences in viral genotypes, such as the occurrence of specific changes in the viral genome, can also result in the heterogeneous ability for a given FP

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. For example, ZIKV isolates collected from the explosive outbreaks that occurred from 2013 in FP and elsewhere were shown to have an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution in the non-structural protein 1 compared with previous isolates of the same lineage 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This mutation was found to facilitate viral acquisition by 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and subsequently to enhance viral prevalence in mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This may have facilitated the spread of ZIKV during the outbreak in FP.
