<p>In this study, a total of 136 hybridoma cell lines were generated to produce monoclonal antibodies for subsequent characterization. The reactivity of these MAbs with DENV1 to DENV4 was determined using ELISA and Western blot analysis. We confirmed the serotype specificity of 23 of these MAbs to the NS1 proteins of DENV (5 MAbs against DENV1 NS1, 5 MAbs against DENV2 NS1, 8 MAbs against DENV3 NS1, and 5 MAbs against DENV4 NS1; we also found that 4 of the 136 MAbs cross-reacted with the NS1 proteins of other DENVs). Confirmation was based on strong positive reactions observed when (i) indirect ELISA was performed using immunoaffinity-purified NS1 proteins as antigens and (ii) Western blot analysis was performed on lysates from C6/36 cells infected with DENV.</p>
