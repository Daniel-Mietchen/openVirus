<p>Our study overcomes many of the limitations of the above-mentioned tests. The soluble NS1 proteins from the supernatant of Vero cells infected with DENV1 to DENV4 were purified in their authentic, native form with proper glycosylation. The native epitopes within our NS1 proteins enhance the ability of our generated monoclonal antibodies to recognize NS1 proteins in patient serum. We selected a single cross-reactive MAb as the capture antibody that was paired with one of the four serotype-specific MAbs-HRP to create our ELISA for DENV NS1. As a result, we established a serotyping assay using only five antibodies without the need for expensive equipment for detection.</p>
