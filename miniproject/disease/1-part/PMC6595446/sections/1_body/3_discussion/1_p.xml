<p>Dengue virus infections range from asymptomatic or mild to severe or life-threatening (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The fact that the appropriate detection method varies with the stage of the disease makes it very difficult to secure a reliable clinical diagnosis (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Large-scale epidemics often occur in areas with insufficient medical resources to treat every patient. In such cases, it is essential that medical staff have access to reliable detection methods capable of identifying the patients who are the most likely to progress to a more severe form of the disease.
