<p>Four dengue viral strains (DENV1 Hawaii, DENV2 16681, DENV3 H87, and DENV4 H241) were propagated in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aedes albopictus</named-content> C6/36 cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and then incubated at 28°C until cytopathic effects were observed. As a control, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strain SA14-14-2 was propagated in BHK-21 cells, and the Zika virus (ZIKV) ATCC VR 1843 strain was propagated in Vero cells that had been incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS at 37°C for 2 to 3 days.
