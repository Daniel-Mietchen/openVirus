<p>A total of 146 clinical serum samples were used in this study. These included 55 samples from cases of confirmed dengue virus infection and 30 samples from nondengue cases (provided by the Centers for Disease Control, Department of Health, Taipei, Taiwan) as well as 61 samples from patients with suspected dengue virus infection collected from three hospitals from 2016 to 2018 (the Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, the Zuoying Branch of the Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, and the Tangshan Branch of the Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital). All clinical serum samples were collected during the acute phase (1 to 7â€‰days after the onset of illness) in Taiwan. Samples were tested using a serotype-specific one-step SYBR green I real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, a dengue virus-specific IgM/IgG capture ELISA, the commercially available Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA kit (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France), and our ELISA for DENV NS1. Negative results for non-dengue viral infections were obtained using a serotype-specific RT-PCR, the dengue virus-specific IgM/IgG capture ELISA, and the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA. The study protocol was approved by the Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB no. KAFGH 104-048). All patient clinical samples were deidentified, i.e., made anonymous, prior to analysis of the study data.</p>
