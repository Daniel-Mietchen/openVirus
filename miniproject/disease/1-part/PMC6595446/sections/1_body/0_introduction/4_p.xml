<p>To overcome the limitations of the current commercial dengue virus NS1 detection systems, our primary objective in this study was to develop a sensitive NS1 antigen ELISA capable of detecting NS1 antigens and differentiating among the four dengue virus serotypes. We used one serotype-cross-reactive monoclonal antibody (MAb; as the capture antibody against NS1 protein) paired with one of four monoclonal antibodies (each of which was specific to NS1 of a particular serotype of dengue virus) to create our ELISA for DENV NS1 that can simultaneously detect the NS1 antigen and identify the dengue virus serotype. The clinical diagnostic benefits and utilities of our ELISA for DENV NS1 include the identification of patients at risk of severe dengue disease at the early stages of illness, because dengue virus serotypes can differ in virulence and epidemic capacity (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Early detection also provides effective patient management, especially in areas where multiple serotypes cocirculate. As our ELISA for DENV NS1 is a simple and straightforward assay that has a high sensitivity and a high specificity in discriminating dengue virus serotypes, its application to clinical diagnosis and mass serotype screening is advantageous, even in regions where medical resources are limited and/or where multiple DENVs cocirculate.
