<p>Severe dengue illness is not currently treatable with medication, and the only form of assistance is supportive care. Unfortunately, the development of safe and fully protective dengue vaccines does not appear likely in the near future; therefore, early detection is crucial for success in disease management and epidemiological surveillance (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Definitive methods used in laboratories for the diagnosis of dengue fever include viral isolation, viral RNA detection, IgM/IgG antibody detection, and NS1 antigen detection (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The sensitivity of the first two methods (viral isolation and viral RNA detection) is far greater when they are performed during viremia (within 5 days of the onset of fever), in which the serotype of DENV can be confirmed; however, these methods require special equipment and trained personnel available only in major medical centers. Furthermore, viral isolation is time-consuming and viral RNA detection is too expensive for all but the most advanced hospitals in developed countries (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). IgM/IgG antibody detection (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and lateral flow assay) is currently the method most commonly used to detect dengue diseases; however, it is inapplicable to the detection of DENVs in the early stages of infection and often produces false positives in cases where a patient has previously been infected with DENVs or other flaviviruses. Moreover, paired serum samples are required to confirm the diagnosis (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). NS1 antigen detection exploits the presence of dengue virus NS1, a highly conserved glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 45 to 55 kDa. This antigen exists in monomer, dimer, and hexamer forms (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Infected patients secrete large quantities of soluble NS1 (sNS1) into the bloodstream, such that the concentrations can reach up to 50 μg/ml (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). sNS1 can remain in the blood for 9 days and persist for up to 18 days in some patients (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), making NS1 an ideal biomarker during the early stages of illness, as it provides a wide window for dengue virus detection (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Dengue virus NS1 detection systems (ELISA and lateral flow assays) are commercially available from various manufacturers (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, none of the existing commercial kits has the capacity to identify the dengue serotype.
