  <p>Orientation and specificity of sandwich ELISA for the detection of NS1 proteins in cell culture. In assessing specificity, cell culture supernatants from Vero cells infected with DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4, JEV, or ZIKV were used as NS1 antigen sources, and the supernatant from noninfected Vero cells was used as a negative control. The antibodies were paired as follows: serotype-specific MAbs (detection antibodies) were paired with cross-reactive (capture antibodies) (A to D), and serotype-specific MAbs (capture antibodies) were paired with cross-reactive MAbs (detection antibodies) (E to H).</p>
