  <p>Sensitivity and specificity of HRP-conjugated serotype-specific antibodies paired with cross-reactive MAb53-1.1. Sensitivity was assessed by testing serial dilutions of supernatant from Vero cell cultures infected with DENV, whereas specificity was assessed in terms of the ability to differentiate among DENV serotypes: DENV1 (MAb12-4.1), DENV2 (MAb33-7.1), DENV3 (MAb43-1.3), and DENV4 (MAb22-1.5).</p>
