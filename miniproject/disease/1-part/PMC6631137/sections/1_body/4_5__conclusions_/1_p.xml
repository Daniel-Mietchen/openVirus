<p>For decades, we have been using the traditional approaches to design and develop influenza vaccines. The rapid genetic changes and antigenic drift of influenza virus populations result in short-term protection necessitating continual vaccine updates with novel viral components based on analysis of globally circulating variants. Furthermore, these vaccines do not offer any immunological protection against potential pandemic zoonotic strains, one of the lessons learned through the unprecedent appearance of swine-origin 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. </p>
