<p>Recent decades have witnessed the technological advancements in the viral genetic sequencing and computational modeling in tracing the complexities involved in the interactions of host- pathogen-environment that produced important insights into influenza disease dynamics across biological scales. Integrating these computational and technological pipelines into the vaccine design protocols can facilitate the development of a broadly cross-reactive, evolutionarily-resistant universal influenza vaccine. </p>
