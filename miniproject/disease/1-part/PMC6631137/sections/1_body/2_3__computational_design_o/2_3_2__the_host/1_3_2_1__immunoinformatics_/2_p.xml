<p>The study of immunomes coined as a new discipline “immunomics”, where the ‘immunome’ is quoted as “the detailed map of immune reactions of a given host interacting with a foreign antigen” [

Immunomics tools such as B-cell epitope and T-cell epitope mapping methods mimic the diverse molecular pathways of adaptive immune system that accounts for humoral immunity (B-cells) and cellular immunity (CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells) to predict potential epitopes or immunomes from the pathogen proteomes [

Two distinct subsets, CD4+ T-cells (helper T cells) and CD8+ T-cells (cytotoxic T cells) recognize epitopes when they bind with MHC class II and MHC class I, respectively [
