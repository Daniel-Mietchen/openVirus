<p>T-cell immunity plays a critical role in viral clearance thereby reduction in disease severity. Particularly, memory CD4+ T-cells can provide substantial protection against influenza infection through direct effector mechanisms as well as indirect regulatory and helper functions [

 <xref rid="B68-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, the cross-reactive T-cell immune responses towards the well-conserved T-cell epitopes may play a significant role in promoting clearance of virus and reducing disease severity [

 <xref rid="B71-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This phenomenon was well documented during the 2009 pandemic H1N1, as its unanticipated milder disease severity was largely attributed to the preexisting cross-reactive T-cell immune responses towards the evolutionarily conserved T-cell epitopes between seasonal H1N1 and 2009 H1N1 strains [

 <xref rid="B78-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Taken together, these studies suggest that an epitope-based universal influenza vaccine can be developed by selecting the well-conserved and immunodominant epitopes across influenza subtypes using the immunomics approach.
