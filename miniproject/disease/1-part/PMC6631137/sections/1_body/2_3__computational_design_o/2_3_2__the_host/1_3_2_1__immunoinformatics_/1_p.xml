<p>The field of immunoinformatics or computational immunology received major attention in 2000’s from the research and governmental funding agencies [

These technological developments coupled with pathogen genomes have tremendously contributed to the selection process of optimal vaccine antigens by lessening the time and cost involved in the conventional methodologies that involve pathogen cultivation and protein extractions. This methodology of analyzing pathogen genome to identify potential vaccine antigens is called “reverse vaccinology” [
