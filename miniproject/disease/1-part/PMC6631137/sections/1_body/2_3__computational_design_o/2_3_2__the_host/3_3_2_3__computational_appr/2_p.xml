<p>The main limitation with this approach is that linear sequence may not accurately predict the conformational variations when these antigens are put back in a complete protein context [

 <xref rid="B96-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. To solve this issue, some high-performance bioinformatics tools such as molecular dynamics simulations can be used to predict the 3-D structure and stability of proteins or peptides [

 <xref rid="B98-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Furthermore, in the previous section, the successful maintenance of the conformational epitope in these clinical tested vaccines has provided positive evidence for epitope-based universal vaccine design. Taken together, with this antibody repertoire analysis tool, the computational estimation of immune stimulation of these predicted viral antigens in hosts could be more accurate.
