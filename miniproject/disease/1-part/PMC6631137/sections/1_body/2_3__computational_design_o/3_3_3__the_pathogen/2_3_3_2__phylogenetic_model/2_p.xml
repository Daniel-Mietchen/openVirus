<p>In detail, Ducatez and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B44-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] developed an ancestral sequence reconstruction method for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 surface proteins HA and NA. Based on a maximum likelihood tree, several ancestral sequences were reconstructed at the internal nodes of co-circulating HPAI H5N1 viral lineages to capture the conserved genetic characteristics of these viruses. These ancestral sequences were synthesized into attenuated influenza viruses that could replicate. Their cross-reactive protection against H5N1 morbidity and mortality have been confirmed in preclinical experiments with ferret models. These findings provide strong evidence that computationally derived vaccine candidate sequences and these technologies should be used to explore and enhance the cross-reactivity, which can be easily fit into the current licensed vaccine platform. These computationally derived ancestral sequences as vaccine candidates may help in avoiding the detrimental effects of antigenic drift on the vaccine effectiveness. But this approach can be weakened by phylogenetic uncertainty in particular when trees possess long branches due to insufficient information [
