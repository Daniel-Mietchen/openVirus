<p>High-throughput experiments quantify the effects of all single substitutions on gene function so that evolutionary model can adequately capture the heterogeneity of selection at different sites, which may improve phylogenetic inference and ancestral sequence reconstruction [

 <xref rid="B114-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The new experimental technique is called deep mutational scanning, where a gene is randomly mutagenized and subjected to functional selection in the laboratory, and then deep sequenced to quantify the relative frequencies of mutations before and after selection [

 <xref rid="B116-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. This technique has been used to quantify the impacts of codon changes to several proteins or functional domains [
