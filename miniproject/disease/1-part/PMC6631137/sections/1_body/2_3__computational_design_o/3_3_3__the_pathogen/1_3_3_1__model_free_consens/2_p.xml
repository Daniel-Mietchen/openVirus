<p>The critical step in designing COBRAs is to use multiple rounds of consensus generation. Within each phylogenetic subclade of the influenza virus subtype, the primary consensus with the most common amino acid at each position is generated for each individual outbreak group that is defined based on geographic location and collection time. The secondary consensus is generated from the primary consensus to represent the subclade. The third or fourth consensus is generated based on previous round of consensus, until the final consensus is generated and termed COBRAs [
