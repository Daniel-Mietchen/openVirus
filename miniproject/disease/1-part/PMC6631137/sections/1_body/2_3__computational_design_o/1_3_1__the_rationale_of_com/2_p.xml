 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], increased computational power and theoretical algorithms allow complex data sources to be integrated into a unified framework allowing for a more complete understanding of pathogen and host features. Huge amount of data generated by the high-throughput technologies are currently available with more data regularly being made available. Computational approaches with advance data integration and quantitative empirical analyses fit the needs of universal vaccine design for highly diverse influenza virus in several promising aspects [
