<p>Computational approaches to identify candidates for universal influenza vaccine design have been used with a variety of novel vaccine production strategies in development. These approaches mainly focus on the ‘unnatural immunity’ [
 <xref rid="B40-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] induced by more conserved or less immune-dominant domains in the surface proteins, internal proteins or both, to tackle with the high degree of variability in influenza viruses by boosting the immunity from the conserved or less evolvable proteins of the viruses. Current rational vaccine design uses comparative genomic methods to identify these conserved regions. These inferential methods include naïve approaches where conserved regions are identified from multiple sequence alignment comparison [
