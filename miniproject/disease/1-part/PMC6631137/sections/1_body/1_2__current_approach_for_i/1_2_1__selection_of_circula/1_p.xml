<p>To prevent infections from circulating seasonal influenza viruses, the annually administered influenza virus vaccines contain H1N1 (phylogenetic group 1 hemagglutinin), H3N2 (phylogenetic group 2 hemagglutinin) and two influenza B virus components (Victoria-like and Yamagata-like) [

The vaccine candidates from natural influenza virus strains are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) based on the characterization and prediction of circulating strains likely to dominate in upcoming epidemic seasons. Twice a year, the expert panel from the WHO Collaborating Centers and essential laboratories and academies reviews the evidence of global surveillance, laboratory and clinical studies and evaluate the availability of vaccine strains to make recommendation on the components of influenza vaccine [

The evaluations are mainly based on viral antigenic and genetic characterization, which requires tremendous annual surveillance efforts and laboratory tests. After the selection of vaccine strains, it takes at least 6-8 months to produce sufficient global supplies of influenza vaccine via current vaccine production technologies with egg-based, cell-based or recombination-based vaccine [
