<p>Influenza vaccines selected from natural influenza virus strains predominantly elicit specific antibodies against the globular head domain of the surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) for each subtype or lineage, which is only effective to protect against closely-matched antigenic variants [
 <xref rid="B7-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The HA, however, undergoes rapid antigenic drift that accumulates from point mutations under immune selection pressure in the major antigenic sites, allowing the virus to escape neutralizing antibody responses [
 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], resulting in imprecise predictions of circulating strains. Despite significant efforts of continuous surveillance and vaccine strain updates, vaccine mismatches have occurred many times [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition to potential antigenic mismatch from selection procedure and delays in production, egg-adapted mutations accumulated during egg-based vaccine production can further exacerbate this issue, where the vaccine virus strain obtains relevant functional amino acid changes in the HA protein, resulting in low vaccine effectiveness [

 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies investigating the impact of vaccine mismatch have reported broad ranging vaccine efficacy (10% to 60%) for these annual vaccines, demonstrating severely low and unstable immune protection from influenza infection [

Predictive models of viral evolution to forecast dominant circulating influenza viral strains in the upcoming influenza seasons through the analysis of genetic and epidemiological data from influenza surveillance system have been developed to make quantitative predictions of viral evolution and aim to improve the selection of seasonal influenza vaccine candidates [

 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This framework has demonstrated potential to integrate multiple data sources to improve influenza vaccine design.
