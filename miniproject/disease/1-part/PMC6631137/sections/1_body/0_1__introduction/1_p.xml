<p>In the history of fighting infectious diseases, vaccinations are amongst the most cost-effective approaches available to prevent infection. Traditional approaches to vaccine design have been successful against many pathogens. But vaccines that target rapidly-evolving and genetically-diverse disease agents have frequently failed to generate long lasting protection for human populations. This is particularly true for influenza viruses, a single-stranded, negative sense RNA virus. One of the important weapons being developed to effectively prevent influenza virus infection is a vaccine that can provide durable and broadly-reactive protection against multiple subtypes, including those that may cause potential pandemics, that is, a universal influenza vaccine [

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has defined the criteria for universal influenza vaccine, which includes (1) being at least 75% effective against symptomatic influenza infection; (2) protecting against group I and group II influenza A viruses (influenza B would be a secondary target); (3) having durable protection that lasts at least 1 year and preferably through multiple seasons [
