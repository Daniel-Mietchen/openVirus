<p>Recent approaches to vaccine design have taken advantage of large-scale viral sequencing platforms, phylogenetic frameworks, protein structural modeling and systems biology to design novel broadly-reactive vaccine candidates, which have been used for influenza and other pathogens [

However, it has found limited applications in the design and discovery of new vaccines, an area where proper integration of computational support and design is urgently needed [
