<p>The unequal sampling of geographical regions is caused by global and local resource allocation [
 <xref rid="B132-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Policies to globally optimize resource allocation with considering the representative of collected samples from outbreaks in different regions are needed. But majorly, the unequal sampling in zoonotic hosts is more severe. Human influenza outbreaks have been well monitored and sampled [
 <xref rid="B129-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. However, to better understand viral evolvability and predict potential pandemic emerging from zoonotic strains, more sampling efforts are definitely necessary in animal hosts, especially wild aquatic birds [

 <xref rid="B129-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], examined 11,870 GenBank records and reviewed 50 non-overlapping studies and over 250,000 birds to access the status of historic sampling efforts during 1977â€“2012, where they found that sampling in different hosts, location and viral subtypes are severely imbalanced and there are a high proportion of non-tested samples globally. If we aim to identify a high proportion of the virus subtypes in circulation in a given time period with limited resources, a sample-based accumulation curve can provide an initial rationalization and optimal sample size for avian influenza virus surveillance [
