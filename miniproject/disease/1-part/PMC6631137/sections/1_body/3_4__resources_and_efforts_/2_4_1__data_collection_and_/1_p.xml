<p>Computational vaccine design relies on the input data quality [

 <xref rid="B130-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Compared to other infectious disease sampling, influenza viruses have already established an excellent global network of sentinel institutions to monitor outbreaks and collect human samples [
 <xref rid="B131-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. With the lower cost of full-genome sequencing, a large amount of genetic data has been available for influenza research. However, three main limitations exist in current surveillance: (1) the imbalanced sampling efforts on different hosts and geographical regions; (2) the incompletion of data records [
 <xref rid="B129-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]; and (3) the delayed availability of sequence data [
