<p>We explored four distinct control scenarios where the presence of infected humans in a given patch triggered responses that varied from highly focal to collective and area-wide. Specifically, we had 1) a focal or individual-patch level response; 2) a targeted response, in which control occurs in the patch with infections as well as the patch with which it is most strongly connected; 3) a limited area-wide response, wherein control occurs in all neighborhoods within a certain radius (0.33 x the mean distance among all neighborhoods in that localityâ€“a value chosen to lead to a scenario intermediate between scenarios 1 and 4) of the patch with infective humans; and 4) a collective, area-wide response, wherein all neighborhoods initiate control. We also obtained baseline estimates of the progression of the epidemic in the absence of mosquito control.</p>
