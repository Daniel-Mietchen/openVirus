<p>We developed a discrete, stochastic version of a spatial compartmental vector-borne pathogen transmission model, which was previously used to explore spatial aspects of mosquito control on a simplified grid-based landscape [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Here, in this metapopulation model individual patches represent neighborhoods or districts. Briefly, the model is suitable for microparasites where within-host dynamics can safely be ignored and infection status can thus be modelled as a population-level characteristic. We assume a pathogen with a single host species and a single vector species, which is a reasonable assumption for arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses, transmitted by
