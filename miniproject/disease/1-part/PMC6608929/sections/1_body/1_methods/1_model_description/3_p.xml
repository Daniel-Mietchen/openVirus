<p>We base the spatial configuration of the model on three areas where dengue and/or Zika virus epidemics have been known to occur in recent years. The purpose is simply to have a diversity of spatial distributions of neighborhoods in tropical urban settings. The cities which informed our spatial modelling were San Juan (Puerto Rico), Recife (Brazil), and Jakarta (Indonesia), though other differences between those cities (e.g., rainfall patterns or seasonality) were not considered. A figure with directed graphs and information on sizes and relative distances between patches is provided (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007479.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We thus also kept entomological details as simple as possible, and adjusted the density-dependent rate of larval mortality for each neighborhood such that the vector:host ratio was similar in all neighborhoods and across settings (ca. 5 female mosquitoes per human). We used the lowest available level of administrative boundary for each city (i.e., neighborhoods or districts) to inform a model of human movement, as well as the structuring of vector control (i.e., we assume the most intense form of targeting occurs at the scale of one patch or neighborhood and ignore the role of movement or heterogeneity within patches). The choice of neighborhoods as our smallest spatial unit was driven by two reasons: we wanted to cover areas that were large enough so that we could ignore the movement of mosquitoes, and to keep the model simulations from becoming computationally too demanding. It is likely true that within these neighborhoods human populations are not homogeneously distributed or exposed to mosquito bites. To capture such heterogeneity (which would even occur within households), one would need an individual-based approach with much finer granularity. As we were interested in the broad question of whether the distribution of humans over the landscape and their movement might affect vector control strategies, and the patch size has little effect on that question, we use this simpler model to derive strategic insights (but would suggest using individual-based models that account for local spatial and temporal distributions of vectors, vector control measures that are already in place, and other forms of local parameterization, for predictive purposes and policy recommendations).
