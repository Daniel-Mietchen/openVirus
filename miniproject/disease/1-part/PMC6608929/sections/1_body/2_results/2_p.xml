<p>An exploration of individual simulations via scatter plots of infections averted versus the total number of people covered by larval control over the two-year period reveals the complex relationship between investment and efficacy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007479.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top panel). There are two distinct patterns visible in these scatterplots: an area where the four strategies differ largely in the extent of the number of persons covered, but with no clear improvement in outcome; and an area where scenarios that cover more persons also result in a greater number of infections averted. A similar distinction is evident when looking at the number of infections averted per simulation in relation to the assumption of efficacy of larval control at the patch-level (i.e., the induced level of larval mortality per day in a patch that enacts larval control)â€”at lower levels of efficacy there is no discernable difference in outcomes between the interventions, while at higher levels the more collective responses do achieve a greater impact (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007479.g003">Fig 3</xref>, lower panels). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is as follows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007479.g004">Fig 4</xref>): when the efficacy of larval control is low (e.g., 40%), this intervention is unable to contain the spread of the infection and regardless of the response type, control is triggered everywhere. In other words, the focal response and collective response become essentially equivalent. This is in contrast to control at higher levels of efficacy, where we see that under a collective response, control ceases when transmission is interrupted. Under the focal control strategy, however, the virus maintains itself in the metapopulation triggering waves of control throughout the two-year period.
