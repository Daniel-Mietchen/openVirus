<p>The reasons for these differences are not immediately obvious but could be tied to differences in scale (population, physical size, number of neighborhoods, etc.). This suggests that optimizing control responses will have to be done on a location-by-location specific manner. Critically, however, when we estimated the effort involved in enacting each of the control scenarios (by summing the total number of persons covered over all days of treatment) and used this metric to investigate which scenarios were the most effective for a given amount of effort, the outcomes are remarkably consistent between the urban centers. When efficacy of control is high, the collective response provides the best value. This is likely because although it is costly to treat all locations simultaneously, this strategy then can succeed at quickly interrupting transmission of the virus. Two important caveats are that we only introduce the pathogen at a single time point, and that this high level of efficacy of larval control is unlikely to be achieved in reality due to the cryptic and abundant larval habitats employed by

 <italic>aegypti</italic>. For lower levels of efficacy, the scenario that offers the best value varies by investment threshold and location. At lower investment thresholds, the focal scenario is likeliest to provide the best value, while at high levels, the targeted response provides the best value in Recife and Jakarta, while in San Juan the focal response is consistently the most effective for a given level of effort. Whether such insights would still be evident were we to extend this modelling approach with appropriate costing and economic models was beyond the scope of the current study, but would be required before making policy recommendations.
