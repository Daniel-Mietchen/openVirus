<p>We also investigated whether there might be differences in the most effective spatial configuration of control, and discovered that there were certain neighborhoods which, if included in the control scenario, tended to increase or decrease the overall effectiveness. The neighborhoods whose inclusion most increased effectiveness tended to have lower human population sizes in San Juan, though this relation was somewhat (in Recife) and considerably (Jakarta) weaker in the other two environments. Because we used a constant ratio of vectors to hosts, this outcome does not relate to differences in vectorial capacity directly. As our movement was informed by a gravity model, smaller neighborhoods will receive fewer commuters. Larger neighborhoods, on the other hand, will attract visitors from a larger number of patches and therefore be better mixed, which can lower the intensity of transmission. This would suggest that in certain areas it may be worthwhile to target less well-mixed neighborhoods. It is not clear why the impact of neighborhood size on effect size decreased in the larger cities. It is possible that above a certain scale, factors related to the spatial distribution or configuration of patch sizes becomes more relevant. The criteria for selecting specific neighborhoods for control may in that case have to take the scale of urban centers into account.</p>
