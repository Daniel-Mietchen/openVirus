<p>These exacerbating factors lend themselves especially well to arboviruses transmitted by the anthropophilic mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti</italic>, which thrives in (sub-)tropical urban settings and is often the primary vector of the dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses. Variation in dengue transmission risk, for instance, is thought to be driven largely by rainfall, temperature, urbanization and socioeconomic factors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Part of what makes this mosquito such an important vector in urban settings is that it undergoes its life cycle in close proximity to humans. In the larval stage, it develops in water-holding containers in or around homes, while as an adult it almost exclusively feeds on humans and can find suitable resting spots and oviposition sites in and around the domicile. Thus, with urbanization projected to rise from 54% of the world population in 2014 to 66% by 2050 [
