  <title>Heatmaps of larval populations in 49 districts (y-axis) over time (x-axis), for San Juan.</title>
  <p>Darker red areas reflect low levels of larval populations due to control. Top row is for an individual, focal strategy, the bottom row for the collective strategy. Efficacy of larval control (the proportion of larvae killed by larval control per day) was 40% (left), 60% (center), or 80% (right).</p>
