<p>Based on our results, some of the known infectious causes of HSP were identified. Previously known infectious agents, such as adenovirus, were associated with HSP and were found to be statistically significant even in our study using national health data.

 </sup> However, adenovirus did not show any significant seasonal tendency and was found to occur evenly throughout the year. Several studies have described the influenza virus to be a predisposing cause of HSP with significant association with HSP incidences and we confirmed similar result.

 </sup> On the other hand, we also confirmed a possibility of rotavirus that it has not been previously reported as predisposing cause of HSP. However, we cannot conclude that the incidence of HSP is triggered by only 1 causative virus.
