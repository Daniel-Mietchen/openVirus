<p id="Par15">The proportion of samples infected with ZIKV in each study was combined to give a pooled prevalence of ZIKV in blood donations. All analyses were performed with R 3.4.1 software (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.10 define a statistically significant degree). Random effects model was used for high level of heterogeneity. The data were converted using Freeman-Tukey Double arcsine transformation to satisfy the normal distribution. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to study period, study area and detection method, difference of subgroups was tested by Cochran Q statistic, the significant level (two-tailed) was set at 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the stability of analyses, and potential publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger’s test.
