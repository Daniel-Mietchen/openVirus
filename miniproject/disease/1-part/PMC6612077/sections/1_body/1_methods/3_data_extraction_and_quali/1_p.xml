<p id="Par14">All data from included studies were extracted independently by 2 reviewers (RFL and XZW) using the same Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The following data were recorded: Author (study year), sample source, study period (*epidemic means the time is during local Zika-epidemic), study area, number of ZIKV infected samples (Event), total number of samples tested (Number), virus loads (if any), and detection method. As studies finally included were all prevalence-study, so, the quality score of studies was assessed by an 11-item checklist recommended for cross-sectional/prevalence study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An item would be scored “0” if it was answered “NO” or “UNCLEAR”; scored “1” for “YES”. Article quality was classified as follows: low quality = 0–3; moderate quality = 4–7; high quality = 8–11.
