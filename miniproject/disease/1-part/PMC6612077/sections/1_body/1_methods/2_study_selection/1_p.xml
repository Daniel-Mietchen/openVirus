<p id="Par13">The selection process was conducted by two researchers (RFL and XZW) independently in 2 steps. First, we browsed through titles and abstracts of each study, any type of study such as cross-sectional/prevalence study, cohort study, case-control study and screening study were eligible for next inspection as long as the survey of ZIKV or arboviruses in human blood samples was mentioned in the study. Second, we went full-text screening and included studies that focused on ZIKV infection in blood donors or donations. The detection of ZIKV was confirmed by molecular or serological methods with RNA and/or IgM/IgG detected in samples. Studies were excluded when: 1). the types of articles are overviews, abstracts, case-reports and comments. 2). the articles are not in English; 3) the purpose of the study is to evaluate detection methods of ZIKV; 4) the samples size is less than 500. Any disagreement between reviewers was resolved by discussion with a third experienced investigator (YM).</p>
