<p id="Par19">As to the study period, most of the studies (7/10) were performed in 2016 and only one study in other years, so it would be hard to deduce the prevalence trend of ZIKV in recent years. But since the prevalence of Zika virus in blood is presumably influenced by local endemic situation, we divided the studies into 2 parts according to whether the study was performed during local epidemic/outbreak or not. Epidemic and outbreak situation is defined as a series of autochthonous infection cases were reported in a short time and epidemiological correlation between cases were observed. Non-epidemic/outbreak situation is identified in those studies: study conducted in areas where ZIKV infection cases have been reported long ago but no exceptionally increases occurred in study time (p3); study performed in outside of active-transmission areas (p4); study in risk area but no cases have been reported (p5); and study collected samples before ZIKV emergence (p10). Six studies (p1,p2,p6,p7,p8,p9) were performed when Zika is circulating and the pooled prevalence of Zika virus in blood donations was 1.37% (95%CI 0.91–1.91). Five studies (p3,p4,p5,p5.1,p10) were performed when non Zika-epidemics and the pooled prevalence was 0.61% (95%CI 0–2.55) (Additional file
