<p id="Par18">A total of 528,947 blood samples were tested in 10 literatures, the prevalence of Zika virus in blood donations range from 0 to 4.89%, and ZIKV RNA detection rate range from 0 to 2.79%, ZIKV antibody seroprevalence range from 0.40 to 4.89%. All studies have samples more than 500 and 4 of which more than 10,000 (p2, p4, p8, p9). A very high level of heterogeneity was observed (
