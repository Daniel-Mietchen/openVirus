<p id="Par23">In all included studies, a total of 122 ZIKV reactive blood donors were followed in three studies (p1:42, p4:5, p6:75), of which 48(39%) reported symptoms within 1–10 days of postdonation, and 3 cases (p4) were retrospectively confirmed had shown symptoms before donation. Two studies (p1, p4) have traced down to the recipients to whom ZIKV reactive blood donations were transfused. Overall, among the 13 recipients (p1:12, p4:1) investigated, 3 of them have developed anti-ZIKV IgG antibodies after received RBCs (p1). None of recipients reported any clinical symptoms consistent with ZIKV infection within 2 months of posttransfusion.</p>
