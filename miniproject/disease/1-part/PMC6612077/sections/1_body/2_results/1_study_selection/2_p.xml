 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]), a large majority were performed in the year of 2016 (7 studies, p2,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8,p9) and each has one in 2013 (p10),2014 (p1) and 2015 (p3). Puerto Rico is the most interested location with 3 studies (p2,p8,p9) conducted here, followed by French Polynesia with 2 studies (p1,p10). Study areas were classified by geographical continents for the sake of analysis: North America (Puerto Rico, United States):4 studies, South America (Martinique, Brazil):2 studies, Oceania (French Polynesia):2 studies, Europe (Austria):1study, and Africa (Cameroon):1 study. As to the detection methods, 7 studies detected ZIKV RNA and 2 studies detected anti-ZIKV antibodies. One research (p5) have used both nucleic acid test and antibody test in all samples separately and did not give a conclusion that weather itâ€™s false positive/negative or not, so we took it as two studies (p5, p5.1) in future meta-analysis. Methodological quality assessment showed 2 studies were of high quality (score 8) and 8 studies were of moderate quality (mean score 5.4) (Table
