<p id="Par24">Flavivirus transmission through blood transfusion has been recorded for Dengue virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], West Nile virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], Yellow Fever vaccine virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and Zika virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The major challenges in preventing transfusion-associated transmission of ZIKV are the high rate of asymptomatic infections and the high proportion of infected people in endemic-areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Asymptomatic infectors have long been a challenging aspect in the control and prevention of infectious disease, for their ability to spread virus and high mobility without surveillance. Asymptomatic blood donors during viremia period can pose a great threat to blood supply system with viremia of Zika virus reaching to a high level exceeding 10
 <sup>8</sup>copies/mL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, an extensive investigation of ZIKV prevalence in blood donations is quite essential to provide information for interventions implemented to ensure the safety of blood transfusion.
