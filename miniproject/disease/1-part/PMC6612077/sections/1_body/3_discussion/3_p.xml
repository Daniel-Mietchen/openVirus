<p id="Par26">The prevalence of anti-ZIKV antibodies (1.61%) in blood donation was almost twice as much as ZIKV RNA prevalence (0.85%), this may due to antibodies can persist longer in blood than nucleic acid, thus are more likely to be detected. But the existence of antibodies doesn’t mean the blood is contagious, for IgG antibody only indicate remote infections while IgM represent recent infections. On the contrary, a mere absence of ZIKV nucleic acid in blood samples does not absolutely rule out the existence of virus. So, both ZIKV RNA and antibodies in blood donations implied risks in blood supply system. Here we calculated the overall pooled prevalence of ZIKV including both ZIKV RNA and antibody, and then computed separately within each method. The 3 included antibodies-detected studies all tested for anti-ZIKV IgG antibodies, only 1 study (p5) tested both IgM and IgG and merely 3 cases were reactive with IgM in all included samples. Additionally, antibody detection assay may be compromised by cross-reacting antibodies and lead to false-positive results [

But there was no statistically significant difference between two detection methods, which may be due to the limited amount of studies in antibody detection. The prevalence of ZIKV in blood donations during epidemic period (1.37%) was more than two times higher than in non-epidemic period (0.61%). Blood donations collected during non-epidemic period were likely get infected because of the donors may have travel history to ZIKV endemic areas, and get infected without notice before donation. Another possibility that ZIKV has already transmitted into the study areas where are outside of the active-transmission regions or at risk of virus invading. There are four studies conducted in non-epidemic period, and three of them were detected ZIKV antibodies. So, it’s also a possibility that false-positive results were made because of antibody cross-reacting with other flavivirus. The result shows that South America has the highest prevalence of ZIKV in blood donations (2.17%), which is consistent with the geographic distribution of Zika infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and Brazil contributed most of the cases. Africa has a high prevalence of anti-Zika IgG (4.89%), which can be attributed to the sporadic circulation history of Zika in Africa [
