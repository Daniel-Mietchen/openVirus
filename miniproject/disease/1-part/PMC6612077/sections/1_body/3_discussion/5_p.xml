<p id="Par28">There are spaces for improvements to this review: Firstly, the amount of eligible studies was not enough for deep analysis of subgroups, for some subgroups contained only 1 study and some are null, which could reduce the accuracy of results. Secondly, significant high heterogeneity and publication bias were observed. Several factors might contribute to the existence of heterogeneity, for example, socioeconomic status, sanitary conditions and most importantly, the method used to detect ZIKV infection and the diagnostic cutoffs adopted. In addition, the heterogeneity of single-rate meta-analysis is usually higher than two-group study, such as case-control study and RCTs, because the data were extracted only from one group. It is common to see that

 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> statistic should not be the only standard to judge the reliability of a study. Based on the precisely sampling methods and detailed subgroup analyses, we believe that the pooled prevalence of ZIKV in blood donations calculated in this study are of high reference value. Thirdly, those studies that detected antibodies didnâ€™t confirm the result with RNA tests, this caused much uncertainty in the interpretation of the result. Finally, it would be better if detailed information was provided in included studies, such as the demographic characteristics of blood donors or the types of blood products (plasma, platelet, red cell and whole blood). With attention on ZIKV increases, more research data are expected in the future to provide more insights for intensive research.
