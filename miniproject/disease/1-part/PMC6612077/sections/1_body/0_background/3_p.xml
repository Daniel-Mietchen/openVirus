<p id="Par11">WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and FDA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have instituted multiple interventions to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmission (TT) ZIKV, such as deferral of blood collection in endemic areas and donors returned from Zika-endemic countries within 28 days; import of blood from low-risk regions; screening blood donations by ZIKV NAT (Nucleic Acid Tests) and/or treating them with PRT (Pathogen Reduction/inactivation Technology). On March 30, 2016, the first ZIKV NAT assay for blood screening was permitted by FDA for emergency use, enabling the blood collection in Puerto Rico resumed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and there is no urgent need to introduce universal screening of donated blood for ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, some studies mentioned that present measures were not effective enough to prevent transfusion of ZIKV RNA-reactive blood products, and ZIKV NAT should be used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Their attitudes varied greatly depend on the prevalence rate of ZIKV considered as low or high by different public health officials in different areas, but the cut-off value hasn’t been revealed. ZIKV TT risk modeling is not yet available to date due to the absence of critical parameters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and US FDA Zika guidance remained to be evaluated by a formal risk assessment and stakeholder consultation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Many factors can influence the interventions to reducing TT risk of ZIKV, including social, economic and ethical factors, but the foremost factor is the infection rate of ZIKV in blood components, which should be a topic for further discussions. In this study, we performed the first systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of ZIKV in blood donors or blood donations and find out potential risk factors. The result will provide valuable reference information for strategy making to ensure blood supply safety.
