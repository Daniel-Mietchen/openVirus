<p>Since the year 2000, computational and mathematical modeling of biological systems, also known as systems biology, has been widely used as a holistic approach to discover novel ways in which the virus and host interact. Here,

For example,

As such, inhibition or knockdown of CHK2 reduced JEV infection. This study elegantly demonstrates how systems biology is used to identify new strategies to combat arboviral infections.
