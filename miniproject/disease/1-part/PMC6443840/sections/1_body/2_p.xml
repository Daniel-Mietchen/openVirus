 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes transmit WNV to dead-end mammalian hosts, birds are reservoirs for WNV. Each host species exhibits similar innate immune responses that function through detection of viral RNA and subsequent JAK/STAT pathway activation that leads to adaptive immunity in mammals. In humans, WNV begins replicating in the skin at the site of mosquito bite before traveling to the lymph node, which can lead to viremia and neuronal infections.

Interestingly, the addition of mosquito saliva to keratinocytes reduced WNV-mediated inflammatory responses and lead to increased viral replication.
