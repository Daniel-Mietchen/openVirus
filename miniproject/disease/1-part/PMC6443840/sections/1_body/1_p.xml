<p>An important topic covered is the growing threat of infection by tick-borne viral pathogens.

Rodents are a true reservoir of TBFVs, as these animals harbor the virus without showing clinical disease. While the research community agrees that rodents play a major role in TBFV transmission, there remains a need for better understanding of the host response to infection with these viruses. TBFV infections in humans are often neurotropic and can cause acute neuroinflammation or tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) disease. Cases of TBE are highest in the summer-autumn period, and

Thus, bites during the summer-autumn period deliver a higher viral load to humans, and they call for these data to be used to forecast TBE risk.
