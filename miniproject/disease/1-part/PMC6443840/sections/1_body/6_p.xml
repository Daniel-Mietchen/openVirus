Specifically, the development of immunity to other flaviviral infections, particularly DENV, with which ZIKV co-circulates, or yellow fever virus, for which there is a vaccine, could facilitate ADE during ZIKV infection. However, more epidemiological and animal model data must be analyzed before fully understanding the role of ADE during ZIKV infection and pathogenesis. The findings from these studies could also help combat infection with each of the other arboviruses discussed in this research topic.
