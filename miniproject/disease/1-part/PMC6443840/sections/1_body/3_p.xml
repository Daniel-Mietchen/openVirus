<p>Key host cellular mechanisms of pathogenesis are explored, including the important role of host lipids in viral replication and downstream effects on specific host tissues. Cholesterol plays a fundamental role during flavivirus infection, from viral entry and innate immune responses to viral egress. Due to the dependence of flaviviruses on cholesterol,

Cholesterol and other lipid molecules also play a major role in epidermal homeostasis and hair follicle regeneration (Driskell et al.,

These results could mechanistically explain why some DENV-infected individuals display hair loss as a clinical manifestation.
