With regard to cellular markers and tropism of flaviviral infections,

They demonstrated that select viruses interfered with cytokine production and innate immunity in a species-dependent manner. Together, these articles emphasize the significance of cellular responses in realizing the zoonotic and pathogenic potential of arboviral infection.
