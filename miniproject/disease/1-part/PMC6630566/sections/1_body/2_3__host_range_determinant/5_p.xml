<p>Highly pathogenic avian H5N1, H7N7 and, more recently, H5N6 and H7N9 IAVs that emerged in poultry have caused human infections in several countries raising concerns about their pandemic potential. However, it should be noted that the HPAI human infections have not spread from person to person and none of the pandemic viruses from the last century were derived from HPAI viruses.</p>
