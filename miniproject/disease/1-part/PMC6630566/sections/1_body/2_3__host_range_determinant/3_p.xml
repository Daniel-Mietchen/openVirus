<p>The relevant SA receptors are present on epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract of humans and the gastrointestinal tract of birds. It is generally stated that α2,6 SA receptors are present in the upper respiratory tract of humans and α2,3 SA receptors are present in the lower respiratory tract, distal to the respiratory bronchioles [

 <xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, this is an oversimplification; a careful characterization of the N- and O-glycan composition of the human lung, bronchus and nasopharynx by mass spectrometry revealed that there was a wide spectrum of α2,3 and α2,6 glycans in the lung and bronchus [
 <xref rid="B11-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, when these data were combined with binding data from commonly used glycan arrays, even the most comprehensive array that contained the greatest diversity of sialylated glycans, was not predictive of productive replication in the bronchus and lung [
