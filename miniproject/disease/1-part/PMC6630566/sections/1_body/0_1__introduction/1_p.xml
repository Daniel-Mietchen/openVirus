<p>Much of what we know about pandemic influenza viruses is based on analysis of the four influenza A viruses (IAVs) that caused influenza pandemics in the last 100 years: the 1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2 and 2009 H1N1pdm09 viruses. Animal hosts, primarily avian species and swine are the source of novel IAVs that are introduced into the human population. Over the last 20 years, hundreds of sporadic human infections caused by a range of different avian IAV subtypes and a few swine virus subtypes have been identified. This review examines the factors that affect the ability of IAVs to cross the species barrier into humans</p>
