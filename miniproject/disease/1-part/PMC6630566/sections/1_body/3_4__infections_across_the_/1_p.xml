<p>Although mammals are generally infected by a limited range of IAV subtypes, it is clear that interspecies transmission of IAVs is more common than was previously thought. Sporadic human infections by a range of avian IAVs (H4, H5, H6, H7, H9 and H10) and swine IAVs (H1 and H3) have been reported over the last 20 years [

Many of these infections are associated with severe disease and a high case fatality rate (H5, H7, H10), while others have been associated with mild, self-limited illness (H3N2v, H6, H9). Notably, very few of these infections have spread from person to person. Conversely, human IAVs have infected and become established in pigs [
