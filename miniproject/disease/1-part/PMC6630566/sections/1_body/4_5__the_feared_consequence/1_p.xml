<p>Influenza pandemics occur when a novel influenza A virus, to which a significant proportion of the human population lacks immunity, infects humans and is able to spread efficiently from person to person through the airborne route, causing sustained chains of community-wide transmission. The introduction and spread of antigenically novel IAVs in humans is referred to as antigenic shift. Novel influenza viruses are introduced from an animal reservoir. If the virus is able to spread efficiently and if a large enough proportion of the population is susceptible to infection, the novel virus can spread around the world in a pandemic and usually replaces the previously circulating virus. </p>
