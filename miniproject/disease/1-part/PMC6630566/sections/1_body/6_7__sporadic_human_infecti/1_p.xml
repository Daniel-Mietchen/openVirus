<p>In addition to the four viruses that caused pandemics, several avian IAVs have crossed the species barrier to infect humans but have not caused a pandemic, including hundreds of cases of H5N1 and H7N9 infection and sporadic cases of H5N6, H6N1, H9N2, H7N7, H7N3, H7N4, and H10N8 infection [
 <xref rid="B33-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. All of these infections were caused by wholly avian IAVs and almost all cases were associated with exposure to infected poultry. Compared to the four viruses that caused influenza pandemics, with very rare exceptions in close contacts, these AIVs were not associated with secondary spread. Thus, although they crossed the species barrier, and the human population lacks immunity to these subtypes, they failed to spread from person to person.
