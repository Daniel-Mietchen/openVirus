<p>In contrast, the 1918 H1N1 virus is believed to have derived all of its genes from an avian IAV, though this has been debated in the literature [

 <xref rid="B31-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Pigs and humans were infected by the 1918 virus around the same time, though the virus evolved differently in the two species. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the 2009 H1N1pdm09 virus was derived from a reassortment of a North American lineage swine virus and a Eurasian avian-like virus circulating in pigs. It is not known when, where and in which pigs this reassortment event occurred. Since 2009, the virus has been isolated from pigs in many countries.
