<p>The 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemic influenza viruses were genetic reassortants that derived three [HA, NA and polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1)] or two (HA and PB1) gene segments, respectively, from an avian influenza virus and the remaining gene segments from the previously circulating human influenza virus [

In principle, for reassortment to occur, the putative host would have to be productively coinfected with avian and human IAVs. Pigs were proposed to serve as the ‘mixing vessel’ because they support replication of IAVs from both species [
