<p>Do host factors play a role in IAV transmission? The conventional wisdom was that only IAVs with an HA that bound α2,6 SA could transmit by the airborne route. The HAs of the 1957 and 1968 pandemic IAVs were derived from avian species and changed in their α2,3 SA binding specificity to bind α2,6 SA as they adapted to humans [

We found that acquisition of long-chain α2,6 SA binding was required, without loss of α2,3 SA binding and that the mutation that permitted this occurred in the soft palate of the ferret, a site that was overlooked in all previous influenza research [
 <xref rid="B42-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We found that the soft palate of ferrets, pigs and humans is highly enriched for long-chain α2,6 SA. This may explain why IAVs with preferential long chain α2,6 SA binding were selected in the soft palate of ferrets [
