<p>Even in the absence of epidemics since 1989, SLEV activity was documented continuously in California from the 1990s through 2003 by human cases, detections in mosquitoes, or seroconversions in sentinel chickens (

 </xref>). In 2003, WNV activity was first detected in the state (

 </xref>). During 2003–2015, no SLEV activity was detected in California, despite ongoing SLEV surveillance in

 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>). The absence of SLEV activity during that period was likely not the result of a lack of surveillance because the invasion of WNV led to a ≈6-fold statewide increase in mosquito pool testing, from ≈5,000 pools in 2003 to 30,000–35,000 pools annually since 2007. Instead, the absence of SLEV activity suggested extirpation from California.
