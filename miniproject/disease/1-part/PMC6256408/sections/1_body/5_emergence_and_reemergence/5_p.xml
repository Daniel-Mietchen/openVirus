<p>SLE was diagnosed in a febrile human in São Paulo State, Brazil, in 2004, by viral isolation and molecular detection (
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>31</italic>
 </xref>). Molecular characterization classified the isolate as SLEV genotype III. During a dengue virus outbreak in São José do Rio Preto (São Paulo State, Brazil) in 2006, Mondini et al. (
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>32</italic>
 </xref>) reported the first outbreak of SLE reported in Brazil. Human cases were diagnosed by molecular detection of SLEV RNA in serum or cerebrospinal fluid. All SLEV-infected patients (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>6</italic>
 </xref>) had an initial diagnosis of dengue fever or viral encephalitis; 3 cases were diagnosed as viral meningoencephalitis, and the other 3 patients had signs of hemorrhagic disease (

This finding indicates that genotype V SLEV strains are also pathogenic for humans, as shown in previous studies in murine models (

 </xref>). Because genotype V strains are widespread in South America, human SLEV cases could be misdiagnosed as dengue virus infection. A detailed analysis of South America human SLE cases is shown in
