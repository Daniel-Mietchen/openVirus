<p>The high prevalence of HEV in Saudi Arabia reported by old studies showed a seroprevalence ranging from (7.2% vs. 10.8%) in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to a prevalence of 16.9% and 18% in blood donors in Jeddah (west) and sickle cell anemia children in Jazan (south) [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; respectively. This study is the first study to investigate the prevalence of HEV in dromedary camels from Saudi Arabia. The high seroprevalence of DcHEV in dromedaries indicates that they might play a role as a zoonotic reservoir for viral infection to humans. In the absence of pig farming and consumption in Saudi Arabia, due to religious considerations, camels might play a role in the transmission of HEV to humans. Future HEV seroprevalence studies in humans are needed to investigate the role of DcHEV in the human population in Saudi Arabia especially due to the consumption of camel meat and products in the country. The potential role of dromedary camels in spreading HEV infection to humans is indicated by the experimental transmission of DcHEV to primates [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], together with the report of a possible transmission of HEV from consuming camel meat and milk to a person in UAE [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This shows that DcHEV might play a role in the spread of HEV hepatitis in regions where consumption of camel milk and camel products are common. Further studies are needed to investigate the prevalence of HEV RNA in dromedary populations in Saudi Arabia to elucidate the burden of the disease and the prevalent genotypes of HEV in the camel populations. Screening the human population for HEV will give more insights into the potential role of dromedaries in HEV transmission. Due to the fecal oral route of transmission of HEV it is recommended to investigate the seroprevalence of HEV in other animal species that are in frequent contact with camels such as sheep, goats, and horses.
