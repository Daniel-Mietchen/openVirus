<p>The seroprevalence of DcHEV infection has not been well studied, even in areas where camels are most frequently available for use in transportation and for meat and milk, due to the lack of an accurate method for detecting anti-DcHEV antibodies. A previous study showed that an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using virus-like particles of DcHEV (DcHEV-LPs) could detect anti-DcHEV IgG and IgM [
