 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] are among the risk factors for HEV infection. The disease is asymptomatic from the time of infection, but as it manifests, symptoms appear which might include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and jaundice [

HEV infections are ubiquitous in developing countries as a cause of epidemic and endemic acute hepatitis, the infection can be chronic in immunocompromised individuals receiving chemotherapy, solid organ transplant patients, and HIV patients [
