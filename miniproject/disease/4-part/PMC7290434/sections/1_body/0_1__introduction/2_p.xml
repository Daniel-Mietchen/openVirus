<p>HEV belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> and family 
 <italic>Orthohepeviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and is further classified under two genera namely 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic>, which includes isolates from mammals and chicken and 
 <italic>Piscihepevirus</italic> which includes Cutthroat trout isolates. 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> includes species A, B, C, and D, while 
 <italic>Piscihepevirus</italic> includes species A only. 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> A species includes isolates from humans, pigs, wild boars, rabbits, deer, mongoose, and camels [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. HEV is a single-stranded, positive- sense RNA genome that varies from 6.6 to 7.3 kB in length. There are eight known HEV genotypes belonging to a particular serotype [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The HEV genotypes 1 and 2 can infect humans only, while genotypes 3 and 4 are responsible for infection in humans and animals [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Genotypes 5 and 6 are responsible for infection in wild boar [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The HEV-7 and HEV-8 were identified in dromedary (1-humped) and bactrian (2-humped) camels, respectively [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Phylogenetic studies have shown that HEV sequences were detected in dromedaries in the United Arab Emirates and the isolates are classified as a new 
 <italic>orthohepevirus</italic> genotype, HEV 7 [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00553" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The first report of HEV type 7 in humans was detected from a patient undergoing a liver transplant and is linked to consuming camel products [
