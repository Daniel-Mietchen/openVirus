<p>The total number of positive cases in the collected samples was 270 resulting in a total prevalence of 23.1%. Imported camels showed a slightly lower prevalence than domestic camels (22.4% vs. 25.4%) with no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> value = 0.3). The age of the camels did not show significant difference in the prevalence of HEV in camels (
 <italic>p</italic> value = 0.827). Gender was significantly associated with the prevalence of HEV in the collected camels (
 <italic>p</italic> value = 0.015) where males (31.6%) were more infected than females (13.4%) (likelihood ratio = 6.675). The main characteristics of the IgG positive samples are presented in
