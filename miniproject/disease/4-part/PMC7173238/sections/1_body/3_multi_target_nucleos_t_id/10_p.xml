<p id="p0215">Penciclovir (PCV, 9-[4-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine), developed in Beecham Pharmaceuticals Laboratories, is an acyclic guanosine analogue. Penciclovir-triphosphate, its active metabolite, competitively inhibits the replicative function of the viral DNA polymerase. Unlike acyclovir, penciclovir is not considered a DNA chain terminator due to the presence of the 3â€²-OH group in the acyclic part of PCV, which allows DNA chain elongation. Incorporated penciclovir probably distorts the DNA conformation and then induces the suppression of further DNA elongation (

It is less active than acyclovir, but its longer half-life and higher intracellular concentration compensate for the lower antiviral effect. Phosphorylated penciclovir concentrations can be as much as 200-fold higher than those of phosphorylated acyclovir (
