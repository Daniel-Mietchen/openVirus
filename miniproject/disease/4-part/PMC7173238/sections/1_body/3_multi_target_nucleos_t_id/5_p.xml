<p id="p0190">As described above, some of the nucleotide-based anti-herpesvirus drugs are active against more than one virus. Idoxuridine (IDU, 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine, 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ) is an iodinated thymidine analogue and the first antiherpetic drug, discovered by W. Prusoff in 1959 (

The mechanism of action of idoxuridine is not exactly defined, but the triphosphate inhibits viral DNA synthesis and is incorporated into both viral and cellular DNA. Currently, in the United States, idoxuridine is approved for only topical treatment of HSV keratitis, but in Europe, idoxuridine in DMSO is available for the treatment of herpes labialis, herpes genitalis and herpes zoster (
