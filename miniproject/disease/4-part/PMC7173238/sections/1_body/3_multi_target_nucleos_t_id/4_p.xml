<p id="p0185">Drugs used clinically for treating herpesvirus infections can be divided into two categories: nucleoside analogues and non-nucleoside drugs. Both types of drugs target viral DNA polymerase. Nucleoside-type drugs enter cells through concentrative nucleoside transporters (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cano-Soldado and Pastor-Anglada, 2012</xref>). Inside the cell, these transporters undergo phosphorylation with a nucleoside kinase (e.g., thymidine kinase). This initial rate-limiting step leads to a monophosphate metabolite. The herpesvirus thymidine kinase is characterized as having broader substrate specificity than that of its counterpart in mammalian cells, and as a result, drugs targeting herpesviruses have relatively low toxicity (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Andrei et al., 2012</xref>). The second and third phosphorylation steps are performed by viral kinases. The triphosphorylated nucleoside formed in this way is the active form of this type of drug, and it can bind to the active sites of the viral DNA polymerase and act as a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme during viral DNA synthesis. The active form of nucleoside-type drugs can also act as a substrate for the viral enzyme and can be incorporated into the DNA chain, preventing the prolongation of the viral DNA and possibly causing the accumulation of mutations in the multiplying viruses or the induction of apoptosis (

To increase the oral bioavailability of some of the anti-herpesvirus drugs, such as acyclovir, penciclovir or ganciclovir, an amino acid esterification strategy is applied to obtain compounds such as valaciclovir, famciclovir and valganciclovir, respectively. These “prodrugs” are rapidly converted into the active form of the nucleoside-type drugs by enzymes in the liver and intestinal walls (
