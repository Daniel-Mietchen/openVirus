<p id="p0290">Decitabine (DAC; 5-aza-2â€²-deoxycytidine; Dacogen; Demylocan), another antineoplastic antimetabolite, is a cytidine analogue. This hypomethylating agent was approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of multiple types of myelodysplastic syndrome. It promotes cytotoxic DNA hypomethylation and cell death in rapidly dividing cells by disrupting DNA synthesis. Similar to azacytidine, decitabine also induces immune responses and sensitizes tumours to checkpoint inhibition (
