<p id="p0270">Recently, experimental data on the antiviral activity of gemcitabine have been widely reported (
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Shin et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ianevski et al., 2019</xref>). The broad range of viruses against which gemcitabine has shown activity includes HIV-1 (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Clouser et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Clouser et al., 2012</xref>), HIV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Beach et al., 2014</xref>), ZIKV (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Kuivanen et al., 2017</xref>), enteroviruses such as poliovirus (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), rhinoviruses (
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2017</xref>), HCV (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Beran et al., 2012</xref>), coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Dyall et al., 2014</xref>), Sindbis virus (SINV), HSV-1 and FLUAV (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Denisova et al., 2012</xref>). The synergistic effect of gemcitabine combined with low doses of other nucleoside analogues was also reported. It is applied in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of enteroviruses or with decitabine for the treatment of HIV (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Clouser et al., 2010</xref>). In most cases, gemcitabine inhibits viruses at low, non-cytotoxic concentrations (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Denisova et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Kuivanen et al., 2017</xref>). Depending on the virus, gemcitabine was shown to be an inhibitor of viral replication, proliferation, RNA and protein synthesis, or production. The gemcitabine antiviral effect on enteroviruses was proposed to be based on two actions. It can be directly incorporated into newly synthesized viral RNA during the polymerization process. Gemcitabine preferentially incorporates into viral RNA since the RNA replication process in viruses is more active than cellular DNA or RNA synthesis. It is also possible that gemcitabine can block the RNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide-binding regions. Another possibility is that the viral ribonucleotide reductase is inhibited, resulting in an increased mutation rate and loss of viral proliferation capability (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2015</xref>). It was postulated that the inhibition of RNA replication might be related to the limited amount of nucleoside available (
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2017</xref>). As a cytidine analogue, gemcitabine was reported to inhibit the salvage pathway of the pyrimidine biosynthesis. Additionally, treatment with gemcitabine activates the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (including CXCL10, IRF7, IRF9, IFIT1 or DDX58), the major effectors in innate immunity (
