<p id="p0300">Clofarabine (CAFdA; Cl-F-Ara-A; Clolar; Evoltra; FDA approval in 2004) is an antineoplastic agent used to treat lymphoblastic leukaemia, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in paediatric patients aged 1â€“21 whose disease has relapsed or become refractory after at least two prior treatment regimens. The drug acts as an antimetabolite that interferes with DNA replication. Clofarabine inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, causes termination of DNA chain elongation, and inhibits DNA polymerases. Additionally, it disrupts mitochondrial membrane integrity, which results in the release of apoptosis-inducing factors, pro-apoptotic proteins, and cytochrome C, leading to the activation of programmed cell death pathways.</p>
