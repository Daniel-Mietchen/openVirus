<p id="p0265">Gemcitabine (dFdC; dFdCyd) is an approved antineoplastic drug (initially approved by the FDA in 1996; brand name Gemzar) used for the treatment of different cancers (e.g., pancreatic, ovarian, lung and breast and bladder cancer) (

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cerqueira et al., 2007</xref>). It is a prodrug that is converted to monophosphate metabolites by deoxycytidine kinase and then to active diphosphate and triphosphate metabolites by nucleoside mono- and diphosphate kinases, respectively. The diphosphate metabolite acts as an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, which is the catalyst for deoxyribonucleotide generation (for DNA synthesis and repair). The triphosphate metabolite in turn competes with natural deoxycytidine-5-triphosphate to incorporate into replicating DNA (

Gemzar in combination with cisplatin was approved in 1998 for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and Gemzar in combination with paclitaxel was approved as the first-line therapy for women battling metastatic breast cancer. Gemzar demonstrates dose-dependent synergistic activity with cisplatin. In the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer (at least 6 months after completion of platinum-based therapy), gemcitabine is used in combination with carboplatin. Another study showed that co-treatment with gemcitabine and zidovudine re-sensitized gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer by inhibiting the key signalling pathway, Akt-GSK3Î²-Snail1, in the resistant cells (
