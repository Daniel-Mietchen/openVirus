<p id="p0320">Even though more than 90 antiviral drugs are currently approved for the treatment of viral infections, many of them are suitable for use only with a single virus. New antiviral drugs with activity against multiple viral types are being sought, and many of these compounds are subjects of advanced clinical trials. Moreover, experimental data open the possibility of repurposing broad-spectrum antimetabolites to other viral infections. Because these drugs have already been approved, such an application could save the time and money that are needed to prove their safety. It is possible that a compound that has already been classified as a drug against one virus may be suitable for the treatment of other viral infections. This approach is particularly important for candidates for the treatment of deadly viral infections, such as Ebola virus (EBOV). In this case, the safety threshold would be based on different criteria from those that are currently applied for drugs used to control chronic infections such as HIV and HBV.</p>
