It has been observed that patients who had both hepatitis B and hepatitis C and who were treated for hepatitis C for 12 weeks with a combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir had decreased hepatitis B surface antigen levels. This finding was the basis for the hypothesis that a similar decrease could be observed in mono-infected individuals with hepatitis B.
