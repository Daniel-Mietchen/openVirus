<p id="P12">This study establishes a connection between mosquito feeding behavior and viral development within the vector that has direct impacts on the transmissibility and epidemic risk of arboviruses. We found that providing a second non-infectious bloodmeal to mosquitoes enhances viral dissemination from the midgut for a number of different virus-vector pairings. We propose that under field-relevant feeding regimens, viruses emerging from infected midgut epithelium cells can more readily traverse the basal lamina during subsequent feeding episodes as a result of bloodmeal-induced microperforations (

 </sup>. If the initial infectious blood meal resulted in sporadic basal lamina disruption followed by partial repair, then growing virus foci will eventually overlap with regions of discontinuous basal lamina that could serve as a conduit for virus escape. The addition of a second bloodmeal would only increase the number of microperforations and thus increase the likelihood that virus foci will chance upon a basal lamina break prior to repair. This proposed model helps explain how a second bloodmeal accelerates virus dissemination from an already established midgut infection.
