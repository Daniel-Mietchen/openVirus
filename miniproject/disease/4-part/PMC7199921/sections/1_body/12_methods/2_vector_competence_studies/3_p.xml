<p id="P19">To evaluate ZIKV transmission by mosquitoes, saliva was collected in individual glass capillary tube containing immersion oil Type B. Salivation was allowed to occur for 25–30 min at room temperature. After salivation, the capillary tube was put into 100 μl of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% EquaFETAL (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO) and 100 Units/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin, and the tube was centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min. Outbred mice are susceptible to CHIKV infection
