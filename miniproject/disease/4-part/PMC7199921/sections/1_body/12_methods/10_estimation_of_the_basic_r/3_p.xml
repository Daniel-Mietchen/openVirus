 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> according to current understanding of ZIKV transmission dynamics. When parameters specific to ZIKV transmission were not available or as yet understood, we informed the ranges from dengue virus studies, as Zika and dengue are arboviruses of the same 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus, and are both spread by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus mosquitoes. Parameters were as specific as possible to 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti,</italic> although ranges often accounted for what may also be observed with 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> As a conservative assumption (and consistent with our experimental finding that the difference in dissemination rates disappeared by day 10), we used values of the vector competence from the literature and assumed 
 <italic>b</italic> did not vary between the single- and double-feed models. Parameter values and ranges are summarized in 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>. Parameter distributions are also specified, where triangular distributions signify the expectation that values close to the peak of the triangular distribution are more likely to occur (
