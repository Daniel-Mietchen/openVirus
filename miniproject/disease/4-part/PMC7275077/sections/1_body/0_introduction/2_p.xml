 </sup> and support risk assessment of this emerging pathogen. However, following the widescale circulation of CHIKV in the Americas since 2013, the evaluation of MAYV infection is greatly complicated by serological cross-reactivity where CHIKV infected individuals may experience a rise in MAYV antibody measures, even if they have not been infected by MAYV. This problem of cross-reactivity hampers serological studies across many different pathogens
