<p id="Par5">Here, we demonstrate that by jointly analyzing serological results for both MAYV and CHIKV alongside data on the age and location of participants, we can simultaneously reconstruct the history of circulation of the viruses and the extent of cross-reactivity. We apply our approach to MAYV and CHIKV in French Guiana, a territory that has seen a CHIKV epidemic between February 2014 and October 2015
