<p id="Par83">We tested four combinations of virus circulation models where (i) MAYV is constant and CHIKV is epidemic, (ii) both MAYV and CHIKV are epidemic, (iii) both MAYV and CHIKV are constant, (iii) MAYV is epidemic and CHIKV circulation is constant. DICs of the different models are shown in Supplementary TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>. The best fitting model was the one where the FOI was constant for MAYV but epidemic for CHIKV; this scenario was therefore considered as our baseline model.
