<p id="Par72">The simulated surveys could reproduce the observed age profile of the RFI distribution in the different regions except in High Oyapock (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). For this region, we explored if a model combining constant MAYV circulation along with a MAYV outbreak could improve the fit. While such model improved the fit for MAYV RFIs, it worsened it for CHIKV RFIs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and no overall improvement in terms of DIC was observed (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).
