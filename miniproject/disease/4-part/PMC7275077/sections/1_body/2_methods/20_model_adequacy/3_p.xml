<p id="Par73">In addition, we tested the ability of our approach to identify the correct epidemiological (constant force of infection vs. epidemic transmission), we simulated serological surveys for each of these scenarii. Both surveys had 500 individuals with age randomly drawn between 1 and 70. In the first simulation, we assumed a constant annual probability of infection of 0.01. In the second, we assumed an outbreak that happened in 1980 and infected 20% of the population. We fitted the epidemic and constant model on the two datasets. The DIC shows we are able to identify the correct scenario: we obtained a difference of DIC of 35 for the constant model survey and of 42 for the epidemic model survey. We also estimated the posterior distribution of the parameters. The probability of infection in the first model is 0.94% (95% CrI: 0.78–1.11%) (real value = 1%). For the outbreak model we found
