<p id="Par86">To test the hypothesis that males and females had different boosting, we estimated the model parameters on the subsets of males and females, respectively. We obtained small differences in the model estimates. The MAYV response for females was estimated to be 2.39 (95% CrI: 2.23–2.58) compared to 2.04 (95% CrI: 1.9–2.18) for males. Similarly females had a slightly higher CHIKV response of 3.71 (95% CrI: 3.65–3.75) vs. 3.55 (95% CrI: 3.48–3.62) for males. However we found larger individual variation among males compared to females (parameters

 <sup>M</sup> was 0.51 (95% CrI: 0.50–0.53) for females and 0.54 (95% CrI: 0.52–0.56) for males. The mean posterior of

 <sup>C</sup> was 0.39 (95% CrI: 0.38–0.41) for females and 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.43–0.47) for males (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Cross-reactivity parameters were estimated to be similar. Overall, the results on prevalence were similar to the baseline where we did not account for differential boosting. The total number of infected individuals was 73 males and 58 females for MAYV (total = 131 compared to 133 with the baseline model) and 192 males and 350 females for CHIKV (total = 542, which is the same as the baseline model).
