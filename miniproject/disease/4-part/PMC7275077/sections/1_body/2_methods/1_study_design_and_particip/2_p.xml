<p id="Par16">We estimated the sample size for this survey at 2500 persons distributed in the French Guiana territory based on a 50% seroprevalence, 95% confidence, 90% power and a cluster effect. To reach the desired sample size, a total of 1600 households were randomly selected for possible participation in the study from household databases maintained by the Geographic information and knowledge dissemination unit of the Regional environment, planning and housing agency and the National Institute of Economic and Statistical Information (INSEE). A stratified simple random sampling was adopted to select households allowing an over-representation of the isolated and small municipalities. The global sampling fraction of the households was 1:49 varying from 1:103 to 1:5 according to the municipality.</p>
