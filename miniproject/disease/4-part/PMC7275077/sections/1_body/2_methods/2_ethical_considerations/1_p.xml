Fieldworker teams including investigators, nurses or medicine residents were trained to visit all households, explain the project objectives, and, when allowed, collect participant’s signatures in a free and informed consent form and carry out the interviews. All members of selected households who were 2–75 years of age were invited to take part in the study during a preliminary face-to-face interview. For all participants under 18 years of age, one or two responsible adults signed the informed consent. A specific educational-style comic book was designed for children 6 to 17 years of age to explain, in an understandable way, the nature and objectives of the survey and inform them about the voluntary nature of the participation of the study and their rights to access and rectify their personal information. The study was recorded on Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT03210363) and approved by the “Sud-Ouest &amp; Outre-Mer IV” Ethical Research Committee (No.CPP17-007a/2017-A00514-49) and by the French Data Protection Authority (No.DR-2017-324) responsible for ethical issues and protection of individual data collection.</p>
