<p id="Par10">Once parameters characterizing cross-reactivity and the force of infection have been estimated, the model can be used to improve the interpretation of serological assays and estimate the prevalence of infection. We propose a model-based classification that derives for each possible value of the assays the probability of infection by MAYV and/or CHIKV and classifies the result as infected if the estimated probability of infection is above 50% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). To validate the model-based classification, 100 sera were selected for further testing with anti-MAYV and anti-CHIKV microneutralization tests (MNTs). Using the results from the MNTs as the gold standard, we find that the model-based classification that uses both RFI values performs substantially better than a classification based on a simple optimized cut-off (Fig.
