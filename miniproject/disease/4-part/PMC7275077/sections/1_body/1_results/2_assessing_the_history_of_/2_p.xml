<p id="Par9">For CHIKV, our best fitting model (see Methods section Alternative models of virus circulation) correctly identifies that the virus emerged only recently in French Guiana (Fig.

 </sup> and predominantly circulated in the coastal and urbanized areas, as well as the north western region of the territory. Contrasting with MAYV, we find that females are more likely to be infected by CHIKV than males (relative FOI is 1.2, 95% CrI: 1.0–1.4) and children are as likely as adults to be infected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). We find an increased risk of CHIKV infection for individuals that spend more time at home. We assessed whether this observation could help explain the increased level of CHIKV infection among women. In the survey, participants were asked the average time they spend at home per day. We found that females were 1.38 (95% CrI: 1.13–1.69) times more likely than men to spend &gt;16 h per day at home. Spending time at home was also associated with infection by CHIKV (OR, 95% CrI: 1.84 (1.41–2.40)), but not significantly associated with MAYV infection (OR, 95% CrI: 1.30 (0.79–2.14)). These findings are consistent with a previous study on CHIKV transmission in Bangladesh, which suggested that the increased time women spend within and around their home compared to men was responsible for an increased risk of infection

 </sup>. We also tested whether the differences between males and females could be explained by differential boosting of the RFI rather than different viral exposure levels. We ran the same model using only males and only females. We found that the overall prevalence was not modified by this additional assumption, although we found a slightly larger mean boosting for females, but larger individual variations for males (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). There is a good adequacy between model predictions and the data (Supplementary Figs.
