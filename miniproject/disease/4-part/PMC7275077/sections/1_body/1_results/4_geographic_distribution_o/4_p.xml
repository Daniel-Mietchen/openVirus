 </sup>. Our study shows how modeling techniques integrating multiple data streams may overcome this issue, with important implications for the interpretation of pathogen serosurveys. Here, this allowed us to determine the level of circulation of MAYV, which is non-negligible in some parts of French Guiana. Our results highlight the need to strengthen surveillance for MAYV in the region so as to be able to quickly detect any substantial change in MAYV circulation patterns that may be indicative of a rise to emergence.
