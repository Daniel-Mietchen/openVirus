<p id="Par13">To assess the risk of future MAYV emergence, it is important to understand how the CHIKV outbreak affected the susceptibility to MAYV. With our model-based classification, we found only five individuals with evidence of historical infections by both viruses. While this may be indicative of cross-immunity between the two alphaviruses, it may also be due to the vectors occupying different ecological niches. Serological assays alone are unable to differentiate between these potential mechanisms. Future animal challenge models may help in this context. Our results are specific to the E2 antigens used in the assay. Future studies that use different antigens would likely result in different estimates of cross-reactivity.</p>
