<p>The IAV genome is comprised of eight segmented, negative sense, single-stranded RNAs which are bound by nucleoprotein (NP) and the vRdRp [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Three subunits, PB1, PB2, and PA proteins, make up the vRdRp complex. The PB1 protein is the main catalytic unit of the vRdRp, responsible for transcribing viral mRNAs and replicating the viral genome (vRNA) through a positive sense intermediate (cRNA) [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PB2 and PA bind to PB1 to make up the core structure of the vRdRp which has been shown in a number of crystal structures, including a recently solved crystal structure of human H3N2 vRdRp [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has been well described that vRdRp derived from avian IAVs do not function well in mammalian cells. However, it has also been determined that adaptive mutations in the polymerase subunits can rescue the functionality of avian vRdRp in mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The environment in which avian and human IAVs replicate differs significantly; the median temperature of the avian enteric tract is around 40 °C, while human airways range from 33 °C (upper respiratory tract) to 37 °C (lower respiratory tract). Temperature-sensitive adaptive mutations have been identified in the vRdRp and are even exploited when making live attenuated influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Historically, the majority of host adaptive mutations that have been found in the influenza A vRdRp are located in the PB2 subunit. Very few adaptive mutations have been characterized in PB1, and in fact, avian PB1 is able to function in assays where mammalian-adapted PA and PB2 are present. This is supported by the fact that the 1957 and 1968 pandemic viruses contained an avian PB1 gene but PB2 and PA genes were from human adapted IAVs [
