<p>Unlike NS1 which is proposed to prevent mRNA processing through its interaction with CPSF30, PA-X directly degrades host mRNAs through its N-terminal endonuclease domain. In fact, it has been shown that mutations in the endonuclease domain are able to completely inactivate PA-X shutoff activity [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In an effort to characterize PA-X functionality, several groups have identified amino acid residues which are critical for PA-X shutoff activity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00365-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the functional domains of PA-X and the location of amino acid residues known to affect shutoff activity on a crystal structure of the PA N-terminal domain. Initially, the X-ORF was the subject of intense study as it contains a unique sequence not found in the full-length PA protein that could explain the distinct functions of PA and PA-X. Sequence analysis identified two strain-dependent isoforms of PA-X which have either a 61 or 41 amino acid X-ORF. These two isoforms are hypothesized to play a role in host adaptation, as avian origin PA-X typically contains the 41 amino acid X-ORF while the X-ORF in human IAVs is typically 61 amino acids in length [

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The additional C-terminal 20 residues in the 61 amino acid X-ORF do not appear to have a significant impact on PA-X shutoff activity, as determined by reporter gene assays [

 <xref rid="B108-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. However, one study showed that viruses containing PA-X with the 61 amino acid X-ORF exhibited enhanced viral replication and virulence in mice compared to viruses expressing the 41 amino acid X-ORF, suggesting that the C-terminal 20 residues have an additional function to enhance viral replication in vivo [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. As of yet, the current body of literature does not fully address the function of these additional 20 C-terminal residues.
