<p>Additionally, a recent study reported a posttranslational modification on the N-terminal E2 residue of PA-X by an acetyltransferase, NatB [

The effects of acetylation on individual proteins is hard to predict, with N-terminal acetylation reported to differentially effect proteinâ€“protein interactions, localization, stability, and structure of various cellular proteins [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. However, acetylation of E2 in PA was also shown to be required for the function of PA as a component of vRdRp, highlighting the importance of posttranslational modifications in PA or PA-X [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Further work is needed to understand how exactly this post translational modification affects PA-X shutoff activity. Interestingly, in the structure of the N-terminal of PA-X, residues 2 and 28 are in close proximity to each other and the beginning of the X-ORF appears to fold back near this N-terminal region, suggesting that this region forms a critical domain required for the shutoff function of PA-X. Taken together, these data suggest that coordination between the N-terminal region and X-ORF is essential for PA-X activity, possibly through association with key host factors.
