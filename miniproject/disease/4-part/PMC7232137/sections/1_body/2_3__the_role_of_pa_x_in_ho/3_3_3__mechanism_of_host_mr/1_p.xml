<p>It has been shown that PA-X selectively targets cellular RNA pol II transcripts in the nucleus while sparing products of pol I and pol III [

While this explains specificity for targeting host mRNAs, as viral mRNAs are transcribed by viral RdRp, the mechanism of how host pol II transcripts are targeted by PA-X is not fully elucidated. Unlike the full-length PA in the vRdRp complex, PA-X lacks the C-terminal domain of PA which allows for specific interactions with the Ser5 phosphorylated RNA pol II C-terminal domain; therefore an additional mechanism must exist to allow for PA-X specificity for RNA pol II transcripts. One possibility is that PA-X interacts with cellular factors involved in pol II transcription or transcript processing. In agreement with this, a recent study indicated that PA-X preferentially degrades spliced pol II transcripts [

Additionally, a proteomic analysis using both the 61 and 41 amino acid X-ORFs from PA-X suggested there are a number of PA-X interactions with cellular proteins involved in mRNA processing. This analysis revealed 156 candidate proteins including 29 high confidence interactions that can be divided into four main groups: RNA splicing factors, pre-mRNA processing factors, proteasome factors, and proteins involved in nuclear import/export. Interaction of PA-X with NUDT21, a component of the CFIm complex that modulates polyadenylation of pre-mRNA, was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation [

 <xref rid="B111-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. In addition to interactions through the X-ORF, PA-X likely interacts with other host factors through the N-terminal domain as well. Future studies to unravel additional interacting partners and potential differences amongst various IAV strains are needed to fully understand PA-X induced host shutoff activity and its potential role in host adaptation.
