<p>Recently, PA has become an attractive target for therapeutic interventions against IAV because of its essential role in viral transcription and replication. Thanks in part to the large amount of structural information on PA and vRdRp, it has become more feasible to target PA with drugs and inhibitors. One such inhibitor, baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza
 <sup>TM</sup>), specifically targets the endonuclease activity of PA by binding in the endonuclease active site and inhibits replication of both influenza A and B viruses [

This targeting to the endonuclease active site indicates that baloxavir likely would be effective in inhibiting PA-X shutoff activity as well, although this has not been demonstrated. Baloxavir is currently licensed for usage to treat uncomplicated influenza A and B infections in both the United States and Japan. In clinical trials, baloxavir was shown to reduce viral loads and symptoms of influenza infection similar to treatment with oseltamivir (Tamiflu
 <sup>TM</sup>), a neuraminidase inhibitor [

The mutation from isoleucine to either threonine, phenylalanine, or methionine at residue 38 is predicted to prevent baloxavir from binding in the endonuclease active site [

 <xref rid="B125-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. While targeting the vRdRp and PA/PA-X activity is promising as a treatment for acute IAV infection, these resistance mutations have been observed to arise rapidly in the human population as well. During a phase III clinical trial, 9.7% of baloxavir recipients were found to be harboring a strain with PA I38T/F/M resistance mutations after baloxavir treatment for only five days [
