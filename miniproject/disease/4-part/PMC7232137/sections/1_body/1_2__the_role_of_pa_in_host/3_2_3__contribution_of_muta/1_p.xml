<p>While mutations in PB2 have long been known to regulate host adaptation, recent studies indicate that PA mutations also play a major role [

 <xref rid="viruses-12-00365-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> highlights experimentally-verified host adaptive mutations in PA that are involved in avian to mammalian transmission and the locations of these mutations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00365-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Many of these host adaptive mutations in PA were not identified until after the outbreak of the H1N1pdm09 virus. As previously mentioned, this virus did not contain typical mammalian adaptive mutations in PB2 and instead mutations in PA were found to play a larger role in modulating polymerase activity [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, the recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian IAVs led to identification of previously unknown host adaptive mutations in PA. Characterization of H5N1 viruses, which have caused severe disease in humans, shows that some of these viruses contain the characteristic mutations E627K and D701N in PB2 [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, detailed analysis of H5N1 viruses also revealed the presence of host adaptive mutations in PA. In particular, this includes mutations at residues A343T and N383D that activate polymerase activity in human cells in the absence of PB2 E627K or D701N [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition to these experimentally confirmed adaptive mutations in PA, some bioinformatics analysis suggest that there are additional residues involved in mammalian host adaptation [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, many of these residues still need to be experimentally validated to be certain they do in fact play a role in host adaptation. Experimentally validating these residues involves characterizing how they would affect viral mRNA transcription, viral RNA replication, and overall viral polymerase activity, alongside viral growth and pathogenicity in mammalian hosts.
