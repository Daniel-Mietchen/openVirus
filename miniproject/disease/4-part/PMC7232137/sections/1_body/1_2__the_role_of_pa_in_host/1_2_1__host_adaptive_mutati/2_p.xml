<p>Recently, it has become apparent that the PA subunit can play a major role in the host adaptation of avian vRdRp. This was highlighted with the emergence of the H1N1pdm09 virus which originated from genomic reassortment events in swine. Genetic analysis determined that the PB1 gene segment was introduced to swine from a human IAV, while the PB2 and PA segments were recently introduced into swine from an avian IAV around 1998 [

What is interesting from the H1N1pdm09 virus is that the PB2 gene segment originated from an avian IAV and was maintained for approximately ten years in the swine population without acquiring previously described host-adaptive PB2 mutations such as E627K. Instead, our lab and others have found that the PA segment in the H1N1pdm09 virus contains a number of host-adaptive mutations that determine the activity of vRdRp in mammalian cells [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, there have been several studies regarding novel H5N1 and H7N9 avian IAVs whose replicative ability and virulence have been linked to mutations in PA in addition to the previously described host adaptive mutations in PB2 [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00365" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Together these studies show that the PA gene segment also plays a major role in the adaptation of avian IAVs to mammals and the emergence of pandemic viruses.
