<p>In Thailand, RV gastroenteritis is common in children but not as prevalent in adults. In the winter season of 2017â€“2018, an outbreak of acute RV-induced gastroenteritis in adults was reported in Thailand (mainly Bangkok). As mentioned earlier, immunity acquired following exposure during childhood may effectively contribute to protection against infection in individual adults. Therefore, the potential factors underlying the increased number of adults suffering from RV infections is worth investigation. The main objective of the current study was to determine the genotype distribution of RV in adults over an extended period from July 2016 to December 2019.</p>
