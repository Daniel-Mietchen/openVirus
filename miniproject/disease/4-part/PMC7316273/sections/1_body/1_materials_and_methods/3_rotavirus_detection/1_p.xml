<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 10% (v/v) stool suspension in phosphate buffer saline. RNA was automatically extracted from 200 μL supernatant stool samples after centrifugation at 4,000 
 <italic>x</italic> g for 10 minutes using a magLEAD 12gC instrument (Precision System Science, Chiba, Japan) with a magLEAD Consumable Kit (Precision System Science, Chiba, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification of the partial 
 <italic>VP6</italic> gene was performed in a 25 μL reaction volume comprised 10 μM forward primer VP6-F (5’- GACGGVGCRACTACATGGT-3’) and reverse primer VP6-R (5’-GTCCAATTCATNCCTGGTGG -3’), based on the study of Kang G. et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 2 μL RNA template using the QuantiTect SYBR Green 1-step real-time RT-qPCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was conducted at 50°C for 30 min, followed by heat denaturation at 95°C for 15 min. In total, 45 cycles of amplification were performed comprising denaturation at 94°C for 15 sec, annealing at 50°C for 30 sec, and extension at 72°C for 30 sec. Melting curve analysis was performed from 60°C to 95°C with 1°C increments. Amplified products were purified and sequenced for I genotype identification.
