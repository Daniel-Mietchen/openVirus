<p>In addition to the prevalence of adult RV infections, the molecular characteristics of RV-induced acute gastroenteritis in adults were investigated. The distribution of 
 <italic>G</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> types in Thailand have changed over time, but seasonality of RV infection remains unchanged [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The 
 <italic>G1</italic> genotype combination with 
 <italic>P[8]</italic> strains has been predominantly identified in many parts of Thailand since 1993, followed by genotypes 
 <italic>G2</italic>, 
 <italic>G3</italic>, and 
 <italic>G9</italic> in different seasons and regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. From 2000 to 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], various 
 <italic>G</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> type combinations have been detected, such as 
 <italic>G1P[8]</italic>, 
 <italic>G2P[4]</italic>, 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic>, and 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic>. On an annual basis, the dominant 
 <italic>G</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> types were identified as 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic> from 2000 to 2004, 
 <italic>G1P[8]</italic> from 2005 to 2009, 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic> from 2009 to 2011, 
 <italic>G1P[8]</italic> from 2012 to 2014, and 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic> from 2015 to 2016. Moreover, uncommon genotypes, such as 
 <italic>G3P[10]</italic> and 
 <italic>G12P[8]</italic>, were detected. In the current study, 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic> was the predominant strain (33.2%, 75/226), consistent with previous reports from Indonesia (2015–2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Brazil (2016–2017) [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], followed by 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic> (17.3%, 39/226) and 
 <italic>G2P[4]</italic> (15.0%, 34/226). In terms of genetic backbone, the DS-1-like strain (I2) was prevalent (55.3%, 125/226) with the highest being unusual DS-1-like 
 <italic>G3P[8]I2</italic> (53.6%, 67/125), followed by 
 <italic>G2P[4]</italic>I2 (27.2%, 34/125).
