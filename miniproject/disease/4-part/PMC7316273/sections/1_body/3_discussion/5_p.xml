<p>In conclusion, the increase in RV infections in adults during the winter season in 2017â€“2018 relative to that during the equivalent periods in the previous and subsequent years was of significant interest. Genotyping of the RV backbone in routine surveillance provided additional information to explain this finding. The unusual DS-1-like 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic> strain was most prevalent amomg rotavirus strains detected in this study (29.6%, 67/226). The results obtained may aid in further understanding of not only viral evolution but also symptomatic infection in adults. The effectiveness of the vaccine should be concerned for the unusual DS-1-like strain. Therefore, continuous and extensive surveillance, including genotyping of RV infection, is essential for preventive measures, vaccine efficacy, and control of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks.
