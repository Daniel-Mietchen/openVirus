<p>The participant must be informed that his/her participation is entirely voluntary, that he/she can withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment nor his relationship with the treating physician. If participants withdraw from the study, they will be asked whether information that has been obtained about them before they have chosen to withdraw may be used for analysis and hence may be included in reports and publications. If participants also withdraw their consent for data processing, all obtained data from them will be excluded from further analysis and processing.</p>
