<p id="p0040">The first layer of information transfer and transformation from genotype to phenotype is mediated by molecular networks within the cell. In analogy to the genome representing the blueprint for all molecular components, the collection of all their interactions is referred to as the 
 <italic>interactome</italic>. The interactome thus represents the blueprint for the collective functions that emerge from interactions between individual components. Most commonly, the term interactome is used specifically for 
 <italic>protein-protein interaction (PPI)</italic> networks. Over the last two decades, genome-scale PPI networks have become available for a variety of species (
