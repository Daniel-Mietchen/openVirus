<p id="p0010">In the 19th century, brilliant pioneers the like of Mendel, Darwin and Semmelweis required little more than meticulous observation of their surroundings for developing their theories on inheritance, evolution and infectiology that would become the foundations of modern biology and medicine. Since then, a range of sophisticated technologies have been developed that now allow us to observe biological systems at molecular resolution. However, our rapidly growing knowledge at the molecular level also revealed the fundamental limitations of traditional reductionist approaches that aim to understand complex biological systems by dissecting their individual elements (

It is becoming increasingly clear that many system-wide phenomena cannot be understood in this fashion, and that often the ‘whole is more than the sum of its parts.’ It is thus essential to systematically study not only the isolated elements of these systems, but also their interactions. These interactions are key to understand the emergence of novel properties and behaviors, in particular when moving across different scales, i.e., from molecules to cells, tissues, organs and organisms or entire populations (
