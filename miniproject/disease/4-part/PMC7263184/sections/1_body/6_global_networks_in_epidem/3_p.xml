<p id="p0095">Smallpox is currently the only human infectious disease that was successfully eradicated through immunization. There are two key aspects for the success of an immunization campaign: First, the effective access to immunization, which includes the availability of a vaccine, but also the individual willingness to get vaccinated. The latter may decline along with the disease prevalence, even in countries where immunization is compulsory. It has been shown that a better understanding of the herd effect improves the adherence to such programs (

Second, the impact that an immunization of a certain subpopulation has on the spreading of the disease, i.e., how it reduces the contagion rate in total, as well as within smaller subcommunities. This aspect can be studied from a network theory point of view. The structure of the social face-to-face contact network determines whether bottlenecks (such as high centrality nodes or links) could prevent a disease outbreak and whether some communities are more at risk than others. This enables the design of more efficient quarantine strategies with maximal impact on the social network connectivity. In the past, epidemiological modeling was essential for example in handling the avian influenza outbreak in 2005 (
