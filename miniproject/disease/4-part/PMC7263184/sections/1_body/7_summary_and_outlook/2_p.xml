<p id="p0105">An important open question in this context is how exactly different network perturbations influence each other. For example, it has been found that a network overlap between a drug-induced perturbation and a disease associated perturbation may either indicate an effective treatment of the respective disease, but also the opposite, namely that the disease may be a side effect of the treatment (

This highlights an important methodological and conceptual limitation of current network approaches: We are still lacking a systematic understanding of the combined effect of independent perturbations, in particular when considering complex phenotypes. To date, most large-scale experimental efforts for elucidating the combined effect of perturbations relied on relatively simple, one-dimensional readouts, such as growth assays, for example in the characterization of genetic interactions (

 <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Piotrowski et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, more informative readouts have been employed as well, such as high-content imaging or next-generation sequencing, which allow for a much more detailed assessment of the interactions between different perturbations. Using these high-dimensional readouts it is possible to identify different types of interactions between perturbations (positive, negative), as well as their direction. Furthermore, high-dimensional readouts allow for the identification of interactions that lead to the emergence of entirely new phenotypes. The first studies aiming to map out such high-resolution ‘perturbome’ networks were based on morphological changes induced by combinations of genetic perturbations in a model organism (
