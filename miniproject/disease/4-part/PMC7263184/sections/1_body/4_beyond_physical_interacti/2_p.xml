<p id="p0060">Functional networks may also contain various types of nodes, connecting for example genes and drugs: A genome-wide screen in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has recently been used to map out the interactions between 1377 chemical compounds and 177 genes (
 <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Piotrowski et al., 2017</xref>). Systematically exploring pairwise combinations of cellular perturbations has great potential for functionally annotating individual components, such as genes, drugs or environmental factors, as well as for identifying the involved molecular pathways and, more generally, for elucidating the fundamental rules that underlie the cellular response to combinations of perturbations.
