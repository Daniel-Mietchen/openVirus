<p id="p0055">The links in the molecular networks discussed above represent physical interactions that can be directly measured. In addition to these 
 <italic>physical networks</italic>, we can also construct 
 <italic>functional networks</italic>, where links represent more indirect relationships or similarities. The most commonly used functional networks are co-expression networks, where two genes are linked if their expression levels were found to be correlated across different experimental conditions (
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Saha et al., 2017</xref>). Other important examples are genetic interaction networks, where a link between two genes indicates that the phenotype of their combined knock-out deviates from the expectation based on the individual knockouts (

 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Rauscher et al., 2018</xref>), drug-drug interaction networks, in which links connect non-additive drugs (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Caldera et al., 2019</xref>) or chemical networks, in which compounds are linked based on structural similarity (
