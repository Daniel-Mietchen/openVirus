<p id="p0020">Network theory provides a versatile and general toolbox for investigating complex systems composed of interacting elements. In the most generic case, each element of the system is represented by a node and each interaction between a pair of nodes by a link (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). In mathematical terms, the collection of all nodes and links is also called a ‘graph.’ This simple definition can be extended, for example by adding weighted or directed links, by including time-dependence or different layers of connectivity between the nodes, resulting in so-called weighted, directed, temporal or multi-layer networks, respectively.
