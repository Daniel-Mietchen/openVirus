  <p>The processes involved in human health and disease range from the molecular to the population scale. Networks provide a unifying framework for describing and investigating the complex interactions that occur both within and across scales: They can be used to describe the molecular interactions forming the basis of all biological processes within the cell, as well as the social interactions that form the basis for the spread of infectious diseases. Diseases can be conceptualized as perturbations of these intricate systems. These perturbations may be internal, for example genetic mutations, or external, for example environmental exposures.</p>
