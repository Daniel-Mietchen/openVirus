  <bold>Loan Vulliard</bold> studied bioinformatics in Lyon (France), Daejon (South Korea), Copenhagen (Denmark), and Montpellier (France) and graduated in 2017 with a Master's degree in bioscience from INSA Lyon, France. Interested in systems biology and computational methods for analyzing large biological datasets, he then joined the group of Dr. JÃ¶rg Menche at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna (Austria) as a doctoral candidate. His work involves planning and interpreting large-scale high-content screening experiments using network science. His main focus are drug-gene interactions and how intrinsic and extrinsic factors can combine and affect cellular morphology.
