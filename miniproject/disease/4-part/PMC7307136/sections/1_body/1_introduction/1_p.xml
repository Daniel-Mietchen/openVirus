<p id="p0155">The family 
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic> contains important genera of plant viruses, with host ranges varying from narrow to very wide, and infecting herbaceous plants, shrubs and even trees. Several of them are responsible for major epidemics in fodder crops such as tomato, cucurbits, bananas, or alfalfa. The members of the family 
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic> have spherical or bacilliform particles with a tri-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome, packaged in separate virions. Bromovirids can be transmitted mechanically, via the pollen, seeds or by insect vectors.
