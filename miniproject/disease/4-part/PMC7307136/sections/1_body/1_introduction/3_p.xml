<p id="p0165">The two prototype genera, 
 <italic>Bromovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cucumovirus</italic>, are the genera mostly related, with the latter being agriculturally important. Both bromo- and cucumoviruses share such properties like the molecular and genetic features of their tripartite RNA genome, the number of encoded proteins and similar virion structure. The computer-assisted comparisons of aa sequences reveal significant similarity among their RNA replication proteins, much beyond the presence of characteristic GDD motif for 2a or for helicase/transferase domains in 1a. More broadly, the replication proteins share aa sequence similarity within the alphavirus-like super-family of positive-strand RNA viruses, which includes numerous plant and important animal/human viruses. The type members of different genera, such as CMV, BMV and AMV, have and continue to constitute excellent models for molecular research on viral gene expression, RNA replication, virion assembly, RNA recombination, epidemiology or the role of cellular genes in basic virology.
