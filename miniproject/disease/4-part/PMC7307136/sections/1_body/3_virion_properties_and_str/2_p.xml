<p id="p0180">In genus 
 <italic>Bromovirus</italic> three types of icosahedral particles are composed of 180 molecules of a 20 kDa CP, and encapsidate different RNA components: RNA1 (Mr 
 <italic>c.</italic> 1.1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>), RNA2 (Mr 
 <italic>c.</italic> 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) and RNA3 plus sgRNA4 (Mr 
 <italic>c.</italic> 0.75 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 0.3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>). In addition to viral RNAs, BMV virions have been recently reported to package small amounts of host RNAs, with their functions yet to be determined. The members of the genus 
 <italic>Cucumovirus</italic>, in addition to three genomic RNAs, encapsidate two sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and a satellite RNA.
