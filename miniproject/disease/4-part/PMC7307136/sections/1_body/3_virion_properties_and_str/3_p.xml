<p id="p0185">The crystal structures of both BMV and CCMV have been resolved showing very similar organization (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ), with the CP subunits folded into a beta-barrel core organized within the protruding both pentameric and hexameric capsomers. The interactions among hydrophobic aa residues stabilize the capsomers, and the hexameric subunits are further stabilized via interactions between N-terminal portions, where six short beta-strands form a tubule called beta-hexamer. Mutational analysis demonstrated that beta-hexamer was not required for virion formation but rather modulated virus spread 
 <italic>in planta</italic>. In addition, the capsomers are hold together by interactions through C-terminal portions that extend radially from the capsid. The C-termini are anchored between the beta-barrel core and the N-proximal loop, and this interaction might be responsible for initiation of assembly of CCMV capsids. The structure of BMV is organized similarly to that of CCMV such that both capsids undergo well-studied reversible structural transitions where shifting pH from 5.0 to 7.0 causes capsid expansion. However, some CP mutations can further stabilize the capsids. Capsids are also stabilized by metals at multiple biding sites that coordinate the amino acids from adjacent CP subunits.
