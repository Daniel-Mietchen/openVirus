<p id="p0220">Replication of bromovirus RNAs are the best studied among the members of the family 
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic>. Only viral proteins 1a (helicase and methyl-transferase domains) and 2a (RdRp), but not the proteins 3a or CP, are required for RNA synthesis (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), first demonstrated for BMV, both in plant and in yeast cells. The cytoplasmic RNA replicase complex localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes called spherules. The extracted bromoviral RdRp preparations have allowed for mapping in vitro on three genomic BMV RNAs the promoter of (–) strand synthesis within the 3′ UTR. The promoters of (+) strand synthesis have also been mapped to the 5′ proximal non-coding region in BMV RNAs. Likewise, the sub-genomic promoter (sgp) has been localized as a 100 nt subset of the 250 nt intercistronic region in (–) strand in BMV RNA3, being responsible for synthesis (transcription) of sgRNA4. In addition, in the plus strand the 250 nt intercistronic sequence supports other functions including the efficient RNA3 replication, the maintenance of a proper ratio of (+) to (–) strands of RNA3, stabilization of RNA3 via interaction with protein 1a, synthesis (transcription) of sgRNA4, and the assembly of the active RNA replication complex. It also serves as an efficient RNA recombination hot spot. Some bromoviruses as well as togaviruses carry the internal poly(A) tract, as part of the intercistronic region of the RNA3 segment. Besides viral RNA sequences and viral proteins, a variety of essential host genes affecting BMV RNA replication have been identified, by using yeast knockout libraries, as apparently the yeast cells can support a complete replication cycle of this virus
