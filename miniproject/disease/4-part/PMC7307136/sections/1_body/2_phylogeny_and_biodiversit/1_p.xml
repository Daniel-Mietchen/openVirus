<p id="p0170">Although RNA1, 2 and 3 overall keep a great similitude in their sequences, clearly rearrangements of RNAs has been done for members of the Bromoviridae. Both RNA recombination but also segment reassortment played a major role as the sources of variation in shaping the bromovirids member groups, being important contributors to the evolutionary history of the family, especially for the genera 
 <italic>Bromovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cucumovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ilarvirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). However, doubts have been shed on the biological significance of the official taxonomy of the family 
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic>. To better understand the taxonomy, attempts have been made to reconcile the incongruences observed in the viruses’ evolutionary radiation caused by recombination and reassortment. These two processes could create new genetic variability and then these primary variants would undergo further selection for functional genomes of individual viruses. Consequently, the variants generated by reassortment and recombination events must have been initially viable which represents the first selective filter while further directional selection fine tunes the newly created RNAs. RNA segment reassortment was probably common at the origin of the bromoviruses and cucumoviruses as well as at the origin of Alfalfa mosaic virus, American plum line pattern virus and Citrus leaf rugose virus. Furthermore, recombination analyzes done for each of the three genomic RNAs revealed very common crossovers within the members of the genera Bromovirus, Cucumovirus and Ilarvirus, but also mixed recombination involving species from different genera. It seems that bromoviruses and cucumoviruses did split from a common ancestor forming distinct clades due to crossover events in RNA3, whereas protein 2b promoted the selection of a CMV-TAV RNA1/2-RNA3 recombinant. In the 5′ untranslated regions (UTR) of CMV RNA3 the sequence rearrangements have likely been the precursors of the radiation of three cucumovirus subgroups. The results illustrated in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> confirm a clear separation between the genera 
 <italic>Bromovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cucumovirus</italic>, while the ilarviruses constitute their own cluster; two other genera (
 <italic>Anulavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Oleavirus)</italic> are more unique within the family. Although these results suggest that AMV should be included in the ilarviruses, its unequivocal assignment has yet to be resolved, especially because AMV differs from other ilarviruses with the mode of transmission, by aphids versus by pollen and thrips. Bromovirids are members of a larger alpha-like supergroup based upon both 1a and 2a proteins whereas 3a proteins cluster the bromovirids together with other viral groups into a separate pool of movement-associated proteins. In general, the constructed phylogenetic network not only reflects the initial genetic exchanges but also confirms the taxonomic status of the different genera within the family 
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic>, notwithstanding the phylogenetic disturbances caused by genetic exchange.
