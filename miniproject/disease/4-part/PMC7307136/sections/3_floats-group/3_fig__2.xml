  <p>Evolution of the family 
   <italic>Bromoviridae</italic>. Unrooted phylogenetic network illustrating the evolutionary history of the family 
   <italic>Bromoviridae</italic>. The different viral species in the family are linked to each other via multiple paths of interconnecting network rather than as single tree, which suggests the effects of recombination and reassortment events.
