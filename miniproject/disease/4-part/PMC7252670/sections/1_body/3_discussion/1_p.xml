<p>Since 2008, DENV circulation has increased in NC and caused recurrent outbreaks with cases detected every year. DENV-1 has been the major circulating serotype in NC until 2017, co-circulating with DENV-4 in 2009, DENV-3 in 2014, DENV-2 and -3 in 2017 and DENV-2 in 2018 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This epidemiological profile with the prolonged circulation of DENV-1 during 15 years was particularly unusual for NC [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> population from NC to transmit the four circulating DENV serotypes and two genotypes of DENV-1. Vector competence is defined as the ability of a mosquito to be infected, to disseminate and finally to be able to transmit a given virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is based on a close interaction between the virus and the vector, which can lead to different outcomes depending on the fitness of both at the time of the experiment. To remove this bias, we performed two replicates experiments whose results were not significantly different. This observation, combined with the fact that the results obtained for DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” infected mosquitoes are equivalent to those obtained in our previous study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], gives reliability to our results. NC 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is a competent vector for dengue viruses, with the detection of infectious virus in saliva from 7 dpi for three out of five DENV strains.
