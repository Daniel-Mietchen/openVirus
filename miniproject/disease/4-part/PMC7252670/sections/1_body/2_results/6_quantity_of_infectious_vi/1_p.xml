<p>The quantity of infectious viral particles was determined for each positive mosquito at 14 dpi in parallel with the different vector competence indices (

 <sup>5</sup> FFU/mL/body (

The median viral titers obtained for DENV-2 infected mosquitoes was significantly higher than that obtained from DENV-3 infected mosquitoes (two-sample Wilcoxon test:
