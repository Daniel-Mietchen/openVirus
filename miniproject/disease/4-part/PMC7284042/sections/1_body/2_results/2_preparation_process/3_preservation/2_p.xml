<p>It has been established that the environmental conditions, especially the temperature, greatly influence the degradation of DNA in ancient teeth (Alvarez García et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). Following an experimental study of teeth burial, we noticed that an increase of 2°C in soil could divide by two the half‐life of mtDNA and nuclear fragments. This evidence demonstrated the significant impact of temperature on the yield of DNA in dental tissues. Thus, storage of teeth samples at a low temperature would minimize the rate of DNA degradation and help make genetic analysis more accurate (Higgins, Rohrlach, Kaidonis, Townsend, &amp; Austin, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Preferable conditions of preservation for ancient samples would be a dry environment and a temperature of −20° (Rizzi et al.,
