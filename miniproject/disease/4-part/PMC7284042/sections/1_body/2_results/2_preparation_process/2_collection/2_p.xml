<p>After death, the human body decomposes, this process can be modified depending on the burial conditions, natural postmortem degradation, and environmental conditions (Wills, Ward, &amp; Vanessa,

When human remains are found in archaeological sites, the anthropologist carefully collects samples to avoid any contamination, principles such as using facemask, head‚Äêdress gown, lab coat, disposable gloves, and sterile instruments should be implemented (Rizzi, Lari, Gigli, De Bellis, &amp; Caramelli, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). It is important to keep the teeth in their alveolus on the jawbone for better protection and to decrease the risk of contamination (Dang et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; De Leo, Turrina, &amp; Marigo, 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Samples are usually preserved in archeology laboratories. The teeth with or without jawbone can be addressed to other laboratories for various studies.
