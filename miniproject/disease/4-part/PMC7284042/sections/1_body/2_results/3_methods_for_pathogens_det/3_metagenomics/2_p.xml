<p>Metagenomics is based on the association of bioinformatics and genomic technologies aimed at analyzing genes from communities of organisms. This method has more advantages than the molecular approach for aDNA studies because metagenomics was not influenced by length and sequence variants, even DNA fragments that were short or degraded could be successfully sequenced by High‐Throughput Sequencing (HTS) platforms (Warinner et al.,

 <italic>.</italic> Metagenomics had access to this sample through analysis of 16S RNA amplicon sequencing data from dental pulp belonging to different chronological periods. The results indicated that ancient dental pulp could preserve the natural microbiome in the oral cavity and also in the dental pulp. In addition, this ancient specimen allowed DNA detection of oral pathogens that likely caused localized bacteremia (Rascovan et al.,

 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>enterica</italic> serovar Paratyphi C, this pathogen was proposed as the causative agent of the epidemic at Teposcolula Yucundaa‐Mexico during the 1545–1550 period (Vågene et al.,

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was found in a famous painter, Michelangelo Merisi ‘the Caravage’ (1571–1610) who died with signs of sepsis (Drancourt et al.,

 <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> was confirmed in a 15th century skeleton (Guellil et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> was isolated from two 3800‐year‐old individuals: this is the oldest reported case of this bacterium in human pulp (Spyrou et al.,
