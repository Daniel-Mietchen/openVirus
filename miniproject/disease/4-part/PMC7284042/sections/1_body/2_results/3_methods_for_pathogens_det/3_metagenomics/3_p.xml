<p>There are many factors linked to post‐mortem modifications that affected PCR amplification of ancient specimens. The presence of PCR inhibitors, including all substances that negatively impact on PCR results (such as decreased sensitivity or false‐negative) could be derived from the sample itself, during sample processing or DNA extraction (Schrader, Schielke, Ellerbroek, &amp; Johne,

The first and second types were oxidative damage and degradation, respectively, both caused strand break; the third was inter‐strand or inter‐molecular DNA crosslinks and the fourth was hydrolysis damage related to miscode. Moreover, modern DNA contamination is a great obstacle since PCR amplifies DNA fragments to obtain large quantities of copies (Rizzi et al.,
