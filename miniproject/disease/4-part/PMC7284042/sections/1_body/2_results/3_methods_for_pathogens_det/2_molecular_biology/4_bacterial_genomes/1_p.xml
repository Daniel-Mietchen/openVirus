<p>Reconstruction of ancient bacterial genomes aims to elucidate the mechanisms of disease transmission in history and investigate the relationship to current emerging infections. Certainly, 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> is the cause of plague disease, responsible for at least three high‐mortality pandemics in human history and many plague foci today, and about 40 historical burial places have been authenticated in Eurasia (Drancourt &amp; Raoult,
