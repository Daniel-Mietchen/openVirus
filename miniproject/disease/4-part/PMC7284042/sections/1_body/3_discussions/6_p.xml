<p>Culture is the most common method in microbiology to isolate and identify microorganisms. However, that is a very difficult task to apply on ancient sources because of bacterial survival and suitable media of growth (Vishnivetskaya et al., 
 <xref rid="mgg31202-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Among bacteria found in ancient dental pulp, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> can enter a dormant state during its life cycle and resists well to the environment and infected host. PCR testing for 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> on samples of 300‐year‐old mummies yielded positive results but the culture method results were negative (Lemma et al.,
