<p>Viremia was assessed by detecting RVFV genomic sequences in sera using qRT-PCR. Viral genomes were detected in the mock-vaccinated calves 3 dpc in four of the five animals (not detected in animal D2-1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). Peak levels of RVFV occurred at this time point for most animals as indicated by low Ct values. Animal D2-5 displayed the lowest Ct value at 3 dpc, and succumbed to RVFV infection by 5 dpc. In contrast, RVFV was detected in two of the five animals (C2-2 and C2-3) in the vaccinated group and displayed higher Ct values than the mock-vaccinated group at 3 dpc (
