<p>The sera were also evaluated for antibodies to RVFV using two ELISAs (an IgG and IgM ELISA) utilizing recombinant RVFV nucleoprotein (rNP) as antigen (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). As expected, first IgM antibodies were detected, from 3 dpc, and then IgG antibodies, from 6 dpc, since the recombinant LSDV-vectored RVF vaccine expresses the viral GPs, and not the NP. IgM antibody levels rapidly decreased from 9 to 14 dpc, then rose around 21 dpc. The IgG antibody levels (
