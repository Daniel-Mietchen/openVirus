<p>Sub-culture focus 2a.2_6 was finally selected for a stability study, in which it was passaged 10x in cell culture and retested for RVFV GP expression and homogeneity (data not shown), and it was shown to be stable, homogeneous and expressing the RVFV GPs. This recombinant virus was then grown to high titres, aliquots made and stored at −20°C, until further use.</p>
