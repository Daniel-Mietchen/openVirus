 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) an increase in rectal temperatures indicative of pyrexia was observed in all calves, except animal A1-5, at 24 h post-challenge. The febrile response (in the range of 39.6–40.3°C) lasted for a single day with temperatures normalizing the following day.
