<p>Detection of the extracted LSDV DNA was achieved using a conventional PCR and a GeneAmp 2400 thermocycler (Perkin Elmer, USA). The method was performed as described by Viljoen et al. (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The primer pair (OP3: 5′-CAC CAG AGC CGA TAA C−3′; OP49: 5′-GTG CTA TCT AGT GCA GCT AT−3′) was used. This primer pair amplifies a 450 base pair (bp) region within the wild type LSDV TK gene. Amplification was carried out using a GeneAmp 2400 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer, USA) in a 25 μl reaction volume consisting of 2.0 μl 10X HotStarTaq PCR buffer, 1 μl 2.5 mM dNTPs, 2 units HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen, Germany), 1.0 μl of each primer [20 pmoles each] [Gibco-BRL, UK], 5.0 μl template DNA (1 ng) and 14.8 μl sterile DNase/RNase free water. Template DNA was denatured for 45 s (sec) at 94°C, primer annealing was carried out at 53°C for 45 s, and strand extension was at 75°C for 60 s (repeated through 35 amplification cycles) (preceded by an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 7 min). PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel containing Ethidium bromide (EtBr).
