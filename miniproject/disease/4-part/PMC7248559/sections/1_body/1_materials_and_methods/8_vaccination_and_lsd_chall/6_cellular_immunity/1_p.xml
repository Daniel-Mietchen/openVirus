<p>Whole blood was collected on the day of inoculation, 7 and 14 dpi, the day of challenge and 7 and 14 dpc. Lymphocytes were isolated and used for bovine IFN-γ ELISPOT and phenotype analysis as described previously by Kara et al. (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In both assays PMBCs (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were stimulated in triplicate with the LSDV_WB isolate (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/well), inactivated whole RVFV antigen (0.5% [V/V] formaldehyde solution) (10 μg/ml, from OBP LTD, Smithburn vaccine strain) and positive ConA antigen (5 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, USA). Responses were measured using the bovine IFN-γ ELISPOT kit (Mabtech AB, Sweden) as per the manufacturer's instructions and spot-forming cells (SFC) were enumerated using an automated ELISPOT reader (Zeiss KS ELISPOT Compact 4.5, Germany). Antibodies used for phenotype determination (at a 1:100 dilution) were mouse anti-bovine CD45Ro-PE (cell line IL-A116, IgG3, BioRad), mouse anti-bovine CD8α-FITC (Clone 38.65, IgG1, BioRad), mouse anti-bovine CD4 primary antibody (cell line GC50A1, IgM, VMRD Inc, USA) and goat anti-mouse IgM-APC secondary antibody (1:8 dilution; Invitrogen, UK). Flow cytometry data acquisition was performed using a MACSQuant® Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec) and data were analyzed using Kaluza 2.1 software (Beckman Coulter, USA). Isotypic controls were included for all isotypes used. The significance of differences between the average values per group was determined by means of the Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. Differences with 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.
