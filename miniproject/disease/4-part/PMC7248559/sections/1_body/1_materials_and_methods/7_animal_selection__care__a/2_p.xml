<p>Fifty-six male Holstein-Friesian cross calves, ~8 months old, were pre-screened for exposure/presence of LSDV and RVFV using a conventional PCR for LSDV (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and a real-time RT-PCR for RVFV (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), respectively. Serology was also performed for detecting antibodies to either pathogen. Forty calves were then selected, purchased and delivered to the ARCâ€“Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs) biosafety containment level-3 facilities, of which twenty were used in this trial.
