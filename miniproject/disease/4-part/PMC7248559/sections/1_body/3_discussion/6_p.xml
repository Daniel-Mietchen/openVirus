<p>Cellular immunity was measured using the same parameters as described in a related study (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). ELISPOT assays were used to determine the number of IFN-γ-producing cells in calves and the results demonstrated that LSD-RVF.mf-vaccinated animals had higher numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells compared to calves in the control groups following challenge with LSDV and stimulation with LSDV antigen. The increased number of IFN-γ-producing cells correlated with increased CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells in PBMCs of the vaccinated animals post-challenge. Production of IFN-γ by memory T cells is a key element required for the control of virus infections (

It was also demonstrated that the PBMCs of vaccinated calves produced IFN-γ 7 dpi when stimulated with RVFV antigen and a RVFV-specific memory CD8+ T cell response was detected at 14 dpi. The production of IFN-γ may be considered as a key factor for survival in RVFV infection. It has been shown that IFN-γ treatment can reduce RVF infection in rhesus monkeys (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The source of IFN-γ at 7 dpi is most likely NK cells (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), but CD8+ T cells cannot be ruled out, since elevated levels of both were detected in the PBMCs of calf C2-4 at 7 dpi.
