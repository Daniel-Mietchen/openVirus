<p>However, a proper isolation strategy for patients exposed to MERS-CoV has not been established. Therefore, during the MERS outbreak in 2015, the Korean Society of Nephrology MERS-CoV Task Force Team developed MERS clinical practice and infection control guidelines for HD facilities.

 </sup> The guidelines recommend appropriate isolation practice among HD patients according to the risk of MERS-CoV exposure. Close contacts with fever or respiratory symptoms should be isolated in a single negative pressure room with a portable dialysis machine. By contrast, close contacts without any suspected symptoms may undergo either single-room isolation, cohort isolation, or self-imposed quarantine until the possibility of additional MERS-CoV infection is ruled out. Casual contacts should be subjected to cohort isolation and contact surveillance. Our study validated the efficacy of the recommended isolation practices in preventing secondary transmission. Results showed no difference among the different isolation methods. Therefore, in the future, the most cost-effective isolation method available at each facility is sufficient to prevent further transmission of MERS-CoV and to improve patient survival.
