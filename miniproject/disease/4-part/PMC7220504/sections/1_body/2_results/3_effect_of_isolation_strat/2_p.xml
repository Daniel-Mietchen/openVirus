<p>We compared the effect of each isolation method on preventing secondary transmission. During the isolation period, we performed regular screening for MERS-CoV in all symptomatic and asymptomatic participants who were isolated. Sputum specimens were collected for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and all specimens were negative for MERS-CoV. After 16 weeks from the isolation period, we collected serum samples from isolated participants and performed serological assays to assess secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in asymptomatic patients. Based on the results, 3 patients tested positive for anti-MERS-CoV IgG. To confirm MERS-CoV infection, we further tested the blood samples using IFA and ppNT. Results showed no further secondary transmission of MERS-CoV among asymptomatic contacts (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), indicating that either single-room isolation, cohort isolation, or self-imposed quarantine was effective in preventing further transmission of infectious diseases among HD patients.
