<p>We finally evaluated the effect of isolation practice on patient survival. During the 24-month follow-up period, 12 patients died. Four and 3 patients died from underlying lung disease and cardiovascular events, respectively. In addition, some patients presented with septic shock and hyperkalemia, and 1 patient committed suicide. However, none of the patients presented with infection during the isolation period, and no differences in survival rate were observed among patients subjected to different isolation strategies (
