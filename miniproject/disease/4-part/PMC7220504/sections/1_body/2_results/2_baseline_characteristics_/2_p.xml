<p>A total of 116 patients from three HD units were included in the analysis (n = 73, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong; n = 9, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital; and n = 34, Gangneung Medical Center). The baseline characteristics of the study cohort according to different isolation practices are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The exposed patients were isolated according to the hospital strategy and available resources. Fifty-four (46.6%) patients underwent single room isolation; 46 (39.7%), cohort isolation; and 16 (13.8%), self-imposed quarantine. The average duration of isolation was 15.0 ± 3.0 days. The mean age of the participants was 62 years, and male predominance (66.4%) was observed. Diabetes was the most common cause of dialysis, and the average duration of dialysis was 52.6 months. Ninety-five (81.9%) patients had native arteriovenous fistula; 16, graft; and 5, catheter. The patients under self-imposed quarantine were younger (54 vs 65 and 62 years, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .017) and had a shorter duration of isolation (11.8 vs 15.9 and 15.2 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) than those under single room or cohort isolation.
