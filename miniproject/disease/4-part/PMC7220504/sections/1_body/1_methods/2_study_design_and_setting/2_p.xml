<p>A 2-year prospective cohort study was performed during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak at the HD units of 2 university hospitals (Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong and Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea) and 1 public medical center (Gangneung Medical Center, Gangwon, Korea). Some patients from each HD unit were exposed to individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and were subsequently isolated from those not exposed. Patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were sent to the designated hospital with a single-occupancy negative pressure room and a portable dialysis machine according to the Middle East respiratory syndrome clinical practice guideline on HD facilities, as mandated by the Korean Society of Nephrology.

 </sup> Before entering the dialysis unit, the other HD patients were closely monitored for possible fever or respiratory symptoms. When a patient develops suspicious symptoms, he/she was sent to the quarantine desk for MERS-CoV screening test. All healthcare workers and HD patients followed the standard, contact, and droplet precautions, including hand hygiene and wearing of masks.
