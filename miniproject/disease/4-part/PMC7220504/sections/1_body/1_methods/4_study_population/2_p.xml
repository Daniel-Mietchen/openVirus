<p>We enrolled 126 participants from 3 HD units who underwent isolation practice after MERS-CoV exposure. The exposed healthcare workers were excluded from the analysis. A total of 116 patients were included in the analysis because 10 patients from Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong were lost to follow-up. Nine patients were then transferred to other hospitals, and 1 switched from HD to peritoneal dialysis. All of them received HD treatment while in isolation about 1â€“2 weeks until they were considered free from MERS-CoV infection.</p>
