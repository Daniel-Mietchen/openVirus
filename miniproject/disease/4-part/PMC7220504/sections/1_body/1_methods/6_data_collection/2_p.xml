<p>Data about demographic characteristics, including age, gender, body mass index, HD duration, and cause of end-stage renal disease, were collected at the time of enrollment. Laboratory parameters, including systolic blood pressure (BP); diastolic BP; plasma hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, calcium, phosphorous, parathyroid hormone, serum albumin, and total cholesterol levels; and single-pool kt/V, were collected from 3 months prior to MERS-CoV exposure to 6 months after exposure. Single-pool kt/V was calculated based on decreased intradialytic blood urea level and weight change.
