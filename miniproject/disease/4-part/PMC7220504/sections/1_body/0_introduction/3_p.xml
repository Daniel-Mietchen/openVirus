<p>Patients with end-stage renal disease are at risk of viral transmission due to decreased immune function and high comorbidity. In addition, they cannot sustain a healthy life without undergoing regular HD treatment. Therefore, HD patients are at risk of both infectious and noninfectious diseases during disasters. A recent study has shown that HD patients who are on dialysis treatment while in isolation received suboptimal quality of care and experienced high level of stress.

 </sup> Therefore, strict isolation care during epidemics, including MERS-CoV outbreak, may result in suboptimal dialysis dose and poor clinical outcomes as well as decreased quality of life among HD patients. However, a critical care response manual for epidemics, including MERS-CoV outbreak, in HD units is not available to date. Moreover, only few studies have examined the effect of isolation practice on secondary viral transmission and clinical outcomes among patients in HD units.
