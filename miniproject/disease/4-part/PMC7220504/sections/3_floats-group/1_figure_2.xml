  <p>Different isolation strategies during the MERS-CoV outbreak. Exposed patients were isolated according to each hospital strategy and available resources. (A) Single-room isolation refers to a method of admitting a patient in a single negative pressure room while providing HD treatment using separate portable reverse osmosis. (B) Cohort isolation is a method of isolating a patient in a single room in an affected hospital while providing HD treatment in an HD room after other healthy HD patients finished their treatment session. (C) Self-imposed quarantine refers to an isolation method for asymptomatic contacts in which a patient stays at home and is transported to the hospital on the day of HD treatment via a designated vehicle provided by the disease prevention authority. HD = hemodialysis, MERS-CoV = middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus.</p>
