<p>In another study, a considerable reduction in the fertility of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> adult males was observed when feeding their larvae double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeting testis genes. Moreover, several dsRNAs were reported to be inducing males and were remarkably effective in competing for mates. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the female-specific isoform of double-sex was also effective in producing a highly male-biased population of mosquitoes, making it possible to overcome the need to sex-sort insects before release [
