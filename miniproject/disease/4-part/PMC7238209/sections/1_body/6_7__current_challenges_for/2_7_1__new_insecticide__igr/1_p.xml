<p>The most urgent need is to develop new insecticides to fight mosquito-borne diseases due to their crucial efficiency and their economic importance [
 <xref rid="B212-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. The Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC) has released new product classes, especially for malaria eradication, and manages international efforts to establish new methods, including producing a new ATSB (attractive targeted sugar bait) product class and programming next-generation IRS projects [

 <xref rid="B110-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Several other bacteria showing promising results on numerous pests have been suggested to have the same effect on mosquitoes, such as the entomopathogenic nematode-associated bacteria
