<p>Different pathogenic blood-borne bacteria are regularly detected in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It is not yet clear whether the presence of these bacteria in mosquitoes may be explained by occasional ingestion with blood meals or acquisition from the environment, or whether these bacteria may multiply and eventually be transmitted during blood meals. Different pathogenic alpha-proteobacteria, including 
 <italic>Anaplasma</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Candidatus</italic> Neoehrlichia, 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Rickettsia</italic> spp., have been identified (xeno-monitoring studies) in adult mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B59-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. More interestingly, the agent of febrile rickettsiosis, 
 <italic>Rickettsia felis</italic>, has not only been identified in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] but also shown to be potentially transmitted by 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes in laboratory experiments [
 <xref rid="B62-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. 
 <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B63-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] is also carried by mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes</italic>), which act as a main vector in Sweden and Finland, making it the first reported mosquito-borne bacterium [
 <xref rid="B63-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].
