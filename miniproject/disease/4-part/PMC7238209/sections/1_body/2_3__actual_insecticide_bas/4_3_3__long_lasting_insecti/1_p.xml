<p>Designed as a solution to the problems of conventional insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), and based on novel fabric technologies [
 <xref rid="B84-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], LLINs were developed to resist multiple washes and remain effective for a prolonged time (at least three years). LLINs are considered one of the most successful mosquito control tools, especially for malaria prevention [
 <xref rid="B85-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. ITNs with synthetic pyrethroid insecticides either incorporated into or coated around their fibres have resulted in a considerable decline in malaria morbidity and mortality in several countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where over 427 million nets were delivered between 2012 and 2014 [
 <xref rid="B85-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Th annual cost of an LLIN can be as high as US$2.6, while IRS costs about US$4, and standard ITN costs range from US$1.5 to US$6 [
 <xref rid="B85-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The level of use of LLINs varies according to several factors, such as temperature, humidity, season, and, especially, the density of mosquitoes, and access to them plays a major determinant of their use [

 <xref rid="B87-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. LLINs have contributed to the reduction in malaria over the past 15 years, combined with other new control measures, such as IRS and artemisinin-based combination therapies [
 <xref rid="B88-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] in children and pregnant women [

 <xref rid="B89-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Other important advantages of LLINS include reduced consumption of insecticides and insecticide released into the environment because they do not need retreatment [
 <xref rid="B85-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The efficacy of LLINs is closely related to the molecules used (the choice depends on the presence or absence of its resistance) [
 <xref rid="B90-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], and their correct use may enhance their efficiency [
 <xref rid="B91-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In a study, the use of LLINs led to a dramatic reduction (97%) in the prevalence of malaria compared to a group of LLIN non-users [
