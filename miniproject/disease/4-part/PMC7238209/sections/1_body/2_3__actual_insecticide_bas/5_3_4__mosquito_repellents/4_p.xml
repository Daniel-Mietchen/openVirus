<p>The most effective synthetic repellents are DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) and IR3535 (3-(NButyl-N-acetyl)-aminopropionic acid [

Several nanoparticles synthesised and successfully impregnated into cotton fabrics in insect-repellent clothing show high efficacy against mosquito larvae and adult populations, which gives them the potential to be used as eco-friendly approaches to control mosquitoes if applied in long-lasting insect-repellent clothing [

 <xref rid="B99-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The fact that the use of synthetic repellents causes insecticide resistance in mosquitoes, has a harmful effect on non-target organisms, and threatens the environment has led to widespread discussions around this method of control [
