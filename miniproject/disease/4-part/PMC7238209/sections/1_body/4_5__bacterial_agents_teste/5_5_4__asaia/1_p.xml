<p>To make malaria vectors inefficient, interruption of the cycle within the vector to stop parasite development before the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> host becomes infective is a good solution [
 <xref rid="B163-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. The simplest approach to this is paratransgenesis, consisting of producing bacterial strains that are able to both live in the midgut of various mosquito species and spread rapidly among wild mosquito populations [
 <xref rid="B164-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Several studies have been performed on the identification and use of competent microorganisms to combat vector-borne diseases [
 <xref rid="B165-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Asaia</italic>, first discovered in plant nectar, is an excellent candidate [
 <xref rid="B166-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]; it is localized in many organs of mosquitoes, and can disperse inside the mosquito body through the haemolymph [
 <xref rid="B165-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>,
 <xref rid="B167-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Its distribution in the mosquito population is made possible through several mechanisms (co-feeding, sexual mating, paternal, maternal, and horizontal transmission) [
 <xref rid="B168-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>,
 <xref rid="B169-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>,
 <xref rid="B170-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. 
 <italic>Asaia</italic> bacteria may be genetically modified in order to be recolonised in a new host, resulting in spread within wild populations [
 <xref rid="B166-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Recently, it was isolated and characterised from several 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species, which would be beneficial if applied toward achieving paratransgenesis against malaria [
 <xref rid="B165-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Advanced studies recently showed that 
 <italic>Asaia</italic> may activate the mosquitoâ€™s immune system, leading to a reduction in the development of malaria parasites [
 <xref rid="B171-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. In the future, additional assets to which the bacterium may be used in mosquito control may be identified because it seems that 
 <italic>Asaia</italic> plays a key role in the health of the mosquito host, even during its larval stage, allowing the larvae to develop rapidly [
 <xref rid="B172-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Engineering of 
 <italic>Asaia</italic> to produce an antiplasmodial effector causing the mosquito to become refractory to 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> is a perfect demonstration of the power of a transgenic microbiota [
 <xref rid="B173-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>], which makes it beneficial to microbial ecology and a potential candidate not only for paratransgenesis but also for general control of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases.
