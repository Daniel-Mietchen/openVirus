<p>Spinosad is a biopesticide derived via fermentation from an actinomycete, 
 <italic>Saccharopolyspora spinosa</italic>, a naturally occurring soil-dwelling bacterium. It contains two insecticidal factors, A (C

 <xref rid="B175-pathogens-09-00310" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. It is categorised as a Group 5 insecticide by the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC), forming a new class of polyketide-macrolide insecticides that act as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) allosteric modulators. Discovered in the 1980s in an early-stage insecticide screen that included 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, it was shown to be highly active against numerous pests in the Lepidoptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Hymenoptera orders, and others. Its application to mosquito control is relatively new due to its pesticidal activity after ingestion and cuticle absorption and its highly favourable toxicology profiles in mammals and the environment [
