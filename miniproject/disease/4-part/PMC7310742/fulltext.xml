One approach to improve the outcome of these infections is to use passive immunization targeting GAS. To test this idea, we assessed the efficacy of passive immunotherapy using antisera against either the streptococcal M protein or streptolysin O (SLO) in a murine model of IAV-GAS superinfection. Prophylactic treatment of mice with antiserum to either SLO or the M protein decreased morbidity compared to mice treated with non-immune sera; however, neither significantly decreased mortality. Therapeutic use of antisera to SLO decreased morbidity compared to mice treated with non-immune sera but neither antisera significantly reduced mortality. Overall, the results suggest that further development of antibodies targeting the M protein or SLO may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of invasive GAS diseases, including IAV-GAS superinfections, which may be particularly important during influenza pandemics.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for the project was provided by NIH/NIAID grants 5R21AI115087 (M.S.C) and 5R01AI132117 (J.B.D.) and the South Dakota Center for Biologics Research &#x00026; Commercialization (SD-CBRC) from the SD GOED Governors Research Center (M.S.C, D.D, and V.C.H.).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) creates a permissive environment for secondary bacterial infections (often referred to as superinfections), which significantly increases the morbidity and mortality associated with both IAV epidemics and pandemics [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (the group A Streptococcus, GAS) typically causes pharyngitis but also can cause more serious invasive GAS infections (iGAS) such as bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and IAV superinfections. An analysis of lung biopsies from the 1918 influenza pandemic revealed that <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and GAS were the most frequently observed bacteria in the lungs and contributed to approximately 90% of the estimated 50 million deaths attributed to influenza [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>IAV increases host susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections by a variety of mechanisms. Most research related to GAS has focused on the characterization of viral-induced changes affecting GAS adherence and internalization [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consistent with these studies, murine models of IAV-GAS superinfection show that IAV infection significantly enhances the virulence of GAS [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, active vaccination of mice against IAV provides significant protection against GAS secondary infections indicating a specific role for the virus in enhancing host susceptibility to superinfection [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Finally, epidemiological studies support the idea that several viruses, and particularly influenza, increase the incidence of iGAS diseases including pneumonia [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Many antibiotics, including penicillin, are effective against GAS. Nonetheless, iGAS diseases are associated with a surprisingly high fatality rate. For example, during the 2009 IAV pandemic, 7 out of 10 patients in California with a laboratory confirmed IAV-GAS superinfection died despite being treated with antibiotics and anti-viral agents. The median age at the time of death was 37 years [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a separate study conducted between December 2010 and January 2011, 14 of 19 patients with an iGAS disease also had an IAV infection; ten died, even though at least nine received antibiotics effective against GAS <italic>ex vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Finally, it is estimated that while only 12% of iGAS infections involve the lower respiratory tract [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], 38% are fatal [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, while GAS remains susceptible to many antibiotics and influenza vaccines and anti-viral agents are widely used, the mortality of IAV-GAS superinfections is significant [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Currently there are no vaccines available for GAS; however, vaccination with the surface-localized M protein elicits protective opsonic antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and experimental M protein-based vaccines have been used in animal studies [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and human clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, we previously showed that active vaccination targeting the M protein confers 100% protection against mortality by using a murine model of IAV-GAS superinfection [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Another potential GAS vaccine target is the secreted cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) streptolysin O (SLO). SLO contributes to virulence [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and orthologues are encoded in the genomes of a wide range of bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] including <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumolysin; PLY), which has historically been the most frequent cause of IAV superinfections [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

We assessed the use of passive immunotherapy to reduce morbidity and mortality using an established murine model of IAV-GAS superinfection and antisera targeting two GAS proteins; one against the cell wall-associated M protein and the other against the exoprotein SLO. We measured efficacy with three endpoints: i) enumeration of GAS in the blood and organs of mice. ii) weight loss (morbidity). iii) mortality. In general, prophylactic use of the antisera decreased morbidity compared to groups of mice treated with non-immune sera. Therapeutic treatment with the antisera slightly decreased the numbers of bacteria in the lungs and spleens of superinfected mice but there was no significant decrease in mortality. While refinement of the antibody formulation is necessary, our results support the continued development of passive immunotherapy as a potential preventative measure, or treatment, for IAV-GAS superinfections.</p><p>Both the M protein and SLO enhance virulence by decreasing the susceptibility of GAS to killing by immune effector cells such as macrophages and neutrophils [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

First, antibodies can promote opsonophagocytosis, which is consistent with our interpretation of results assessing the survival of GAS incubated with antibodies to the M protein and suspended in whole blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235139.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

In contrast, SLO is an exoprotein that disrupts the integrity of cholesterol-containing cell membranes [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in neutrophils, macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Antibody-mediated neutralization of SLO [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] can decrease toxin-mediated apoptosis of immune effector cells and thereby increase the killing of GAS. Similarly, antibodies to the exoprotein streptolysin S enhanced GAS killing by neutralizing the cytolytic activity of the toxin [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Finally, active vaccination of non-human primates with an SLO toxoid (also containing other GAS antigens) induced non-opsonizing SLO-specific antibodies and decreased pharyngitis [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, the antisera to the M protein and SLO likely enhanced opsonophagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235139.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and neutralized cytolytic activity (<xref rid="pone.0235139.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Our study was not designed to compare the efficacy of antisera against the M protein to that against SLO but rather to assess the feasibility of pursuing such an approach. We note that treatment was not based on the titer of antigen-specific antibodies, which differed between the sera.</p><p>The mortality of iGAS diseases is remarkably high despite the susceptibility of the pathogen to antibiotics and there is considerable need for adjunct therapeutics. Patients with iGAS diseases typically have either low titers, or lack antibodies to the causative GAS serotype suggesting that sufficient levels of circulating antibodies may protect against iGAS diseases [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains both opsonic and neutralizing antibodies to several GAS virulence factors [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. There has been some clinical success using IVIG to treat iGAS diseases, especially streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; however, definitive results from robust clinical trials are lacking [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This is due, in part, to challenges in enrolling a sufficient number of patients and probably the low concentration, and variability, of GAS-specific antibodies in IVIG [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A study supporting this interpretation found that when IgG antibodies specific to GAS were purified from human IVIG they were more efficacious when used as a passive vaccine in a murine model of iGAS infection compared to IVIG [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These results support the idea that GAS-specific antibodies may be an effective therapeutic approach to manage iGAS diseases, although it is acknowledged that IVIG treatment also dampens the inflammatory response [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which likely affects clinical outcomes.</p><p>Passive antibody therapy has been successfully used to treat toxin-mediated bacterial diseases including diphtheria, tetanus, botulism, and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These diseases result largely from the activity of one, or two, specific proteins. In contrast, the pathogenesis of GAS (and many other bacteria), involves multiple, sometimes functionally redundant, virulence factors. Thus, the successful development of antibody-based adjunct therapeutics to pathogens employing multiple virulence factors may require formulations that include antibodies to multiple virulence factors and not monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies targeting a single protein. Subsequent studies will explore the efficacy of using a combination of IgG antibodies to both the M protein and SLO in mitigating the morbidity and mortality of IAV-GAS superinfections.</p><p>Several studies have used animal models to test the ability of passive immunotherapy to protect against iGAS diseases, although ours is the first to assess efficacy in the context of a viral superinfection. Previous studies showed that opsonic antisera to a fibronectin binding protein (FBP54) [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], the streptococcal hemoprotein receptor (Shr) [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], GAS carbohydrate [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], or various epitopes of the M protein [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] are protective compared to controls. In addition, passive immunization with non-opsonic antisera containing antibodies to Streptococcal esterase (Sse) [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA) [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], the M6 protein [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], or C5a peptidase [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] are also protective based on studies using mice. Taken together, the studies show that the prophylactic use of either opsonizing or non-opsonizing antibodies targeting GAS can be useful in the protecting against a GAS monoinfection; however, there has been less success in treating established iGAS infections using passive immunotherapy.</p><p>While an active vaccine against GAS is an ideal outcome, many successful vaccines do not abolish disease including the pneumococcal, Hib, and influenza vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235139.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, the development of therapeutic antibodies designed as an adjunct treatment for severe iGAS diseases, including IAV-GAS superinfections, may prove to be beneficial, particularly during influenza pandemics.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0235139.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Morens</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Taubenberger</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fauci</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Predominant role of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of death in pandemic influenza: implications for pandemic influenza preparedness</article-title>. <source>The Journal of infectious diseases</source>. <year>2008</year>;<volume>198</volume>(<issue>7</issue>):<fpage>962</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>70</lpage>.
