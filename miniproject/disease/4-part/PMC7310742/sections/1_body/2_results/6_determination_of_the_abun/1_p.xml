<p>To determine if immunotherapy administered after the establishment of an IAV-GAS superinfection could enhance the clearance of GAS from mice, we quantified GAS in the lungs, blood, and spleen of superinfected mice treated with antisera to either SLO or the M protein. The differences between each individual group treated with immune sera compared to mice treated with non-immune sera (e.g. antisera to M protein versus control sera) were not statistically significant (
