<p>To determine if treatment with antisera to SLO or the M protein could decrease the morbidity or mortality associated with an established IAV-GAS superinfection, mice were first inoculated with a sublethal dose of IAV (0.1 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) on day 0. On day 7 mice were inoculated with a sublethal dose of GAS (0.1 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) and 2 h later were given antisera to either SLO or the M protein. As a control, mice were similarly treated with non-immune sera. Treatment with antisera to the M protein did not decrease morbidity compared to mice receiving non-immune sera (
