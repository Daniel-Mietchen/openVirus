<p>Rabbits were injected with either a recombinant hexavalent M-protein vaccine, which included an amino acid sequence known to elicit antibodies specific to the serotype M3 protein [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or with an SLO toxoid [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The titers of antigen-specific antibodies against the SLO or the M protein vaccines were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were 600,000 and 400,000 respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235139.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Antisera to SLO and to the M protein also contained antibodies that bound to an immobilized serotype M3 strain MGAS315 (antibody titers of 22,000 and 6,000 respectively), (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235139.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The results indicated that the epitopes of the target proteins were exposed and accessible to the antibodies. Non-immune serum, which in subsequent experiments was used as a negative control, also contained a low level of antibodies that bound to immobilized MGAS315 (antibody titer 1,000).
