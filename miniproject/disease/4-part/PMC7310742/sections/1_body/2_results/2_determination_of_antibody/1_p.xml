<p>Prior to assessing the efficacy of using passively administered antisera to curtail disease, it was of interest to measure the titers of antibodies in mice following either i.p. or i.n. administration of antisera. Antisera to either SLO or the M protein was given separately by either i.p. (125 μL) or i.n. (100 μL) inoculation. After 24 h, the titers of antigen-specific antibodies in the blood and lungs of mice were determined with ELISA (
