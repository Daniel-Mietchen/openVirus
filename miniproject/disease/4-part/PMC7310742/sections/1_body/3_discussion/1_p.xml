<p>Despite the availability of influenza vaccines, anti-viral agents, and antibiotics that are effective against GAS 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>, the morbidity and mortality of IAV-GAS superinfections is considerable. We assessed the use of passive immunotherapy to reduce morbidity and mortality using an established murine model of IAV-GAS superinfection and antisera targeting two GAS proteins; one against the cell wall-associated M protein and the other against the exoprotein SLO. We measured efficacy with three endpoints: i) enumeration of GAS in the blood and organs of mice. ii) weight loss (morbidity). iii) mortality. In general, prophylactic use of the antisera decreased morbidity compared to groups of mice treated with non-immune sera. Therapeutic treatment with the antisera slightly decreased the numbers of bacteria in the lungs and spleens of superinfected mice but there was no significant decrease in mortality. While refinement of the antibody formulation is necessary, our results support the continued development of passive immunotherapy as a potential preventative measure, or treatment, for IAV-GAS superinfections.
