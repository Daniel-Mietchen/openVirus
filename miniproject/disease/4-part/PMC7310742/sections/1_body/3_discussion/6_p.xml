<p>Several studies have used animal models to test the ability of passive immunotherapy to protect against iGAS diseases, although ours is the first to assess efficacy in the context of a viral superinfection. Previous studies showed that opsonic antisera to a fibronectin binding protein (FBP54) [

 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] are protective compared to controls. In addition, passive immunization with non-opsonic antisera containing antibodies to Streptococcal esterase (Sse) [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA) [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], the M6 protein [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], or C5a peptidase [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] are also protective based on studies using mice. Taken together, the studies show that the prophylactic use of either opsonizing or non-opsonizing antibodies targeting GAS can be useful in the protecting against a GAS monoinfection; however, there has been less success in treating established iGAS infections using passive immunotherapy.
