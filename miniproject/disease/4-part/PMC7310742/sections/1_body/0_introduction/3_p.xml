<p>Many antibiotics, including penicillin, are effective against GAS. Nonetheless, iGAS diseases are associated with a surprisingly high fatality rate. For example, during the 2009 IAV pandemic, 7 out of 10 patients in California with a laboratory confirmed IAV-GAS superinfection died despite being treated with antibiotics and anti-viral agents. The median age at the time of death was 37 years [
