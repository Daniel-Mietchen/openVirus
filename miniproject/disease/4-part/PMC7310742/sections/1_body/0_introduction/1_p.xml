<p>Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) creates a permissive environment for secondary bacterial infections (often referred to as superinfections), which significantly increases the morbidity and mortality associated with both IAV epidemics and pandemics [

 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (the group A Streptococcus, GAS) typically causes pharyngitis but also can cause more serious invasive GAS infections (iGAS) such as bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and IAV superinfections. An analysis of lung biopsies from the 1918 influenza pandemic revealed that 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and GAS were the most frequently observed bacteria in the lungs and contributed to approximately 90% of the estimated 50 million deaths attributed to influenza [
