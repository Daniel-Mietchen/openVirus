<p>A recombinant hexavalent M protein vaccine containing protective M protein peptides from GAS serotypes M24, M5, M6, M19, M1, and M3 was generated by amplifying and ligating the 5â€™ end of each 
 <italic>emm</italic> gene together into a pQE-30 vector [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The SLO toxoid was created by mutating amino acids (Thr and Leu) in the domain that comprises the cholesterol binding motif [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The hexavalent M protein or SLO toxoid were used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits, as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0235139.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, 1 mL of each purified recombinant protein (1.6 mg M protein or 2.5 mg SLO toxoid) was mixed 1:1 with the adjuvant Montanide ISA 50 (Seppic Inc; Fairfield, New Jersey). Adult 12-week old rabbits were kept in individual cages with food and water 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> throughout the study. Each rabbit was immunized with either antigen, which was administered by three 0.5 mL subcutaneous injections (day 0, 14, and 28) and one 0.5 mL intramuscular injection (day 0). The rabbits were euthanized by exsanguination 42 days after the initial injection.
