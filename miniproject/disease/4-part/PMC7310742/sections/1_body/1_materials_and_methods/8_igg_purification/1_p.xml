<p>The IgG fraction of antibodies was isolated from polyclonal rabbit sera using a 1 mL Melon Gel column, as per manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Rockford, IL). All purified IgG was immediately buffer exchanged to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL in PBS using 40 kDa Zeba spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). IgG fractionation was verified by SDS-PAGE and concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (E280 0.1%) of 1.4.</p>
