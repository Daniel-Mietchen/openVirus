<p>Both ZIKV and four serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV1–4) are members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. These viruses share over half of the homology in amino acid sequences [

Supporting the cross-reactive immunity between ZIKV and DENV, another investigation has been conducted using a Zika DNA vaccine candidate (pV-ZME) expressing ZIKV premembrane and envelop proteins will elicit robust both humoral and cellular immune response in BALB/c mice against DENV1-4 where immunized mice had limited body loss, better survival rates and increased IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells compared to the control mice [
