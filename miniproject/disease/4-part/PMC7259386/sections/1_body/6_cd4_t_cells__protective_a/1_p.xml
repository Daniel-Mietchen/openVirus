<p>Recent studies have been focusing on the role of CD4 T cells in the context of neurotropic infections, especially some flavivirus infections [

Although these immunodeficient mice may not faithfully reproduce host immune responses observed in humans, as described above, these experiments support multiple prior studies demonstrating a critical role for CD4 T cells in antiviral immunity in the CNS. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) produced by Treg inducing CD103 expression on CD8 T cells has been well examined [
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. CD103 (i.e., integrin aEb7) is the ligand for an adhesion molecule E-cadherin, which could be related to T cell retention within the brain. In Treg-depleted mice, CD103 + CD8 bTrms are significantly reduced following MCMV infection from 7 days post infection (dpi) to 30 dpi [
