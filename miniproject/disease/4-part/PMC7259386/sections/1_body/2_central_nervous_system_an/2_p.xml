<p>Members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family of small enveloped viruses with RNA genomes have evolved mechanisms to inhibit IFNAR signaling. For example, Zika virus (ZIKV), a neurotropic flavivirus that induces congenital and adult disorders of the CNS, induces human, but not murine, STAT2 degradation to inhibit IFN-I signaling [

Loss of IFNAR signaling has been shown to impair the proliferation and activation of regulatory T cells (Treg) during acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, and effector functions of CD8 and CD4 T cells, resulting in an inefficient viral clearance [
