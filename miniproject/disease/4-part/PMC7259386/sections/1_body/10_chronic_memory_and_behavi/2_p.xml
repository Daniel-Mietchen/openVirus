<p>These T cells also expressed markers of Trm cells, including CD103 [

Specific deletion of IFN-γ signaling in microglia protects mice from microglial activation, synapse elimination and promoted synaptic repair resulting in reinstatement of spatial learning post recovery, suggesting that the effect of Trm-derived IFN-γ on microglia may be the most proximal trigger in the development of memory disorders that emerge after flavivirus encephalitis. IFN-γ alone, or in combination with tumor necrosis factor-α, has also been shown to upregulate CXCL9 and CCL2 in subventricular zone-derived adult neural precursor cells [

 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This could potentially provide a feed-forward mechanism to maintain T cells in the parenchyma with continued activation of microglia.
