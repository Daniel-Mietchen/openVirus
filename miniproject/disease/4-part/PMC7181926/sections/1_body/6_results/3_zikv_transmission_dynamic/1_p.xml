<p>We found that the continuous increase of seroprevalence with age in the tropical savannah area was better explained by a model assuming constant low-level circulation of ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, panel A) than one assuming a single outbreak occurred in the past (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, panel B). From the best fitting model with a constant force of infection, we estimated that 2.5% (95% CI 2.0%–3.1%) of the susceptible population is infected by ZIKV annually (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, panel C). In the semiarid areas, we saw seroprevalence sharply increase for participants &gt;20 years of age and then stabilize (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, panels D, E). This age profile was best explained by the epidemic model, with an epidemic expected to have occurred in the late 1990s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, panel F). The proportion of the population infected at that time was estimated to be 18% (95% CI 13%–23%).
