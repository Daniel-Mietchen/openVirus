<p>The analysis of seroprevalence stratified by age can provide insight on the history and mode of circulation of a pathogen (

 </xref>). For example, a slow continuous rise of seroprevalence with age may indicate endemic circulation, whereas a sudden increase in seroprevalence for persons &gt;20 years of age suggests that an outbreak took place 20 years ago. We used serocatalytic statistical models to reconstruct the force of infection, defined as the per capita rate of infection of susceptible persons, from such data (
