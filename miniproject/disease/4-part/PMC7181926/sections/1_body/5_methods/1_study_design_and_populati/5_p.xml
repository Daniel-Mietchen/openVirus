<p>We enrolled only healthy, nonfebrile male and female volunteers 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>15 years of age. We provided study information in the most familiar language of the volunteer and in the presence of an observer designated by the village authorities who ensured that volunteers understood the information completely and helped obtain answers to any question. All volunteers signed the informed consent form before enrollment and received a copy of the signed form.
