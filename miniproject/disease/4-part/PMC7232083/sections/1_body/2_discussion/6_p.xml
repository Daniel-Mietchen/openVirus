<p id="par0095">After a literature review, we identified only four cases of chronic meningococcemia in horizontally HIV-infected adult patients since 1990, none with this serious evolution [

A recent study found a substantial increased risk of meningococcal disease among adults with HIV infection that met AIDS criteria; in this study they observed a similar clinical presentation and outcomes of meningococcal disease compared to those without HIV infection [

The increased relative risk observed for meningococcal disease was similar to those observed for HIV-infected individuals in New York City, South Africa and England, ranged from 3.4–6.6 per 100,000 (relative risk = 5–13 compared with HIV-uninfected persons) [
