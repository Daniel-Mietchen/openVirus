  <p>Cellular RBPs participate in the assembly of 
   <italic>Flavivirus</italic> particles and possibly the loading of vRNA into exosomes. In addition to viral-encoded proteins (Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), host RBPs including DDX56 and nucleolin have been reported to enable 
   <italic>Flavivirus</italic> assembly. Furthermore, our group has discovered that YBX1 and TDRD3 are also required during this step (unpublished results). We propose that RBPs also mediate the sorting of vRNA into exosomes and therefore contribute to an alternative route of virus dissemination
