<p id="Par51">Flaviviruses enter a susceptible host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. There is not a single receptor for these viruses; rather binding of E to various membrane-bound molecules has been shown to mediate entry. Possible receptors include α

 <sub>3</sub> integrins, C-type lectin receptors (CD206, CD209, CLEC5A), TIM/TAM phosphatidylserine receptors, heat shock proteins 70 and 90, among others [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In addition, virus particles opsonized with immunoglobulins, which are present during secondary DENV infections, mediate entry in cells bearing Fc receptors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Maturation from early to late endosomes with a concomitant drop in pH favours conformational changes in the viral E protein resulting in its fusion with host cell membranes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Following the fusion step, the viral RNA (vRNA) is released into the cytoplasm. The process of uncoating, e.g. the disassembly of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, is not completely understood, but it has been suggested that a non-degradative ubiquitination of C, mediated by E1-activating enzyme is required for genome uncoating [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We have previously proposed a model in which elongating ribosomes drive the release of C from the vRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], but this remains to be investigated.
