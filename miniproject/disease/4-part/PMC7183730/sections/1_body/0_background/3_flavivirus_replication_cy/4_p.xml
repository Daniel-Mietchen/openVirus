<p id="Par54">Newly synthesized vRNAs exit through the pore of VPs and serve multiple purposes. They are used to translate viral proteins, function as template for (−)RNA synthesis to generate additional genomes, become the precursors of sfRNA molecules, or are selectively packaged into viral particles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. All these processes are tightly coordinated in time and space but little is known about the mechanisms that determine the fate of vRNA molecules at this point. vRNA molecules destined to be part of virions are relocated to the assembly sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), where the nucleocapsid is formed and newly assembled virus particles containing E and prM bud into the ER lumen (details of this step will be discussed below). These immature virions are transported via the secretory pathway where the slightly acidic pH (~ 5.8–6.0) of the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network triggers conformational changes of E/prM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Such changes expose a cleavage site for the cellular protease furin that releases the pr-peptide from the M protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The cleaved pr fragment remains associated with the virion until the virus is secreted to the extracellular environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].
