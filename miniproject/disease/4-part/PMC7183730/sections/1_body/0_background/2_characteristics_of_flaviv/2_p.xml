<p id="Par49">The 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genome is around 11 kb in length, carries a type 1 cap (m7GpppAmp) structure at the 5′ end and lacks a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The single open reading frame (ORF) is flanked by highly structured 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) involved in translation, replication and likely packaging of the vRNA. The 5′ UTR is relatively short (~ 100 nt) and carries a large stem-loop (SLA) that functions as promoter for the viral polymerase, NS5, to initiate RNA synthesis at the 3′ end of a ‘circularized’ genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The 3′ UTR is larger (~ 400 to 700 nt) and includes three distinct domains. Domain 1, which is the least conserved among flaviviruses, is known as the ‘variable region’ and contains two stem-loop structures (SLI and SLII) that form pseudoknots with adjacent sequences; domain 2 includes either one (e.g., ZIKV and YFV) or two (e.g., DENV and JEV) conserved dumbbell structures (DB1 and DB2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The structures present in domain 1 facilitate but are considered dispensable for replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Finally, domain 3, the most conserved region of the 3′ UTR, contains a complementary sequence element (CS1) followed by a terminal stem-loop structure (3′ SL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Both, CS1 and portions of the 3′ SL are complementary to sequences present at the 5′ end and thus, allow the circularization of the RNA genome, a step required prior to vRNA replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].
