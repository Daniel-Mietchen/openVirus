 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>-infected cells suggesting that encapsidation is rapid and/or concurrent with replication and budding. Indeed, Khromykh and collaborators showed that packaging of Kunjin (KUN) WNV vRNA is coupled to active vRNA replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. For their study, the authors designed a DNA-based KUN replicon that allows the continuous transcription by cellular RNA polymerase II and accumulation of replication-competent (wild-type) and replication-deficient (RdRp-defective) KUN RNAs. As expected, transfection of wild-type DNA constructs yielded replicating KUN RNA and secretion of infectious virions. On the other hand, transfection of the RdRp-defective construct resulted in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RdRp-defective RNA and the secretion of structural proteins; however, this RNA was not packaged into secreted virus particles. Notably, when the RdRp-defective plasmid was transfected into helper BHK-21 cells, which persistently express KUN replicon RNA and thus provide wild-type replicative proteins, the RdRp-defective RNA was packaged and secreted into virus particles [

Coupling of vRNA replication with assembly plausibly gives specificity to the encapsidation process and its straightforward to envision a model wherein the vRNA will exit through the pore of the VP which is juxtaposed to the assembly sites at the ER [
