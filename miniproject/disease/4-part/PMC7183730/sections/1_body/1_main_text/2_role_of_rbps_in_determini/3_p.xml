<p id="Par71">Besides carrying endogenous molecules, EVs also carry virus particles and infectious genomes. This phenomenon was initially discovered for non-enveloped viruses in which several viral genomes are packaged and released inside EVs, thus mediating 
 <italic>en bloc</italic> viral transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>]. Interestingly, several reports indicate that enveloped viruses that are traditionally seen to disseminate as free viral particles, also exploit EVs for their propagation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. In particular, cells infected with HCV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>], DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>], ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>] and TBEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>] release exosomes that are infectious to recipient cells. These infectious exosomes carry full-length vRNA but do not always contain the structural viral proteins associated with virions, thus suggesting that in 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>-infected cells, vRNA molecules are sorted into exosomes independently of the assembly of fully mature particles. It is not known how vRNAs are sequestered into endosomal ILVs, but it is likely that, as in the case of cellular RNAs, specific RBPs would mediate the interaction with MBVs. For example, exosomes from sera of HCV-infected patients were found to contain vRNA, miR-122, HSP90 and the RBP Ago2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>]. The binding of miR-122 to HCV vRNA in association with Ago2 favors vRNA replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>] and it was previously shown that HSP90 functions as a chaperone for Argonaute proteins facilitating the loading of small RNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. It is interesting that these components of cytoplasmic RNPs are present in infectious HCV exosomes. Similarly, it is intriguing that YBX1 and hnRNPA2B1, previously described to mediate the packaging of cellular RNAs into exosomes, have been shown to bind DENV vRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. Furthermore, DENV, WNV and TBEV vRNA colocalizes with several RBPs present in cytoplasmic RNA granules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>], which could potentially facilitate its sorting into exosomes. Collectively, these data highlight a previously overlooked function of cellular RBPs during 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection. We propose that these proteins do not only favor the assembly and release of traditional virions, but are likely involved in the secretion of alternative infectious units, with potentially important consequences for viral dissemination and immune recognition.
