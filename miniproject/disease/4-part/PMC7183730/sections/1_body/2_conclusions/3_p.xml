<p id="Par74">Remarkably, host RBPs potentially contribute to the dissemination of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection via the incorporation of vRNA into exosomes. How these infectious exosomes are formed and what they contribute to viral dissemination is not known. Taking into account that exosomes may be poorly recognized by the host immune system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>] and that 
 <italic>en bloc</italic> transmission of multiple genomes favors higher replicative fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>], a deeper study of the role of exosomes during 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection and their biogenesis is warranted. It is interesting that viral assembly/release and exosome biogenesis share common features, such as membrane remodelling, loading of specific cargo and fusion with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, host factors from the vesicular trafficking machinery are required for the egress of flaviviruses. For example, the assembly, but not replication, of DENV, JEV and YFV has been shown to require components of ESCRT, which is central to exosome biogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. In addition, DENV, WNV and ZIKV have been shown to induce autophagy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>], a pathway that was recently described to mediate the loading of RBPs into EVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. Further studies are required to establish whether flaviviruses evolved to co-opt exosomes as an alternative route of dissemination, but it is clear that RBPs guide the fate of vRNA molecules and thus, potentially determine the mechanism by which viral infection is disseminated.
