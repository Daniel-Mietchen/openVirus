<p>Autophagy was modeled in three different cell lines, the mosquito-derived 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 (ATCC; American Type Culture Collection) and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells (Generously provided by Dr. Gregory Ebel, Colorado State University) and mammalian cell line BHK-21 clone 15 (Syrian golden hamster kidney cells) (Generously provided by Dr. Rushika Perrera, Colorado State University). The two mosquito cell lines were maintained at 28°C in the presence of CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and the BHK cells were maintained at 37°C with CO
 <sub>2</sub>. All cells were grown in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, L-glutamine, and non-essential amino acids. This media was used in all transfections, infections and plaque assays. Cell infections were carried out using viruses from two major arbovirus families, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>. DENV-2 strain Jam 1409 (Jamaica) was passaged on C6/36 cells and CHIKV strain R99659 (Caribbean lineage, British Virgin Islands, 2013) was passaged on Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney cells).
