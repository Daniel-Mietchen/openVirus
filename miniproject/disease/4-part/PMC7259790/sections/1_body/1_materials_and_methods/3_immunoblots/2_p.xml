<p>The effect of virus infection in combination with pharmacological modulators on autophagy was also assayed via western blot. Aag2 cells were prepared as above and infected with DENV-2 or CHIKV at a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of 0.5. After one hour of infection at 28°C, DMSO, 1 μM bafilomycin A1, 1 μM torin-1, or 10 μM spautin-1 were added to the wells. For DENV-2, cells were harvested 48 hours post infection (hpi) using RIPA buffer and tested for Atg8 expression as above. Due to a difference in viral replication kinetics, CHIKV samples were harvested at 24 hpi. Band intensities of Atg8-PE and β-actin were determined by ImageJ. Autophagy induction was quantified by calculating the ratio of Atg8-PE to β-actin for each sample. The fold change in Atg-PE induction for each treatment was determined by comparing it to the DMSO control. All experiments were completed in triplicate.</p>
