<p>For titration of DENV-2, BHK21 c15 cells were grown to a confluent monolayer in 12-well plates and infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus for 1 hour at room temperature and overlaid with a mixture of the standard media and 5% methyl cellulose. After incubation at 37Â°C for four days, the cells were fixed with 7.4% formaldehyde and stained with gentian violet. Viral titers were determined by counting plaques. For titration of CHIKV, the above protocol was followed in Vero cells.</p>
