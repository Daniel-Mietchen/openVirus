<p>This study provides an important first-step in understanding autophagy-arbovirus interactions within mosquitoes and highlights differences between the mammalian and mosquito autophagic response to infection. However, future work assessing these interactions within mosquitoes will be needed due to the limitations of our cell culture system. As previously mentioned, the origin of mosquito cell culture is unknown and therefore, it is difficult to determine if, in the context of natural infection, virus-autophagy interactions may function differently. Further, during infection, arboviruses must infect and replicate in a diversity of tissues and cell types before being transmitted. Previous studies have shown that autophagy can function differently between cell types and tissue types, and it is therefore possible that during the course of mosquito infection autophagy might interact differently with viruses depending on the tissue and cell type [
