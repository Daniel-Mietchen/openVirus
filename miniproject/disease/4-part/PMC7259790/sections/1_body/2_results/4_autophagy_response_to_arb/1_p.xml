<p>Due to the unexpected results associated with chemical treatment in Aag2 cells, we examined if the observed outcomes were consistent in other host systems. Others have previously shown that spautin-1 mediated inhibition of autophagy in mammalian cells, specifically BHK-21, drastically reduces DENV-2 titers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In an effort to recapitulate these findings we treated DENV-2 infected BHK-21 cells with spautin-1 and observed a significant reduction in DENV-2 titers 48 hpi (

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> cells. As before, treatment of Aag2 cells with both torin-1 and spautin-1 resulted in significantly increased DENV-2 titers 48 hpi; however, we observed a significant decrease in titers upon torin-1 treatment and no effect upon spautin-1 treatment in C6/36 cells (
