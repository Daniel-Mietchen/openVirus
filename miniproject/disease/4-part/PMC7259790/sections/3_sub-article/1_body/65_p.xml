<p>Line 10: The process of Dengue induced lipophagy and its role in processing mature viral progenies was actually demonstrated in this paper (Zhang et al., 2018); this needs to be cited. Along the same lines, since both Dengue and Zika have been reported to induce autophagy for the purpose of hydrolyzing lipid droplets, it might be relevant to measure their abundance in infected insect cells, via simple Nile Red staining. This will provide useful information on similarities and differences between human and insect cells.</p>
