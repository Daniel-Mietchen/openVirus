  <title>Chemical modulators of autophagy have minimal toxicity in Aag2 cells.</title>
  <p>Aag2 cells were treated with either torin-1 (1 μM), spautin-1 (10 μM), bafilomycin A1 (1 μM), 1% DMSO, or untreated for 24 hrs (n = 4). Subsequently, the MTT cell viability assay was performed to determine if the chemicals had cytotoxic effects. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Red data points were determined to be outliers by Grubb’s test for outliers and were not included in the analysis.</p>
