  <title>Both induction and inhibition of autophagy increase ZIKV titers in Aag2 cells.</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells were infected with ZIKV followed by chemical treatment (1% DMSO, 1 μM bafilomycin A1, 1 μM torin-1 or 10 μM spautin-1) or treated with dsRNA against Atg5, Atg14, or non-specific control luciferase genes two days prior to infection with ZIKV. Samples were collected for titration 48 hpi. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. (*) p&lt;0.05, (**) p&lt;0.01, (***) p&lt;0.001.
