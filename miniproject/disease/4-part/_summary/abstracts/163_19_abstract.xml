 <p>Plant viruses infecting crop species are causing long-lasting economic losses and are endangering food security worldwide. Ongoing events, such as climate change, changes in agricultural practices, globalization of markets or changes in plant virus vector populations, are affecting plant virus life cycles. Because farmerâ€™s fields are part of the larger environment, the role of wild plant species in plant virus life cycles can provide information about underlying processes during virus transmission and spread. This review focuses on the 
  <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, which contains thousands of species growing all around the world, including crop species, wild flora and model plants for genetic research. In a first part, we analyze various viruses infecting 
  <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants across the agro-ecological interface, emphasizing the important role of virus interactions between the cultivated and wild zones as global changes affect these environments on both local and global scales. To cope with these changes, it is necessary to adjust prophylactic protection measures and diagnostic methods. As illustrated in the second part, a complex virus research at the landscape level is necessary to obtain relevant data, which could be overwhelming. Based on evidence from previous studies we conclude that 
  <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plant communities can be targeted to address complete life cycles of viruses with different life strategies within the agro-ecological interface. Data obtained from such research could then be used to improve plant protection methods by taking into consideration environmental factors that are impacting the life cycles of plant viruses.
