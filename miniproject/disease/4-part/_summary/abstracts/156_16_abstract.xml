 <p>Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is emerging as the primary cause of acute viral hepatitis in humans. The virus is commonly transmitted by the fecalâ€“oral route via contaminated water in endemic regions or through the consumption of inadequately cooked swine products or game meats in industrialized regions. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are predominantly associated with waterborne transmission in developing countries, whereas 
  <italic>HEV3</italic> and 
  <italic>HEV4</italic> are mainly zoonotically transmitted in industrialized countries. Seroprevalence in populations determined by detecting anti-HEV antibodies and serum HEV RNA is commonly used to analyze the presence of HEV. Although HEV RNA-based detection is now standardized, there is a lack of agreement between the assaying methods used for gathering seroprevalence data. Since 2004, HEV has been considered as a transmissible infectious agent through blood transfusion. Recent seroprevalence studies in European countries indicate an underestimated risk for blood transfusion and hence warrant testing the blood supply. HEV infection is usually self-limiting and spontaneously cleared. However, in about 60% of recipients of solid organ transplants, HEV progresses to chronic hepatitis. Immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus are a major cause of chronic hepatitis and reducing its dosage results in viral clearance in about 30% of patients. In hemodialysis patients, the parenteral route is implicated as an important mechanism of transmission. In this review, we explore the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of various HEV genotypes in blood donors, hemodialysis patients, and transplant recipients.
