 <p>The members of the family 
  <italic>Bromoviridae</italic> have spherical or bacilliform virions with tri-segmented, single-stranded genomic RNAs, packaged in separate particles. Six genera including 
  <italic>Alfamovirus</italic>, 
  <italic>Anulavirus</italic>, 
  <italic>Bromovirus</italic>, 
  <italic>Cucumovirus</italic>, 
  <italic>Ilarvirus</italic>, and 
  <italic>Oleavirus</italic> are part of the family. RNA1 and RNA2 code for the replicase whereas RNA3 codes for movement and coat proteins. Genomic RNAs are infectious, but some species also require CP for infectivity. Members can encapsidate/accumulate sub-genomic RNAs, and/or defective or satellite RNAs. RNA replication occurs inside membranous spherules, and the role of host factors in RNA replication have been documented. Frequent RNA-RNA recombination and segment reassortment processes were observed among bromovirids. Transmission occurs mechanically, via pollen, seeds or insects. Host range varies from narrow to wide, infecting herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees, with some members causing major epidemics.
