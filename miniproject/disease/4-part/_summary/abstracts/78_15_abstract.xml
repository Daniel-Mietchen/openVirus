  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are the most important arbovirus vectors in the world.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
  <p> This study aimed to investigate and compare the infestation pattern of these species in a neighbourhood of Recife, Brazil, endemic for arboviruses in 2005 (T1) and 2013 (T2).</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p> Infestation, distribution and relative abundance of these sympatric species were recorded by egg collection using a network of 59 sentinel ovitraps (s-ovt) at fixed sampling stations for 12 months in T1 and T2.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>FINDINGS</title>
  <p> A permanent occupation pattern was detected which was characterised by the presence of egg-laying females of one or both species with a high ovitrap positivity index (94.3 to 100%) throughout both years analysed. In terms of abundance, the total of eggs collected was lower (p &lt; 0.005) in T2 (146,153) than in T1 (281,103), although ovitraps still displayed a high index of positivity. The spatial distribution showed the presence of both species in 65.1% of the 148 s-ovt assessed, while a smaller number of traps exclusively contained 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (22%) or 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (13.2%) eggs.
  </p>

  <title>MAIN CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p> Our comparative analysis demonstrated the robustness of the spatial occupation and permanence of 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations in this endemic urban area.
