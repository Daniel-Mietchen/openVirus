  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Transmission dynamics of arboviruses like Zika virus are often evaluated by vector competence (the proportion of infectious vectors given exposure) and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP, the time it takes for a vector to become infectious), but vector age is another critical driver of transmission dynamics. Vectorial capacity (VC) is a measure of transmission potential of a vector-pathogen system, but how these three components, EIP, vector competence and vector age, affect VC in concert still needs study.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">The interaction of vector competence, EIP, and mosquito age at the time of infection acquisition (Age
   <sub>acquisition</sub>) was experimentally measured in an 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti-</italic>ZIKV model system, as well as the age-dependence of probability of survival and the willingness to bite. An age-structured vectorial capacity framework (VC
   <sub>age</sub>) was then developed using both EIP
   <sub>Min</sub> and EIP
   <sub>Max</sub>, defined as the time to first observed minimum proportion of transmitting mosquitoes and the time to observed maximum proportion of transmitting mosquitoes.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">The within-mosquito dynamics of vector competence/EIP were not significant among treatments where mosquitoes were exposed at different ages. However, VC
   <sub>age</sub> revealed: (i) age-dependence in vector-virus interactions is important for transmission success; (ii) lower vector competence but at shorter EIPs was sufficient for transmission perpetuation; and (iii) R
   <sub>0</sub> may be overestimated by using non-age-structured VC.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4">The results indicate that ultimately the temporal component of the virus-vector dynamics is most critical, especially when exposure occurred at advanced mosquito age. While our study is limited to a single virus-vector system, and a multitude of other factors affect both vector competence and mosquito mortality, our methods can be extrapolated to these other scenarios. Results indicate that how ‘highly’ or ‘negligibly’ competent vectors are categorized may need adjustment.
