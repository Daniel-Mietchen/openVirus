 <p id="Par1">Many emerging arboviruses of global public health importance, such as dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV), originated in sylvatic transmission cycles involving wild animals and forest-dwelling mosquitoes. Arbovirus emergence in the human population typically results from spillover transmission via bridge vectors, which are competent mosquitoes feeding on both humans and wild animals. Another related, but less studied concern, is the risk of ‘spillback’ transmission from humans into novel sylvatic cycles. We colonized a sylvatic population of 
  <italic>Aedes malayensis</italic> from a forested area of the Nakai district in Laos to evaluate its potential as an arbovirus bridge vector. We found that this 
  <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> population was overall less competent for DENV and YFV than an urban population of 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Olfactometer experiments showed that our 
  <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> colony did not display any detectable attraction to human scent in laboratory conditions. The relatively modest vector competence for DENV and YFV, combined with a lack of detectable attraction to human odor, indicate a low potential for this sylvatic 
  <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> population to act as an arbovirus bridge vector. However, we caution that opportunistic blood feeding on humans by sylvatic 
  <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> may occasionally contribute to bridge sylvatic and human transmission cycles.
