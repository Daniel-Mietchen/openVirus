  <title>INTRODUCTION:</title>
  <p> DENV-2 is the cause of most dengue epidemics worldwide and is associated with severe cases. </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>METHODS:</title>
  <p> We investigated arboviruses in 164 serum samples collected from patients presenting with clinical symptoms of dengue fever and 152 mosquito pools. </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>RESULTS:</title>
  <p> We detected the Asian II genotype of DENV-2 in humans and mosquitoes. Our results confirmed the circulation of the Asian II genotype in Brazil, in addition to the prevalent Asian/American genotype. </p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS:</title>
  <p> The detection of Asian II genotype of DENV-2 in mosquito pools collected in a forest park may be related to a spillback event of human dengue virus.</p>
