  <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium is a leading cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Our current understanding of the biology of 
  <italic>Salmonella</italic> is largely based on studies using just two laboratory strains of 
  <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, with similar characteristics. Yet this pathogen exhibits a remarkable diversity in host range, outcome of infection, and risk to human health. To investigate the genetic basis of this diversity, we have explored the genetic relationship of a collection of isolates that represent a substantial portion of the diversity of 
  <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, using whole genome sequencing. 
  <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium evolved forming two major groups that differ in their distribution in livestock and wild avian species. The livestock-associated group contained isolates commonly affecting human health and were often drug resistant, while the wild avian-associated group was rarely associated with drug resistance and less frequently associated with human infection. We report distinct evolutionary processes acting on subgroups of 
  <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium including loss of information content of genomes, and gain or loss of genes predicted to affect functions such as antimicrobial resistance, disease potential, and environmental survival, and functional diversification. This study provides a framework in which to understand the epidemiology of 
  <italic>Salmonella</italic> and improve assessment of its risk to animal and human health.
