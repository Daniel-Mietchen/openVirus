  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Humans are the primary hosts of dengue viruses (DENV). However, sylvatic cycles of transmission can occur among non-human primates and human encroachment into forested regions can be a source of emergence of new strains such as the highly divergent and sylvatic strain of DENV2, QML22, recovered from a dengue fever patient returning to Australia from Borneo. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the vector competence of Australian 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes for this virus.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">Four- to five-day-old mosquitoes from two strains of 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Queensland, Australia, were fed a meal of sheep blood containing 10
   <sup>8</sup> 50% cell culture infectious dose per ml (CCID
   <sub>50</sub>/ml) of either QML22 or an epidemic strain of DENV serotype 2 (QML16) isolated from a dengue fever patient in Australia in 2015. Mosquitoes were maintained at 28 °C, 75% relative humidity and sampled 7, 10 and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Live virions in mosquito bodies (abdomen/thorax), legs and wings and saliva expectorates from individual mosquitoes were quantified using a cell culture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CCELISA) to determine infection, dissemination and transmission rates.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">The infection and dissemination rates of the sylvatic DENV2 strain, QML22, were significantly lower than that for QML16. While the titres of virus in the bodies of mosquitoes infected with either of these viruses were similar, titres in legs and wings were significantly lower in mosquitoes infected with QML22 at most time points although they reached similar levels by 14 dpi. QML16 was detected in 16% (
   <italic>n</italic> = 25) and 28% (
   <italic>n</italic> = 25) of saliva expectorates at 10 and 14 dpi, respectively. In contrast, no virus was detected in the saliva expectorates of QML22 infected mosquitoes.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4">Australia urban/peri-urban 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> species are susceptible to infection by the sylvatic and highly divergent DENV 2 QML22 but replication of QML22 is attenuated relative to the contemporary strain, QML16. A salivary gland infection or escape barrier may be acting to prevent infection of saliva and would prevent onward transmission of this highly divergent virus in Australia.
