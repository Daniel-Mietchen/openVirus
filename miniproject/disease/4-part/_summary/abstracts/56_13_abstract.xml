 <p>Food-borne disease is a widespread and escalating public health problem globally. About a quarter of the microorganisms isolated from cockroaches are food-borne pathogens including 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7, 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhi, 
  <italic>Rotavirus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>. Thus, cockroaches could be an important reservoir and mechanical vector of food-borne pathogens. Generally, the role of cockroaches in human infections is poorly understood and has been an issue of debate for several years. This article aims to elucidate the possible role of cockroaches in food-borne infections by reviewing the relevant research publications.
