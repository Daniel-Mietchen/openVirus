 <p>Exposure to bacterial superantigens (SAgs) is often a consequence of infection with common Gram-positive bacteria causing septic and toxic shock or food poisoning. How SAgs affect the magnitude, breadth and quality of infection/vaccine-elicited CD8
  <sup>+</sup> T cell (T
  <sub>CD8</sub>) responses to respiratory viral pathogens, including influenza A viruses (IAVs), is far from clear. Also importantly, superinfections with IAVs and SAg-producing bacteria are serious clinical occurrences during seasonal and pandemic flu and require urgent attention. We demonstrate that two structurally distinct SAgs, including staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), unexpectedly enhance primary T
  <sub>CD8</sub> responses to ‘select’ IAV-derived epitopes depending on the TCR makeup of the responding clones. Intriguingly, the timing of exposure to SEB dictates the outcome of prime-boost immunization. Seeing a SAg before priming raises memory precursor frequencies and augments anamnestic T
  <sub>CD8</sub> responses. Conversely, a SAg encounter before boosting renders T
  <sub>CD8</sub> prone to death or exhaustion and impedes recall responses, thus likely compromising heterosubtypic immunity to IAVs. Finally, local exposure to SEB increases the pulmonary response of immunodominant IAV-specific T
  <sub>CD8</sub>. These findings shed new light on how bacterial infections and SAgs influence the effectiveness of anti-IAV T
  <sub>CD8</sub> responses, and have, as such, wide-ranging implications for preventative vaccination and infection control.
