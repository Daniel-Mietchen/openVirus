 <p>The French overseas Territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands, located in the South Pacific, has been affected by several dengue epidemics, but did not face Zika or chikungunya outbreaks, unlike other neighboring islands. The near-exclusive presence of the 
  <italic>Aedes polynesiensis</italic> mosquito in the islands of Wallis and Futuna confirmed the role played by this mosquito as a vector of dengue fever. A local 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>polynesiensis</italic> population was recently shown to be able to transmit the Zika virus under experimental conditions, but its susceptibility to the chikungunya virus was still unknown, and recent data on the presence of other potential arbovirus vectors were missing. Therefore, we investigated the entomological risk factors for the transmission of arboviral diseases in the Wallis and Futuna Islands. We reported the occurrence and distribution of different 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> species, especially the abundant presence of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>polynesiensis</italic> across the territory and the spread of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> in the island of Wallis. Our results demonstrated the ability of local 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>polynesiensis</italic> populations to transmit the chikungunya virus. These findings highlight the risk of arbovirus transmission in the Wallis and Futuna Islands and provide relevant data to guide prevention and vector control strategies in the territory.
