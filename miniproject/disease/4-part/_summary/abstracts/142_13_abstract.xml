  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Epidemiological data on 
   <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> infection are scarce from the southwestern region of China. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and determinants of 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection in the region.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">A community-based cross-sectional study of 2608 participants aged ≥14 years was conducted in a rural area of southwestern China in 2014–15. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic characteristics and other factors associated with 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection. The diagnoses of 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic>, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were determined by commercial test kits. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the correlates for 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">The prevalence of 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection was 1.2% (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7%). Risk factors varied by gender. In the male group, 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection was significantly associated with ever injection drug use (aOR = 9.42, 95% CI 2.47 to 35.87) and HCV infection (aOR = 13.28, 95% CI 3.20 to 51.70). In the female group, correlates for 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection included spouse having syphilis (aOR = 126.66, 95% CI 7.58 to 2122.94), ever having blood transfusion (aOR = 10.51, 95% CI 1.58 to 41.21) and HBV infection (aOR = 4.19, 95% CI 1.35 to 10.93).

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4">The prevalence of 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection was high in the rural area of southwestern China. Correlates for 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection varied with sex specific. Intervention should be developed for the prevention and control of 
   <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection.
