 <p>Exactly why avian influenza A (H5N1) and (H7N9) viruses cause severe diseases in humans remains unclear. PB1-F2 protein encoded by influenza A virus is one virulence factor that might make a difference. In this study we show that PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus is particularly strong in the suppression of host antiviral defense. This was achieved by inhibiting a key protein in cell signaling named MAVS. PB1-F2 directs MAVS for degradation and prevents MAVS from forming protein aggregates required for full activation. A recombinant virus in which PB1-F2 of H7N9 has been deleted can activate host antiviral response robustly. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus prevents MAVS aggregation and promotes MAVS degradation, leading to the suppression of host antiviral defense.</p>
