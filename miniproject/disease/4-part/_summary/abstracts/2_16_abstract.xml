  <title>Purpose</title>
  <p>The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospital patients is often ambiguous due to the limited pathogen detection. Lack of a microbiological diagnosis impairs precision treatment in CAP.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract of 195 CAP patients, viruses were measured by the Single-plex real-time PCR assay and the conventional culture method was exploited for bacteria.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Among the 195 patients, there were 46 (23.59%) pure bacterial infections, 20 (10.26%) 
   <italic>yeast</italic> infections, 32 (16.41%) pure viral infections, 8 (4.10%) viral-
   <italic>yeast</italic> co-infections, and 17 (8.72%) viral-bacterial co-infections. The two most abundant bacteria were 
   <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and 
   <italic>klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, whereas the most common virus was influenza A.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Non-influenza respiratory microorganisms frequently co-circulated during the epidemic peaks of influenza, which easily being ignored in CAP therapy. In patients with bacterial and viral co-infections, identifying the etiologic agent is crucial for patientâ€™s therapy.</p>
