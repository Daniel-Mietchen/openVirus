  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Zika virus (ZIKV, genus 
   <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, family 
   <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) is transmitted mainly by 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. This virus has become an emerging concern of global public health with recent epidemics associated to neurological complications in the pacific and America. ZIKV is the most frequently amplified arbovirus in southeastern Senegal. However, this virus and its adult vectors are undetectable during the dry season. The aim of this study was to investigate how ZIKV and its vectors are maintained locally during the dry season.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">Soil, sand, and detritus contained in 1339 potential breeding sites (tree holes, rock holes, fruit husks, discarded containers, used tires) were collected in forest, savannah, barren and village land covers and flooded for eggs hatching. The emerging larvae were reared to adult, identified, and blood fed for F1 production. The F0 and F1 adults were identified and tested for ZIKV by Reverse Transcriptase-Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">A total of 1016 specimens, including 13 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> species, emerged in samples collected in the land covers and breeding sites investigated. 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was the dominant species representing 56.6% of this fauna with a high plasticity. 
   <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> and 
   <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> were found in forest tree holes, 
   <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> in forest and village tree holes, 
   <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> in rock holes. ZIKV was detected from 4 out of the 82 mosquito pools tested. Positive pools included 
   <italic>Ae. bromeliae</italic> (2 pools), 
   <italic>Ae. unilineatus</italic> (1 pool), and 
   <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> (1 pool), indicating that the virus is maintained in these 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs during the dry season.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Our investigation identified breeding sites types and land cover classes where several ZIKV vectors are maintained, and their maintenance rates during the dry season in southeastern Senegal. The maintenance of the virus in these vectors in nature could explain its early amplification at the start of the rainy season in this area.</p>
