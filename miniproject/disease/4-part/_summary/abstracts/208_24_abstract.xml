 <p>It is unclear how historical adaptation versus maladaptation in a prior environment affects population evolvability in a novel habitat. We tested whether prior evolution of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) populations at either at constant temperature or under random changing temperatures affected the rate of adaptation at the thermal‐niche edge. Our results suggest that prior adaptation under constant versus random temperatures constrained the mutation landscape that could improve fitness in the novel environment and conclude that RNA viruses maladapted to their previous environment could “leapfrog” over counterparts of higher fitness, to achieve faster adaptability in a novel environment.
