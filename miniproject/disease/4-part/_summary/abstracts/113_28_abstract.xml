 <p>Ross River virus (RRV) was first identified in Australia in 1959, and has since caused multiple outbreaks, some affecting tens of thousands of individuals throughout the Pacific Islands, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. In addition, a mean of 4,600 cases of RRV disease occur in Australia each year. RRV is transmitted to humans via the bite of a mosquito, and disease symptoms include rash, fever, and debilitating polyarthritis. Currently, the adaptive immune response during RRV infection is poorly understood, and no human moncoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the virus exist. In this study, we generated a panel of human mAbs specific for RRV from two donors who had undergone a natural infection with the virus. We then used these mAbs to elucidate antigenic regions of RRV, and to further study mechanisms by which RRV is neutralized. In addition to potently neutralizing virus 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>, these mAbs significantly reduced mouse death and reducd viral burden in an immunocompromised model. Our study provides new insight into the antibody reponse during a natural infection with RRV, and suggests that therapeutic administration of mAbs may be beneficial in reducing disease burden.
