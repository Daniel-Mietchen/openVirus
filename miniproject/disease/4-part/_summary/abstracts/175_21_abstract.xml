 <p>To identify potential sylvatic, urban and bridge-vectors that can be involved in current or future virus spillover from wild to more urbanised areas, entomological field surveys were conducted in rural, peri-urban and urban areas spanning the rainy and dry seasons in western Cameroon. A total of 2650 mosquitoes belonging to 37 species and eight genera were collected. Mosquito species richness was significantly influenced by the specific combination of the habitat type and the season. The highest species richness was found in the peri-urban area (S = 30, Chao1 = 121 ± 50.63, ACE = 51.97 ± 3.88) during the dry season (S = 28, Chao1 = 64 ± 25.7, ACE = 38.33 ± 3.1). 
  <italic>Aedes (Ae.) africanus</italic> and 
  <italic>Culex</italic> (
  <italic>Cx.) moucheti</italic> were only found in the rural and peri-urban areas, while 
  <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> s.l. and 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were only found in the urban area. 
  <italic>Cx. (Culiciomyia)</italic> spp., 
  <italic>Cx. duttoni</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were caught in the three habitat types. Importantly, approximately 52% of the mosquito species collected in this study have been implicated in the transmission of diverse arboviruses. This entomological survey provides a catalogue of the different mosquito species that may be involved in the transmission of arboviruses. Further investigations are needed to study the vectorial capacity of each mosquito species in arbovirus transmission.
