PMC7171471,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\0_17_abstract.xml,   The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques has improved the detection of respiratory viruses particularly with the use of multiplex real-time technique with the capability of simultaneous detection of various pathogens in a single reaction. The aim of this study was to apply the above technology for the diagnosis of influenza infections and at the same time to differentiate between common flu species between hospitalized patients in Laleh hospital (Iran) between two flu seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018). Different respiratory specimens were collected from 540 patients from a period of December 2016 to May 2018 and were sent to the laboratory for molecular diagnosis. RNAs were extracted and subsequently a multiplex real time PCR identifying flu A flu B and typing flu A (H1N1) was carried out. The mean age of patients was 47.54±23.96. 216 (40%) and 321 (60%) of subjects were male and female respectively. 219 out of 540 (40.5%) were positive for influenza infection including flu A (n=97 44.3%) flu A (H1N1) (n=45 20.7%) and flu B (n=77 35%). Flu A was the dominant species on 2016-2017 and flu B was the major species on 2017-2018. Flu A (H1N1) was comparable in both time periods. Flu infections were most frequently diagnosed in age groups 21-40. Flu-positive patients suffered more from body pain and sore throat than flunegative patients with significant statistical difference (P values &lt;0.001). The mean duration of hospitalization was shorter for flu-positive patients (P value = 0.016). Application of multiplex real time PCR could facilitate the influenza diagnosis in a short period of time benefiting patients from exclusion of bacterial infections and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Influenza diagnosis was not achieved in up to 60% of flu-like respiratory infections suggesting the potential benefit of adopting the same methodology for assessing the involvement of other viral or/and bacterial pathogens in those patients.  ,

PMC7172155,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\2_16_abstract.xml,      Purpose   The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospital patients is often ambiguous due to the limited pathogen detection. Lack of a microbiological diagnosis impairs precision treatment in CAP.       Methods   Specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract of 195 CAP patients viruses were measured by the Single-plex real-time PCR assay and the conventional culture method was exploited for bacteria.       Results   Among the 195 patients there were 46 (23.59%) pure bacterial infections 20 (10.26%)     yeast infections 32 (16.41%) pure viral infections 8 (4.10%) viral-    yeast co-infections and 17 (8.72%) viral-bacterial co-infections. The two most abundant bacteria were     Acinetobacter baumannii and     klebsiella pneumoniae whereas the most common virus was influenza A.          Conclusions   Non-influenza respiratory microorganisms frequently co-circulated during the epidemic peaks of influenza which easily being ignored in CAP therapy. In patients with bacterial and viral co-infections identifying the etiologic agent is crucial for patient’s therapy.    ,
PMC7173238,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\3_16_abstract.xml,   Nucleos(t)ide analogues play pivotal roles as antiviral cytotoxic or immunosuppressive agents. Here we review recent reports of nucleoside analogues that exhibit broad-spectrum activity towards multiple life-threatening RNA and DNA viruses. We also present a discussion about nucleoside antimetabolites—approved antineoplastic agents—that have recently been shown to have antiviral and/or antibacterial activity. The approved drugs and drug combinations as well as recently identified candidates for investigation and/or experimentation are discussed. Several examples of repurposed drugs that have already been approved for use are presented. This strategy can be crucial for the first-line treatment of acute infections or coinfections and for the management of drug-resistant strains.  ,
PMC7173702,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\4_14_abstract.xml,          During influenza infection hemagglutinins (HAs) on the viral surface bind to sialic acids on the host cell’s surface. While all HAs bind sialic acids human influenza targets terminal α26 sialic acids and avian influenza targets α23 sialic acids. For interspecies transmission (zoonosis) HA must mutate to adapt to these differences. Here multivalent gold nanoparticles bearing either α26- or α23-sialyllactosamine have been developed to interrogate a panel of HAs from pathogenic human low pathogenic avian and other species’ influenza. This method exploits the benefits of multivalent glycan presentation compared to monovalent presentation to increase affinity and investigate how multivalency affects selectivity. Using a library-orientated approach parameters including polymer coating and core diameter were optimized for maximal binding and specificity were probed using galactosylated particles and a panel of biophysical techniques [ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy dynamic light scattering and biolayer interferometry]. The optimized particles were then functionalized with sialyllactosamine and their binding analyzed against a panel of HAs derived from pathogenic influenza strains including low pathogenic avian strains. This showed significant specificity crossover which is not observed in monovalent formats with binding of avian HAs to human sialic acids and    vice versa in agreement with alternate assay formats. These results demonstrate that precise multivalent presentation is essential to dissect the interactions of HAs and may aid the discovery of tools for disease and zoonosis transmission.    ,
PMC7173783,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\5_18_abstract.xml,   We present results of a study of a simple stochastic agent-based model of influenza A infection simulating its dynamics over the course of one flu season. Building on an early work of Bartlett we define a model with a limited number of parameters and rates that have clear epidemiological interpretation and can be constrained by data. We demonstrate the occurrence of recurrent behavior in the infected number [more than one peak in a season] which is observed in data in our simulations for populations consisting of cohorts with strong intra- and weak inter-cohort transmissibility. We examine the dependence of the results on epidemiological and population characteristics by investigating their dependence on a range of parameter values. Finally we study infection with two strains of influenza inspired by observations and show a counter-intuitive result for the effect of inoculation against the strain that leads to the first wave of infection.  ,
PMC7173960,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\6_14_abstract.xml,   The World Health Organization has included three bunyaviruses posing an increasing threat to human health on the Blueprint list of viruses likely to cause major epidemics and for which no or insufficient countermeasures exist. Here we describe a broadly applicable strategy based on llama-derived single-domain antibodies (VHHs) for the development of bunyavirus biotherapeutics. The method was validated using the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) an emerging pathogen of ruminants as model pathogens. VHH building blocks were assembled into highly potent neutralizing complexes using bacterial superglue technology. The multimeric complexes were shown to reduce and prevent virus-induced morbidity and mortality in mice upon prophylactic administration. Bispecific molecules engineered to present two different VHHs fused to an Fc domain were further shown to be effective upon therapeutic administration. The presented VHH-based technology holds great promise for the development of bunyavirus antiviral therapies.  ,
PMC7175453,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\7_13_abstract.xml,   Pandemics affect human lives severely and globally. Experience predicts that there will be a pandemic for sure although the time is unknown. When a viral epidemic breaks out assessing its pandemic risk is an important part of the process that characterizes genomic property viral pathogenicity transmission in animal model and so forth. In this review we intend to figure out how a pandemic may occur by looking into the past influenza pandemic events. We discuss interpretations of the experimental evidences resulted from animal model studies and extend implications of viral pandemic potentials and ingredients to emerging viral epidemics. Focusing on the pandemic potential of viral infectious diseases we suggest what should be assessed to prevent global catastrophes from influenza virus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus dengue and Zika viruses.  ,
PMC7175558,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\8_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Inconsistencies exist regarding the severity of illness caused by different influenza strains. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hospitalized adults and adolescents with influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-p) from type A and type B strains in China.       Methods   We retrospectively reviewed data from Flu-p patients in five hospitals in China from January 2013 to May 2019. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess the effects of influenza virus subtypes on clinical outcomes and to explore the risk factors of 30-day mortality for Flu-p patients.       Results   In total 963 laboratory-confirmed influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) and 386 influenza B-related pneumonia (FluB-p) patients were included. Upon adjustment for confounders multivariate logistic regression models showed that FluA-p was associated with an increased risk of invasive ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [    aOR]: 3.824 95% confidence interval [    CI]: 2.279–6.414;     P &lt;  0.001) admittance to intensive care unit (    aOR: 1.630     95% CI: 1.074–2.473     P = 0.022) and 30-day mortality (    aOR: 2.427     95% CI: 1.568–3.756     P &lt;  0.001) compared to FluB-p. Multivariate Cox regression models confirmed that influenza A virus infection (hazard ratio: 2.637     95% CI: 1.134–6.131     P = 0.024) was an independent predictor for 30-day mortality in Flu-p patients.          Conclusions   The severity of illness and clinical outcomes of FluA-p patients are more severe than FluB-p. This highlights the importance of identifying the virus strain during the management of severe influenza.    ,

PMC7176985,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\10_16_abstract.xml,   In November 2019 The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a draft set of Target Product Profiles (TPPs) describing optimal and minimally acceptable targets for vaccines against Rift Valley fever (RVF) a Phlebovirus with a three segmented genome in both humans and ruminants. The TPPs contained rigid requirements to protect against genomic reassortment of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) with wild-type RVF virus (RVFV) which place undue constraints on development and regulatory approval of LAVs. We review the current LAVs in use and in development and conclude that there is no evidence that reassortment between LAVs and wild-type RVFV has occurred during field use that such a reassortment event if it occurred would have no untoward consequence and that the TPPs should be revised to provide a more balanced assessment of the benefits versus the theoretical risks of reassortment.  ,
PMC7178760,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\11_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Prophylactic vaccines are critical in preventing hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) primarily caused by human enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Children aged less than 5 years are especially susceptible to EV71 infections. In addition to the development of vaccines containing the inactivated virus those containing virus-like particles (VLPs) with repeated antigens also constitute an effective preventive strategy for EV71 infections with safety and productivity advantages. We previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the EV71 capsid protein which assembled into spherical particles. This study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of EV71 infection.       Methods   To evaluate the protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate neonatal mice born by immunized female mice as well as normal neonatal mice immunized twice were infected with EV71 virus. Whereafter the survival rates clinical scores and viral loads were measured.       Results   The high dosage and booster immunization helped induce specific serum antibodies with high neutralization titers which were transferred to neonatal mice thereby facilitating effective resistance towards EV71 infection. An active immune response was also observed in neonatal mice which generated following immunization.       Conclusions   The present results suggest that this fusion protein is a suitable vaccine candidate in treating EV71 infections.    ,
PMC7179685,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\12_13_abstract.xml,   Zika virus (ZIKV) a vector-borne virus of the family    Flaviviridae continues to spread and remains a significant global public health threat. Currently there are no approved vaccines or antivirals against ZIKV. We investigated the anti-ZIKV ability of three iminosugars with endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidase inhibitor (ER-AGI) activity namely deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) castanospermine and celgosivir. None of the three iminosugars showed any significant cytotoxicity in Vero or human microglia CHME3 cells when applied for 72 h at concentrations up to 100 μM. Iminosugar treatment of Vero or CHME3 cells prior to ZIKV infection resulted in significant inhibition of ZIKV replication over 48 h. Reduction in ZIKV replication in iminosugar-treated cells was not associated with any significant change in the expression levels of key antiviral genes. Following infection with three different strains of ZIKV iminosugar-treated Vero or CHME3 cells showed no cell death whereas vehicle-treated control cells exhibited 50–60% cell death at 72 h post-infection (hpi). While there was no significant difference in apoptosis between iminosugar-treated and control cells iminosugar-treated cells exhibited a substantial reduction of necrosis at 72 hpi following ZIKV infection. In summary iminosugars with ER-AGI activity inhibit ZIKV replication and significantly reduce necrosis without altering the antiviral gene expression and apoptosis of infected human cells. The results of this study strongly suggest that iminosugars are promising anti-ZIKV antiviral agents and such warrant further    in vivo studies.    ,
PMC7181926,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\13_13_abstract.xml,   The circulation of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Mali has not been clearly characterized. Therefore we conducted a serologic survey of 793 asymptomatic volunteers    &gt;15 years of age (2016) and 637 blood donors (2013) to assess the seroprevalence of ZIKV infection in 2 ecoclimatic regions of Mali tropical savannah and warm semiarid region using ELISA and seroneutralization assays. The overall seroprevalence was ≈12% and increased with age with no statistical difference between male and female participants. In the warm semiarid study sites we detected immunological markers of an outbreak that occurred in the late 1990s in 18% (95% CI 13%–23%) of participants. In tropical savannah sites we estimated a low rate of endemic transmission with 2.5% (95% CI 2.0%–3.1%) of population infected by ZIKV annually. These data demonstrate the circulation of ZIKV in Mali and provide evidence of a previously unidentified outbreak that occurred in the late 1990s.    ,
PMC7181938,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\14_13_abstract.xml,   There were 3 influenza pandemics in the 20th century and there has been 1 so far in the 21st century. Local national and international health authorities regularly update their plans for mitigating the next influenza pandemic in light of the latest available evidence on the effectiveness of various control measures in reducing transmission. Here we review the evidence base on the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical personal protective measures and environmental hygiene measures in nonhealthcare settings and discuss their potential inclusion in pandemic plans. Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza. We similarly found limited evidence on the effectiveness of improved hygiene and environmental cleaning. We identified several major knowledge gaps requiring further research most fundamentally an improved characterization of the modes of person-to-person transmission.  ,
PMC7182252,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\15_12_abstract.xml,   Abstract:  Respiratory viruses are commonly detected in both healthy and immunocompromised children. In most healthy children respiratory viruses are associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract infections and are not accompanied by significant morbidity. In immunocompromised hosts including hematopoietic cell transplant recipients solid organ transplant recipients and oncology patients respiratory viruses can be associated with significant clinical manifestations including prolonged viral shedding lower respiratory tract disease the need for supplemental oxygen late airflow obstruction and even death. This chapter reviews the major respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus human metapneumovirus influenza parainfluenza viruses human rhinoviruses and human coronaviruses. Other viruses can manifest as pulmonary infection; however these viruses are discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 17 for discussion of cytomegalovirus and Chapter 22 for discussion of adenoviruses).  ,
PMC7182292,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\16_17_abstract.xml,   Abstract     INTRODUCTION:    DENV-2 is the cause of most dengue epidemics worldwide and is associated with severe cases.        METHODS:    We investigated arboviruses in 164 serum samples collected from patients presenting with clinical symptoms of dengue fever and 152 mosquito pools.        RESULTS:    We detected the Asian II genotype of DENV-2 in humans and mosquitoes. Our results confirmed the circulation of the Asian II genotype in Brazil in addition to the prevalent Asian/American genotype.        CONCLUSIONS:    The detection of Asian II genotype of DENV-2 in mosquito pools collected in a forest park may be related to a spillback event of human dengue virus.    ,
PMC7182600,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\17_29_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Background   Here we genetically and antigenically analyzed influenza B viruses (IBVs) isolated in Japan during the 2017‐2018 and 2018‐2019 influenza seasons.       Methods   A total of 68 IBVs (61 B/Yamagata/16/88‐like [B/Yamagata]‐lineage and 7 B/Victoria/2/87‐like [B/Victoria]‐lineage) were antigenically and genetically characterized by using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and phylogenetic analysis respectively. The susceptibility of IBVs to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors was assessed by using a fluorescence‐based NA inhibition assay.       Results   All 61 B/Yamagata‐lineage isolates were genetically closely related to B/Phuket/3073/2013 the vaccine strain for these two seasons. Eleven B/Yamagata‐lineage isolates tested were antigenically similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013 by the HI test. Seven B/Victoria‐lineage isolates were genetically closely related to B/Texas/02/2013 the WHO‐recommended vaccine strain for the 2017‐2018 season; however they were antigenically distinct from B/Texas/02/2013 with an eightfold or 16‐fold difference in HI titer. Of these 7 isolates 4 possessed a two‐amino‐acid deletion at positions 162 and 163 in hemagglutinin (HA) and the other 3 had a three‐amino‐acid deletion at positions 162‐164 in HA. Importantly the variants with the three‐amino‐acid deletion appeared to be antigenically different from the B/Colorado/06/2017 virus with the two‐amino‐acid deletion the vaccine strain for the 2018‐2019 season with a fourfold or eightfold difference in HI titer. One B/Yamagata‐lineage isolate carrying a G407S mutation in its NA showed a marked reduction in susceptibility to zanamivir peramivir and laninamivir.       Conclusions   These results highlight the need for continued monitoring for the prevalence of the antigenic variant with the three‐amino‐acid deletion and the variant with reduced NA inhibitor susceptibility.    ,
PMC7183126,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\18_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Sub-Saharan Africa carries the greatest burden of HIV-infection with increasing drug resistance burden which requires improved patient management and monitoring. Current WHO recommendations suggest transitioning to dolutegravir-based (adults) or raltegravir-based-regimens (neonates) for initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) and as a suitable alternative in cases of multi-resistance in resource-limited settings. This review aims at synthesizing the current knowledge on dolutegravir use and integrase resistance-associated mutations found before the wide use of dolutegravir-based regimens.       Methods   This systematic review will include randomized and non-randomized trials cohort and cross-sectional studies published on dolutegravir use or integrase resistance-associated mutations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Searches will be conducted (from 2007 onwards) in PubMed Embase Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILAC) Web of Science African Journals Online and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Hand searching of the reference lists of relevant reviews and trials will be conducted and we will also look for conference abstracts. We will include studies of adults and/or children exposed to integrase inhibitors-based therapies; especially dolutegravir or raltegravir (which is our intervention of interest as compared to other antiretroviral regimens). We will exclude studies of patients with specific co-morbidities such as tuberculosis or opportunistic infections. Primary outcomes will be “the rate of viral suppression” and “the level of drug resistance” on integrase inhibitor-based regimens among patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. Secondary outcomes will be “the effect of baseline viremia on viral suppression” “the effect of treatment duration on viral suppression” “the proportion of patients with immune recovery” “the rate of non-adherence” “rate of adverse events;” “drug resistance according to different integrase inhibitor-based regimens” and “drug resistance according to viral subtypes/recombinants.” Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts assess the full texts for eligibility and extract data. If data permits random effects models will be used where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g. age sex baseline viremia CD4 following treatment treatment duration and adherence level).       Discussion   This review will help to strengthen evidence on the effectiveness of integrase strand transfer inhibitors by contributing to current knowledge on the use of dolutegravir and/or raltegravir (especially for neonates) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Results will therefore help in setting-up baseline data for an optimal management of people living with HIV as Sub-Saharan African countries are transitioning to dolutegravir-based regimens. Evidence will also support HIV/AIDS programs in identifying gaps and actions to be undertaken for improved long-term care and treatment of people living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.       Systematic review registration   PROSPERO CRD42019122424    ,
PMC7183472,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\19_22_abstract.xml,      Background and Aim:   Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an alphavirus that causes encephalitis with a high impact on public health in Latin America. However only in Guatemala Trinidad and Tobago and Mexico have found antibodies in VEEV in bats using immunohistochemistry the sensitivity and specificity are improved; thus it is better for demonstrating natural infection in bats as potential hosts. This study aimed to determine the presence of VEEV in tissues of frugivorous bats.       Materials and Methods:   A prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling was carried out in 12 localities of Córdoba and Sucre area of the Colombian Caribbean. Two hundred and eighty-six bats were captured using fog nets and the specimens according to taxonomic keys were classified. According to the Ethics Committee of the University of Córdoba the bats were treated with analgesics and anesthetics. Blood samples were taken and then euthanized to obtain tissues and organs which were preserved in liquid N2 at −196°C. A portion of each organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for the detection of antigens by immunohistochemistry. Several pathological anatomy analyses were performed to determine the histological characteristics of tissue lesions of frugivorous bats naturally infected with the VEEV.       Results:   Of the 286 bats captured 23 species were identified. In samples of the brain spleen and lung of two frugivorous bats (2/286=0.70%)     Artibeus planirostris and     Sturnira lilium the presence of VEEV was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.          Conclusion:   A fragment of the nsP4 non-structural protein gene corresponding to the alphavirus was amplified. Two samples were positive (2/286=0.70%) in frugivorous bats;     A. planirostris (code GenBank: MG820274) and     S. lilium (code GenBank: MG820275). The present study showed the first molecular evidence and cellular evidence (histopathology and immunohistochemistry) of natural VEEV infection in frugivorous bats in Colombia; these bats could be a host of this zoonosis.       ,
PMC7183730,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\20_13_abstract.xml,   The genus    Flavivirus encompasses several worldwide-distributed arthropod-borne viruses including dengue virus Japanese encephalitis virus West Nile virus yellow fever virus Zika virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Infection with these viruses manifest with symptoms ranging from febrile illness to life- threatening hypotensive shock and encephalitis. Therefore flaviviruses pose a great risk to public health. Currently preventive measures are falling short to control epidemics and there are no antivirals against any    Flavivirus.    Flaviviruses carry a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome that plays multiple roles in infected cells: it is translated into viral proteins used as template for genome replication it is the precursor of the subgenomic flaviviral RNA and it is assembled into new virions. Furthermore viral RNA genomes are also packaged into extracellular vesicles e.g. exosomes which represent an alternate mode of virus dissemination.  Because RNA molecules are at the center of    Flavivirus replication cycle viral and host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical determinants of infection. Numerous studies have revealed the function of RBPs during    Flavivirus infection particularly at the level of RNA translation and replication. These proteins however are also critical participants at the late stages of the replication cycle. Here we revise the function of host RBPs and the viral proteins capsid NS2A and NS3 during the packaging of viral RNA and the assembly of new virus particles. Furthermore we go through the evidence pointing towards the importance of host RBPs in mediating cellular RNA export with the idea that the biogenesis of exosomes harboring    Flavivirus RNA would follow an analogous pathway.    ,
PMC7185698,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\21_21_abstract.xml,   Ebola epidemics constitute serious public health emergencies. Multiple vaccines are under development to prevent these epidemics and avoid the associated morbidity and mortality. Assessing the potential impact of these vaccines on morbidity and mortality of Ebola is essential for devising prevention strategies. A mean-field compartmental stochastic model was developed for this purpose and validated by simulating the 2014 Sierra Leone epidemic. We assessed the impacts of prophylactic vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) both alone and in combination with the vaccination of the general population (entire susceptible population other than HCW). The model simulated 8706 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 478–21942) cases and 3575 (95%CI: 179–9031) deaths in Sierra Leone in line with WHO-reported statistics for the 2014 epidemic (8704 cases and 3587 deaths). Relative to this base case the model then estimated that prophylactic vaccination of only 10% of HCW will avert 12% (95% CI: 6%-14%) of overall cases and deaths while vaccination of 30% of HCW will avert 34% of overall cases (95% CI: 30%-64%) and deaths (95% CI: 30%-65%). Prophylactic vaccination of 1% and 5% of the general population in addition to vaccinating 30% of HCW was estimated to result in reduction in cases by 44% (95% CI: 39%-61%) and 72% (95% CI: 68%-84%) respectively and deaths by 45% (95% CI: 40%-61%) and 74% (95% CI: 70%-85%) respectively. Prophylactic vaccination of even small proportions of HCW is estimated to significantly reduce incidence of Ebola and associated mortality. The effect is greatly enhanced by the additional vaccination even of small percentages of the general population. These findings could be used to inform the planning of prevention strategies.  ,
PMC7186774,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\22_15_abstract.xml,      Background   Zika virus (ZIKV) an arbovirus capable of causing neurological abnormalities is a recognised human pathogen for which a vaccine is required. As ZIKV antibodies can mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection a ZIKV vaccine must not only protect against ZIKV but must also not sensitise vaccinees to severe dengue.       Methods   The N-terminal 80% of ZIKV envelope protein (80E) was expressed in     Pichia pastoris and its capacity to self-assemble into particulate structures evaluated using dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Antigenic integrity of the 80E protein was evaluated using ZIKV-specific monoclonal antibodies. Its immunogenicity and protective efficacy were assessed in BALB/c and C57BL/6     Stat2    −/− mice respectively. Its capacity to enhance DENV and ZIKV infection was assessed in AG129 and C57BL/6     Stat2    −/− mice respectively.          Findings   ZIKV-80E protein self-assembled into discrete nanoparticles (NPs) which preserved the antigenic integrity of neutralising epitopes on E domain III (EDIII) and elicited potent ZIKV-neutralising antibodies predominantly against this domain in BALB/c mice.

PMC7187655,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\23_15_abstract.xml,   As the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo illustrates Ebola virus disease continues to pose a significant risk to humankind and this necessitates the continued development of therapeutic options. One option that warrants evaluation is that of defective genomes; these can potentially parasitize resources from the wild-type virus and may even be packaged for repeated co-infection cycles. Deletion and copy-back defective genomes have been identified and reported in the literature. As a crude mixed preparation these were found to have limiting effects on cytopathology. Here we have used synthetic virology to clone and manufacture two deletion defective genomes. These genomes were tested with Ebola virus using    in vitro cell culture and shown to inhibit viral replication; however and against expectations the defective genomes were not released in biologically significant numbers. We propose that EBOV might have yet unknown mechanisms to prevent parasitisation by defective interfering particles beyond the known mechanism that prevents sequential infection of the same cell. Understanding this mechanism would be necessary in any development of a defective interfering particle-based therapy.    ,
PMC7188197,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\24_33_abstract.xml,   The mechanisms underlying virus emergence are rarely well understood making the appearance of outbreaks largely unpredictable. Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants emerged in livestock in northern Europe in 2006 spreading to most European countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of euros. Although the outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010 puzzlingly a closely related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015 triggering a second outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the two outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the second outbreak dates from the height of the first outbreak in 2008. This implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this long period without replication we hypothesise that the second outbreak could have been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008. Our work highlights new targets for pathogen surveillance programmes in livestock and illustrates the power of genomic epidemiology to identify pathways of infectious disease emergence.  ,

HA incidence was assessed between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 and included all symptomatic patients with virologically confirmed HA. Preventive measures consisted in identifying at risk and not immunised patients to propose them a free HAV vaccination and an anonymous survey related to transmission routes of STD and to sexual behaviours. Twenty HA were diagnosed. All were homosexual men recently diagnosed with HIV and another STD. None were vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (HAV). Hospitalisation was required for 52%. We identified 250 patients at risk to acquire HAV and invited them to a free immunisation program. A total of 110 (44%) were vaccinated of whom 74 responded to our survey. A majority of them (84%) reported recent active anal and oral sexuality with multiple (52%) male partners (81%) and ChemSex consumption (14%). Internet was the meeting link for 58%. Another STD history was found in 69%. One third of these individuals had no idea about STD transmission modes. This HA outbreak pointed the insufficient vaccine coverage against HAV and knowledge on STD which may be improved by Internet.  ,

Through subgenomic sequencing of viruses present in residual plasma from an HIV/HCV prevalence study conducted amongst PWID across five cities in India in 2016–2017 a total of N = 498 HCV and N = 755 HIV strains were classified from N = 975 study participants. Considerable HCV diversity was identified with different strains predominating in each region of the country. Overall the most common strain was genotype 3a (39.0%) with genotypes 1a (26.9%) 1b (3.0%) 1c (0.2%) 3b (20.7%) 3i (2.0%) 4a (0.2%) 4d (1.0%) 6 (1.8%) 6n (4.8%) 6 v (0.2%) and one unclassifiable recombinant specimen (0.2%) also identified. The majority of the HIV specimens were subtype C (96.7%) although subtype A (0.4%) CRF01_AE (0.4%) and unique recombinant forms (URFs 2.5%) were also detected. Notably the geographical restriction of HIV subtype A and CRF01_AE and HCV genotypes 4 and 6 to specific sites suggests distinct novel introductions of HIV and HCV into PWID populations potentially via drug trafficking routes from neighboring countries where these strains are common.  ,
PMC7190837,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\28_13_abstract.xml,   Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) control is mainly based on wide vaccine administration. Although effective its efficacy is not absolute the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects cannot be denied. Despite this the determinants of IBV epidemiology and the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and poorly investigated. In the present study 361 IBV QX (the most relevant field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016 from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of different environmental climatic and social factors on its spreading patterns. Moreover two structured coalescent models were considered in order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third “ghost” deme representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading since the strains sampled from the two companies formed two essentially-independent clades. Remarkably the only exceptions were represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into one of the major poultry companies whose farms are mainly located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV geographic spreading was investigated no factor seems to contribute to IBV dispersal velocity being poultry population density the only exception. Finally the different viral population pattern observed in the two companies over the same time period supports the pivotal role of management and control strategies on IBV epidemiology. Overall the present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action rather than environmental factors highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale.  ,
PMC7190985,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\29_15_abstract.xml,   Orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) are an increasing threat to human health due to the growing population of OPXV-naive individuals after the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination. Antiviral drugs that are effective as postexposure treatments against variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) or other OPXVs are critical in the event of an OPXV outbreak or exposure. The only US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat smallpox Tecovirimat (ST-246) exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting extracellular virus (EV) formation thereby preventing cell–cell and long-distance spread. We and others have previously demonstrated that host Golgi-associated retrograde proteins play an important role in monkeypox virus (MPXV) and vaccinia virus (VACV) EV formation. Inhibition of the retrograde pathway by small molecules such as Retro-2 has been shown to decrease VACV infection    in vitro and to a lesser extent    in vivo. To identify more potent inhibitors of the retrograde pathway we screened a large panel of compounds containing a benzodiazepine scaffold like that of Retro-1 against VACV infection. We found that a subset of these compounds displayed better anti-VACV activity causing a reduction in EV particle formation and viral spread compared to Retro-1. PA104 emerged as the most potent analog inhibiting 90% viral spread at 1.3 μM with a high selectivity index. In addition PA104 strongly inhibited two distinct ST-246-resistant viruses demonstrating its potential benefit for use in combination therapy with ST-246. These data and further characterizations of the specific protein targets and    in vivo efficacy of PA104 may have important implications for the design of effective antivirals against OPXV.    ,
PMC7192419,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\30_28_abstract.xml,   Human adenovirus (HAdV-7) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes severe respiratory illnesses. However the epidemic patterns and genetic variability of HAdV-7 circulating in mainland China have not been well elucidated. In this study we used Chinese HAdV sentinel surveillance data obtained from 2012–2015 to investigate the clinical features of 122 HAdV-7-positive cases and performed amplification and sequence determination of three capsid genes (penton base hexon and fiber) from 69 isolated viruses covering from seven provinces of China. Additionally we compared with data from representative sequences of 21 strains covering seven more provinces in China and 32 international HAdV-7 strains obtained from GenBank database to determine the phylogenetic sequence variations and molecular evolution of HAdV-7. The results indicated that HAdV-7 infection occurred throughout the year and a high proportion of severe cases (27 cases 22.1%) exhibited infantile pneumonia. Moreover phylogenetic analysis showed that all HAdV-7 strains could be divided into two major evolutionary branches including subtype 1 and subtype 2 and subtype 3 was also formed according to analysis of the penton base gene. Subtypes 1 and 2 co-circulated in China before 2008 and HAdV-7 strains currently circulating in China belonged to subtype 2 which was also the predominant strain circulating worldwide in recent years. Further sequence variation analysis indicated that three genes of HAdV-7 were relatively stable across time and geographic space particularly for viruses within subtypes which shared almost the same variation sites. Owing to continuous outbreaks caused by HAdV-7 resulting in increased illness severity and fatality rates in China the establishment of a national HAdV surveillance system is urgently needed for the development of effective preventive and infection-control interventions for adenovirus respiratory infections in China.  ,

However its active components and mode of action remain mostly unknown. In the present study erucic acid was isolated from    Isatis indigotica Fort. and subsequently its underlying mechanism against influenza A virus (IAV) infection was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that erucic acid exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity against IAV resulting from reduction of viral polymerase transcription activity. Erucic acid was found to exert inhibitory effects on IAV or viral (v) RNA-induced pro-inflammatory mediators as well as interferons (IFNs). The molecular mechanism by which erucic acid with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties was attributed to inactivation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling. Furthermore the NF-κB and p38 MAPK inhibitory effect of erucic acid led to diminishing the transcriptional activity of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3) and thereby reducing IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response amplification in IFN-β-sensitized cells. Additionally IAV- or vRNA-triggered apoptosis of alveolar epithelial A549 cells was prevented by erucic acid. In vivo erucic acid administration consistently displayed decreased lung viral load and viral antigens expression. Meanwhile erucic acid markedly reduced CD8   + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recruitment pro-apoptotic signaling hyperactivity of multiple signaling pathways and exacerbated immune inflammation in the lung which resulted in decreased lung injury and mortality in mice with a mouse-adapted A/FM/1/47-MA(H1N1) strain infection. Our findings provided a mechanistic basis for the action of erucic acid against IAV-mediated inflammation and injury suggesting that erucic acid may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of influenza.    ,

PMC7198842,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\34_13_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya disease (CHIKD) is a viral infection caused by an alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and triggers large outbreaks leading to epidemics. Despite the low mortality rate it is a major public health concern owing to high morbidity in affected individuals. The complete spectrum of this disease can be divided into four phases based on its clinical presentation and immunopathology. When a susceptible individual is bitten by an infected mosquito the bite triggers inflammatory responses attracting neutrophils and initiating a cascade of events resulting in the entry of the virus into permissive cells. This phase is termed the pre-acute or the intrinsic incubation phase. The virus utilizes the cellular components of the innate immune system to enter into circulation and reach primary sites of infection such as the lymph nodes spleen and liver. Also at this point antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present the viral antigens to the T cells thereby activating and initiating adaptive immune responses. This phase is marked by the exhibition of clinical symptoms such as fever rashes arthralgia and myalgia and is termed the acute phase of the disease. Viremia reaches its peak during this phase thereby enhancing the antigen-specific host immune response. Simultaneously T cell-mediated activation of B cells leads to the formation of CHIKV specific antibodies. Increase in titres of neutralizing IgG/IgM antibodies results in the clearance of virus from the bloodstream and marks the initiation of the post-acute phase. Immune responses mounted during this phase of the infection determine the degree of disease progression or its resolution. Some patients may progress to a chronic arthritic phase of the disease that may last from a few months to several years owing to a compromised disease resolution. The present review discusses the immunopathology of CHIKD and the factors that dictate disease progression and its resolution.  ,
PMC7199921,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\35_22_abstract.xml,   SUMMARY  The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics highlight the explosive nature of arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses transmitted by    Aedes spp. mosquitoes       1    2   . Vector competence and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) are two key entomological parameters used to assess the public health risk posed by arboviruses       3   . These are typically measured empirically by offering mosquitoes an infectious bloodmeal and temporally sampling mosquitoes to determine infection and transmission status. This approach has been used for the better part of a century; however it does not accurately capture the biology and behavior of many mosquito vectors which refeed frequently (every 2–3 days)       4   . Here we demonstrate that acquisition of a second non-infectious bloodmeal significantly shortens the EIP of ZIKV-infected    Ae. aegypti by enhancing virus dissemination from the mosquito midgut. Similarly a second bloodmeal increases the competence of this species for dengue virus and CHIKV as well as    Ae. albopictus for ZIKV suggesting that this phenomenon may be common among other virus-vector pairings and that    Ae. albopictus might be a more important vector than once thought. Bloodmeal-induced microperforations in the virus-impenetrable basal lamina which surrounds the midgut provide a mechanism for enhanced virus escape. Modeling of these findings reveals that a shortened EIP would result in a significant increase in the basic reproductive number R0 estimated from experimental data. This helps explain how    Ae. aegypti can sustain explosive epidemics like ZIKV despite relatively poor vector competence in single-feed laboratory trials. Together these data demonstrate a direct and unrecognized link between mosquito feeding behavior EIP and vector competence.    ,

Treatment options are limited to supportive care and the broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin. However evidence for ribavirin efficacy in patients with LF is poor and pharmacokinetic (PK) data are not available.   Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) developed an intravenous ribavirin regimen different to the WHO recommendation. Apart from a lower total daily dose the drug is usually administered once per day which reduces the exposure of personnel to patients with LF. The aim of this study is to characterise the PK of the Irrua ribavirin regimen.       Methods and analysis   This prospective observational clinical study will assess PK properties of the Irrua ribavirin regimen on routinely ribavirin-treated patients with LF at ISTH a referral hospital serving 19 local governmental areas in a LF endemic zone in Nigeria. Participants will be adults with PCR-confirmed LF. The primary objective is to describe classical PK parameters for ribavirin (maximum plasma drug concentration time to maximum plasma drug concentration area under the plasma drug concentration vs time curve half-life time T1/2 volume of distribution). Blood samples will be collected at 0.5 1 3 5 8 12 and 24 hours after doses on day 1 day 4 and day 10 of ribavirin treatment. Ribavirin plasma concentrations will be determined using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.       Ethics and dissemination   The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol the Declaration of Helsinki Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Nigerian National Code for Health Research Ethics. The protocol has received approval by the Health Research Ethics Committee of ISTH. Results will be made available to LF survivors their caregivers the funders LF research society and other researchers.       Registration details   ISRCTN11104750    ,
PMC7201406,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\37_23_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Background   Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality among children worldwide commonly through acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI). To assess the incidence rate of symptomatic RSV illness among young children we conducted a prospective birth cohort study following children from 0–2 years of age in Managua Nicaragua.       Methods   Children meeting the testing criteria (fever history of fever or severe respiratory symptoms [apnea stridor nasal flaring wheezing chest indrawing and/or central cyanosis]) were tested for RSV infections using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. An acute lower respiratory infection was defined as a diagnosis of pneumonia bronchiolitis bronchitis or bronchial hyperreactivity. The incidence rate was calculated and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a Poisson distribution.       Results   A total of 833 children participated in the cohort: 289 (34.7%) had at least 1 episode of laboratory-confirmed RSV and 156 (18.7%) of had an episode of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI). The incidence rate of symptomatic RSV was 248.1 cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 223.2–275.7). While infants aged 6–11 months had the highest incidence of symptomatic RSV (361.3/1000 person-years 95% CI 304.4–428.8) infants &lt;3 months had the highest incidence of severe RSV (RSV-associated hospitalizations and/or severe ALRI). RSV was also associated with 25.0–37.5% of deaths from medical causes (n = 8).       Conclusions   A substantial burden of RSV exists among children aged &lt;2 years in Nicaraguan communities. RSV was also a leading cause of infant mortality among study participants. The development and implementation of effective RSV prevention and treatment measures represent an opportunity to substantially reduce severe illness and death among children worldwide.    ,

PMC7202302,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\39_23_abstract.xml,   Abstract              Viruses such as dengue Zika yellow fever and chikungunya depend on mosquitoes for transmission. Their epidemics typically present periodic patterns linked to the underlying mosquito population dynamics which are known to be driven by natural climate fluctuations. Understanding how climate dictates the timing and potential of viral transmission is essential for preparedness of public health systems and design of control strategies. While various alternative approaches have been proposed to estimate local transmission potential of such viruses few open‐source ready to use and freely available software tools exist.             We developed the       Mosquito‐borne       Viral       Suitability       Estimator (      MVSE) software package for the R programming environment.       MVSE estimates the index P a novel suitability index based on a climate‐driven mathematical expression for the basic reproductive number of mosquito‐borne viruses. By accounting for local humidity and temperature as well as viral vector and human priors the index P can be estimated for specific host and viral species in different regions of the globe.                  We describe the background theory empirical support and biological interpretation of the index P. Using real‐world examples spanning multiple epidemiological contexts we further demonstrate       MVSE's basic functionality research and educational potentials.                ,
PMC7202625,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\40_20_abstract.xml,   Access to the influenza vaccine pose little barriers in developed countries such as Singapore and vaccination against influenza is highly recommended for at-risk populations including older adults. However vaccination rates are much lower than recommended despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the disease among this vulnerable population. Given timely goals to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake we explored Singaporean older adults’ misperceptions about influenza disease and vaccine. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted among 76 Singaporean adults aged 65 and above with no focus on a specific area in Singapore. Data were analyzed with grounded theory methods to understand participants’ attitudes perceptions and knowledge. We developed    in vivo codes that reflect the verbiage used by participants and exhaustively catalogued themes through a constant comparison coding method. Focusing specifically on older adults’ misperceptions seven main themes about influenza disease or vaccine emerged from our data analysis:    familiarity with influenza    misperceptions about influenza    personal susceptibility to influenza    familiarity with the influenza vaccine    misperceptions about the influenza vaccine    misperceptions about influenza vaccine usage and    opinions about and barriers to influenza vaccine uptake. Notably there is a lack of adequate knowledge and motivation in vaccinating against influenza among older adults in Singapore. Health communication needs to be more tailored toward older adults’ message processing systems and engage health professionals’ involvement in addressing the influenza disease and vaccine misperceptions identified in this study.    ,
PMC7203554,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\41_17_abstract.xml,   Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human respiratory pathogen causing annual epidemics as well as periodic pandemics. A complete understanding of the virus pathogenesis and host factors involved in the viral lifecycle is crucial for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant membrane sphingolipid. It preferentially associates with cholesterol to form distinct domains named lipid rafts. Sphingomyelinases including acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane SM and consequently transform lipid rafts into ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. In this study we investigated the effect of SM hydrolysis on IAV propagation. Depleting plasma membrane SM by exogenous bacterial SMase (bSMase) impaired virus infection and reduced virus entry whereas exogenous SM enhanced infection. Moreover the depletion of virus envelope SM also reduced virus infectivity and impaired its attachment and internalization. Nonetheless inhibition of ASMase by desipramine did not affect IAV infection. Similarly virus replication was not impaired in Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPA) cells which lack functional ASMase. IAV infection in A549 cells was associated with suppression of ASMase activity starting at 6 h post-infection. Our data reveals that intact cellular and viral envelope SM is required for efficient IAV infection. Therefore SM metabolism can be a potential target for therapeutic intervention against influenza virus infection.  ,

This study investigated representations of the Ebola virus/disease in South African news reports (March 2014–June 2015). Four discourses were found to operate within the globalised social context: threat to humanity predation invasion and conspiracy. The South African reportage framed Ebola as a predator and criminal rather than using stock warfare imagery. Representations indicated alignment with phobic high-income countries and colonial hegemony.  ,
PMC7207162,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\43_20_abstract.xml,   Abstract  The current seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine protects only against a narrow range of virus strains as it triggers a dominant antibody response toward the hypervariable hemagglutinin (   HA) head region. The discovery of rare broadly protective antibodies against conserved regions in influenza virus proteins has propelled research on distinct antigens and delivery methods to efficiently induce broad immunity toward drifted or shifted virus strains. Here we report that adeno‐associated virus (   AAV) vectors expressing influenza virus    HA or chimeric    HA protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenges. Unexpectedly immunization even with wild‐type    HA induced antibodies recognizing the    HA‐stalk and activating FcγR‐dependent responses indicating that    AAV‐vectored expression balances    HA head‐ and    HA stalk‐specific humoral responses. Immunization with    AAV‐   HA partially protected also ferrets against a harsh virus challenge. Results from this study provide a rationale for further clinical development of    AAV vectors as influenza vaccine platform which could benefit from their approved use in human gene therapy.    ,

PMC7210265,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\45_13_abstract.xml,   Many emerging arboviruses of global public health importance such as dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) originated in sylvatic transmission cycles involving wild animals and forest-dwelling mosquitoes. Arbovirus emergence in the human population typically results from spillover transmission via bridge vectors which are competent mosquitoes feeding on both humans and wild animals. Another related but less studied concern is the risk of ‘spillback’ transmission from humans into novel sylvatic cycles. We colonized a sylvatic population of    Aedes malayensis from a forested area of the Nakai district in Laos to evaluate its potential as an arbovirus bridge vector. We found that this    Ae. malayensis population was overall less competent for DENV and YFV than an urban population of    Aedes aegypti. Olfactometer experiments showed that our    Ae. malayensis colony did not display any detectable attraction to human scent in laboratory conditions. The relatively modest vector competence for DENV and YFV combined with a lack of detectable attraction to human odor indicate a low potential for this sylvatic    Ae. malayensis population to act as an arbovirus bridge vector. However we caution that opportunistic blood feeding on humans by sylvatic    Ae. malayensis may occasionally contribute to bridge sylvatic and human transmission cycles.    ,

B19V DNA and specific IgG were tested in minimum study samples of donors attending a blood bank at Córdoba Argentina in 2014. Anti-B19V IgM and viral loads were determined in B19V-positive plasma samples. Seven of 731 samples (0.96%) resulted positive corresponding to individuals aged 32–53 years four of them repeat donnors and three first-time donors. Viral loads were &lt;10   3 IU/mL. None had IgM and 6/7 had IgG one of them at a high level (in the range of 100–200 IU/ml and the remaining 5 at low to medium level 5–50 IU/ml). Thus one case was classified as acute infection (DNA+/IgM-/IgG-) and six as potentially persistent infections (DNA+/IgM-/IgG+). No coinfections with other pathogens of mandatory control in the pre-transfusion screening were detected. Prevalence of IgG was 77.9% (279/358). This study provides the first data of B19V prevalence in blood donors in Argentina demonstrating high rates of acute and persistent B19V infections and high prevalence of anti-B19V IgG in a post-epidemic period. Further research is needed to elucidate mechanisms/factors for B19V persistence as well as follow-up of recipients in the context of haemo-surveillance programs contributing to the knowledge of B19V and blood transfusion safety.    ,

The field has advanced dramatically over the past 40 years driven in part by major advances in isolation and manufacturing technologies that have brought these important biologics to the forefront of modern medicine. However the global uptake of monoclonal antibody (mAb) biologics is impeded by biophysical and biochemical liabilities production limitations the need for cold-chain storage and transport as well as high costs of manufacturing and distribution. Some of these hurdles may be overcome through transient in vivo gene delivery platforms such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors that are engineered to encode optimized mAb genes. These approaches turn the body into a biological factory for antibody production eliminating many of the steps involved in bioprocesses and providing several other significant advantages and differ from traditional gene therapy (permanent delivery) approaches. In this review we focus on nucleic acid delivery of antibody employing synthetic plasmid DNA vector platforms and RNA delivery these being important approaches that are advancing simple rapid in vivo expression and having an impact in animal models of infectious diseases and cancer among others.  ,
PMC7211399,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\49_21_abstract.xml,   Abstract  In April 2019 a suspect cluster of enterovirus cases was reported in a neonatology department in Guangdong China resulting in five deaths. We aimed to investigate the pathogen profiles in fatal cases the circulation and transmission pattern of the viruses by combining metatranscriptomic phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses. Metatranscriptomic sequencing was used to characterize the enteroviruses. Clinical and environmental surveillance in the local population was performed to understand the prevalence and genetic diversity of the viruses in the local population. The possible source(s) evolution transmission and recombination of the viruses were investigated by incorporating genomes from the current outbreak from local retrospective surveillance and from public databases. Metatranscriptomic analysis identified Echovirus 11 (E11) in three fatal cases. Seroprevalence of neutralization antibody to E11 was 35 to 44 per cent in 3–15 age groups of general population and the viruses were associated with various clinical symptoms. From the viral phylogeny nosocomial transmissions were identified and all E11 2019 outbreak strains were closely related with E11 strains circulating in local population 2017–19. Frequent recombination occurred among the 2019 Guangdong E11 outbreak strains and various genotypes in enterovirus B species. This study provides an example of combining advanced genetic technology and epidemiological surveillance in pathogen diagnosis source(s) and transmission tracing during an infectious disease outbreak. The result highlights the hidden E11 circulation and the risk of viral transmission and infection in the young age population in China. Frequent recombination between Guangdong-like strains and other enterovirus genotypes also implies the prevalence of these emerging E11 strains.  ,
PMC7212620,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\50_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Humans are the primary hosts of dengue viruses (DENV). However sylvatic cycles of transmission can occur among non-human primates and human encroachment into forested regions can be a source of emergence of new strains such as the highly divergent and sylvatic strain of DENV2 QML22 recovered from a dengue fever patient returning to Australia from Borneo. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the vector competence of Australian     Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for this virus.          Methods   Four- to five-day-old mosquitoes from two strains of     Ae. aegypti from Queensland Australia were fed a meal of sheep blood containing 10    8 50% cell culture infectious dose per ml (CCID    50/ml) of either QML22 or an epidemic strain of DENV serotype 2 (QML16) isolated from a dengue fever patient in Australia in 2015. Mosquitoes were maintained at 28 °C 75% relative humidity and sampled 7 10 and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Live virions in mosquito bodies (abdomen/thorax) legs and wings and saliva expectorates from individual mosquitoes were quantified using a cell culture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CCELISA) to determine infection dissemination and transmission rates.          Results   The infection and dissemination rates of the sylvatic DENV2 strain QML22 were significantly lower than that for QML16. While the titres of virus in the bodies of mosquitoes infected with either of these viruses were similar titres in legs and wings were significantly lower in mosquitoes infected with QML22 at most time points although they reached similar levels by 14 dpi. QML16 was detected in 16% (    n = 25) and 28% (    n = 25) of saliva expectorates at 10 and 14 dpi respectively. In contrast no virus was detected in the saliva expectorates of QML22 infected mosquitoes.          Conclusions   Australia urban/peri-urban     Ae. aegypti species are susceptible to infection by the sylvatic and highly divergent DENV 2 QML22 but replication of QML22 is attenuated relative to the contemporary strain QML16. A salivary gland infection or escape barrier may be acting to prevent infection of saliva and would prevent onward transmission of this highly divergent virus in Australia.           ,
PMC7213748,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\51_24_abstract.xml,      Background   Between January 2015 and August 2016 two epidemic waves of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease swept the Northeastern (NE) region of Brazil. As a result two waves of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) were observed concurrently. The mandatory reporting of ZIKV disease began region-wide in February 2016 and it is believed that ZIKV cases were significantly under-reported before that. The changing reporting rate has made it difficult to estimate the ZIKV infection attack rate and studies in the literature vary widely from 17% to &gt; 50%. The same applies to other key epidemiological parameters. In contrast the diagnosis and reporting of GBS cases were reasonably reliable given the severity and easy recognition of the disease symptoms. In this paper we aim to estimate the real number of ZIKV cases (i.e. the infection attack rate) and their dynamics in time by scaling up from GBS surveillance data in NE Brazil.       Methodology   A mathematical compartmental model is constructed that makes it possible to infer the true epidemic dynamics of ZIKV cases based on surveillance data of excess GBS cases. The model includes the possibility that asymptomatic ZIKV cases are infectious. The model is fitted to the GBS surveillance data and the key epidemiological parameters are inferred by using a plug-and-play likelihood-based estimation. We make use of regional weather data to determine possible climate-driven impacts on the reproductive number                                     R        0                       and to infer the true ZIKV epidemic dynamics.          Findings and conclusions   The GBS surveillance data can be used to study ZIKV epidemics and may be appropriate when ZIKV reporting rates are not well understood. The overall infection attack rate (IAR) of ZIKV is estimated to be 24.1% (95% confidence interval: 17.1%—29.3%) of the population. By examining various asymptomatic scenarios the IAR is likely to be lower than 33% over the two ZIKV waves. The risk rate from symptomatic ZIKV infection to develop GBS was estimated as     ρ = 0.0061% (95% CI: 0.0050%—0.0086%) which is significantly less than current estimates. We found a positive association between local temperature and the basic reproduction number                                     R        0                      . Our analysis revealed that asymptomatic infections affect the estimation of ZIKV epidemics and need to also be carefully considered in related modelling studies. According to the estimated effective reproduction number and population wide susceptibility we comment that a ZIKV outbreak would be unlikely in NE Brazil in the near future.       ,
PMC7213748,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\52_25_abstract.xml,   Author summary  The mandatory reporting of the Zika virus (ZIKV) disease began region-wide in February 2016 and it is believed that ZIKV cases could have been highly under-reported before that. Given the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is relatively well reported the GBS surveillance data has the potential to act as a reasonably reliable proxy for inferring the true ZIKV epidemics. We developed a mathematical model incorporating weather effects to study the ZIKV-GBS epidemics and estimated the key epidemiological parameters. It was found that the attack rate of ZIKV was likely to be lower than 33% over the two epidemic waves. The risk rate from symptomatic ZIKV case to develop GBS was estimated to be approximately 0.0061%. The analysis suggests that it would be difficult for another ZIKV outbreak to appear in Northeastern Brazil in the near future.  ,
PMC7215950,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\53_26_abstract.xml,   Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic coronavirus that has a tendency to cause significant healthcare outbreaks among patients with serious comorbidities. We analyzed hospital data from the MERS-CoV outbreak in King Abdulaziz Medical Center Riyadh Saudi Arabia June–August 2015 using the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) ward transmission model. The SEIR compartmental model considers several areas within the hospital where transmission occurred. We use a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the following units: emergency department (ED) out-patient clinic intensive care unit and hospital wards where each area has its own carrying capacity and distinguishes the transmission by three individuals in the hospital: patients health care workers (HCW) or mobile health care workers. The emergency department as parameterized has a large influence over the epidemic size for both patients and health care workers. Trend of the basic reproduction number (R   0) which reached a maximum of 1.39 at the peak of the epidemic and declined to 0.92 towards the end shows that until added hospital controls are introduced the outbreak would continue with sustained transmission between wards. Transmission rates where highest in the ED and mobile HCWs were responsible for large part of the outbreak.     ,
PMC7216417,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\54_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Between 2016 and 2019 265 cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection were reported in Vietnam predominantly in southern Vietnam. In 2016 a case of ZIKV-associated microcephaly was confirmed in the Central Highlands and several members of the infant’s family were confirmed to be infected with ZIKV. The study aims to determine the level of immunity to ZIKV in the general population of the ZIKV epidemic region.       Methods   A total of 879 serum samples were collected from 801 participants between January 2017 and July 2018 during and after the ZIKV epidemic in Vietnam. The samples were tested for anti-ZIKV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) and anti-dengue virus (DENV) IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for ZIKV was performed on all samples and for DENV on the samples that ZIKV neutralizing antibody positive.       Results   A total of 83 (10.3%) participants had anti-ZIKV IgM. Of the 83 6 were confirmed to be ZIKV antibodies positive using PRNT and anti-ZIKV IgG ELISA. Of the 718 participants who were anti-ZIKV IgM negative a further 3 cases were confirmed as positive for antibodies against ZIKV. Of the 9 participants with ZIKV infection 5 lived in the same village as the infant with ZIKV-associated microcephaly and the other 4 lived in 2 neighboring communes. Repeat samples were collected from the 83 ZIKV IgM positive participants 1.5 years after the first collection. No new cases of ZIKV infection were detected. In addition 2 of 3 participants with anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG demonstrated a 4- to 8-fold increase in ZIKV neutralizing antibody titer.       Conclusions   ZIKV was present in the area around Krong Buk with the rate of ZIKV-specific antibodies was 1.1% in the community since at least 2016. While the low levels of circulation together with low seroprevalence suggests a limited outbreak in the region the results also reflect on low levels of protective immunity to Zika within the population. These results provide a better understanding of the current ZIKV epidemic status in the region and demonstrate a need for implementation of more effective ZIKV infection control measures.    ,
PMC7216668,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\55_13_abstract.xml,      Background   In addition to causing the pandemic influenza outbreaks of 1918 and 2009 subtype H1N1 influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused seasonal epidemics since 1977. Antigenic property of influenza viruses are determined by both protein sequence and     N-linked glycosylation of influenza glycoproteins especially hemagglutinin (HA). The currently available computational methods are only considered features in protein sequence but not     N-linked glycosylation.          Results   A multi-task learning sparse group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (MTL-SGL) regression method was developed and applied to derive two types of predominant features including protein sequence and     N-linked glycosylation in hemagglutinin (HA) affecting variations in serologic data for human and swine H1N1 IAVs. Results suggested that mutations and changes in     N-linked glycosylation sites are associated with the rise of antigenic variants of H1N1 IAVs. Furthermore the implicated mutations are predominantly located at five reported antibody-binding sites and within or close to the HA receptor binding site. All of the three     N-linked glycosylation sites (i.e. sequons NCSV at HA 54 NHTV at HA 125 and NLSK at HA 160) identified by MTL-SGL to determine antigenic changes were experimentally validated in the H1N1 antigenic variants using mass spectrometry analyses. Compared with conventional sparse learning methods MTL-SGL achieved a lower prediction error and higher accuracy indicating that grouped features and MTL in the MTL-SGL method are not only able to handle serologic data generated from multiple reagents supplies and protocols but also perform better in genetic sequence-based antigenic quantification.          Conclusions   In summary the results of this study suggest that mutations and variations in     N-glycosylation in HA caused antigenic variations in H1N1 IAVs and that the sequence-based antigenicity predictive model will be useful in understanding antigenic evolution of IAVs.       ,
PMC7218330,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\56_13_abstract.xml,   Food-borne disease is a widespread and escalating public health problem globally. About a quarter of the microorganisms isolated from cockroaches are food-borne pathogens including    Escherichia coli O157:H7    Staphylococcus aureus Bacillus cereus Shigella dysenteriae Salmonella enterica subsp.    enterica serovar Typhi    Rotavirus Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptosporidium parvum. Thus cockroaches could be an important reservoir and mechanical vector of food-borne pathogens. Generally the role of cockroaches in human infections is poorly understood and has been an issue of debate for several years. This article aims to elucidate the possible role of cockroaches in food-borne infections by reviewing the relevant research publications.    ,
PMC7219742,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\57_24_abstract.xml,      Background   The French overseas Territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands has been affected by several dengue epidemics.     Aedes polynesiensis is the main mosquito vector described in this territory. Other     Aedes species have been reported but recent entomological data are missing to infer the presence of other potential arbovirus vectors and to assess the entomological risk factors for transmission of arboviral diseases.          Methodology/ Principal findings   An entomological prospective study was conducted on the three main islands of the territory to determine the presence and distribution of     Aedes spp. Larvae pupae and adult mosquitoes were collected from 54 sampling points in different environments with a final sampling of 3747 immature stages and 606 adults. The main identified breeding sites were described.     Ae.     polynesiensis was found in every sampled site in peridomestic and wild habitats.     Ae.     aegypti was only found on the island of Wallis in peridomestic environments with a limited distribution. Two other     Aedes species endemic to the Pacific were recorded     Aedes oceanicus and     Aedes futunae. To evaluate the ability of local     Ae.     polynesiensis to transmit the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) two field populations were analyzed for vector competence using experimental oral exposure of females to CHIKV and infection dissemination and transmission assays. Results showed that both populations of     Ae.     polynesiensis were competent for CHIKV (30% at 7 days post-infection).          Conclusions/Significance   This study showed the ubiquitous distribution and abundance of     Ae.     polynesiensis on the three islands and demonstrated that local populations were able to transmit CHIKV. Combined with the presence and expansion of     Ae.     aegypti on the main island of Wallis these data highlight the risk of transmission of arboviral diseases in the territory of Wallis and Futuna and provide relevant information for entomological surveillance and vector control programs.       ,
PMC7219742,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\58_25_abstract.xml,   Author summary  The French overseas Territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands located in the South Pacific has been affected by several dengue epidemics but did not face Zika or chikungunya outbreaks unlike other neighboring islands. The near-exclusive presence of the    Aedes polynesiensis mosquito in the islands of Wallis and Futuna confirmed the role played by this mosquito as a vector of dengue fever. A local    Ae.    polynesiensis population was recently shown to be able to transmit the Zika virus under experimental conditions but its susceptibility to the chikungunya virus was still unknown and recent data on the presence of other potential arbovirus vectors were missing. Therefore we investigated the entomological risk factors for the transmission of arboviral diseases in the Wallis and Futuna Islands. We reported the occurrence and distribution of different    Aedes species especially the abundant presence of    Ae.    polynesiensis across the territory and the spread of    Ae.    aegypti in the island of Wallis. Our results demonstrated the ability of local    Ae.    polynesiensis populations to transmit the chikungunya virus. These findings highlight the risk of arbovirus transmission in the Wallis and Futuna Islands and provide relevant data to guide prevention and vector control strategies in the territory.    ,
PMC7220504,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\59_24_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Hemodialysis (HD) patients had a high rate of infection transmission and mortality during the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Saudi Arabia. A standardized guideline on isolation technique for exposed HD patients is not available. Thus this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different isolation strategies on the prevention of secondary viral transmission and clinical outcomes among exposed HD patients.  During the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea 116 patients in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and underwent different types of isolation which were as follows: single-room isolation (n = 54 47%) cohort isolation (n = 46 40%) and self-imposed quarantine (n = 16 13%). The primary outcome was rate of secondary viral transmission. The secondary outcome measures were changes in clinical and biochemical markers during the isolation period difference in clinical and biochemical markers according to the types of isolation practice and effect of isolation practice on patient survival.  During a mean isolation period of 15 days no further cases of secondary transmission were detected among HD patients. Plasma hemoglobin serum calcium and serum albumin levels and single-pool Kt/V decreased during the isolation period but normalized thereafter. Patients who were subjected to self-imposed quarantine had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure lower total cholesterol level and lower Kt/V than those who underwent single-room or cohort isolation. During the 24-month follow-up period 12 patients died. However none of the deaths occurred during the isolation period and no differences were observed in patient survival rate according to different isolation strategies.  Although 116 participants in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak in Korea strict patient surveillance and proper isolation practice prevented secondary transmission of the virus. Thus a renal disaster protocol which includes proper contact surveillance and isolation practice must be established in the future to accommodate the needs of HD patients during disasters or outbreaks.  ,
PMC7225641,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\60_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Solomon Islands a country made up of tropical islands has suffered cyclic dengue fever (DF) outbreaks in the past three decades. An outbreak of dengue-like illness (DLI) that occurred in April 2016 prompted this study which aimed to determine the population’s immunity status and identify the arboviruses circulating in the country.       Methods   A household survey involving 188 participants in two urban areas (Honiara and Gizo) and a parallel hospital-based clinical survey were conducted in April 2016. The latter was repeated in December after a surge in DLI cases. Arbovirus IgG ELISA were performed on the household blood samples to determine the prevalence of arboviruses in the community while qPCR testing of the clinical samples was used to identify the circulating arboviruses. Dengue virus (DENV)-positive samples were further characterized by amplifying and sequencing the envelope gene.       Results   The overall prevalence rates of DENV Zika virus and chikungunya virus were 83.4% 7.6% and 0.9% respectively. The qPCR positivity rates of the clinical samples collected in April 2016 were as follows: DENV 39.6% Zika virus 16.7% and chikungunya virus 6.3% which increased to 74% 48% and 20% respectively in December 2016. The displacement of the circulating serotype-3 genotype-1 with DENV serotype 2 genotype cosmopolitan was responsible for the outbreak in 2016.       Conclusions   A DENV outbreak in Solomon Islands was caused by the introduction of a single serotype. The high prevalence of DENV provided transient cross-protection which prevented the introduction of a new serotype from the hyperendemic region for at least 3 years. The severe outcomes seen in the recent outbreak probably resulted from changes in the causative viruses and the effects of population immunity and changes in the outbreak pattern. Solomon Islands needs to step up surveillance to include molecular tools increase regional communication and perform timely interventions.    ,
PMC7226564,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\61_16_abstract.xml,   Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of chronic autoinflammatory diseases including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Although the molecular mechanisms governing the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal inflammation are not completely clear the main factors are presumed to be genetic predisposition environmental exposure and the intestinal microbiome. Hitherto most of the studies focusing on the role of the microbiome studied the action and effect of bacteria. However the intestinal microbiome comprises other members of the microbial community as well namely fungi protozoa and viruses. We believe that bacteriophages are among the main orchestrators of the effect of microbiota on the gut mucosa. Therefore this review aims to summarize the knowledge of the role of intestinal phageome in IBD and to discuss the concept of phage therapy and its future applications.  ,
PMC7226716,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\62_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Dengue is endemic in over 100 countries and is an important public health problem worldwide. Dengue fever is not endemic in Taiwan; the importation of dengue viruses from neighboring countries via close commercial links and air travel is considered to be the cause of local outbreaks. Therefore efforts toward disease control have focused on preventing the importation of dengue into Taiwan. In this study we investigated the relationships between the numbers of imported and indigenous dengue cases to test the validity of this strategy.       Methods   Data on cases of dengue fever that occurred between 2013 and 2018 were obtained from the surveillance systems of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Kaohsiung City Health Department. Standard epidemiological data including the monthly numbers of indigenous and imported cases of dengue were calculated. Potential associations between the numbers of indigenous and imported cases were investigated using correlation analyses.       Results   We identified a possible relationship between the period of disease concealment and the number of imported dengue cases which resulted in epidemics of indigenous dengue fever within local communities. Further analysis of confirmed cases during previous epidemics in Kaohsiung City found that the risk of indigenous dengue fever may be related to the likelihood that patients with imported dengue fever will stay within local communities.       Conclusion   Given the correlations found between imported and indigenous cases of dengue fever as well as the relationship between the disease concealment period and the risk of indigenous dengue fever prevention of disease importation and efficient identification of dengue cases within high-risk communities remain the major priorities for disease control.    ,
PMC7227788,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\63_25_abstract.xml,      BACKGROUND    Despite efforts to mitigate the impact of dengue virus (DENV) epidemics the virus remains a public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Most DENV cases in the Americas between January and July 2019 were reported in Brazil. São Paulo State in the southeast of Brazil has reported nearly half of all DENV infections in the country.       OBJECTIVES    To understand the origin and dynamics of the 2019 DENV outbreak.       METHODS    Here using portable nanopore sequencing we generated20 new DENV genome sequences from viremic patients with suspected dengue infection residing in two of the most-affected municipalities of São Paulo State Araraquara and São José do Rio Preto. We conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis with 1630 global DENV strains to better understand the evolutionary history of the DENV lineages that currently circulate in the region.       FINDINGS    The new outbreak strains were classified as DENV2 genotype III (American/Asian genotype). Our analysis shows that the 2019 outbreak is the result of a novel DENV lineage that was recently introduced to Brazil from the Caribbean region. Dating phylogeographic analysis suggests that DENV2-III BR-4 was introduced to Brazil in or around early 2014 possibly from the Caribbean region.       MAIN CONCLUSIONS    Our study describes the early detection of a newly introduced and rapidly-expanding DENV2 virus lineage in Brazil.    ,
PMC7228120,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\64_18_abstract.xml,   Since its first introduction into China in 2009 influenza A/H1N1pdm virus has undergone a rapid expansion and replaced the classical seasonal A(H1N1) virus. To characterize the ongoing evolution and national transmission dynamics of this virus we analyzed 335 complete genome 1259 HA and 1043 NA sequences of the A/H1N1pdm strains detected in China. We found that the dN/dS value and relative genetic diversity of the A/H1N1pdm virus experienced a decrease from 2009 to 2017 and then a rapid increase during 2018–2019. Importantly elevated relative genetic diversity was observed in the A/H1N1pdm and the A/H3N2 viruses as well as two lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) of influenza B virus during 2018–2019 suggesting the simultaneous changes of these viruses in terms of genetic diversity might be associated with the recent large outbreak of seasonal influenza epidemic in China during 2018–2019. Fifteen amino acid mutations were found to be fixed along the main trunks of both HA and NA phylogenetic trees and some of them are located in the antigen binding site or the receptor binding site. A sequential accumulation of mutations relative to the 2009-vaccine strain was observed in the circulating A/H1N1pdm strains during 2009–2016 while a rapid accumulation of mutations relative to the 2015-vaccine strain appeared in the emerging variants in 2017 shortly after the release of the vaccine. Multiple introductions of the A/H1N1pdm lineages into China were observed during 2009–2019 and East China and South China were found to serve as two major epicenters responsible for the national migration of the virus. In summary these data provide important insights into the understanding of the evolution epidemiology and transmission of the A/H1N1pdm virus and highlight the importance of strengthening influenza surveillance in East China and South China.  ,
PMC7230280,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\65_16_abstract.xml,   Ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan China and the number of new patients continues to increase. Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world such as other Asian countries the Americas Europe and the Middle East the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990–1000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232–478). Calculated mean basic reproductive number (R   0) was 6.5 (Interquartile range IQR 5.6–7.2). However better case scenarios with different parameters led to no secondary cases. Altering parameters especially time to hospital visit. could change the impact of a secondary outbreak. With these multiple scenarios with different parameters healthcare professionals might be able to better prepare for this viral infection.    ,
PMC7230963,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\66_16_abstract.xml,   Severe influenza is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the clinical outcomes of critically ill influenza patients. In this retrospective study we enrolled critically ill adult patients with influenza at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. We evaluated the demographic clinical and laboratory findings and examined whether any of these measurements correlated with mortality. We then created an event-based algorithm as a simple predictive tool using two variables with statistically significant associations with mortality. Between 2015 and 2018 102 critically ill influenza patients (median age 62 years) were assessed; among them 41 (40.1%) patients died. Of the 94 patients who received oseltamivir therapy 68 (72.3%) began taking oseltamivir 48 h after the onset of illness. Of the 102 patients the major influenza-associated complications were respiratory failure (97%) pneumonia (94.1%) acute kidney injury (65.7%) adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (51%) gastrointestinal bleeding (35.3%) and bacteremia (16.7%). In the multivariate regression model high lactate levels ARDS acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal bleeding were independent predictors of mortality in critically ill influenza patients. The optimal lactate level cutoff for predicting mortality was 3.7 mmol/L with an area under curve of 0.728. We constructed an event-associated algorithm that included lactate and ARDS. Fifteen (75%) of 20 patients with lactate levels 3.7 mmol/L and ARDS died compared with only 1 (7.7%) of 13 patients with normal lactate levels and without ARDS. We identified clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality that could aid in the care of critically ill influenza patients. Identification of these prognostic markers could be improved to prioritize key examinations that might be useful in determining patient outcomes.   ,

Avian waterfowl are the natural reservoir of IAVs but a wide range of species can serve as hosts. Most IAV strains are adapted to one host species and avian strains of IAV replicate poorly in most mammalian hosts. Importantly IAV polymerases from avian strains function poorly in mammalian cells but host adaptive mutations can restore activity. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) virus acquired multiple mutations in the PA gene that activated polymerase activity in mammalian cells even in the absence of previously identified host adaptive mutations in other polymerase genes. These mutations in PA localize within different regions of the protein suggesting multiple mechanisms exist to activate polymerase activity. Additionally an immunomodulatory protein PA-X is expressed from the PA gene segment. PA-X expression is conserved amongst many IAV strains but activity varies between viruses specific for different hosts suggesting that PA-X also plays a role in host adaptation. Here we review the role of PA in the emergence of currently circulating H1N1pdm09 viruses and the most recent studies of host adaptive mutations in the PA gene that modulate polymerase activity and PA-X function.  ,
PMC7232149,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\70_18_abstract.xml,   Every year influenza B viruses (IBVs) contribute to annual illness and infection can lead to serious respiratory disease among humans. More attention is needed in several areas such as increasing virulence or pathogenicity of circulating B viruses and developing vaccines against current influenza. Since preclinical trials of anti-influenza drugs are mainly conducted in mice we developed an appropriate infection model using an antigenically-relevant IBV strain for furtherance of anti-influenza drug testing and influenza vaccine protective efficacy analysis. A Victoria lineage (clade 1A) IBV was serially passaged 17 times in BALB/c mice and adaptive amino acid substitutions were found in hemagglutinin (HA) (T214I) and neuraminidase (NA) (D432N). By electron microscopy spherical and elliptical IBV forms were noted. Light microscopy showed that mouse-adapted IBVs caused influenza pneumonia on day 6 post inoculation. We evaluated the illness pathogenicity viral load and histopathological features of mouse-adapted IBVs and estimated anti-influenza drugs and vaccine efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Assessment of an investigational anti-influenza drug (oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate) and an influenza vaccine (Ultrix   ® SPBNIIVS Saint Petersburg Russia) showed effectiveness against the mouse-adapted influenza B virus.    ,
PMC7232181,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\71_22_abstract.xml,   Pneumonia is the leading cause of hospitalization worldwide. Besides viruses bacterial co-infections dramatically exacerbate infection. In general surfactant protein-A (SP-A) represents a first line of immune defense. In this study we analyzed whether influenza A virus (IAV) and/or    Staphylococcus aureus (   S. aureus) infections affect SP-A expression. To closely reflect the situation in the lung we used a human alveolus-on-a-chip model and a murine pneumonia model. Our results show that    S. aureus can reduce extracellular levels of SP-A most likely attributed to bacterial proteases. Mono-epithelial cell culture experiments reveal that the expression of SP-A is not directly affected by IAV or    S. aureus. Yet the mRNA expression of SP-A is strongly down-regulated by TNF-α which is highly produced by professional phagocytes in response to bacterial infection. By using the human alveolus-on-a-chip model we show that the down-regulation of SP-A is strongly dependent on macrophages. In a murine model of pneumonia we can confirm that    S. aureus decreases SP-A levels in vivo. These findings indicate that (I) complex interactions of epithelial and immune cells induce down-regulation of SP-A expression and (II) bacterial mono- and super-infections reduce SP-A expression in the lung which might contribute to a severe outcome of bacterial pneumonia.    ,
PMC7232189,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\72_16_abstract.xml,   Influenza B virus (IBV) is a respiratory pathogen that infects humans and causes seasonal influenza epidemics. However cellular response to IBV infection in humans and mechanisms of host-mediated restriction of IBV replication are not thoroughly understood. In this study we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to perform transcriptome profiling of IBV-infected human lung epithelial A549 cells at 0 6 12 and 24 h post infection (hpi) and characterized the cellular gene expression dynamics. We observed that more than 4000 host genes were differentially regulated during the study period which included up regulation of genes encoding proteins having a role in the innate antiviral immune responses immune activation cellular metabolism autophagy and apoptosis as well as down regulation of genes involved in mitosis and cell proliferation. Further analysis of RNA-Seq data coupled with RT-qPCR validation collectively showed that double-strand RNA recognition pathways including retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) were substantially activated following IBV infection. Taken together these results provide important initial insights into the intimate interaction between IBV and lung epithelial cells which can be further explored towards elucidation of the cellular mechanisms in restriction or elimination of IBV infections in humans.  ,
PMC7232257,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\73_17_abstract.xml,   Attracting about 100 participants the fifth edition of our French Phages.fr annual conference was once more a success. This year’s conference took place at the Institute for Structural Biology on the European Electron and Photon Campus in Grenoble 8–9 October 2019. Similar to previous years our meeting gathered scientists mainly working in France from academic labs and hospitals as well as from industry. We also had the pleasure of welcoming attendees from different European countries and even beyond. The conference was divided into four sessions: Ecology and Evolution Phage Therapy and Biotechnology Structure and Assembly and Phage–Host Interaction each opened by a keynote lecture. The talks selected from abstracts gave the opportunity for young scientists (especially students and post-docs) to present their project and results in a friendly atmosphere. Poster sessions also favoured interactions and discussions between young researchers and more senior scientists. Here we provide a summary of the topics developed during the conference.  ,
PMC7232439,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\74_15_abstract.xml,   Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are highly contagious pathogens infecting human and numerous animals. The viruses cause millions of infection cases and thousands of deaths every year thus making IAVs a continual threat to global health. Upon IAV infection host innate immune system is triggered and activated to restrict virus replication and clear pathogens. Subsequently host adaptive immunity is involved in specific virus clearance. On the other hand to achieve a successful infection IAVs also apply multiple strategies to avoid be detected and eliminated by the host immunity. In the current review we present a general description on recent work regarding different host cells and molecules facilitating antiviral defenses against IAV infection and how IAVs antagonize host immune responses.   ,
PMC7232486,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\75_22_abstract.xml,   Mosquito-borne viruses are emerging or re-emerging globally afflicting millions of people around the world.    Aedes aegypti the yellow fever mosquito is the principal vector of dengue Zika and chikungunya viruses and has well-established populations across tropical and subtropical urban areas of the Americas including the southern United States. While intense arboviral epidemics have occurred in Mexico and further south in the Americas local transmission in the United States has been minimal. Here we study    Ae. aegypti and    Culex quinquefasciatus host feeding patterns and vertebrate host communities in residential environments of South Texas to identify host-utilization relative to availability. Only 31% of    Ae. aegypti blood meals were derived from humans while 50% were from dogs and 19% from other wild and domestic animals. In    Cx. quinquefasciatus 67% of blood meals were derived from chicken 22% came from dogs 9% from various wild avian species and 2% from other mammals including one human one cat and one pig. We developed a model for the reproductive number    R   0 for Zika virus (ZIKV) in South Texas relative to northern Mexico using human disease data from Tamaulipas Mexico. We show that ZIKV    R   0 in South Texas communities could be greater than one if the risk of human exposure to    Ae. aegypti bites in these communities is at least 60% that of Northern Mexico communities. The high utilization of non-human vertebrates and low risk of human exposure in South Texas diminishes the outbreak potential for human-amplified urban arboviruses transmitted by    Ae. aegypti.    ,
PMC7232498,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\76_16_abstract.xml,   Influenza B viruses (IBV) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality during interpandemic periods in the human population. Two phylogenetically distinct IBV lineages B/Yamagata and B/Victoria co-circulate worldwide and they present challenges for vaccine strain selection. Until the present study there was little information regarding the pattern of the circulating strains of IBV in Uruguay. A subset of positive influenza B samples from influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatients and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) inpatients detected in sentinel hospitals in Uruguay during 2012–2019 were selected. The sequencing of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes showed substitutions at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the co-circulation of both lineages in almost all seasonal epidemics in Uruguay and allows recognizing a lineage-level vaccine mismatch in approximately one-third of the seasons studied. The epidemiological results show that the proportion of IBV found in ILI was significantly higher than the observed in SARI cases across different groups of age (9.7% ILI 3.2% SARI) and patients between 5–14 years constituted the majority (33%) of all influenza B infection (   p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly we found that individuals &gt;25 years were particularly vulnerable to Yamagata lineage infections.    ,
PMC7232503,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\77_21_abstract.xml,   In South Africa canid rabies virus (RABV) infection is maintained in domestic and wildlife species. The identification of rabies in African civets raised the question of whether this wildlife carnivore is a potential reservoir host of RABVs of direct and ancestral dog origin (dog-maintained and dog-derived origins) with an independent cycle of transmission. Genetic analyses of African civet nucleoprotein sequences for 23 African civet RABVs and historically published sequences demonstrated that RABVs from African civets have two origins related to dog and mongoose rabies enzootics. The data support observations of the interaction of civets with domestic dogs and wildlife mongooses mostly in Northern South Africa and North-East Zimbabwe. Within each host species clade African civet RABVs group exclusively together implying intra-species virus transfer occurs readily. The canid RABV clade appears to support virus transfer more readily between hosts than mongoose RABVs. Furthermore these data probably indicate short transmission chains with conspecifics that may be related to transient rabies maintenance in African civets. Hence it is important to continue monitoring the emergence of lyssaviruses in this host. Observations from this study are supported by ongoing and independent similar cases in which bat-eared foxes and black-backed jackal species maintain independent rabies cycles of what were once dog-maintained RABVs.  ,
PMC7233267,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\78_15_abstract.xml,      BACKGROUND       Aedes aegypti and     Aedes albopictus are the most important arbovirus vectors in the world.          OBJECTIVES    This study aimed to investigate and compare the infestation pattern of these species in a neighbourhood of Recife Brazil endemic for arboviruses in 2005 (T1) and 2013 (T2).       METHODS    Infestation distribution and relative abundance of these sympatric species were recorded by egg collection using a network of 59 sentinel ovitraps (s-ovt) at fixed sampling stations for 12 months in T1 and T2.       FINDINGS    A permanent occupation pattern was detected which was characterised by the presence of egg-laying females of one or both species with a high ovitrap positivity index (94.3 to 100%) throughout both years analysed. In terms of abundance the total of eggs collected was lower (p &lt; 0.005) in T2 (146153) than in T1 (281103) although ovitraps still displayed a high index of positivity. The spatial distribution showed the presence of both species in 65.1% of the 148 s-ovt assessed while a smaller number of traps exclusively contained     Ae. aegypti (22%) or     Ae. albopictus (13.2%) eggs.          MAIN CONCLUSIONS    Our comparative analysis demonstrated the robustness of the spatial occupation and permanence of     Ae. aegypti and     Ae. albopictus populations in this endemic urban area.       ,
PMC7233507,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\79_18_abstract.xml,   Background  There is a significant impact of influenza on individuals families and societies both economically and clinically. This significant impact is a result of hospital admissions medication expenses side effects secondary bacterial infections and more days off from work or other forms of reduced productivity for the patients or their caretakers. Our objective is to present the trends in the rate of hospital discharges per 100000 population from the years 1993 through 2015 the mean age and the inpatient mortality rate.  Methods  This is a retrospective study utilizing the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 1993 through 2015. Discharges due to influenza from 1993 to 2015 were identified and the rate of discharges per 100000 population inpatient mortality and mean age of discharged patients were trended. Linear regression was used to assess if the deviation from horizontal was statistically significant for the trends of the rate of discharges per 100000 population mean age and percentage of the inpatient mortality.  Result  The mean age and inpatient mortality vary from year to year. The linear regression analysis for the trends was not statistically significant and for the percentage of the inpatient mortality the deviation from horizontal was not significant P-value 0.75 and F-value: 0.09. Similarly for the mean age the deviation from horizontal was not significant with a P-value of 0.97 and an F-value of 0.001. However the linear regression analysis for the rate of discharges per 100000 population was remarkable for a statistically significant deviation from the horizontal with a P-value of 0.0002 and an F value of 19.5.  Conclusion  Recent advancements in influenza detection have made the detection feasible quick and cost-effective. However the role of these advanced modalities on the outcome is still controversial. Our analysis revealed a significant increase in the rate of discharges due to influenza but there was no significant change in the parentage of the inpatient mortality over the years between 1993 - 2015. Advanced influenza virus detection tests are now recommended in both outpatient (including emergency department) and inpatient admissions. The recent increase in inpatient admissions could be due to better detection modalities. However no change in the percentage of inpatient mortality makes the impact of these detection tests on the outcome questionable. A further prospective study is warranted to assess the impact of these tests on the outcome.   ,
PMC7233653,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\80_18_abstract.xml,      Background and aim of the work: Influenza virological surveillance is essential for monitoring the evolution of influenza viruses (IVs) as well as for annual updating of the vaccine composition. The aim of this study is to analyse IVs circulation in Emilia-Romagna during the eight epidemic seasons after the 2009 pandemic and to evaluate their match with seasonal vaccine strains.    Methods: A total of 7882 respiratory specimens from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) were collected by regional sentinel practitioners and hospital physicians. Viral investigations were conducted by rRT-PCR assay. Genetic characterization was performed for a spatial-temporal representative number of influenza laboratory-confirmed specimens.    Results: Influenza-positive samples per season ranged between 28.9% (2013-2014) and 66.8% (2012-2013). Co-circulation of IVs type A and type B was observed in all seasons although with a different intensity. In all seasons the highest number of positive samples was recorded in younger patients aged 5-14 years with relative frequencies ranging from 40% in the 2013-2014 season and 78% in the 2012-2013 season. Since the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1pdm09 IVs circulating were closely related to the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009. Antigenic mismatch between vaccine strain and A/H3N2 IVs was observed in the 2011-2012 and 2014-2015 seasons. During 2015-2016 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons a complete or nearly complete mismatch between the predominant influenza B lineage of IVs type B circulating and vaccine B lineage occurred.    Conclusions: This analysis confirms the importance of the virological surveillance and highlights the need of a continuous monitoring of IVs circulation to improve the most appropriate vaccination strategies.

PMC7235449,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\81_19_abstract.xml,   O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that caused two large epidemics in 1959 and 1996 affecting millions of people in Africa. More recently sero-surveillance of healthy blood donors conducted in 2019 revealed high rates of unreported ONNV infection in Uganda. Due to similar clinical symptoms with other endemic mosquito-borne pathogens in the region including chikungunya virus dengue virus and malaria ONNV infections are often un- or misdiagnosed. Elucidating the immunopathogenic factors of this re-emerging arbovirus is critical with the expanding geographic distribution of competent vectors. This study reports the establishment of an immune competent C57BL6/J mouse model to mechanistically characterize ONNV infection and assess potential treatment efficacy. This mouse model successfully recapitulated arthralgia and viremia profiles seen in ONNV patients. Furthermore longitudinal    in-vivo PET imaging with [   18F]FB-IL-2 (CD25+CD4+ binding probe) and histopathological assessment in this model demonstrated the pathogenic role of CD4+ T cells in driving joint pathology. Concordantly    in vivo CD4+ T cell depletion or suppression with fingolimod an FDA-approved immunomodulating drug abrogated CD4+ T cell-mediated disease. This study demonstrates the importance of this immune competent ONNV model for future studies on factors influencing disease pathogenesis which could shape the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies for arthritogenic alphaviruses.    ,
PMC7236111,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\82_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancers causing 270.000 deaths annually worldwide of which 85% occur in developing countries with an increasing risk associated to HIV infection. This study aimed at comparing HPV’s positivity and genotype distribution in women according to their HIV status and determinants.       Methods   A comparative study was carried out in 2012 at the Chantal BIYA International Reference Centre (CIRCB) among 278 women enrolled consecutively at the General Hospital and the Gynaeco-Obstetric and Paediatric Hospital of the City of Yaoundé. HPV genotyping was performed by real-time PCR HIV serological screening by serial algorithm CD4 T cell phenotyping by flow cytometry and HIV viral load by Abbott m2000RT. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2016 and Graph Pad version 6.0 software; with     P &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant.          Results   Globally mean age was 37 ± 3 years; median CD4-count for HIV+ was 414 cells/mm    3 [IQR: 264.75–588] and median viremia was 50 RNA copies/mL [IQR: &lt; 40–8288]. Overall HPV rate was 38.49% (107/278); 58.88% for single women vs. others (28.97% married 2.80% divorced 9.34% for widows) OR: 2.164;     p = 0.0319. Following HIV status HPV rate was 43.48% (80/184) among HIV+ vs. 28.72% (27/94) among HIV- (OR: 1.937;     p &lt; 0.0142); HPV genotypes among HIV+ vs. HIV- were respectively distributed as follows: genotype 16 (3.75% vs. 0.00%     p = 0.57) genotype 18 (3.75% vs. 3.70%     p = 1.00) co-infection 16 and others (8.75% vs. 7.40%     p = 1.00) co-infection 18 and others (8.75% vs. 11.11%     p = 0.71) co-infection 16 18 and others (2.50% vs. 0.00% p = 1.00) and other genotypes (72.50% vs. 77.78%     p = 0.80). Among HIV+ participants HPV rate following CD4 was 62.88% (61/97) for CD4 &lt; 500 vs. 35.71% (20/56) for CD4 ≥ 500 (OR: 3.05;     p = 0.0012) while HPV rate following HIV viremia was 42.71% (41/96) with &lt; 1000 RNA copies/ml vs. 66.00% (33/50) with &gt; 1000 RNA copies/ml (OR = 0.384;     p = 0.009).          Conclusion   In Yaoundé HPV rate appear to be very high with higher rates of genotypes other than 16 and 18. In the event of HIV infection the risk of HPV positivity is two times higher favoured essentially by immunodeficiency. Thus HIV-infected women should be closely monitored to prevent the emergence of cervical cancer.    ,
PMC7236501,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\83_14_abstract.xml,   Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness affecting infants and children that is usually caused by Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA-16). To diagnose HFMD we developed a method for rapid detection of CVA-16 based on reverse transcription-polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR). We used two pairs of primers that specifically recognize the conserved sequences of VP1 coding region of CVA-16 and template RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified in a single tube under isothermal conditions total reaction time could be reduced to less than 40 min. The detection limit of this method was between 2.4 × 10   2 and 2.4 × 10   1 copies/μl with excellent specificity. To test the clinical applicability of the method 40 clinical stool samples were analyzed using RT-PSR and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and comparison showed that the coincidence rate was 100%. Compared with other similar detection methods RT-PSR requires less time simpler operation and lower cost. These results prove that our novel simple and reliable isothermal nucleic acid testing assay has potential application for clinical detection of CVA-16.    ,
PMC7236962,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\84_13_abstract.xml,   The equine encephalitis viruses Venezuelan (VEEV) East (EEEV) and West (WEEV) belong to the genus alphavirus family Togaviridae and still represent a threat for human and animal public health in the Americas. In both these infections are characterized by high viremia rash fever encephalitis and death. VEEV encephalitis is similar clinically to other arboviral diseases such as dengue Zika or chikungunya. Most of the alphaviruses are transmitted between vertebrates and mosquitoes. They are able to replicate in a wide number of hosts including mammals birds reptiles amphibian and arthropods. The VEEV has enzootic and epizootic transmission cycles. At the enzootic one enzootic strains (subtype I serotypes D–F and serotypes II–VI) are continuously circulating between mosquitoes and wild rodents in tropical forests and mangroves of the Americas. The main reseroivrs are wild rodent species of the subfamily    Sigmodontinae. However bats can be also accidental reservoirs of VEEV. In this article we reviewed the main features epidemiology clinical aspects and the current perspectives of the VEEV.    ,
PMC7237041,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\85_24_abstract.xml,      Background   To counter the increasing global risk of Yellow fever (YF) the World Health Organisation initiated the Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. Estimating YF burden as well as vaccine impact while accounting for the features of urban YF transmission such as indirect benefits of vaccination is key to informing this strategy.       Methods and findings   We developed two model variants to estimate YF burden in sub-Saharan Africa assuming all infections stem from either the sylvatic or the urban cycle of the disease. Both relied on an ecological niche model fitted to the local presence of any YF reported event in 34 African countries. We calibrated under-reporting using independent estimates of transmission intensity provided by 12 serological surveys performed in 11 countries. We calculated local numbers of YF infections deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost based on estimated transmission intensity while accounting for time-varying vaccination coverage. We estimated vaccine demand and impact of future preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs) according to various vaccination scenarios.   Vaccination activities conducted in Africa between 2005 and 2017 were estimated to prevent from 3.3 (95% CI 1.2–7.7) to 6.1 (95% CI 2.4–13.2) millions of deaths over the lifetime of vaccinees representing extreme scenarios of none or maximal herd effects respectively. By prioritizing provinces based on the risk of urban YF transmission in future PMVCs an average of 37.7 million annual doses for PMVCs over eight years would avert an estimated 9900000 (95% CI 7000000–13400000) infections and 480000 (180000–1140000) deaths over the lifetime of vaccinees corresponding to 1.7 (0.7–4.1) deaths averted per 1000 vaccine doses.       Conclusions   By estimating YF burden and vaccine impact over a range of spatial and temporal scales while accounting for the specificity of urban transmission our model can be used to inform the current EYE strategy.    ,

We developed two model variants to estimate YF burden in sub-Saharan Africa each either representing the sylvatic or urban cycle of the disease. Both relied on an ecological niche model fitted to known records of YF in 34 African countries and calibrated using serological survey data. Local numbers of YF infections and deaths were derived while accounting for time-varying vaccination coverage. We estimated vaccine demand and the impact of future preventive mass vaccination campaigns according to various vaccination scenarios. By providing burden and vaccine impact estimates over a range of spatial and temporal scales and accounting for the specificity of urban transmission our model can be used to inform the current international strategy to counter the increasing global risk of yellow fever.  ,
PMC7238209,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\87_16_abstract.xml,   Deadly pathogens and parasites are transmitted by vectors and the mosquito is considered the most threatening vector in public health transmitting these pathogens to humans and animals. We are currently witnessing the emergence/resurgence in new regions/populations of the most important mosquito-borne diseases such as arboviruses and malaria. This resurgence may be the consequence of numerous complex parameters but the major cause remains the mismanagement of insecticide use and the emergence of resistance. Biological control programmes have rendered promising results but several highly effective techniques such as genetic manipulation remain insufficiently considered as a control mechanism. Currently new strategies based on attractive toxic sugar baits and new agents such as    Wolbachia and    Asaia are being intensively studied for potential use as alternatives to chemicals. Research into new insecticides Insect Growth Regulators and repellent compounds is pressing and the improvement of biological strategies may provide key solutions to prevent outbreaks decrease the danger to at-risk populations and mitigate resistance.    ,
PMC7239338,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\88_27_abstract.xml,   In 2014 our research network was involved in the evaluation of favipiravir an anti‐influenza polymerase inhibitor against Ebola virus. In this review we discuss how mathematical modeling was used first to propose a relevant dosing regimen in humans and then to optimize its antiviral efficacy in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model. The data collected in NHPs were finally used to develop a model of Ebola pathogenesis integrating the interactions among the virus the innate and adaptive immune response and the action of favipiravir. We conclude the review of this work by discussing how these results are of relevance for future human studies in the context of Ebola virus but also for other emerging viral diseases for which no therapeutics are available.  ,
PMC7239382,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\89_26_abstract.xml,   Infection with (SAg)-producing bacteria may precede or follow infection with or vaccination against influenza A viruses (IAVs). However how SAgs alter the breadth of IAV-specific CD8   + T cell (T   CD8) responses is unknown. Moreover whether recall responses mediating heterosubtypic immunity to IAVs are manipulated by SAgs remains unexplored. We employed wild-type (WT) and mutant bacterial SAgs SAg-sufficient/deficient    Staphylococcus aureus strains and WT mouse-adapted and reassortant IAV strains in multiple    in vivo settings to address the above questions. Contrary to the popular view that SAgs delete or anergize T cells systemic administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or    Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen before intraperitoneal IAV immunization enlarged the clonal size of ‘select’ IAV-specific T   CD8 and reshuffled the hierarchical pattern of primary T   CD8 responses. This was mechanistically linked to the TCR Vβ makeup of the impacted clones rather than their immunodominance status. Importantly SAg-expanded T   CD8 retained their IFN-γ production and cognate cytolytic capacities. The enhancing effect of SEB on immunodominant T   CD8 was also evident in primary responses to vaccination with heat-inactivated and live attenuated IAV strains administered intramuscularly and intranasally respectively. Interestingly in prime-boost immunization settings the outcome of SEB administration depended strictly upon the time point at which this SAg was introduced. Accordingly SEB injection before priming raised CD127   highKLRG1   low memory precursor frequencies and augmented the anamnestic responses of SEB-binding T   CD8. By comparison introducing SEB before boosting diminished recall responses to IAV-derived epitopes drastically and indiscriminately. This was accompanied by lower Ki67 and higher Fas LAG-3 and PD-1 levels consistent with a pro-apoptotic and/or exhausted phenotype. Therefore SAgs can have contrasting impacts on anti-IAV immunity depending on the naïve/memory status and the TCR composition of exposed T   CD8. Finally local administration of SEB or infection with SEB-producing    S.    aureus enhanced pulmonary T   CD8 responses to IAV. Our findings have clear implications for superinfections and prophylactic vaccination.    ,
PMC7239382,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\90_27_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Exposure to bacterial superantigens (SAgs) is often a consequence of infection with common Gram-positive bacteria causing septic and toxic shock or food poisoning. How SAgs affect the magnitude breadth and quality of infection/vaccine-elicited CD8   + T cell (T   CD8) responses to respiratory viral pathogens including influenza A viruses (IAVs) is far from clear. Also importantly superinfections with IAVs and SAg-producing bacteria are serious clinical occurrences during seasonal and pandemic flu and require urgent attention. We demonstrate that two structurally distinct SAgs including staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) unexpectedly enhance primary T   CD8 responses to ‘select’ IAV-derived epitopes depending on the TCR makeup of the responding clones. Intriguingly the timing of exposure to SEB dictates the outcome of prime-boost immunization. Seeing a SAg before priming raises memory precursor frequencies and augments anamnestic T   CD8 responses. Conversely a SAg encounter before boosting renders T   CD8 prone to death or exhaustion and impedes recall responses thus likely compromising heterosubtypic immunity to IAVs. Finally local exposure to SEB increases the pulmonary response of immunodominant IAV-specific T   CD8. These findings shed new light on how bacterial infections and SAgs influence the effectiveness of anti-IAV T   CD8 responses and have as such wide-ranging implications for preventative vaccination and infection control.    ,
PMC7240362,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\91_29_abstract.xml,   In the past centuries viruses have benefited from globalization to spread across the globe infecting new host species and populations. A growing number of viruses have been documented in the western honey bee    Apis mellifera. Several of these contribute significantly to honey bee colony losses. This review synthetizes the knowledge of the diversity and distribution of honey-bee-infecting viruses including recent data from high-throughput sequencing (HTS). After presenting the diversity of viruses and their corresponding symptoms we surveyed the scientific literature for the prevalence of these pathogens across the globe. The geographical distribution shows that the most prevalent viruses (deformed wing virus sacbrood virus black queen cell virus and acute paralysis complex) are also the most widely distributed. We discuss the ecological drivers that influence the distribution of these pathogens in worldwide honey bee populations. Besides the natural transmission routes and the resulting temporal dynamics global trade contributes to their dissemination. As recent evidence shows that these viruses are often multihost pathogens their spread is a risk for both the beekeeping industry and the pollination services provided by managed and wild pollinators.    ,
PMC7241786,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\92_18_abstract.xml,   West Nile virus (WNV) has consistently been reported to be associated with human cases of illness in the region near Chicago Illinois. However the number of reported cases of human illness varies across years with intermittent outbreaks. Several dynamic factors including temperature rainfall and infection status of vector mosquito populations are responsible for much of these observed variations. However local landscape structure and human demographic characteristics also play a key role. The geographic and temporal scales used to analyze such complex data affect the observed associations. Here we used spatial and statistical modeling approaches to investigate the factors that drive the outcome of WNV human illness on fine temporal and spatial scales. Our approach included multi-level modeling of long-term weekly data from 2005 to 2016 with weekly measures of mosquito infection human illness and weather combined with more stable landscape and demographic factors on the geographical scale of 1000m hexagons. We found that hot weather conditions warm winters and higher MIR in earlier weeks increased the probability of an area of having a WNV human case. Higher population and the proportion of urban light intensity in an area also increased the probability of observing a WNV human case. A higher proportion of open water sources percentage of grass land deciduous forests and housing built post 1990 decreased the probability of having a WNV case. Additionally we found that cumulative positive mosquito pools up to 31 weeks can strongly predict the total annual human WNV cases in the Chicago region. This study helped us to improve our understanding of the fine-scale drivers of spatiotemporal variability of human WNV cases.  ,
PMC7241834,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\93_26_abstract.xml,   In South East Asia dengue epidemics have increased in size and geographical distribution in recent years. We examined the spatiotemporal distribution and epidemiological characteristics of reported dengue cases in the predominantly rural state of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo–an area where sylvatic and urban circulation of pathogens are known to intersect. Using a public health data set of routinely notified dengue cases in Sabah between 2010 and 2016 we described demographic and entomological risk factors both before and after a 2014 change in the clinical case definition for the disease. Annual dengue incidence rates were spatially variable over the 7-year study period from 2010–2016 (state-wide mean annual incidence of 21 cases/100000 people; range 5-42/100000) but were highest in rural localities in the western districts of the state (Kuala Penyu Nabawan Tenom and Kota Marudu). Eastern districts exhibited lower overall dengue rates although a high proportion of severe (haemorrhagic) dengue cases (44%) were focused in Sandakan and Tawau. Dengue incidence was highest for those aged between 10 and 29 years (24/100000) and was slightly higher for males compared to females. Available vector surveillance data indicated that during large outbreaks in 2015 and 2016 the mosquito    Aedes albopictus was more prevalent in both urban and rural households (House Index of 64%) than    Ae.    aegypti (15%). Demographic patterns remained unchanged both before and after the dengue case definition was changed; however in the years following the change reported case numbers increased substantially. Overall these findings suggest that dengue outbreaks in Sabah are increasing in both urban and rural settings. Future studies to better understand the drivers of risk in specific age groups genders and geographic locations and to test the potential role of    Ae.    albopictus in transmission may help target dengue prevention and control efforts.    ,
PMC7241834,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\94_27_abstract.xml,   Author summary  In order to combat the rising regional incidence of dengue in South East Asia incidence patterns must be better characterised within different ecological settings. We conducted the first retrospective analysis of dengue epidemiology in the predominantly rural state of Sabah Malaysia where both urban and sylvatic transmission cycles exist. Human notification data over a 7-year period were reviewed and spatiotemporal and demographic risk factors identified. We found that: 1. While urban habitats do play a role in mediating the spread of dengue in Sabah cases from both urban and rural localities contributed equally to dengue outbreaks; 2. Human demographic risk factors included being aged between 10 and 29 years and being male; 3. Cases of severe dengue were more common in the eastern districts of the state–almost half of severe dengue cases were reported from Sandakan and Tawau; and 4. The presence of    Aedes albopictus in and around the majority of urban and rural case households often in the apparent absence of    Ae.    aegypti suggests that its role in transmission requires further investigation. This study emphasises that increasing incidence of dengue in urban South East Asia is also mirrored in more rural areas and suggests a need for control strategies that address both urban and rural dengue risk.    ,
PMC7242466,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\95_13_abstract.xml,   Infection with influenza can be aggravated by bacterial co-infections which often results in disease exacerbation. The effects of influenza infection on the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome are largely unknown. Here we report a longitudinal study to assess the temporal dynamics of the URT microbiomes of uninfected and influenza virus-infected humans and ferrets. Uninfected human patients and ferret URT microbiomes have stable healthy ecostate communities both within and between individuals. In contrast infected patients and ferrets exhibit large changes in bacterial community composition over time and between individuals. The unhealthy ecostates of infected individuals progress towards the healthy ecostate coinciding with viral clearance and recovery.    Pseudomonadales associate statistically with the disturbed microbiomes of infected individuals. The dynamic and resilient microbiome during influenza virus infection in multiple hosts provides a compelling rationale for the maintenance of the microbiome homeostasis as a potential therapeutic target to prevent IAV associated bacterial co-infections.    ,

PMC7243378,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\97_21_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Background   Understanding local epidemiology and etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients is crucial for determining the appropriateness of treatment guidelines. We aim to determine the etiologies severity and outcomes in adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia and to study the impact of empirical antibiotic therapy on patient outcomes.       Methods   We performed a prospective observational cohort study involving adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia in Hong Kong. Sputum nasopharyngeal aspirate blood and urine were collected for bacterial culture molecular tests for detection of viruses and atypical pathogens and antigen tests. Multivariable logistic regression model and Cox proportional hazard models were performed to determine independent factors associated with prolonged hospitalization and mortality.       Results   From February 2017 to July 2018 258 patients were enrolled. The median age was 73 (interquartile range 61–80) years 66% were male 57% had underlying chronic illnesses 13% had CURB-65 score ≥3 and 10% had higher 1-year mortality. Pathogens were identified in 45% of patients; 20% had viral 15% had bacterial and 9% had polymicrobial pneumonia.     Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%) influenza virus (12%) and     Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1.2%) were the most common bacterial viral and atypical pathogens respectively. Nonadherence to local empirical antibiotic treatment guidelines (primarily recommending beta-lactam and doxycycline) was observed in 25% and was independently associated with prolonged hospitalization (≥7 days) and higher mortality after adjustment for age underlying chronic illness and disease severity.          Conclusions   Adherence to treatment guidelines was associated with shorter hospitalization and improved survival. We provided evidence for the use of doxycycline for coverage of atypical pathogens in nonsevere pneumonia.    ,

PMC7245076,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\99_17_abstract.xml,   Significance  Dengue affects approximately one-half of the world’s population. While it causes regular and cyclical outbreaks throughout the tropical world the molecular mechanisms that determine its epidemic potential remain poorly defined. The present work provides insight into the molecular determinants of epidemiologic fitness which is critical for surveillance to identify dengue virus strains with a potential to cause outbreaks. This will allow for better implementation of control measures to intercept impending outbreaks before many lives are affected.  ,
PMC7245076,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\100_18_abstract.xml,   Dengue virus (DENV) is a global health threat causing repeated epidemics throughout the tropical world. While low herd immunity levels to any one of the four antigenic types of DENV predispose populations to outbreaks viral genetic determinants that confer greater fitness for epidemic spread is an important but poorly understood contributor of dengue outbreaks. Here we report that positive epistasis between the coding and noncoding regions of the viral genome combined to elicit an epidemiologic fitness phenotype associated with the 1994 DENV2 outbreak in Puerto Rico. We found that five amino acid substitutions in the NS5 protein reduced viral genomic RNA (gRNA) replication rate to achieve a more favorable and relatively more abundant subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) a byproduct of host 5′-3′ exoribonuclease activity. The resulting increase in sfRNA relative to gRNA levels not only inhibited type I interferon (IFN) expression in infected cells through a previously described mechanism but also enabled sfRNA to compete with gRNA for packaging into infectious particles. We suggest that delivery of sfRNA to new susceptible cells to inhibit type I IFN induction before gRNA replication and without the need for further de novo sfRNA synthesis could form a “preemptive strike” strategy against DENV.  ,
PMC7245956,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\101_15_abstract.xml,    The live smallpox vaccine was a historical first and highly effective vaccine. However along with high immunogenicity the vaccinia virus (VACV) caused serious side effects in vaccinees sometimes with lethal outcomes. Therefore after global eradication of smallpox VACV vaccination was stopped. For this reason most of the human population worldwide lacks specific immunity against not only smallpox but also other zoonotic orthopoxviruses. Outbreaks of diseases caused by these viruses have increasingly occurred in humans on different continents. However use of the classical live VACV vaccine for prevention against these diseases is unacceptable because of potential serious side effects especially in individuals with suppressed immunity or immunodeficiency (e.g. HIV-infected patients). Therefore highly attenuated VACV variants that preserve their immunogenicity are needed. This review discusses current ideas about the development of a humoral and cellular immune response to orthopoxvirus infection/vaccination and describes genetic engineering approaches that could be utilized to generate safe and highly immunogenic live VACV vaccines.   ,
PMC7245998,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\102_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Previous studies have proven that the closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) was an effective intervention to reduce human risk of avian influenza A (H7N9) infection but evidence is limited on the impact of scale and duration of LPMs closure on the transmission of H7N9.       Method   Five cities (i.e. Shanghai Suzhou Shenzhen Guangzhou and Hangzhou) with the largest number of H7N9 cases in mainland China from 2013 to 2017 were selected in this study. Data on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 human cases in those five cities were obtained from the Chinese National Influenza Centre. The detailed information of LPMs closure (i.e. area and duration) was obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture. We used a generalized linear model with a Poisson link to estimate the effect of LPMs closure reported as relative risk reduction (RRR). We used classification and regression trees (CARTs) model to select and quantify the dominant factor of H7N9 infection.       Results   All five cities implemented the LPMs closure and the risk of H7N9 infection decreased significantly after LPMs closure with RRR ranging from 0.80 to 0.93. Respectively a long-term LPMs closure for 10–13 weeks elicited a sustained and highly significant risk reduction of H7N9 infection (RRR = 0.98). Short-time LPMs closure with 2 weeks in every epidemic did not reduce the risk of H7N9 infection (    p &gt; 0.05). Partially closed LPMs in some suburbs contributed only 35% for reduction rate (RRR = 0.35). Shenzhen implemented partial closure for first 3 epidemics (    p &gt; 0.05) and all closure in the latest 2 epidemic waves (RRR = 0.64).          Conclusion   Our findings suggest that LPMs all closure in whole city can be a highly effective measure comparing with partial closure (i.e. only urban closure suburb and rural remain open). Extend the duration of closure and consider permanently closing the LPMs will help improve the control effect. The effect of LPMs closure seems greater than that of meteorology on H7N9 transmission.    ,
PMC7246361,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\103_19_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Background   The differential diagnoses of patients hospitalized for respiratory infections due to influenza virus vs other pathogens are challenging. Our study investigated whether hematological parameters such as neutrophil (N) lymphocyte (L) platelet (PLT) and neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR) contributed in diagnosing influenza virus infections and in discriminating other respiratory infections.       Methods   We retrospectively analyzed the laboratory characteristics of 307 patients with respiratory infections caused by influenza/non‐influenza virus and bacteria. The diagnostic abilities of hematological indexes were evaluated in the patients compared with 100 healthy people.       Results   The hematological parameters in patients with influenza virus infection were dramatically altered compared with those in the controls. Additionally among the systemic inflammatory markers the sensitivity of NLR for influenza detection was higher than that of N and L. PLT was significantly lower in influenza virus‐positive infection than in influenza virus‐negative infection. Moreover when patients with influenza virus infection were cured PLT returned to a normal level. The red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels of influenza virus infection were higher than those of bacterial infection. Compared with traditional N and L NLR and platelet‐to‐neutrophil (PNR) showed greater significance between influenza virus and bacterial infection (    P &lt; .01).          Conclusion   Neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio with high sensitivity is a preferable diagnostic tool to screen influenza virus‐infected patients than N and L. PLT accounts in the differential diagnoses of respiratory infections due to influenza virus and other pathogens among patients. In addition RBC Hb NLR and PNR can significantly differentiate between influenza virus infections and bacterial infections.    ,
PMC7247048,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\104_17_abstract.xml,   Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe human disease with mortality rates of up to 30%. The disease is widespread in Africa Asia the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The last few years have seen disease emergence in Spain for the first time and disease re-emergence in other regions of the world after periods of inactivity. Factors such as climate change movement of infected ticks animals and changes in human activity are likely to broaden endemic foci. There are therefore concerns that CCHF might emerge in currently nonendemic regions. The absence of approved vaccines or therapies heightens these concerns; thus Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is listed by the World Health Organization as a priority organism. However the current sporadic nature of CCHF cases may call for targeted vaccination of risk groups as opposed to mass vaccinations. CCHF vaccine development has accelerated in recent years partly because of the discovery of CCHF animal models. In this review we discuss CCHF risk groups who are most likely to benefit from vaccine development the merits and demerits of available CCHF animal models and the various approaches which have been explored for CCHF vaccine development. Lastly we present concluding remarks and research areas which can be further explored to enhance the available CCHFV vaccine data.  ,
PMC7247188,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\105_13_abstract.xml,      Background   After the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infected people increasing numbers of patients have pretreatment drug resistance (PDR). In this study the prevalence of PDR was evaluated in adults initiating antiretroviral therapy in China.       Methods   Blood samples were obtained from 1943 patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2017 from 13 provinces or cities in China. Pol sequences were used to analyze drug resistance and construct transmission networks. Logistic regression model was used to estimate the potential factors associated with PDR.       Results   In total 1711 eligible patients (76.0% male; 87.8% aged ≥ 25 years) were included of which 117 (6.8%) had PDR. The highest rates of PDR were 12.2% in Liangshan Prefecture of Sichuan and 9.3 and 8.9% in Dehong and Lincang Prefecture of Yunnan. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PDR was significantly higher among intravenous drug users (adjusted Odds Ratio (a    OR) = 2.64 95%     CI: 1.57–4.44) and individuals from Liangshan Dehong and Lincang (a    OR = 2.04 95%     CI: 1.26–3.30). In total 754 sequences were used to generate 164 transmission networks. Five transmission networks had two or three sequences containing the same mutations two networks contained subjects from Liangshan and one network contained subjects from Dehong.          Conclusions   Overall the PDR prevalence was moderate with a particularly high prevalence in areas with severe HIV epidemics. These results indicate the importance of continuous PDR monitoring in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy.    ,
PMC7247193,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\106_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Zika virus (ZIKV genus     Flavivirus family     Flaviviridae) is transmitted mainly by     Aedes mosquitoes. This virus has become an emerging concern of global public health with recent epidemics associated to neurological complications in the pacific and America. ZIKV is the most frequently amplified arbovirus in southeastern Senegal. However this virus and its adult vectors are undetectable during the dry season. The aim of this study was to investigate how ZIKV and its vectors are maintained locally during the dry season.          Methods   Soil sand and detritus contained in 1339 potential breeding sites (tree holes rock holes fruit husks discarded containers used tires) were collected in forest savannah barren and village land covers and flooded for eggs hatching. The emerging larvae were reared to adult identified and blood fed for F1 production. The F0 and F1 adults were identified and tested for ZIKV by Reverse Transcriptase-Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction.       Results   A total of 1016 specimens including 13     Aedes species emerged in samples collected in the land covers and breeding sites investigated.     Ae. aegypti was the dominant species representing 56.6% of this fauna with a high plasticity.     Ae. furcifer and     Ae. luteocephalus were found in forest tree holes     Ae. taylori in forest and village tree holes     Ae. vittatus in rock holes. ZIKV was detected from 4 out of the 82 mosquito pools tested. Positive pools included     Ae. bromeliae (2 pools)     Ae. unilineatus (1 pool) and     Ae. vittatus (1 pool) indicating that the virus is maintained in these     Aedes eggs during the dry season.          Conclusion   Our investigation identified breeding sites types and land cover classes where several ZIKV vectors are maintained and their maintenance rates during the dry season in southeastern Senegal. The maintenance of the virus in these vectors in nature could explain its early amplification at the start of the rainy season in this area.    ,
PMC7248199,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\107_14_abstract.xml,   Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) cause major economic losses to the global poultry industry. Many host factors have been identified that act as regulators of the inflammatory response and virus replication in influenza A virus (IAV) infected cells including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptor (NLR) family proteins. Evidence is emerging that NLRC5 the largest NLR member is a regulator of host immune responses against invading pathogens including viruses; however its role in the avian immune system and AIV pathogenesis has not been fully explored. In this study we found that NLRC5 is activated by a range of low and highly pathogenic AIVs in primary chicken lung cells and a chicken macrophage cell line. Further siRNA mediated NLRC5 knockdown in chicken macrophages resulted in a significant reduction in AIV replication which was associated with the upregulation of genes associated with activated NFκB signaling pathway. The knockdown of NLRC5 enhanced the expression of genes known to be associated with viral defense and decreased innate cytokine gene expression following AIV infection. Overall our investigation strongly suggests that NLRC5 is a pro-viral factor during IAV infection in chicken and may contribute to pathogenesis through innate cytokine regulation. Further studies are warranted to investigate the IAV protein(s) that may regulate activation of NLRC5.  ,
PMC7248559,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\108_17_abstract.xml,   Lumpy skin disease and Rift Valley fever are two high-priority livestock diseases which have the potential to spread into previously free regions through animal movement and/or vectors as well as intentional release by bioterrorists. Since the distribution range of both diseases is similar in Africa it makes sense to use a bivalent vaccine to control them. This may lead to the more consistent and sustainable use of vaccination against Rift Valley fever through a more cost-effective vaccine. In this study a recombinant lumpy skin disease virus was constructed in which the thymidine kinase gene was used as the insertion site for the Gn and Gc protective glycoprotein genes of Rift Valley fever virus using homologous recombination. Selection markers the enhanced green fluorescent protein and    Escherichia coli guanidine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt) were used for selection of recombinant virus and in a manner enabling a second recombination event to occur upon removal of the gpt selection-pressure allowing the removal of both marker genes in the final product. This recombinant virus LSD-RVF.mf was selected to homogeneity characterized and evaluated in cattle as a vaccine to show protection against both lumpy skin disease and Rift Valley fever in cattle. The results demonstrate that the LSD-RVF.mf is safe immunogenic and can protect cattle against both diseases.    ,

PMC7252625,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\110_21_abstract.xml,      Background   Against the background of the international public health emergency related to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in addition to other recent large Ebola epidemics the issue of transmission due to viral persistence from survivors’ body fluids is becoming increasingly urgent. Clinical research in which body fluids play a role is critical and semen testing programs are part of the suggested response to the outbreak. Broad acceptance and understanding of testing programs and research often in resource poor settings is essential for the success and sustainability of clinical studies and an accurate epidemic response. Study participants’ perceptions on the collection of body fluids are therefore relevant for the programmatic planning and implementation of clinical studies.       Study aim and methods   In this qualitative study we aimed to explore the perceptions on bio-sampling in the Sierra Leone Ebola Virus Persistence Study (SLEVP study). We were interested to understand how norms on gender and sexuality related to perceptions and experiences of study participants and staff specifically in what way perceptions of the body on intimacy and on body fluids related to the study process. We purposively sampled former study participants for in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions. We conducted 56 in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussions with 93 participants. In a participatory approach we included study participants in the analysis of data.       Results   Overall the SLEVP study was well perceived by study participants and study staff. Study participants conceived the testing of their body fluids positively and saw it as a useful means to know their status. However some study participants were ambivalent and sometimes reluctant towards sampling of certain body fluids (especially semen blood and vaginal fluid) due to religious or cultural reasons. Self-sampling was described by study participants as a highly unusual phenomenon. Several narratives were related to the loss of body fluids (especially semen) that would make men weak and powerless or women dizzy and sick (especially blood). Some rumors indicated mistrust related to study aims that may have been expressions of broader societal challenges and historical circumstances. These reservations could eventually be overcome by guaranteeing confidentiality and privacy and by comprehensive professional counseling.       Conclusion   In the course of the sampling exercise study participants were often obliged to transgress cultural and intimate boundaries. It is therefore important to understand the potential importance some of these perceptions have on the recruitment of study participants and the acceptability of studies on a symbolic as well as a structural level. In order to capture any reservations it is necessary to provide plenty of possibilities of information sharing and follow-up of continuous consent.    ,
PMC7252625,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\111_22_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Recent studies have shown that the Ebola Virus might persist in body fluids of survivors of the disease. Clinical research in which body fluids (semen vaginal fluids blood sweat tears breast milk and rectal fluids) are sampled play an increasingly important role specifically in light of growing EVD epidemics. The success of these studies e.g. how many participants are recruited in a study and how many are staying until the end of a study is highly dependent on the participants’ cooperation and understanding of testing programs. However until now there has been only little research on how studies and testing programs in which body fluids are sampled are perceived and understood by study participants. In this study we were therefore interested to understand how study participants perceived the sampling and collection of body fluids and how their cultural or religious background may influence the willingness to participate and stay in a clinical study. We conducted one-to-one interviews and focus-group discussions with 93 former study participants of a viral persistence study. We found that overall study participants conceived the testing of their body fluids positively and saw it as a useful means to know their status. However some study participants were ambivalent and sometimes reluctant towards sampling of certain body fluids (especially semen blood and vaginal fluid) due to religious or cultural reasons. Self-sampling was described by study participants as a highly unusual phenomenon. Participants explained that the collection of certain body fluids would make men weak and powerless (especially the sampling of semen) or women dizzy and sick (especially blood). Rumors indicated that some participants mistrusted the study aims. In the course of the sampling exercise study participants often felt that they had to transgress cultural and intimate boundaries. We conclude that it is important to understand the potential importance some of these perceptions have on the recruitment of study participants and the acceptability of studies. The understanding of the socio-cultural context of clinical research is relevant for the programmatic planning of such research.  ,
PMC7252634,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\112_27_abstract.xml,   Ross River fever is a mosquito-transmitted viral disease that is endemic to Australia and the surrounding Pacific Islands. Ross River virus (RRV) belongs to the arthritogenic group of alphaviruses which largely cause disease characterized by debilitating polyarthritis rash and fever. There is no specific treatment or licensed vaccine available and the mechanisms of protective humoral immunity in humans are poorly understood. Here we describe naturally occurring human mAbs specific to RRV isolated from subjects with a prior natural infection. These mAbs potently neutralize RRV infectivity in cell culture and block infection through multiple mechanisms including prevention of viral attachment entry and fusion. Some of the most potently neutralizing mAbs inhibited binding of RRV to Mxra8 a recently discovered alpahvirus receptor. Epitope mapping studies identified the A and B domains of the RRV E2 protein as the major antigenic sites for the human neutralizing antibody response. In experiments in mice these mAbs were protective against cinical disease and reduced viral burden in multiple tissues suggesting a potential therapeutic use for humans.  ,
PMC7252634,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\113_28_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Ross River virus (RRV) was first identified in Australia in 1959 and has since caused multiple outbreaks some affecting tens of thousands of individuals throughout the Pacific Islands Australia and Papua New Guinea. In addition a mean of 4600 cases of RRV disease occur in Australia each year. RRV is transmitted to humans via the bite of a mosquito and disease symptoms include rash fever and debilitating polyarthritis. Currently the adaptive immune response during RRV infection is poorly understood and no human moncoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the virus exist. In this study we generated a panel of human mAbs specific for RRV from two donors who had undergone a natural infection with the virus. We then used these mAbs to elucidate antigenic regions of RRV and to further study mechanisms by which RRV is neutralized. In addition to potently neutralizing virus    in vitro these mAbs significantly reduced mouse death and reducd viral burden in an immunocompromised model. Our study provides new insight into the antibody reponse during a natural infection with RRV and suggests that therapeutic administration of mAbs may be beneficial in reducing disease burden.    ,
PMC7252670,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\114_21_abstract.xml,   In New Caledonia (NC)    Aedes aegypti is the only proven vector of dengue virus (DENV) which is the most prevalent arbovirosis in NC. Since World War II the four DENV serotypes have circulated regularly in NC. The epidemiological profile however has evolved over the last ten years with the persistence of DENV-1 circulation and the co-circulation of several DENV serotypes. The current study evaluated the ability of    Ae.    aegypti from NC to transmit four DENV serotypes (and two DENV-1 genotypes) isolated during recent outbreaks in NC. An    Ae.    aegypti F1 generation was twice independently orally challenged with each DENV strain (10   7 FFU/ml). Infection dissemination and transmission rates and transmission efficiency were measured at day 7 and 14 post-exposure as well as the quantity of infectious virus particles. Mosquito infection was observed as early as 7 days post-infection. Infection rates between 18 and 58% were measured for all DENV serotypes/genotypes tested. Although dissemination rates ranged from 78 to 100% transmission efficiencies were low with values not exceeding 21% at 14 days post-infection for all DENV strains. This study shows that NC    Ae.    aegypti are moderately competent for DENV in laboratory conditions. In link with epidemiological data these results suggest implication of other factors in the sustained circulation of DENV-1 in New Caledonia.    ,
PMC7252670,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\115_22_abstract.xml,   Author summary     Aedes aegypti is the only known vector for dengue virus (DENV) in New Caledonia (NC). DENV are divided into four serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) based on their antigenic properties these being subdivided into different genotypes. All four DENV serotypes have regularly circulated in New Caledonia in the past. An unusual persistence of DENV-1 has been observed during the last ten years suggesting a possible preferential transmission of this DENV serotype by    Ae.    aegypti. In this study we examine for the first time the ability of    Ae.    aegypti from New Caledonia to transmit the four circulating DENV serotypes and more precisely two genotypes of DENV-1. Our results demonstrate that this vector is moderately competent for DENV with slight differences observed between DENV serotype/genotype in terms of transmission. These findings suggest that other factors are at play in the sustained circulation of DENV-1 and that further vector-virus interactions studies should be undertaken to better understand the DENV epidemiological profile in NC.    ,
PMC7253103,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\116_17_abstract.xml,   Abstract.  Recent expansions of vector-borne diseases highlight the need for improved surveillance especially in resource-poor settings. Dengue virus (DENV) chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) share the same vectors as well as similar clinical presentations suggesting that combined surveillance would be useful. We hypothesized that blood spotted on dengue rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) could be harnessed for sample collection in remote areas for subsequent detection of DENV CHIKV and ZIKV by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). CHIKV and ZIKV dilutions were spotted on dengue RDTs (SD BIOLINE Dengue DUO Standard Diagnostics Gyeonggi-do Republic of Korea) dried and extracted. As reference aliquots of each viral dilution were directly extracted. Using specific RT-qPCR tests both viruses were successfully detected from RDT extracts. However the limit of detection was slightly lower in comparison to direct extracts two logfold for CHIKV and one logfold for ZIKV. For analysis of temperature stability DENV dilutions were spotted on RDTs and stored for up to 2 months at −80°C 4°C or 35°C before testing. Storage of RDTs for 2 months at 35°C did not compromise detection of RNA by RT-qPCR; only minimal degradation was observed. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential of using dengue RDTs for DENV/CHIKV/ZIKV combined surveillance in areas without access to laboratory facilities. Further investigations are needed for evaluation of tri-viral surveillance under field conditions using patient samples. Large-scale implementation of surveillance for these viruses is of crucial public health importance for the early detection of epidemics. This method also has important implications for improving understanding of the molecular epidemiology of the three viruses.  ,
PMC7254658,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\117_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection constitute a deadly infectious disease synergy disease and major public health problem throughout the world. The risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV) is 21 times higher than the rest of the world population. The overlap of latent TB infection and HIV infection has resulted in marked increases in TB incidence in countries with dual epidemics. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the single most significant way to reduce incident TB in PLHIV besides early ART initiation isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is the key intervention to prevent TB among PLHIV. This prospective cohort and longitudinal study aimed to document; retention adherence development of active TB disease possible adverse drug reactions and completion among patients initiated on IPT in Jan 2019.       Methods   This was both a prospective cohort and longitudinal study nested within a national quality improvement collaborative in which multiple quality improvement teams tested changes in care delivery to improve the delivery of IPT. The prospective cohort were HIV patients without TB disease initiated on a dosage of Isoniazid 300 mg/day for adults and 150 mg/day for children for a period of 6 months. Association statistics were used to describe patient characteristics and outcomes. Variables with p-value &lt; 0.05 were used to determine linear by linear associations between patient characteristics assumed to influence both primary and secondary outcomes. Variables with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were included in the logistical regression model. The final model included those factors that retained statistical significance. The odds ratios (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR) along with its 95% confidence interval were used to determine the power of relationship in determining the outcomes of interest. The model was tested for fitness using goodness-of-fit Hosmer–Lemeshow tests.       Results   The completion of IPT was at 89%. A significant proportion of patients adhered to treatment (89%) and kept their appointment schedules-retention (89%). All patients (100%) received IPT at each appointment visit. Only 4% of patients experienced side effects of isoniazid (INH) but none of them developed active TB at the end of the 6 month INH dose. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of covariates of IPT completion revealed a strong and statistical association between IPT completion and age gender retention and side effects of INH. Our multivariate model found that children below 15 years were less likely to complete INH than patients ≥ 15 years (    AOR = 0.416     p = 0.230     df = 1). Female patients were 2 times more likely to complete INH dose than male patients (AOR = 1.598     p = 0.018). Patients who kept all their appointment schedules were 10 times more likely to complete IPT than those who missed one or more schedules (    AOR = 10.726     p = 0.000     df = 1). We also found that patients who did not report any side effects associated with INH were 2 times more likely to complete INH (    AOR = 1.958     p = 0.016     df = 1) than patients who reported one or more side effects.          Conclusion   Treatment completion is the end-point of the IPT initiation strategy in Uganda. With a completion rate of 89% our results seem re-assuring and suggest that improvement collaborative is an effective approach to achieving results through combined efforts. The high rates of completion are encouraging indicators of progress in the implementation of collaborative activities in the study setting. However such collaboratives would require periodic evaluation to prevent possible relapses in progress attained.    ,
PMC7255596,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\118_23_abstract.xml,   Little is known about the contribution of virus-specific and cross-reacting antibodies (Abs) or the cellular immune response generated by a primary dengue (DENV) infection on the course of a secondary zika (ZIKV) infection    in vivo. Here we show that the length of time between DENV/ZIKV infections has a qualitative impact on controlling early ZIKV replication. Depletion of DENV2-specific Abs in sera confirmed that those type-specific Abs do not contribute to ZIKV control. We show that the magnitude and durability of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) induced by a secondary ZIKV infection is modest compared to the response induced after a secondary heterologous DENV infection. Our    in vivo results are showing a complex interplay between the cellular and innate immune responses characterized by a high frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) correlating with an increase in the frequency of DENV antigen specific T cells and a significant control of ZIKV replication which is time dependent. Taken together our results suggest that early after ZIKV infection other mechanisms such as the innate and cellular immune responses may play a predominant role in controlling ZIKV replication. Regardless of the time elapsed between infections there was no evidence of    in vivo antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV by DENV immunity. These findings have pivotal implications while interpreting ZIKV pathogenesis in flavivirus-experimented populations diagnostic results interpretation and vaccine designs and schedules among others.    ,
PMC7255596,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\119_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  From our previous work in non-human primates and others using humans we believe that previous DENV immunity confers some degree of protection against ZIKV infection. However at least two highly relevant questions remain unanswered. One is precisely if the time between primary DENV and a subsequent ZIKV infections may play a role in the degree of protection conferred by DENV immunity. The second question is related to the mechanisms of cross-protection. In this work we provide evidences that a period of 12 months between DENV and ZIKV infections has a significant impact controlling ZIKV replication compared to a shorter period of 3 months. We also provide evidences that the pre-existing DENV Abs play no role controlling early ZIKV replication. Our results strongly suggest that the mechanisms controlling ZIKV replication are related to the complex interaction between the innate and the cellular immune responses. Our results have significant implications for vaccine design and schedules.  ,
PMC7255645,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\120_20_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Background   Men who have sex with men (MSM) are vulnerable risk group for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. However some MSM do not disclose their same-sex behavior and could impact the transmission and prevention of HIV-1 infection. Here we evaluated the role of nondisclosed MSM in HIV-1 transmission in Guangzhou China.       Methods   The HIV-1     pol sequences were obtained from HIV-infected subjects from 2008 to 2015. A transmission network was constructed using HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE) at a pairwise genetic distance of 0.5%. The position of nondisclosed MSM in the network was determined by centrality analysis.          Results   Nondisclosed MSM were inferred in 9.92% (61 of 615) of slightly older self-reported non-MSM (    P = .006). They were more likely to be married (    P = .002) and less educated (    P &lt; .001) than the MSM with whom they clustered. Closeness centrality was bigger for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM (    P &lt; .001) indicating the central position of nondisclosed MSM in the networks. The average shortest path length was smaller for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM (    P &lt; .001) whereas radiality was bigger for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM suggesting a relatively greater contribution of nondisclosed MSM in transmitting HIV-1 than MSM. Assortativity analysis indicated that nondisclosed MSM were more likely to link each other with coefficient of 0.025.          Conclusions   Nondisclosed MSM are a specific group and they play an important role in HIV-1 transmission. They could be bisexual and might increase the risk of HIV-1 infection to their sex partners. Therefore specific prevention and intervention targeting nondisclosed MSM are urgently needed.    ,
PMC7256184,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\121_16_abstract.xml,   In July–December 2018 an outbreak of polio-like acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) occurred in Zhejiang province China. Enterovirus (EV)-D68 infection has been reported to be associated with AFM. This study aimed to investigate the clinical presentation laboratory findings and outcomes of AFM patients. We investigated the clinical and virologic information regarding the AFM patients and real-time PCR sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to investigate the cause of AFM. Eighteen cases met the definition of AFM with a median age of 4.05 years (range 0.9–9 years) and nine (50%) were EV-D68 positive. Symptoms included acute flaccid limb weakness and cranial nerve dysfunction. On magnetic resonance imaging 11 (61.1%) patients had spinal gray matter abnormalities. Electromyography results of 16 out of 17 patients (94.1%) were abnormal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis was common (94.4%) while CSF protein concentration was normal in all patients. There was little improvement after early aggressive therapy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that EV-D68 subclade B3 was the predominant lineage circulating in Zhejiang province in 2018.  ,
PMC7256917,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\122_13_abstract.xml,      Background   The seasonal influenza epidemic is an important public health issue worldwide. Early predictive identification of patients with potentially worse outcome is important in the emergency department (ED). Similarly as with bacterial infection influenza can cause sepsis. This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria and the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score as prognostic predictors for ED patients with influenza.       Methods   This single-center retrospective cohort study investigated data that was retrieved from a hospital-based research database. Adult ED patients (age ≥ 18 at admission) with laboratory-proven influenza from 2010 to 2016 were included for data analysis. The initial SIRS and qSOFA scores were both collected. The primary outcome was the utility of each score in the prediction of in-hospital mortality.       Results   For the study period 3561 patients met the study inclusion criteria. The overall in-hospital mortality was 2.7% (95 patients). When the qSOFA scores were 0 1 2 and 3 the percentages of in-hospital mortality were 0.6 7.2 15.9 and 25% respectively. Accordingly the odds ratios (ORs) were 7.72 11.92 and 22.46 respectively. The sensitivity and specificity was 24 and 96.2% respectively when the qSOFA score was ≥2. However the SIRS criteria showed no significant associations with the primary outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.864 which is significantly higher than that with SIRS where the AUC was 0.786 (    P &lt; 0.01).          Conclusions   The qSOFA score potentially is a useful prognostic predictor for influenza and could be applied in the ED as a risk stratification tool. However qSOFA may not be a good screening tool for triage because of its poor sensitivity. The SIRS criteria showed poor predictive performance in influenza for mortality as an outcome. Further research is needed to determine the role of these predictive tools in influenza and in other viral infections.    ,
PMC7258707,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\123_15_abstract.xml,   Research to discover and develop antibacterial and antiviral drugs with potent activity against pathogens of biothreat concern presents unique methodological and process-driven challenges. Herein we review laboratory approaches for finding new antibodies antibiotics and antiviral molecules for pathogens of biothreat concern. Using high-throughput screening techniques molecules that directly inhibit a pathogen’s entry replication or growth can be identified. Alternatively molecules that target host proteins can be interesting targets for development when countering biothreat pathogens due to the modulation of the host immune response or targeting proteins that interfere with the pathways required by the pathogen for replication. Monoclonal and cocktail antibody therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for countering anthrax and under development for treatment of Ebola virus infection are discussed. A comprehensive tabular review of current in vitro in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy datasets has been presented for biothreat pathogens of greatest concern. Finally clinical trials and animal rule or traditional drug approval pathways are also reviewed.  Opinions; interpretations; conclusions; and recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the US Army.  ,
PMC7259386,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\124_19_abstract.xml,   Purpose of review  The present review will outline neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating T cells during viral infections. Evidence demonstrating differential roles for antiviral effector and resident memory T-cell subsets in virologic control and immunopathology in the CNS will be discussed. Potential therapeutic targets emanating from a growing understanding of T-cell-initiated neuropathology that impacts learning and memory will also be delineated.     Recent findings   The critical role for T cells in preventing and clearing CNS infections became incontrovertible during the era of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Recent studies have further defined differential roles of T-cell subsets including resident memory T cells (Trm) in antiviral immunity and unexpectedly in postinfectious cognitive dysfunction. Mechanisms of T-cell-mediated effects include differential innate immune signaling within neural cells that are virus-specific.       Summary   T-cell cytokines that are essential for cell-mediated virologic control during neurotropic viral infections have recently been identified as potential targets to prevent post-infection memory disorders. Further identification of T-cell subsets their antigen specificity and postinfection localization of Trm will enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies through minimization of immunopathology.    ,
PMC7259492,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\125_22_abstract.xml,      Aedes aegypti and    Aedes albopictus are both vectors of Zika virus and both are endemic to the New Orleans Metropolitan area. Fortunately to date there has been no known autochthonous transmission of Zika virus in New Orleans. No studies of the vector competence of local populations of    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus for Zika virus transmission have been conducted. To determine if New Orleans    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus mosquitoes are competent for Zika virus mosquitoes were reared to generation F3 from eggs collected in New Orleans during the 2018 mosquito season. Adults were fed an infectious blood meal and kept for 15 days in an environmental chamber. Transmission assays were conducted at 4 10 and 15 days post exposure and RT-PCR was run on bodies and saliva to detect the presence of Zika virus RNA. We observed remarkably low susceptibility of both    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus from New Orleans to a Zika strain from Panama after oral challenge. These results suggest a limited risk of Zika virus transmission should it be introduced to the New Orleans area and may partially explain why no transmission was detected in Louisiana during the 2016 epidemic in the Americas despite multiple known travel associated introductions to New Orleans. Despite these results these mosquito populations are known to be competent vectors for some other mosquito-borne viruses and control measures should not be relaxed.    ,
PMC7259790,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\126_19_abstract.xml,   Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can additionally function as an innate immune response to viral infection as has been demonstrated for a number of arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses. Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors yet the majority of studies assessing autophagy-arbovirus interactions have been limited to the mammalian host. Therefore we evaluated the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of the invertebrate vector using the tractable Aag2    Aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture system. Our data demonstrates that autophagy is significantly induced in mosquito cells upon infection with two divergent arboviruses: dengue virus-2 (DENV-2;    Flaviviridae    Flavivirus) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV;    Togaviridae    Alphavirus). While assessing the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection we observed a somewhat paradoxical outcome. Both induction and suppression of autophagy via torin-1 and spautin-1 respectively resulted in increased viral titers for both viruses yet suppression of autophagy-related genes had no effect. Interestingly chemical modulators of autophagy had either no effect or opposite effects in another widely used mosquito cell line C6/36    Aedes albopictus cells. Together our data reveals a limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells. Further our findings suggest that commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy alter mosquito cells in such a way as to promote viral replication; however it is unclear if this occurs directly through autophagic manipulation or other means.    ,
PMC7259790,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\127_20_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses specifically those transmitted by    Aedes aegypti mosquitoes cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a continued public health threat worldwide. Many of these viruses lack vaccines or therapeutics and current mosquito control strategies are underperforming. For these reasons identifying vulnerabilities within the transmission cycle that can be targeted will be critical to the development of novel control interventions. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway and previous studies manipulating this pathway have shown promise in minimizing viral infections in mammalian hosts. In this study we examined arbovirus-autophagy interactions within mosquito cells. The goal was to elucidate the role of autophagy during infection of these cells in hopes of identifying critical interactions that can be targeted by novel approaches to block infection of and transmission by vector mosquitoes.    ,
PMC7260208,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\128_13_abstract.xml,   Dengue is the single most important human viral infection transmitted by insects. The function of the viral proteins andtheir interactions with the host cell is under exhaustive investigation with the aim of identifying antiviral strategies. Hereusing recombinant full-length dengue virus genomes carrying a fluorescent mCherry fused to capsid we studied biophysicalproperties of the viral protein during one infectious cycle in living cells. Dengue virus capsid protein associates to differentcellular compartments but its function in these locations is largely unknown. We evaluated the diffusion of capsid inside the celland determined a higher effective diffusion coefficient in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. Using advanced fluorescencecorrelation methods including the recently developed two-dimensional pair correlation analysis we constructed for the first timehigh resolution maps of capsid mobility in an infected cell. We observed that the motion of capsid in the nucleoplasm-nucleolusinterface was highly organized indicating an obstacle in this interface. Although nucleoli are membraneless structures theydisplayed liquid-liquid phase separation. Once inside nucleoli the protein showed isotropic mobility indicating free diffusion orimmobilized capsid inside these structures. This is the first study presenting spatial and temporal dynamics of the dengue viruscapsid protein during infection.  ,
PMC7261124,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\129_14_abstract.xml,      Background   Influenza A (H5N1) virus is a global concern with potential as a pandemic threat. High sequence variability of influenza A viruses is a major challenge for effective vaccine design. A continuing goal towards this is a greater understanding of influenza A (H5N1) proteome sequence diversity in the context of the immune system (antigenic diversity) the dynamics of mutation and effective strategies to overcome the diversity for vaccine design.       Methods   Herein we report a comprehensive study of the dynamics of H5N1 mutations by analysis of the aligned overlapping nonamer positions (1–9 2–10 etc.) of more than 13000 protein sequences of avian and human influenza A (H5N1) viruses reported over at least 50 years. Entropy calculations were performed on 9408 overlapping nonamer position of the proteome to study the diversity in the context of immune system. The nonamers represent the predominant length of the binding cores for peptides recognized by the cellular immune system. To further dissect the sequence diversity each overlapping nonamer position was quantitatively analyzed for four patterns of sequence diversity motifs: index major minor and unique.       Results   Almost all of the aligned overlapping nonamer positions of each viral proteome exhibited variants (major minor and unique) to the predominant index sequence. Each variant motif displayed a characteristic pattern of incidence change in relation to increased total variants. The major variant exhibited a restrictive pyramidal incidence pattern with peak incidence at 50% total variants. Post this peak incidence the minor variants became the predominant motif for majority of the positions. Unique variants each sequence observed only once were present at nearly all of the nonamer positions. The diversity motifs (index and variants) demonstrated complex inter-relationships with motif switching being a common phenomenon. Additionally 25 highly conserved sequences were identified to be shared across viruses of both hosts with half conserved to several other influenza A subtypes.       Discussion   The presence of distinct sequences (nonatypes) at nearly all nonamer positions represents a large repertoire of reported viral variants in the proteome which influence the variability dynamics of the viral population. This work elucidated and provided important insights on the components that make up the viral diversity delineating inherent patterns in the organization of sequence changes that function in the viral fitness-selection. Additionally it provides a catalogue of all the mutational changes involved in the dynamics of H5N1 viral diversity for both avian and human host populations. This work provides data relevant for the design of prophylactics and therapeutics that overcome the diversity of the virus and can aid in the surveillance of existing and future strains of influenza viruses.    ,
PMC7261188,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\130_21_abstract.xml,   Abstract  The    Bunyavirales order contains several emerging viruses with high epidemic potential including Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV). The lack of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and antivirals is a limiting factor for the containment of any virus outbreak. To develop such antivirals a profound understanding of the viral replication process is essential. The L protein of bunyaviruses is a multi-functional and multi-domain protein performing both virus transcription and genome replication and therefore is an ideal drug target. We established expression and purification procedures for the full-length L protein of SFTSV. By combining single-particle electron cryo-microscopy and X-ray crystallography we obtained 3D models covering ∼70% of the SFTSV L protein in the apo-conformation including the polymerase core region the endonuclease and the cap-binding domain. We compared this first L structure of the    Phenuiviridae family to the structures of La Crosse peribunyavirus L protein and influenza orthomyxovirus polymerase. Together with a comprehensive biochemical characterization of the distinct functions of SFTSV L protein this work provides a solid framework for future structural and functional studies of L protein–RNA interactions and the development of antiviral strategies against this group of emerging human pathogens.    ,

We analyzed the incubation period and generation time by using the maximum likelihood method assessed the symptom period and hospitalization duration using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the basic reproductive number and dormitory transmission rate by using established methods.       Results   The epidemic lasted for 30 days and 375 individuals were affected. Overall 109 patients were hospitalized and 266 individuals were isolated and treated. The median incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0 to 5.4 days). The median generation time was 7.3 days (95% CI: 7.1 to 7.6 days). The median symptom period was 6 days (95% CI: 6 to 7 days). The median hospitalization duration was 9 days (95% CI: 9 to 11 days). The basic reproductive number was 5.1 (95% CI: 4.6 to 5.6) and the dormitory transmission rate was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.18).       Conclusion   Patients in the early stage of the epidemic were treated as having a regular cold and were not isolated; therefore the virus continued to be transmitted to other susceptible individuals.    ,

At these scales the timing duration and magnitude of epidemics vary substantially but the underlying causes of this variation are poorly understood. Here based on analyses of a 15-year city-level dataset of 18250 laboratory-confirmed and antigenically-characterised influenza virus infections from Australia we investigate the effects of previously hypothesised environmental and virological drivers of influenza epidemics. We find that anomalous fluctuations in temperature and humidity do not predict local epidemic onset timings. We also find that virus antigenic change has no consistent effect on epidemic size. In contrast epidemic onset time and heterosubtypic competition have substantial effects on epidemic size and composition. Our findings suggest that the relationship between influenza population immunity and epidemiology is more complex than previously supposed and that the strong influence of short-term processes may hinder long-term epidemiological forecasts.  ,

PMC7266344,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\135_23_abstract.xml,      Background   The global spread of     Aedes albopictus has exposed new geographical areas to the risk of dengue and chikungunya virus transmission. Several autochthonous transmission events have occurred in recent decades in Southern Europe and many indicators suggest that it will become more frequent in this region in the future. Environmental socioeconomic and climatic factors are generally considered to trigger the emergence of these viruses. Accordingly a greater knowledge of the determinants of this emergence in a European context is necessary to develop adapted surveillance and control strategies and public health interventions.          Methodology/Principal findings   Using French surveillance data collected from between 2010 and 2018 in areas of Southern France where     Ae.     albopictus is already established we assessed factors associated with the autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya. Cases leading to autochthonous transmission were compared with those without subsequent transmission using binomial regression. We identified a long reporting delay (≥ 21 days) of imported cases to local health authorities as the main driver for autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya in Southern France. The presence of wooded areas around the cases’ place of residence and the accumulation of heat during the season also increased the risk of autochthonous arbovirus transmission.          Conclusions   Our findings could inform policy-makers when developing strategies to the emerging threats of dengue and chikungunya in Southern Europe and can be extrapolated in this area to other viruses such as Zika and yellow fever which share the same vector. Furthermore our results allow a more accurate characterization of the environments most at risk and highlight the importance of implementing surveillance systems which ensure the timely reporting and of imported cases and swift interventions.    ,
PMC7266344,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\136_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  The dengue chikungunya and Zika viruses have tremendously expanded their geographic range during recent decades and are now considered emerging threats in temperate areas. The increase in international travel and trade appear to be major factors encouraging both a circulation of these viruses on a global scale and the dispersion of one of their main vectors:    Aedes albopictus the tiger mosquito. However these two factors cannot fully explain the risk of viral emergence in temperate areas. Climatic factors land cover socioeconomic characteristics and public health systems also likely impact the risk of virus transmission. In this context we performed a statistical analysis of the different imported cases of dengue and chikungunya in Southern France where the tiger mosquito is already established. A comparison between contexts with local virus transmission and situations without local transmission made it possible to identify the factors associated with the risk of viral circulation. We found that a delay in reporting imported cases the presence of wooded areas around the cases’ places of residence and the accumulation of heat during the season all increased the risk of transmission. The identification of these conditions is therefore of primary importance both to determine the risk of the emergence of these viruses and to improve public health policies.    ,

Globally DF incidence and disease burden have increased in the recent past. Initially implicated in a 1982 outbreak DENV-2 recently reemerged in Kenya causing outbreaks between 2011 and 2014 and more recently 2017–8. The origin and the evolutionary patterns that may explain the epidemiological expansion and increasing impact of DENV-2 in Kenya remain poorly understood. Using whole-genome sequencing samples collected during the 2011–4 and 2017–8 dengue outbreaks were analyzed. Additional DENV-2 genomes were downloaded and pooled together with the fourteen genomes generated in this study. Bioinformatic methods were used to analyze phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary patterns of DENV-2 causing outbreaks in Kenya. The findings from this study have shown the first evidence of circulation of two different Cosmopolitan genotype lineages of DENV-2; Cosmopolitan-I (C-I) and Cosmopolitan-II (C-II) in Kenya. Our results put the origin location of C-I lineage in India in 2011 and C-II lineage in Burkina Faso between 1979 and 2013. C-I lineage was the most isolated during recent outbreaks thus showing the contribution of this newly emerged strain to the increased DENV epidemics in the region. Our findings backed by evidence of recent local epidemics that have been associated with C-I in Kenya and C-II in Burkina Faso add to the growing evidence of expanding circulation and the impact of multiple strains of DENV in the region as well as globally. Thus continued surveillance efforts on DENV activity and its evolutionary trends in the region would contribute toward effective control and the current vaccine development efforts.  ,

PMC7266596,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\139_17_abstract.xml,   Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) a member of the genus    Alphacoronavirus in the family    Coronaviridae causes acute diarrhea and/or vomiting dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets. Two different genogroups of PEDV S INDEL [PEDV variant containing multiple deletions and insertions in the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein G1b] and non-S INDEL (G2b) strains were detected during the diarrheal disease outbreak in US swine in 2013–2014. Similar viruses are also circulating globally. Continuous improvement and update of biosecurity and vaccine strains and protocols are still needed to control and prevent PEDV infections worldwide. Although the non-S INDEL PEDV was highly virulent and the S INDEL PEDV caused milder disease the latter has the capacity to cause illness in a high number of piglets on farms with low biosecurity and herd immunity. The main PEDV transmission route is fecal–oral but airborne transmission    via the fecal–nasal route may play a role in pig-to-pig and farm-to-farm spread. PEDV infection of neonatal pigs causes fecal virus shedding (alongside frequent detection of PEDV RNA in the nasal cavity) acute viremia severe atrophic enteritis (mainly jejunum and ileum) and increased pro-inflammatory and innate immune responses. PEDV-specific IgA effector and memory B cells in orally primed sows play a critical role in sow lactogenic immunity and passive protection of piglets. This review focuses on the etiology transmission pathogenesis and prevention and control of PEDV infection.    ,
PMC7266814,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\140_13_abstract.xml,   Influenza epidemics and pandemics are constant threats to global public health. Although strategies including vaccines and antiviral drugs have achieved great advances in controlling influenza virus infection the efficacy of these strategies is limited by the highly frequent mutations in the viral genome and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Our previous study indicated that boosting the immunity of human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells with the phosphoantigen pamidronate could be a therapeutic strategy to treat seasonal and avian influenza virus infections. However one notable drawback of γδ-T cell-based immunotherapy is the rapid exhaustion of proliferation and effector responses due to repeated treatments with phosphoantigens. Here we found that the expression of CD137 was inducible in Vγ9Vδ2-T cells following antigenic stimulation. CD137   + Vγ9Vδ2-T cells displayed more potent antiviral activity against influenza virus than their CD137   − counterparts in vitro and in Rag2   -/- γc   -/- mice. We further demonstrated that CD137 costimulation was essential for Vγ9Vδ2-T cell activation proliferation survival and effector functions. In humanized mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells CD137 costimulation with a recombinant human CD137L protein boosted the therapeutic effects of pamidronate against influenza virus. Our study provides a novel strategy of targeting CD137 to improve the efficacy of Vγ9Vδ2-T cell-based immunotherapy.    ,

The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and determinants of     T. pallidum infection in the region.          Methods   A community-based cross-sectional study of 2608 participants aged ≥14 years was conducted in a rural area of southwestern China in 2014–15. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic characteristics and other factors associated with     T. pallidum infection. The diagnoses of     T. pallidum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were determined by commercial test kits. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the correlates for     T. pallidum infection and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.          Results   The prevalence of     T. pallidum infection was 1.2% (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7%). Risk factors varied by gender. In the male group     T. pallidum infection was significantly associated with ever injection drug use (aOR = 9.42 95% CI 2.47 to 35.87) and HCV infection (aOR = 13.28 95% CI 3.20 to 51.70). In the female group correlates for     T. pallidum infection included spouse having syphilis (aOR = 126.66 95% CI 7.58 to 2122.94) ever having blood transfusion (aOR = 10.51 95% CI 1.58 to 41.21) and HBV infection (aOR = 4.19 95% CI 1.35 to 10.93).          Conclusions   The prevalence of     T. pallidum infection was high in the rural area of southwestern China. Correlates for     T. pallidum infection varied with sex specific. Intervention should be developed for the prevention and control of     T. pallidum infection.       ,
PMC7269036,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\143_17_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as an antiviral factor can inhibit replication of several viruses including influenza virus. A single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12252-C of    IFITM3 results in a truncated IFITM3 protein lacking its first 21 amino acids which is much higher in the Han Chinese population and associated with severe illness in adults infected with pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus. To investigate if IFITM3 or    IFITM3 rs12252-C could affect the antibody response after influenza vaccination we detected the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) of 171 healthy young adult volunteers (   IFITM3 rs12252-C/C C/T T/T carriers) and in an IFITM3-deletion mouse model (   Ifitm3    -/-   ) after trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) immunization. Seroconversion rates for H1N1 H3N2 and B viruses in    IFITM3 rs12252-C/C genotype carriers was lower compared with C/T and T/T donors   . Significantly lower levels of specific antibodies to H1N1 H3N2 and B viruses and total IgG were observed in    Ifitm3    -/-    mice. Correspondingly the numbers of splenic germinal centre (GC) B cells plasma cells TIV-specific IgG   + antibody secreting cells and T follicular helper cells in    Ifitm3    -/-    mice were lower compared with wild type mice. However the number of memory B cells was higher in    Ifitm3    -/-    mice at day 7 after booster. The HI level of    Ifitm3    -/-    mice remained lower than WT mice after third vaccination. Moreover the transcriptional network regulating GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation was abnormal in    Ifitm3    -/-    mice. Our results indicate that IFITM3 deletion attenuated the antibody response. The mechanism of influenza-IFITM3 interactions affecting the antibody response requires further investigation.    ,

Yet emerging Nipah Ebola and Zika viral diseases outbreaks have been indirectly linked to substantially globalization of trade and travel climate change and intense urbanization impact healthcare and socioeconomic inequities as well in affected community settings. Although no case has been documented in Saudi Arabia there is a great risk of sudden emergence of any of these viruses and others via introducing among pilgrims coming from endemic regions during ritual ceremonies of mass gatherings. Consequently promoting and investing on new and sensitive proven effective and innovative surveillance and monitoring approaches including enhanced risk communication improved integrated vectors surveillance in addition to improved sustainable highly pathogens surveillance control programs to human motility and environmental sanitation strategies all represent ‘One Health’ approach implementation strategic core. Initiation development and implementation leaded by Saudi government and international stakeholders’ of new partnership coordinated response leadership and resource mobilization for multidisciplinary and intersectorial advocacy on emerging viral disease outbreaks accompanied with R&amp;D roadmap and taskforce is crucial. More efforts in epidemiological and laboratory early screening and surveillance of highly pathogenic germs/microbes and confirmation of asymptomatic and syndromic cases amongst suspected Hajj and Umrah pilgrims local vulnerable populations and expatriate workers is vital in generating reliable data and data sharing platform for timely risk communication and tourist information update appropriate immunization campaigns or safe and efficacious care delivery implementation. Moreover increase Hajj/Umrah mass gathering emergency outbreak preparedness pilgrims health education and engagement outreach pre- during and post programs coverage and effectiveness is needed through One Health approach integration in attaining pilgrims and local population health safety and security in advancing Saudi sustainable health development goals.  ,
PMC7270913,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\145_19_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Presently several evidences support an association between acute myocardial infarction and influenza infection. The pathophysiology rationale rests on the release of inflammation cytokines rupture of atherosclerotic plaque and triggering of prothrombotic events leading to coronary artery occlusion. Several observational evidences support a potential role of influenza vaccine in cardiovascular prevention. It is estimated that the efficacy of influenza vaccine in preventing myocardial infarction could range between 15% and 45%. Notwithstanding the clear recommendation of numerous guidelines concerning patients with cardiovascular diseases vaccination rates are still low in the high-risk groups. Influenza vaccine as preventive measure of cardiovascular disease still awaits support from randomized clinical trials. Nonetheless considering the favourable cost-efficacy and safety profile of influenza vaccination its use should be encouraged in everyday clinical practice.  ,
PMC7271460,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\146_13_abstract.xml,      Background   There is scare information about HIV co-infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) among People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) in Mozambique. This information is critical to ensure the treatment necessary to decrease the progression of liver disease and the transmission of both HIV and hepatitis. We assess the prevalence of HIV HBV and HCV co-infections as well as associated risk factors among PWID.       Methods   The first Bio-Behavioral Surveillance Survey was conducted in 2013–2014 among persons who self-reported to have ever injected drugs. Using respondent-driven sampling PWID aged 18 years and older were recruited in two cross-sectional samples in Maputo and Nampula/Nacala two large urban centers of Mozambique. Rapid screening of HIV HBV (HBsAg) and HCV was performed on site. Data from participants in both cities were pooled to conduct RDS-weighted bivariate analyses with HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections as separate outcomes. Unweighted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess correlates of co-infection.       Results   Among 492 eligible PWID 93.3% were male and median age was 32 years [IQR: 27–36]. HIV HBV and HCV prevalence were respectively 44.9% (95% CI:37.6–52.3) 32.8% (95% CI:26.3–39.5) and 38.3 (95% CI:30.6–45.9). Co-infections of HIV/HBV HIV/HCV and HIV/HBV/HCV were identified in 13.1% (95% CI:7.2–18.9) 29.5% (95% CI:22.2–36.8) and 9.2% (95% CI:3.7–14.7) of PWID respectively. Older age history of needle/syringe sharing and history of injection with used needle/syringe was associated with HIV/HBV co-infection. Living in Maputo city have older age history of needle/syringe sharing and history of injection with used needle/syringe was associated with HIV/HCV co-infection.       Conclusion   There is a high burden of HBV and HCV among HIV-infected PWID in Mozambique. Our results highlight the need for targeted harm reduction interventions that include needle exchange programs and integrated services for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV HBV and HCV to address these epidemics among PWID. Efforts should be made to strengthen ART coverage in the population as an important treatment strategy for both viruses.    ,
PMC7272714,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\147_17_abstract.xml,   The trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was the only approved and available vaccine during the 2016–2018 influenza seasons. It did not include the B/Yamagata strain. In this study we report an acute respiratory disease outbreak associated with influenza B/Yamagata infections in Guangzhou Southern China (January through March 2018). Among the 9914 patients 2241 (22.6%) were positive for the influenza B virus with only 312 (3.1%) positive for the influenza A virus. The influenza B/Yamagata lineage dominated during this period in Southern China. The highest incidence of influenza A virus infection occurred in the children aged 5–14 years. In contrast populations across all age groups were susceptible to the influenza B virus. Phylogenetic mutations and 3D structure analyses of hemagglutinin (HA) genes were performed to assess the vaccine-virus relatedness. The recommended A/H1N1 vaccine strain (A/Michigan/45/2015) during both 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 was antigen-specific for these circulating isolates (clade 6B.1) in Spring 2018. An outbreak of influenza B/Yamagata (clade 3) infections in 2018 occurred during the absence of the corresponding vaccine during 2016–2018. The recommended influenza B/Yamagata vaccine strain (B/Phuket/3073/2013) for the following season (2018–2019) was antigen-specific. Although there were only a few influenza B/Victoria infections in Spring 2018 five amino acid mutations were identified in the HA antigenic sites of the 19 B/Victoria isolates (clade 1A) when compared with the 2016–2018 B/Victoria vaccine strain. The number was larger than expected and suggested that the influenza B HA gene may be more variable than previously thought. One of the mutations (K180N) was noted to likely alter the epitope and to potentially affect the viral antigenicity. Seven mutations were also identified in the HA antigenic sites of 2018–2020 B/Victoria vaccine strain of which some or all may reduce immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of the vaccine perhaps leading to more outbreaks in subsequent seasons. The combined epidemiological phylogenetic mutations and 3D structural analyses of the HA genes of influenza strains reported here contribute to the understanding and evaluation of how HA mutations affect vaccine efficacy as well as to providing important data for screening and selecting more specific appropriate and effective influenza vaccine candidate strains.  ,
PMC7273724,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\148_19_abstract.xml,   Cross-subtype neutralizing single domain antibodies against influenza present new opportunities for immunoprophylaxis and pandemic preparedness. Their simple modular structure and single open reading frame format are highly amenable to gene therapy-mediated delivery. We have previously described R1a-B6 an alpaca-derived single domain antibody (nanobody) that is capable of potent cross-subtype neutralization    in vitro of H1N1 H5N1 H2N2 and H9N2 influenza viruses through binding to a highly conserved epitope in the influenza hemagglutinin stem region. To evaluate the potential of R1a-B6 for immunoprophylaxis we have reformatted it as an Fc fusion for adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector delivery. Our findings demonstrate that a single intramuscular injection in mice of AAV encoding R1a-B6 fused to Fc fragments of different isotypes equipped either with or without antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity was able to drive sustained high-level expression (0.5–1.1 mg/mL) in sera with no evidence of reduction for up to 6 months. R1a-B6-Fc fusions of both isotypes gave complete protection against lethal challenge with both pandemic A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 and avian influenza A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1). This data suggests that R1a-B6 is capable of cross-subtype protection and ADCC was not essential for R1a-B6 efficacy. Our findings demonstrate AAV delivery of cross-subtype neutralizing nanobodies may be an effective strategy to prevent influenza infection and provide long-term protection independent of a host induced immune response.    ,

In this study we conducted virological and molecular biological laboratory tests on JE case samples (serum/cerebrospinal fluid) and locally collected mosquito samples from the 2018 JE outbreak in Ningxia China. The result of JEV IgM antibody detection showed that 96% (67/70) of the suspected cases were laboratory-confirmed JE cases. Of the mosquitoes collected from local environments 70% (17400/24900) were    Culex tritaeniorhynchus of which 4.6% (16 /348 of the pools tested) were positive for JEV other mosquitoes were negative. JEVs isolated from both the human cases and    C.    tritaeniorhynchus specimens belong to JEV GIb and are in the same evolutionary clade according to molecular evolution analyses.    JEV GIb was detected simultaneously from specimens of JE cases and mosquito samples collected in nature in this study suggesting that the JE outbreak that occurred in Ningxia in 2018 was due to infection of JEV GIb.  ,

Its genotype is divided into GI-V. In recent years JEV GIb (a temperate genotype) has gradually replaced GIII as the prevalent strain in JE endemic areas. Although JEV GIb originated from tropical Asia along with JEV GIa it has rapidly spread for its advantages in wintering and infecting vectors. Although there have been epidemics caused by JEV GI and GIII there have been no reports of a JE outbreak caused by JEV GIb alone in northeastern Asia. However a JE outbreak occurred in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northern China in summer 2018 which was the first outbreak in Ningxia in recent decades. This paper presents a series of laboratory and field studies of this outbreak. The strain isolated from JE cases as well as JEV detected in    Culex tritaeniorhynchus collected from local areas in nature all belonged to JEV GIb and were in the same evolutionary clade. This is the first report of a JE outbreak caused by JEV GIb infection in northeastern Asia (latitude 35 ° 14’– 39 ° 23’ N longitude 104 ° 17’– 107 ° 39’ E) which used to be a low endemic area of JEV GIII.    ,

Here we develop an analytical framework to jointly assess MAYV epidemiology and the extent of cross-reactivity with CHIKV from serological data collected throughout French Guiana (N = 2697). We find strong evidence of an important sylvatic cycle for MAYV with most infections occurring near the natural reservoir in rural areas and in individuals more likely to go to the forest (i.e. adult males) and with seroprevalences of up to 18% in some areas. These findings highlight the need to strengthen MAYV surveillance in the region and showcase how modeling can improve interpretation of cross-reacting assays.  ,

PMC7277729,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\153_19_abstract.xml,      Background: Chikungunya fever is caused by the chikungunya virus. Numerous factors affect the risk of chikungunya transmission. This study explored the epidemiological characteristics differences and trends in domestic and imported cases of chikungunya fever in Taiwan in terms of patient sex age month of confirmation and area of residence from 2007 to 2019.    Methods: Public annual chikungunya data from Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were analyzed. In total 21 confirmed domestic and 198 imported cases of chikungunya were reported. Of the domestic cases one was sporadic and reported in July 2019 and 20 were attributed to a cluster event during August and September 2019.    Results: In a comparison between domestic and imported cases reported from July to October 2019 differences in sex were nonsignificant (   p = 0.555) whereas significant differences were observed for age (   p &lt; 0.001) month of confirmation (   p = 0.005) and place of residence (   p = 0.001). An age of 69–69 years (odds ratio (OR) = 6.66 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 2.15–20.65) month of confirmation of September (OR = 5.25 95%CI = 1.89–14.61) and place of residence of New Taipei City (OR = 48.70 95%CI = 6.17–384.44) were identified as potential risk factors. Additionally domestic cases in August and September 2019 increased in proportion to the increase in imported cases during July and August 2019. Increased domestic patients may have been caused by the domestic mosquitoes that transmitted the virus by biting the imported patients to Taiwan. This is the first report comparing domestic and imported cases of chikungunya from surveillance data from the Taiwan CDC from 2007 to 2019.    Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of longitudinal and geographically extended studies to understand the implications of zoonotic disease transmission on Taiwan’s population. Critical data were identified to inform future surveillance and research efforts in Taiwan.    ,

CE 429/2016) which will be implemented in 2021. The article describes the major changes and modifications related to notifiable diseases of sheep and goats and outlines the approach that will be taken for their surveillance and control. It explains the objective of the European Commission in applying a modern animal health system based on risk assessment updated scientific knowledge epidemiology and a new culture of European diseases prevention. Five categories of diseases are recognized. Category A diseases are not usually present in the EU which must be immediately eradicated. Category B diseases must be controlled in member states and eventually eradicated while category C diseases are present in some MS which must be prevented from spreading to disease-free states. Category D diseases only present moderate risk but necessitate measures such as movement control to prevent their spread among MS or their entry into the EU and category E diseases need surveillance. Lastly differences between the previous Italian regulations and the new EU law are highlighted.       Abstract   After almost 40 years the 27 member states (MS) of the European Union (EU) will comply with the European Law 429/2016 in 2021 by completing a process of unification and harmonization of all regulations related to animal health between MS. These new provisions are based on modern scientific principles on animal health on long-term epidemiological data and above all on the most current risk assessment and analysis. The paper describes all changes and updates which will impact the Italian current National regulation. A total of 58 animal diseases have been included in the Annex II (“Listing”) and Annex IV (“Categorization”) of the new Delegated Act (DA 2018/1629). Five diseases comprising the great viral epizooties were automatically included on the list because of their primary importance. These diseases include foot and mouth disease (FMD) African swine fever (ASF) classical swine fever (CSF) highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and African horse sickness (AHS). Another 53 diseases have been identified by the ad hoc assessment on listing and categorization of animal diseases developed by the European Food Safety Association. Seventeen communicable diseases of the Order Artiodactlya (sheep goats deer etc.) have been listed including foot and mouth disease sheep and goat pox and pestes de petits ruminants. In addition other endemic diseases affecting more than one species include blue tongue tuberculosis brucellosis and anthrax. There are five categories (A-E) based on the degree of action to be undertaken throughout the EU for each disease. These vary from complete eradication for diseases not normally found in the EU like FMD (category A) for establishing surveillance for diseases like West Nile that present high risk but lack control tools (category E).    ,

The acute infections look similar with regard to histologic features with spotty necrosis throughout the lobules hepatocyte unrest swelling and apoptosis and portal tract and intrasinusoidal inflammation chiefly lymphocytes. The differential diagnosis histologically includes drug-induced liver injury. Structural differences and epidemiology define the major differences in the course of each of these viral infections. Hepatitis A and E are similar in causing only acute hepatitis while some cases of hepatitis B and many of hepatitis C become chronic. The prevalence of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection has seen a reduction worldwide due to hepatitis B vaccination programs. Nonetheless major cities with continued intravenous drug use remain reservoirs with a rate of approximately 8% in Europe. The availability of direct-acting viral agents is spearheading efforts by WHO to eliminate new and chronic HCV infections by 2019. Histologic cholestasis may be a particular feature of acute hepatitis E. It should be noted that hepatitis E virus has four major genotypes of which 1 and 2 infect humans (resulting in travel/endemic-related hepatitis with cholestasis and high mortality in pregnant women) and 3 and 4 are zoonotic and infect pigs boar and several other animal and avian species (and may cause hepatitis associated with poorly or uncooked meat).  ,
PMC7279256,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\156_16_abstract.xml,   Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is emerging as the primary cause of acute viral hepatitis in humans. The virus is commonly transmitted by the fecal–oral route via contaminated water in endemic regions or through the consumption of inadequately cooked swine products or game meats in industrialized regions. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are predominantly associated with waterborne transmission in developing countries whereas    HEV3 and    HEV4 are mainly zoonotically transmitted in industrialized countries. Seroprevalence in populations determined by detecting anti-HEV antibodies and serum HEV RNA is commonly used to analyze the presence of HEV. Although HEV RNA-based detection is now standardized there is a lack of agreement between the assaying methods used for gathering seroprevalence data. Since 2004 HEV has been considered as a transmissible infectious agent through blood transfusion. Recent seroprevalence studies in European countries indicate an underestimated risk for blood transfusion and hence warrant testing the blood supply. HEV infection is usually self-limiting and spontaneously cleared. However in about 60% of recipients of solid organ transplants HEV progresses to chronic hepatitis. Immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus are a major cause of chronic hepatitis and reducing its dosage results in viral clearance in about 30% of patients. In hemodialysis patients the parenteral route is implicated as an important mechanism of transmission. In this review we explore the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of various HEV genotypes in blood donors hemodialysis patients and transplant recipients.    ,
PMC7279404,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\157_20_abstract.xml,   During the progression from hepatitis to fibrosis cirrhosis and liver failure the accumulation of stressed/damaged hepatocyte elements associated with liver inflammation is critical. The causes of hepatocyte injuries include viral hepatitis infections alcoholic hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (Hep-EVs) released from stressed/damaged hepatocytes are partly responsible for liver disease progression and liver damage because they activate non-parenchymal cells and infiltrate inflammatory cells within the liver which are in turn are an important source of EVs. This cell-to-cell signaling is prevalent during inflammation in many liver diseases. Accordingly special emphasis should be placed on liquid biopsy methods for the long-term monitoring of chronic liver diseases. In the present review we have highlighted various aspects of current liquid biopsy research into chronic liver diseases. We have also reviewed recent progress on liquid biopsies that focus on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and the proteins in EVs as potential diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic targets in patients with viral hepatitis fatty liver steatosis and alcoholic liver diseases.  ,
PMC7282336,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\158_18_abstract.xml,      Objectives   Hepatitis A incidence in Korea has dramatically increased in recent years. Individuals in their twenties and thirties who account for majority of the workforce in Korea are particularly susceptible to infection owing to a low seroprevalence of anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) immunoglobulin G (IgG). This study aimed to identify behavioural and occupational factors related to anti-HAV IgG seropositivity.       Design   Cross-sectional study.       Setting   A large university hospital in Seoul Korea.       Participants   Workers in formal employment having an annual routine health screening.       Primary outcome measure   Anti-HAV IgG seropositivity.       Results   Of 131 711 individuals who had an annual health screening at the study hospital in 2018 68 612 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Study participants were predominantly men (64.3%) and in their thirties (55.3%). The overall seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG was 36.2%. In multivariate analyses anti-HAV IgG seropositivity was independently associated with working in a workplace with ≥2 health managers (vs no health manager adjusted OR 1.32 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43); age 40–49 years (vs 20–29 years OR 2.51 95% CI 2.36 to 2.68); female sex (OR 1.54 95% CI 1.48 to 1.59); experience of any general disease (vs no general disease history OR 1.19 95% CI 1.14 to 1.25) obesity (vs normal weight OR 0.91 95% CI 0.86 to 0.97); and hepatitis B antibody seropositivity (OR 2.39 95% CI 2.31 to 2.49).       Conclusions   The low prevalence of anti-HAV IgG seropositivity points to a need for implementation of workplace-based hepatitis A vaccine programmes. To promote workers’ health and prevent hepatitis A outbreaks occupational health managers healthcare providers and policy-makers should focus on individuals who are susceptible to HAV such as young men.    ,

These influenza viruses are evolutionarily distinct are poorly adapted to laboratory mice and ferrets and cannot reassort    in vitro with conventional strains to form new influenza subtypes. However they have attracted renewed attention following reports that their entry in host cells is mediated by the trans-species conserved MHC-II proteins suggesting that they hold zoonotic potential. Despite the recent studies the viruses' epidemiology and public health significance remain incompletely understood. Delineating the mechanistic basis of the interactions with their hosts and assessing their global distribution are essential in order to fully assess the zoonotic threat that these strains pose.    ,
PMC7283535,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\160_16_abstract.xml,   In the last century life expectancy has increased considerably thanks to the introduction of antibiotics hygiene and vaccines that have contributed to the cure and prevention of many infectious diseases. The era of antimicrobial therapy started in the nineteenth century with the identification of chemical compounds with antimicrobial properties. However immediately after the introduction of these novel drugs microorganisms started to become resistant through different strategies. Although resistance mechanisms were already present before antibiotic introduction their large-scale use and mis-use have increased the number of resistant microorganisms. Rapid spreading of mobile elements by horizontal gene transfer such as plasmids and integrative conjugative elements (ICE) carrying multiple resistance genes has dramatically increased the worldwide prevalence of relevant multi drug-resistant human pathogens such as    Staphylococcus aureus Neisseria gonorrhoeae and    Enterobacteriaceae. Today antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of the major global concerns to be addressed and only global efforts could help in finding a solution. In terms of magnitude the economic impact of AMR is estimated to be comparable to that of climate global change in 2030. Although antibiotics continue to be essential to treat such infections non-antibiotic therapies will play an important role in limiting the increase of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Among non-antibiotic strategies vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) play a strategic role. In this review we will summarize the evolution and the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and the impact of AMR on life expectancy and economics.    ,

After the collection of organic molecules from dental pulp they were investigated for pathogen identification based on the analysis of DNA and protein. Actually DNA approach takes a principal role in diagnosis while the protein approach is more and more used. A total of seven techniques was used and ten bacteria (    Yersinia pestis     Bartonella quintana     Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi     Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C     Mycobacterium leprae     Mycobacterium tuberculosis     Rickettsia prowazeki     Staphylococcus aureus     Borrelia recurrentis     Bartonella henselae) and one virus (    Anelloviridae) were identified.     Y. pestis had the most published in quantity and all methods were investigated for this pathogen     S. aureus and     B. recurrentis were identified by three different methods and others only by one. The combining methods interestingly increase the positive rate with ELISA PCR and iPCR in     Yersinia pestis diagnosis. Twenty‐seven ancient genomes of     Y. pestis and one ancient genome of     B. recurrentis were reconstructed. Comparing to the ancient bone ancient teeth showed more advantage in septicemic diagnosis. Beside pathogen identification ancient pulp help to distinguish species.          Conclusions   Dental pulp with specific tissue is a suitable sample for detection of the blood infection in the past through DNA and protein identification with the correct preparation process furthermore it helps to more understand the pathogens of historic diseases and epidemics.    ,

Ongoing events such as climate change changes in agricultural practices globalization of markets or changes in plant virus vector populations are affecting plant virus life cycles. Because farmer’s fields are part of the larger environment the role of wild plant species in plant virus life cycles can provide information about underlying processes during virus transmission and spread. This review focuses on the    Solanaceae family which contains thousands of species growing all around the world including crop species wild flora and model plants for genetic research. In a first part we analyze various viruses infecting    Solanaceae plants across the agro-ecological interface emphasizing the important role of virus interactions between the cultivated and wild zones as global changes affect these environments on both local and global scales. To cope with these changes it is necessary to adjust prophylactic protection measures and diagnostic methods. As illustrated in the second part a complex virus research at the landscape level is necessary to obtain relevant data which could be overwhelming. Based on evidence from previous studies we conclude that    Solanaceae plant communities can be targeted to address complete life cycles of viruses with different life strategies within the agro-ecological interface. Data obtained from such research could then be used to improve plant protection methods by taking into consideration environmental factors that are impacting the life cycles of plant viruses.    ,
PMC7285376,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\164_18_abstract.xml,   Influenza viruses arise from animal reservoirs and have the potential to cause pandemics. In 2013 low pathogenic novel avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses emerged in China resulting from the reassortment of avian-origin viruses. Following evolutionary changes highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses emerged in late 2016. Changes in pathogenicity and virulence of H7N9 viruses have been linked to potential mutations in the viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) as well as the viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2). Recognizing that effective viral transmission of the influenza A virus (IAV) between humans requires efficient attachment to the upper respiratory tract and replication through the viral polymerase complex experimental evidence demonstrates the potential H7N9 has for increased binding affinity and replication following specific amino acid substitutions in HA and PB2. Additionally the deletion of extended amino acid sequences in the NA stalk length was shown to produce a significant increase in pathogenicity in mice. Research shows that significant changes in transmissibility pathogenicity and virulence are possible after one or a few amino acid substitutions. This review aims to summarise key findings from that research. To date all strains of H7N9 viruses remain restricted to avian reservoirs with no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission although mutations in specific viral proteins reveal the efficacy with which these viruses could evolve into a highly virulent and infectious human-to-human transmitted virus.  ,
PMC7286216,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\165_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Hepatitis E virus (HEV) generally causes self-limiting viral hepatitis. However in pregnant women HEV infection can be severe and has been associated with up to 30% mortality in the third trimester. Additionally HEV infection in pregnancy is also associated with high rates of preterm labor and vertical transmission.       Main body   HEV is now recognized as a global health problem in both developing and industrialized countries. HEV can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route zoonotic route and blood transfusion route. An altered immune status hormonal levels and viral factors may be related to the severity of the disease. Currently no established treatment is available for HEV in pregnant women. A Chinese vaccine has been demonstrated to be protective against HEV in the general population and seems to be safe in pregnancy; however its safety and efficacy in a large population of pregnant women remain to be determined.       Conclusion   This review summarizes the current knowledge about HEV infection during pregnancy and focuses on the epidemiology clinical manifestations mechanisms underlying severe liver injury and management and prevention of HEV infection during pregnancy. Considering that HEV infection during pregnancy may result in poor outcomes screening for and monitoring HEV infection early in pregnancy should be taken into account. In addition a better understanding of the pathogenesis will help to develop potential treatment strategies targeting HEV infection in pregnancy.    ,
PMC7286522,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\166_22_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus that causes a febrile illness accompanied by myalgia and arthralgia. Despite having re-emerged as a significant public health threat there are no approved therapeutics or prophylactics for CHIKV infection. In this study we explored the anti-CHIKV effects of proteasome inhibitors and their potential mechanism of antiviral action. A panel of proteasome inhibitors with different functional groups reduced CHIKV infectious titers in a dose-dependent manner. Bortezomib which has been FDA-approved for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma was further investigated in downstream studies. The inhibitory activities of bortezomib were confirmed using different cellular models and CHIKV strains. Time-of-addition and time-of-removal studies suggested that bortezomib inhibited CHIKV at an early post-entry stage of replication. In western blot analysis bortezomib treatment resulted in a prominent decrease in structural protein levels as early as 6 hpi. Contrastingly nsP4 levels showed strong elevations across all time-points. NsP2 and nsP3 levels showed a fluctuating trend with some elevations between 12 to 20 hpi. Finally qRT-PCR data revealed increased levels of both positive- and negative-sense CHIKV RNA at late stages of infection. It is likely that the reductions in structural protein levels is a major factor in the observed reductions in virus titer with the alterations in non-structural protein ratios potentially being a contributing factor. Proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib likely disrupt CHIKV replication through a variety of complex mechanisms and may display a potential for use as therapeutics against CHIKV infection. They also represent valuable tools for studies of CHIKV molecular biology and virus-host interactions.  ,
PMC7286522,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\167_23_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes an illness with debilitating muscle and joint pain. CHIKV has infected millions in a continued wave of outbreaks worldwide. Despite this there are no approved antivirals or vaccines against CHIKV infection. In this study we explored the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors against CHIKV. A panel of proteasome inhibitors was found to reduce CHIKV titres in CHIKV-infected cells. We selected bortezomib an FDA-approved drug for further investigation into its antiviral mechanism. We confirmed the anti-CHIKV effects of bortezomib using different cell lines and CHIKV strains. We found that bortezomib resulted in a major decrease in levels of CHIKV structural proteins which are involved in formation of progeny virus particles. Bortezomib treatment also prominently increased synthesis of viral replicase components and increased CHIKV RNA synthesis. We propose that proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib are likely to inhibit CHIKV through various mechanisms that ultimately lead to a decrease in structural proteins and infectious viral progeny. This study suggests that proteasome inhibitors display a potential for further development as antivirals against CHIKV infection and may be useful tools to study CHIKV molecular biology and virus-host interactions.  ,
PMC7288254,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\168_13_abstract.xml,   Oncolytic viruses constitute an emerging strategy in immunomodulatory cancer treatment. The first oncolytic virus Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) based on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2015. The field of oncolytic virotherapy is still in its beginnings since many promising viruses remain only superficially explored. Influenza A virus causes a highly immunogenic acute infection but never leads to a chronic disease. While oncolytic influenza A viruses are in preclinical development they have not made the transition into clinical practice yet. Recent insights into different types of cell death caused by influenza A virus infection illuminate novel possibilities of enhancing its therapeutic effect. Genetic engineering and experience in influenza A virus vaccine development allow safe application of the virus in patients. In this review we give a summary of efforts undertaken to develop oncolytic influenza A viruses. We discuss strategies for targeting viral replication to cancerous lesions and arming them with immunogenic transgenes. We furthermore describe which modes of cell death are induced by influenza A virus infection and how these insights may be utilized to optimize influenza A virus-based oncolytic virus design.  ,
PMC7289343,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\169_22_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne infection that is emerging in temperate areas of Europe following the expansion of one of its vector species    Aedes albopictus. Although CHIKV fever is a self-limiting disease with a clinical syndrome often resolving within few days it can also cause severe sequelae including chronic polyarthralgia lasting up to 5 years. Additionally CHIKV outbreaks may limit blood bank donations adding economic burden on the health system. Public health authorities in Europe need to increase their preparedness against this emerging threat. Two large CHIKV outbreaks occurred in Italy in 2007 and 2017 with hundreds of cases and significant geographical spread. The aim of this paper is to review and compare the 2 Italian outbreaks in terms of available estimates of key epidemiological features patient clinical presentation virus and immunological characteristics and public health response. Recommendations for public health and future directions for research are also discussed and highlighted.       Key results   Both outbreaks started in small towns but cases were also detected in nearby larger cities where transmission was limited to small clusters. The time spans between the first and the last symptom onsets were similar between the 2 outbreaks and the delay from the symptom onset of the index case and the first case notified was considerable. Comparable infection and transmission rates were observed in laboratory. The basic reproductive number (R    0) was estimated in the range of 1.8–6 (2007) and 1.5–2.6 (2017). Clinical characteristics were similar between outbreaks and no acute complications were reported though a higher frequency of ocular symptoms myalgia and rash was observed in 2017. Very little is known about the immune mediator profile of CHIKV-infected patients during the 2 outbreaks. Regarding public health responses after the 2007 outbreak the Italian Ministry of Health developed national guidelines to implement surveillance and good practices to prevent and control autochthonous transmission. However only a few regional authorities implemented it and the perception of outbreak risk and knowledge of clinical symptoms and transmission dynamics by general practitioners remained low.          Major conclusions   Efforts should be devoted to developing suitable procedures for early detection of virus circulation in the population possibly through the analysis of medical records in near real time. Increasing the awareness of CHIKV of general practitioners and public health officials through tailored education may be effective especially in small coastal towns where the outbreak risk may be higher. A key element is also the shift of citizen awareness from considering     Aedes mosquitoes not only as a nuisance problem but also as a public health one. We advocate the need of strengthening the surveillance and of promoting the active participation of the communities to prevent and contain future outbreaks.       ,

CHIKV is an example of a neglected emerging disease transmitted by the alien mosquitoes    Ae.    albopictus that caused 2 large outbreaks in Italy in 2007 and 2017.

PMC7289416,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\171_19_abstract.xml,      Objectives   Larval indices have been used for     Ae.     albopictus surveillance for many years while there is limited use in assessing dengue transmission risk and adult mosquito emergence. This study is aimed to explore the relationships between larval indices and the     Ae.     albopictus density captured by BG-mosquito trap (BG-trap) method with considering the meteorological factors.          Methods   Data on larval density adult mosquito density and meteorology factors were collected in an entomological survey carried out in Quzhou City Zhejiang Province of China in 2018. The Spearman’s rank correlation and Pearson correlation were used for the analysis on the correlation of density indices. Generalized additive models were established to analyze the influencing factors of mosquito density.       Results   Breteau index (BI) House index (HI) and Container index (CI) were highly correlated with each other (r&gt;0.7 p&lt;0.05). The     Ae.     albopictus density was significantly correlated with CI (rs = 0.260 p&lt;0.05) CI pre one week (rs = 0.259 p&lt;0.05) and CI pre three weeks (rs = 0.329 p&lt;0.05). BI was correlated with female     Ae.     albopictus density pre 4 weeks (r = -0.299 p&lt;0.05). Female     Ae.     albopictus density was correlated with CI pre 3 weeks (rs = 0.303 p&lt;0.05). The influencing factors of BI were average wind speed pre 1 week average temperature and female     Ae.     albopictus density pre 4 weeks. The influencing factors of CI were average humidity pre 3 weeks and average temperature. The influencing factors of HI were average temperature and precipitation pre 4 weeks. The influencing factor of     Ae.     albopictus density and female     Ae.     albopictus density was temperature.          Conclusions   The adult     Ae.     albopictus density had low correlation with certain larval indices. Some of the meteorology factors played significant roles in the density of adult     Ae.     albopictus and larva with or without a time lag.       ,
PMC7290434,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\172_22_abstract.xml,   Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) imposes a major health concern in areas with very poor sanitation in Africa and Asia. The pathogen is transmitted mainly through ingesting contaminated water or food coming into contact with affected people and blood transfusions. Very few reports including old reports are available on the prevalence of HEV in Saudi Arabia in humans and no reports exist on HEV prevalence in camels. Dromedary camel trade and farming are increasing in Saudi Arabia with importation occurring unidirectionally from Africa to Saudi Arabia. DcHEV transmission to humans has been reported in one case from the United Arab Emeritus (UAE). This instigated us to perform this investigation of the seroprevalence of HEV in imported and domestic camels in Saudi Arabia. Serum samples were collected from imported and domestic camels. DcHEV-Abs were detected in collected sera using ELISA. The prevalence of DcHEV in the collected samples was 23.1% with slightly lower prevalence in imported camels than domestic camels (22.4% vs. 25.4%    p value = 0.3). Gender was significantly associated with the prevalence of HEV in the collected camels (   p value = 0.015) where males (31.6%) were more infected than females (13.4%). This study is the first study to investigate the prevalence of HEV in dromedary camels from Saudi Arabia. The high seroprevalence of DcHEV in dromedaries might indicate their role as a zoonotic reservoir for viral infection to humans. Future HEV seroprevalence studies in humans are needed to investigate the role of DcHEV in the Saudi human population.    ,
PMC7290441,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\173_18_abstract.xml,   Influenza A virus one of the major human respiratory pathogens is responsible for annual seasonal endemics and unpredictable periodic pandemics. Despite the clinical availability of vaccines and antivirals the antigenic diversity and drug resistance of this virus makes it a persistent threat to public health underlying the need for the development of novel antivirals. In a cell culture-based high-throughput screen a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist nylidrin was identified as an antiviral compound against influenza A virus. The molecule was effective against multiple isolates of subtype H1N1 but had limited activity against subtype H3N2 depending on the strain. By examining the antiviral activity of its chemical analogues we found that ifenprodil and clenbuterol also had reliable inhibitory effects against A/H1N1 strains. Field-based pharmacophore modeling with comparisons of active and inactive compounds revealed the importance of positive and negative electrostatic patterns of phenyl aminoethanol derivatives. Time-of-addition experiments and visualization of the intracellular localization of nucleoprotein NP demonstrated that an early step of the virus life cycle was suppressed by nylidrin. Ultimately we discovered that nylidrin targets hemagglutinin 2 (HA2)-mediated membrane fusion by blocking conformational change of HA at acidic pH. In a mouse model preincubation of a mouse-adapted influenza A virus (H1N1) with nylidrin completely blocked intranasal viral infection. The present study suggests that nylidrin could provide a core chemical skeleton for the development of a direct-acting inhibitor of influenza A virus entry.  ,
PMC7290740,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\174_18_abstract.xml,   Influenza virus infections can lead to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases causing significant morbidity and mortality and posing a great threat to human health. Because of the diversity of influenza virus strains and drug resistance to the current direct antiviral agents there have been no effective drugs as yet to cure all patients infected by influenza viruses. Natural products from plants contain compounds with diverse structures that have the potential to interact with multiple host and virus factors. In this study we identified the ethanol extract of    Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston (EEC) as an inhibitor against the replication of a panel of influenza A and B viruses both on human pulmonary epithelial A549 and human monocytic U937 cells. The animal study revealed that EEC administration reduces the weight loss and improves the survival rate of mice infected with lethal influenza virus. Also EEC treatment attenuated lung injury and reduced virus titer significantly. In conclusion we showed that EEC has antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo suggesting that the plant    C. decapetala has the potential to be further developed as a resource of new anti-influenza drugs.    ,

A total of 2650 mosquitoes belonging to 37 species and eight genera were collected. Mosquito species richness was significantly influenced by the specific combination of the habitat type and the season. The highest species richness was found in the peri-urban area (S = 30 Chao1 = 121 ± 50.63 ACE = 51.97 ± 3.88) during the dry season (S = 28 Chao1 = 64 ± 25.7 ACE = 38.33 ± 3.1).    Aedes (Ae.) africanus and    Culex (   Cx.) moucheti were only found in the rural and peri-urban areas while    Cx. pipiens s.l. and    Ae. aegypti were only found in the urban area.    Cx. (Culiciomyia) spp.    Cx. duttoni and    Ae. albopictus were caught in the three habitat types. Importantly approximately 52% of the mosquito species collected in this study have been implicated in the transmission of diverse arboviruses. This entomological survey provides a catalogue of the different mosquito species that may be involved in the transmission of arboviruses. Further investigations are needed to study the vectorial capacity of each mosquito species in arbovirus transmission.    ,

Although enormous efforts have aimed to prevent and treat influenza infections seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks remain a major public health concern. This is largely because influenza viruses rapidly undergo genetic mutations that restrict the long-lasting efficacy of vaccine-induced immune responses and therapeutic regimens. In this review we discuss the virological features of influenza A viruses and provide an overview of current knowledge of the innate sensing of invading influenza viruses and the protective immune responses in the host.  ,
PMC7293210,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\177_13_abstract.xml,   While RSV is a major cause of respiratory morbidity in infants vaccine development is hindered by the immaturity and Th2-bias of the infant immune system and the legacy of enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) after RSV infection following immunization with formalin inactivated (FI)-RSV vaccine in earlier clinical trials. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that an adenoviral vector-based RSV F vaccine candidate (Ad26.RSV.FA2) induces Th1-biased protective immune responses without signs of ERD upon subsequent RSV challenge. We here developed an Ad26 vector encoding the RSV F protein stabilized in its prefusion conformation (Ad26.RSV.preF). In adult mice Ad26.RSV.preF induced superior Th1-biased IgG2a-dominated humoral responses as compared to Ad26.RSV.FA2 while maintaining the strong Th1-biased cellular responses. Similar to adult mice Ad26.RSV.preF induced robust and durable humoral immunity in neonatal mice again characterized by IgG2a-dominated RSV F-binding antibodies and high and stable virus-neutralizing titers. In addition vaccine-elicited cellular immune responses were durable and characterized by IFN-γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a profound Th1 bias. In contrast immunization of neonatal mice with FI-RSV resulted in IgG1 RSV F-binding antibodies associated with a Th2 phenotype no detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and a Th2-biased cellular response. These results are supportive for the clinical development of Ad26.RSV.preF for use in infants.  ,
PMC7293723,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\178_14_abstract.xml,   The spread of avian influenza virus among Asian countries is becoming a concern after influenza epidemics in recent years. This study is aimed at identifying the subtypes of avian influenza viruses collected from healthy chickens and ducks at two live bird markets in a border province of Vietnam and the Lao People Democratic Republic. Cloacal and tracheal swab samples from 100 chickens and 101 ducks were collected in May 2017. All samples were screened to detect avian influenza virus by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Samples that are avian influenza virus-positive were isolated in embryonated chicken eggs and the subtypes were identified by RT-PCR with the specific primers. The samples positive for influenza virus H5 were sequenced to identify HA and NA genes. The prevalence of avian influenza virus (AIV) among chicken and duck samples was 27.5% (55/200) and 24.8% (50/202) respectively. AIV subtypes identified among 17 samples positive with the hemagglutination test include H3N6 H6N6 and H9N2. Of these 17 samples 7 duck samples were found to be H6N6 4 duck samples were infected with both subtypes of H3N6 and H6N6 and two chicken samples were recorded as H9N2. A positive chicken sample with A/H5 contains 99% similarity nucleotide with H5N6 reference strain. Results suggested that while the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza virus is predominant potential risks of the appearance of high pathogen avian influenza virus in the east-west boundary in Vietnam should be concerned and studied further. Furthermore prevention activities are needed to reduce such biosecurity threats in Vietnam and other Asian countries.  ,
PMC7293853,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\179_14_abstract.xml,   Indirect transmission of pathogens can pose major risks to wildlife yet the presence and persistence of wildlife pathogens in the environment has been little studied. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is of global conservation concern: it can infect all members of the Psittaciformes one of the most threatened bird orders with infection often being lethal. Indirect transmission of BFDV through contaminated nest hollows has been proposed as a major infection source. However data on whether and for how long nest sites in the wild remain contaminated have been absent. We determined the BFDV status of birds (parents and nestlings) for 82 nests of Crimson Rosellas    Platycercus elegans and Eastern Rosellas    Platycercus eximius. In 11 of these nests (13.4% 95% confidence interval 6.9–22.7) we found an infected parent or nestling. Using nest swabs we then compared BFDV presence at three points in time (before during and after breeding) in three groups of nest boxes. These were nest boxes occupied by infected birds and two control groups (nest boxes occupied by uninfected birds and unoccupied nest boxes). Detection of BFDV on nest swabs was strongly associated with the infection status of parents in each nest box and with the timing of breeding. During breeding boxes occupied by BFDV-positive birds were significantly more likely to have BFDV-positive nest swabs than boxes occupied by BFDV-negative birds; nest swabs tested BFDV-positive in 80% (28.4–99.5) of nests with parental antigen excretion 66.7% (9.4–99.2) of nests occupied by parents with BFDV-positive cloacal swabs and 66.7% (22.3–95.7) of nests occupied by parents with BFDV–positive blood. 0% (0–52.2) of nests with BFDV–positive nestlings had BFDV–positive nest swabs. Across all boxes occupied by BFDV-positive birds (parents or nestlings) no nest swabs were BFDV–positive before breeding 36.4% (95% CI 10.9–69.2) were positive during breeding and 9.1% (0.2–41.3) remained positive after breeding. BFDV was present on nest swabs for up to 3.7 months. Our study provides novel insights into the potential role of nest cavities and other fomites in indirect transmission of BFDV and possibly other pathogens and offers a non-invasive method for surveillance of pathogens in wild bird populations.    ,

PMC7294235,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\181_15_abstract.xml,      Objective   Japanese encephalitis virus infection (JE) remains a leading cause of neurological disease in Asia mainly involving individuals living in remote areas with limited access to treatment centers and diagnostic facilities. Laboratory confirmation is fundamental for the justification and implementation of vaccination programs. We reviewed the literature on historical developments and current diagnostic capability worldwide to identify knowledge gaps and instill urgency to address them.       Methods   Searches were performed in Web of Science and PubMed using the term 'Japanese encephalitis' up to 13th October 2019. Studies reporting laboratory-confirmed symptomatic JE cases in humans were included and data on details of diagnostic tests were extracted. A JE case was classified according to confirmatory levels (Fischer et al. 2008; Campbell et al. 2011; Pearce et al. 2018; Heffelfinger et al. 2017) where level 1 represented the highest level of confidence.       Findings   20212 published JE cases were identified from 205 studies. 15167 (75%) of these positive cases were confirmed with the lowest-confidence diagnostic tests (level 3 or 4 or level 4). Only 109 (53%) of the studies reported contemporaneous testing for dengue-specific antibodies.       Conclusion   A fundamental pre-requisite for the control of JEV is lacking — that of a simple and specific diagnostic procedure that can be adapted for point-of-care tests and readily used throughout JE-endemic regions of the world.    ,
PMC7294518,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\182_13_abstract.xml,   Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus within the    Flaviviridae family. After decades of circulation in Asia ZIKV was introduced to Brazil in 2014–2015 associated with a rise in congenital malformations. Unlike the genetically related dengue virus (DENV) ZIKV constitutes only one serotype. Although assumed that ZIKV infection may engender lifelong immunity the long-term kinetics of ZIKV antibody responses are unclear. We assessed long-term kinetics of ZIKV NS1-IgG response in 144 individuals from 3 different subpopulations: HIV patients tuberculosis patients and healthy individuals first tested in 2016 and retested 1.5–2 years after the 2015–2016 ZIKV epidemic in Salvador de Bahia Brazil using a widely distributed NS1-based commercial ELISA. The seropositivity in 2016 reached 59.0% (85/144 95% confidence interval (CI) 50.7–66.7%) and decreased to 38.6% (56/144 CI 31.3–47.0%) 1.5–2 years later. In addition the median ZIKV NS1-ELISA reactivity for individuals that remained positive in both timepoints significantly decreased from a ratio of 4.4 (95% CI 3.8–5.0) to 1.6 (95% CI 1.6–1.9) over the 2-year interval (   Z: − 6.1;    p &lt; 0.001) irrespective of the subpopulation analyzed. Initial 2016 DENV antibody response was non-significant between groups suggesting comparable DENV background. The high 20.6% seroreversion suggest that widely used serologic tests may fail to account a considerable proportion of past ZIKV infections in flavivirus endemic countries. In addition ZIKV immunity might be shorter-lived than previously thought which may contribute to local ZIKV resurgence once individual immune responses wane sufficiently to reduce community protective immunity in addition to birth and migration.    ,
PMC7296109,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\183_16_abstract.xml,   Prevention early detection prompt reaction and communication play a crucial role in African swine fever (ASF) control. Appropriate surveillance capable of early detection of the disease in both domestic and wild animals and the implementation of consolidated contingency plans are currently considered the best means of controlling this disease. The purpose of this study was to understand the lessons to be learned through the global disease eradication history. To establish which strategies were successful for prevention control and eradication of ASF and which errors should not be repeated we conducted a systematic review. A query was defined to search for surveillance and control strategies applied by countries worldwide for ASF eradication in the past. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined. Decisions on study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers and the differences were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. From 1980 papers 23 were selected and included in the qualitative analysis. Reports from Belgium Brazil Cuba the Dominican Republic and Haiti France mainland Italy Malta Portugal and Spain were included. Despite the economic resources allocated and the efforts made eradication was possible in only eight countries between the 50s and 90s in the twentieth century in different epidemiological and cultural contexts in some instances within &lt;1 year and in others in about 40 years. Classical surveillance strategies such as active and passive surveillance both at farm and slaughterhouse levels targeted surveillance together with conventional biosafety and sanitary measures led to eradication even in countries in which the tick's epidemiological role was demonstrated. Historical surveillance data analysis indicated that eradication was possible even when technological tools either were not available or were used less than they are currently. This emphasizes that data on surveillance and on animal population are crucial for planning effective surveillance and targeting proper control and intervention strategies. This paper demonstrates that some strategies applied in the past were effective; these could be implemented and improved to confront the current epidemiological wave. This offers encouragement for the efforts made particularly in Europe during the recent epidemics.  ,
PMC7296759,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\184_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Transmission dynamics of arboviruses like Zika virus are often evaluated by vector competence (the proportion of infectious vectors given exposure) and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP the time it takes for a vector to become infectious) but vector age is another critical driver of transmission dynamics. Vectorial capacity (VC) is a measure of transmission potential of a vector-pathogen system but how these three components EIP vector competence and vector age affect VC in concert still needs study.       Methods   The interaction of vector competence EIP and mosquito age at the time of infection acquisition (Age    acquisition) was experimentally measured in an     Aedes aegypti-ZIKV model system as well as the age-dependence of probability of survival and the willingness to bite. An age-structured vectorial capacity framework (VC    age) was then developed using both EIP    Min and EIP    Max defined as the time to first observed minimum proportion of transmitting mosquitoes and the time to observed maximum proportion of transmitting mosquitoes.          Results   The within-mosquito dynamics of vector competence/EIP were not significant among treatments where mosquitoes were exposed at different ages. However VC    age revealed: (i) age-dependence in vector-virus interactions is important for transmission success; (ii) lower vector competence but at shorter EIPs was sufficient for transmission perpetuation; and (iii) R    0 may be overestimated by using non-age-structured VC.          Conclusions   The results indicate that ultimately the temporal component of the virus-vector dynamics is most critical especially when exposure occurred at advanced mosquito age. While our study is limited to a single virus-vector system and a multitude of other factors affect both vector competence and mosquito mortality our methods can be extrapolated to these other scenarios. Results indicate that how ‘highly’ or ‘negligibly’ competent vectors are categorized may need adjustment.           ,
PMC7297309,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\185_20_abstract.xml,   The dynamics of infectious diseases propagating in populations depends both on human interaction patterns the contagion process and the pathogenesis within hosts. The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and consequently the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow 24-hour cycles which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized Chinese cities. By this setup we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune systems. In most of the scenarios we test we observe circadian rhythms would constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures (strength outward transmission and introduction speeds) are highly correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City outward transmission speed and introduction speed are correlated with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.83 and the speeds correlate to strength with coefficients of −0.85 and −0.75 respectively (all have    p &lt; 0.05) in simulations with no circadian effect and    R   0 = 1.5. The relation between the circadian rhythms of the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and extent of infectious disease spreading. Shifting commuting times could mitigate the emergence of outbreaks.    ,
PMC7297909,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\186_15_abstract.xml,      Background   Echovirus 30 (E-30) has been investigated and reported worldwide and is closely associated with several infectious diseases including encephalitis; myocarditis; and hand foot and mouth disease. Although many E-30 outbreaks associated with encephalitis have been reported around the world it was not reported in northwest China until 2015.       Methods   The clinical samples including the feces serum throat swabs and cerebrospinal fluid were collected for this study and were analyzed for diagnosis. E-30 was isolated and processed according to the standard procedures. The epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis were performed to indicate the characteristics of E-30 outbreaks and phylodynamics of E-30 in China.       Results   The E-30 outbreaks affected nine towns of Gansu Province in 2015 starting at a school of Nancha town and spreading to other towns within 1 month. The epidemiological features showed that children aged 6–15 years were more susceptible to E-30 infection. The genotypes B and C cocirculated in the world whereas the latter dominated the circulation of E-30 in China. The genome sequences of this outbreak present 99.3–100% similarity among these strains indicating a genetic-linked aggregate outbreak of E-30 in this study. Two larger genetic diversity expansions and three small fluctuations of E-30 were observed from 1987 to 2016 in China which revealed the oscillating patterns of E-30 in China. In addition the coastal provinces of China such as Zhejiang Fujian and Shandong were initially infected followed by other parts of the country. The E-30 strains isolated from mainland of China may have originated from Taiwan of China in the last century.       Conclusion   The highly similar E-30 genomes in this outbreak showed an aggregate outbreak of E-30 with nine towns affected. Our results suggested that although the genetic diversity of E-30 oscillates the dominant lineages of E-30 in China has complex genetic transmission. The coastal provinces played an important role in E-30 spread which implied further development of effective countermeasures. This study provides a further insight into the E-30 outbreak and transmission and illustrates the importance of valuable surveillance in the future.    ,
PMC7302680,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\187_22_abstract.xml,   Abstract  To observe the efficacy of telbivudine in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) women with high viral load during pregnancy and the long-term effects on intelligence growth and development of the newborns.  A total of 87 patients were included. Forty-two patients received telbivudine orally 600 mg per day and treatment initiated from 12 weeks after gestation until the 12th postpartum week. Forty-five patients were untreated according to principle of informed consent. All infants received injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG; 200 IU) and were vaccinated with recombinant HBV vaccine. Wechsler preschool intelligence scale was used to assess mental and neuropsychological developments of these children till they were 6 years old. Data including serum HBV DNA viral load Apgar score and scores of Wechsler preschool intelligence scale were analyzed and compared.  Levels of both serum HBV DNA and ALT in patients who received telbivudine were significantly decreased at the 12th week after delivery compared with baseline levels (   P &lt; .01). No significant changes were observed in patients not receiving telbivudine (   P &gt; .05). Serum HBV DNA and ALT levels at the 12th week after delivery in the telbivudine group were significantly lower than those of patients without telbivudine (   P &lt; .01). The serum HBsAg-positive rate in neonates 7 months of age was 0% which was significantly lower than that in control group (11.11%) (   P &lt; .05). No statistical differences were observed between the 2 groups regarding maternal cesarean section rate adverse pregnancy rate postpartum bleeding rate neonatal body mass Apgar score neonatal malformation incidence or intelligence development of newborn.    Telbivudine is effective to reduce the viral load in CHB mothers with high viral load and could lower the perinatal transmission rate. Both mental and physical development in neonates with exposure to telbivudine during perinatal period were similar to those without telbivudine exposure.  ,

Typhimurium) is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and bacteraemia worldwide and a model organism for the study of host-pathogen interactions. Two    S. Typhimurium strains (SL1344 and ATCC14028) are widely used to study host-pathogen interactions yet genotypic variation results in strains with diverse host range pathogenicity and risk to food safety. The population structure of diverse strains of    S. Typhimurium revealed a major phylogroup of predominantly sequence type 19 (ST19) and a minor phylogroup of ST36. The major phylogroup had a population structure with two high order clades (α and β) and multiple subclades on extended internal branches that exhibited distinct signatures of host adaptation and anthropogenic selection. Clade α contained a number of subclades composed of strains from well characterized epidemics in domesticated animals while clade β contained multiple subclades associated with wild avian species. The contrasting epidemiology of strains in clade α and β was reflected by the distinct distribution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes accumulation of hypothetically disrupted coding sequences (HDCS) and signatures of functional diversification. These observations were consistent with elevated anthropogenic selection of clade α lineages from adaptation to circulation in populations of domesticated livestock and the predisposition of clade β lineages to undergo adaptation to an invasive lifestyle by a process of convergent evolution with of host adapted    Salmonella serotypes. Gene flux was predominantly driven by acquisition and recombination of prophage and associated cargo genes with only occasional loss of these elements. The acquisition of large chromosomally-encoded genetic islands was limited but notably a feature of two recent pandemic clones (DT104 and monophasic    S. Typhimurium ST34) of clade α (SGI-1 and SGI-4).    ,
PMC7302871,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\189_25_abstract.xml,   Author summary     Salmonella Typhimurium is a leading cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Our current understanding of the biology of    Salmonella is largely based on studies using just two laboratory strains of    S. Typhimurium with similar characteristics. Yet this pathogen exhibits a remarkable diversity in host range outcome of infection and risk to human health. To investigate the genetic basis of this diversity we have explored the genetic relationship of a collection of isolates that represent a substantial portion of the diversity of    S. Typhimurium using whole genome sequencing.    S. Typhimurium evolved forming two major groups that differ in their distribution in livestock and wild avian species. The livestock-associated group contained isolates commonly affecting human health and were often drug resistant while the wild avian-associated group was rarely associated with drug resistance and less frequently associated with human infection. We report distinct evolutionary processes acting on subgroups of    S. Typhimurium including loss of information content of genomes and gain or loss of genes predicted to affect functions such as antimicrobial resistance disease potential and environmental survival and functional diversification. This study provides a framework in which to understand the epidemiology of    Salmonella and improve assessment of its risk to animal and human health.    ,
PMC7302872,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\190_20_abstract.xml,   Human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) and (H7N9) viruses causes severe respiratory diseases. PB1-F2 protein is a critical virulence factor that suppresses early type I interferon response but the mechanism of its action in relation to high pathogenicity is not well understood. Here we show that PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus is a particularly potent suppressor of antiviral signaling through formation of protein aggregates on mitochondria and inhibition of TRIM31-MAVS interaction leading to prevention of K63-polyubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS. Unaggregated MAVS accumulated on fragmented mitochondria is prone to degradation by both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. These properties are proprietary to PB1-F2 of H7N9 virus but not shared by its counterpart in WSN virus. A recombinant virus deficient of PB1-F2 of H7N9 induces more interferon β in infected cells. Our findings reveal a subtype-specific mechanism for destabilization of MAVS and suppression of interferon response by PB1-F2 of H7N9 virus.  ,
PMC7302872,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\191_21_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Exactly why avian influenza A (H5N1) and (H7N9) viruses cause severe diseases in humans remains unclear. PB1-F2 protein encoded by influenza A virus is one virulence factor that might make a difference. In this study we show that PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus is particularly strong in the suppression of host antiviral defense. This was achieved by inhibiting a key protein in cell signaling named MAVS. PB1-F2 directs MAVS for degradation and prevents MAVS from forming protein aggregates required for full activation. A recombinant virus in which PB1-F2 of H7N9 has been deleted can activate host antiviral response robustly. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus prevents MAVS aggregation and promotes MAVS degradation leading to the suppression of host antiviral defense.  ,
PMC7303813,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\192_17_abstract.xml,      Introduction: The major burden of diseases in childhood has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic health conditions in recent decades. Although the rates of infectious diseases have decreased the incidence of chronic diseases stemming from infectious agents continues to grow. Enterovirus is a major infectious disease of childhood and has been linked to numerous chronic diseases. We analyzed population-based data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to investigate the correlations between enterovirus infection and major chronic health conditions in children.       Method: Children diagnosed with enterovirus (EV) infection during 1999–2003 were identified from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000) a subdataset of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). A total of 14168 patients were selected after excluding patients with existing chronic diseases and missing data. Another 14168 children matched by age and sex were selected as the control group. Five primary outcomes including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epilepsy asthma allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis were recorded.       Results: The risks of ADHD asthma allergic rhinitis and epilepsy were significantly increased in the EV group compared with the control group. The risk of atopic dermatitis was significantly increased in the crude model. However there were no significant differences in the adjusted model. The risks of ADHD asthma allergic rhinitis and epilepsy were also significantly increased in patients with severe EV infection compared with patients with non-severe EV infection.       Conclusion: Chronic diseases such as ADHD epilepsy asthma allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis were shown to be associated with enterovirus infection during childhood. EV infection during early childhood might have long-term public health implications and thus prevention strategies should be implemented.    ,
PMC7304608,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\193_23_abstract.xml,      Background   Dengue chikungunya and Zika viruses are increasingly important public health problems. Burning vegetation leaves and other plant products have been shown to be effective mosquito repellents for their vector     Aedes spp. but there has been scant research on whether firewood cooking smoke in households influences mosquito populations or mosquito-borne diseases. About 2.9 billion people worldwide use biomass fuel for household cooking and heating resulting in an estimated 1.6 million deaths annually from household air pollution (HAP)-related diseases. Global health agencies now encourage households to transition from biomass to clean fuels but it is unclear whether such interventions may actually increase risk for mosquito-borne diseases. This retrospective case-control study evaluated associations between arboviral infections and cooking with firewood in Santa Rosa Guatemala.          Method       Vigilancia Integrada Comunitaria (VICo) was a prospective public health surveillance system for bacterial parasitic and viral causes of diarrheal neurological respiratory and febrile illnesses in hospitals and clinics in the department of Santa Rosa Guatemala. Enrolled VICo in-patients and out-patients during 2011–2018 were interviewed using standardized questionnaires on demographics and household characteristics. Blood and stool specimens were collected and tested to identify the etiologies presenting symptoms. Cases were defined as laboratory-positive for dengue chikungunya or Zika virus infections. Controls were laboratory-positive for bacterial and viral diarrheal illnesses (e.g.     Salmonella     Shigella     Campylobacter     Escherichia coli rotavirus norovirus sapovirus or astrovirus). Cooking with firewood kitchen location stove type and firewood cooking frequency were the independent exposure variables. Logistic regression models were used to analyze unadjusted and adjusted associations between arboviral infections and exposures of interest.          Result   There were 311 arboviral cases and 1239 diarrheal controls. Arboviral infections were inversely associated with cooking with firewood in the main house (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.08–0.57) cooking with firewood on an open hearth (AOR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33–0.78) and cooking with firewood ≥5 times per week (AOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36–0.81) adjusting for age sex ethnicity socioeconomic status index number of people per household community population density community elevation recruitment location season and admission year.       Conclusion   Several primary determinants of HAP exposure were inversely associated with arboviral infections. Additional studies are needed to understand whether interventions to reduce HAP might actually increase risk for mosquito-borne infectious diseases which would warrant improved education and mosquito control efforts in conjunction with fuel interventions.    ,
PMC7304630,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\194_21_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the    Togaviridae family is part of a group of emergent diseases including arbovirus constituting an increasing public health problem in tropical areas worldwide. CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. The first Colombian autochthonous case was reported in the Colombian Caribbean region in September 2014. Within the next two to three months the CHIKV outbreak reached its peak. Although the CHIKV pattern of clinical symptomatology has been documented in different epidemiological studies understanding of the relationship between clinical symptomatology and variation in phenotypic response to CHIKV infection in humans remains limited. We performed a cross sectional study following 1160 individuals clinically diagnosed with CHIKV at the peak of the Chikungunya outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region. We examined the relationship between symptomatology and diverse phenotypic responses. Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) models were used to characterize patients’ symptomatology and further identify subgroups of individuals with differential phenotypic response. We found that most individuals presented fever (94.4%) headache (73.28%) and general discomfort (59.4%) which are distinct clinical symptoms of a viral infection. Furthermore 11/26 (43.2%) of the categorized symptoms were more frequent in women than in men. LCCA disclosed seven distinctive phenotypic response profiles in this population of CHIKV infected individuals. Interestingly 282 (24.3%) individuals exhibited a lower symptomatic “extreme” phenotype and 74 (6.4%) patients were within the severe complex “extreme” phenotype. Although clinical symptomatology may be diverse there are distinct symptoms or group of symptoms that can be correlated with differential phenotypic response and perhaps susceptibility to CHIKV infection especially in the female population. This suggests that comparatively to men women are a CHIKV at-risk population. Further study is needed to validate these results and determine whether the distinct LCCA profiles are a result of the immune response or a mixture of genetic lifestyle and environmental factors. Our findings could contribute to the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations. Preliminary results have shown prediction models achieving up to 92% accuracy overall with substantial sensitivity specificity and accuracy values per LCCA-derived cluster.    ,
PMC7304630,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\195_22_abstract.xml,   Author summary  The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is a mosquito-borne virus of the    Togaviridae family part of the arbovirus group of mosquito-transmitted pathogens. CHIKV causes a severe and debilitating disease with high morbidity. In this study we comprehensively analysed clinical data from 1160 individuals from the Colombian Caribbean who were diagnosed with CHIKV infection during the 2014 epidemic peak and before the Zika epidemic (registered back in 2015). Further the presence of latent classes and predictors of CHIKV susceptibility and severity of the CHIKV infection were analysed. Although it is well known that people respond differently to infection our results showed that these differences are not arbitrary and may come from the specific orchestration of our immune response and specific genetic makeup. For example we identified that females infected with CHIKV exhibited significant and heterogeneous phenotypic response patterns compared to men. Overall these results inform about potential predictors and outlining strategies to study the natural history of CHIKV infection. Future studies assessing the contribution of demographic immunological and genetic factors to symptom co-occurrence could shed some light on the severity of the clinical symptomatology and ultimately lead to more accurate more efficient and differential diagnosis. These results could contribute to the development of machine learning approaches to characterizing CHIKV infection in other populations and provide more accurate and differential diagnosis.    ,

PMC7308418,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\198_15_abstract.xml,   Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the cause of more than 95% of epidemic non-bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide with some lethal cases. These viral agents affect people of all ages. However young children and older adults are the highest-risk groups being affected with the greatest rate of hospitalizations and morbidity cases. HuNoV structural proteins especially VP1 have been studied extensively. In contrast the functions of the non-structural proteins of the virus have been undescribed in depth. Studies on HuNoV non-structural proteins have mostly been made by expressing them individually in    in vitro cultures providing insights of their functions and the role that they play in HuNoV replication and pathogenesis. This review examines exhaustively the functions of both HuNoV structural and non-structural proteins and their possible role within the viral replicative cycle and the pathogenesis of the virus. It also highlights recent findings regarding the host's innate and adaptive immune responses against HuNoV which are of great relevance for diagnostics and vaccine development so as to prevent infections caused by these fastidious viruses.    ,
PMC7310742,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\199_21_abstract.xml,   Viral infections complicated by a bacterial infection are typically referred to as coinfections or superinfections.    Streptococcus pyogenes the group A streptococcus (GAS) is not the most common bacteria associated with influenza A virus (IAV) superinfections but did cause significant mortality during the 2009 influenza pandemic even though all isolates are susceptible to penicillin. One approach to improve the outcome of these infections is to use passive immunization targeting GAS. To test this idea we assessed the efficacy of passive immunotherapy using antisera against either the streptococcal M protein or streptolysin O (SLO) in a murine model of IAV-GAS superinfection. Prophylactic treatment of mice with antiserum to either SLO or the M protein decreased morbidity compared to mice treated with non-immune sera; however neither significantly decreased mortality. Therapeutic use of antisera to SLO decreased morbidity compared to mice treated with non-immune sera but neither antisera significantly reduced mortality. Overall the results suggest that further development of antibodies targeting the M protein or SLO may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of invasive GAS diseases including IAV-GAS superinfections which may be particularly important during influenza pandemics.    ,
PMC7312578,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\200_16_abstract.xml,   The global epidemic of Zika virus has been a major public health problem affecting pregnant women and their infants. Zika virus causes a viral disease transmitted to humans mainly by the infected    Aedes mosquito bite. The infection is not severe in most cases; however there is evidence that infection during pregnancy may be associated with fetal genetic abnormalities (including microcephaly). In addition to microcephaly and other malformations some specific lesions in the central nervous system have been reported. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the risk of developing microcephaly in infants whose mothers were infected with Zika virus in pregnancy. Epidemiological studies and case reports were incorporated in our review finally including 15 articles from an initial pool of 355 related papers. Most studies have linked maternal infection during pregnancy to the development of neonatal microcephaly. The period considered most dangerous is the first trimester and the beginning or the whole of the second trimester. In order to understand the relationship between Zika virus and microcephaly in infants a cohort study will be able to estimate the time from the onset of Zika infection and the full spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes.    ,
PMC7314749,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\201_13_abstract.xml,   The mosquito    Aedes albopictus is one of the most dangerous invasive species. Its worldwide spread has created health concerns as it is a major vector of arboviruses of public health significance such as chikungunya (CHIKV). Dynamics of different genetic backgrounds and admixture events may have impacted competence for CHIKV in adventive populations. Using microsatellites we infer the genetic structure of populations across the expansion areas that we then associate with their competence for different CHIKV genotypes. Here we show that the demographic history of    Ae. albopictus populations is a consequence of rapid complex patterns of historical lineage diversification and divergence that influenced their competence for CHIKV. The history of adventive populations is associated with CHIKV genotypes in a genotype-by-genotype interaction that impacts their vector competence. Thus knowledge of the demographic history and vector competence of invasive mosquitoes is pivotal for assessing the risk of arbovirus outbreaks in newly colonized areas.    ,

PMC7316228,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\203_23_abstract.xml,   Seasonal influenza A viruses of humans evolve rapidly due to strong selection pressures from host immune responses principally on the hemagglutinin (HA) viral surface protein. Based on mouse transmission experiments a proposed mechanism for immune evasion consists of increased avidity to host cellular receptors mediated by electrostatic charge interactions with negatively charged cell surfaces. In support of this the HA charge of the globally circulating H3N2 has increased over time since its pandemic. However the same trend was not seen in H1N1 HA sequences. This is counter-intuitive since immune escape due to increased avidity (due itself to an increase in charge) was determined experimentally. Here we explore whether patterns of local charge of H1N1 HA can explain this discrepancy and thus further associate electrostatic charge with immune escape and viral evolutionary dynamics. Measures of site-wise functional selection and expected charge computed from deep mutational scan data on an early H1N1 HA yield a striking division of residues into three groups separated by charge. We then explored evolutionary dynamics of these groups from 1918 to 2008. In particular one group increases in net charge over time and consists of sites that are evolving the fastest that are closest to the receptor binding site (RBS) and that are exposed to solvent (i.e. on the surface). By contrast another group decreases in net charge and consists of sites that are further away from the RBS and evolving slower but also exposed to solvent. The last group consists of those sites in the HA core with no change in net charge and that evolve very slowly. Thus there is a group of residues that follows the same trend as seen for the entire H3N2 HA. It is possible that the H1N1 HA is under other biophysical constraints that result in compensatory decreases in charge elsewhere on the protein. Our results implicate localized charge in HA interactions with host cells and highlight how deep mutational scan data can inform evolutionary hypotheses.  ,
PMC7316228,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\204_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  The hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein of influenza A viruses evolves rapidly to evade host immunity leading to sizable yearly epidemics in human populations. Previous transmission experiments with H1N1 in mice have tied immune escape to an increase in HA avidity for cellular receptors mediated by electrostatic charge. Furthermore retrospective sequence analyses from a previous study confirmed that the HA of circulating global H3N2 has increased in net charge yet surprisingly that of H1N1 has not varied significantly. How is a stable net charge related to local patterns of H1N1 HA charge in response to selection? To elucidate the role of local electrostatic charge in host-virus interactions we investigate characteristics of local charge on the H1N1 HA using functional data from deep mutational scan experiments. Combining measures of functional selection and expected charge at each site on DMS data from a 1933 H1N1 HA yields a striking visual pattern that identifies three groups of sites that have different biophysical properties and that prove to have distinct evolutionary patterns in natural human sequences. Essentially we find evidence for an increase in charge near the receptor binding site and for compensatory changes elsewhere on the protein. Thus our findings may reconcile disparate results from transmission experiments and natural sequence analyses and highlight the importance of local properties of the HA protein. Overall our findings further support the hypothesis of immune escape due to increased HA avidity to cellular receptors mediated by electrostatic charge. More generally our work illustrates a novel method of leveraging deep mutational scans in conjunction with natural sequences to shed light on virus-host interactions.  ,
PMC7316273,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\205_19_abstract.xml,   Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of viral diarrhea in infants and young children but uncommon and usually asymptomatic in adults. In the winter of 2017–2018 a large-scale outbreak of rotavirus in both children and adults was reported in Thailand. The current study focused on the prevalence genotyping and molecular characterization of rotavirus infections in Thai adults from July 2016 to December 2019. In 2598 stool samples collected from adult residents of Bangkok (aged #x2265; 15 years) with acute gastroenteritis rotavirus was detected via real-time RT-PCR analysis of the    VP6 gene.    G    P and    I genotypes were determined by direct sequencing of    VP7    VP4 and    VP6 genes respectively. Our results showed 8.7% (226/2598) of stool samples were positive for rotavirus. The incidence of rotavirus was high during the winter season of 2017–2018 (17.7%) compared to another studied periods (4.5% between July 2016- October 2017 and 2.8% between March 2018- December 2019). Nucleotide sequencing of    VP7 and    VP4 revealed    G3P[8] as the predominant strain (33.2%75/226) followed by    G9P[8] (17.3%39/226) and    G2P[4] (15.0%34/226). Uncommon G and P combinations were additionally detected at low frequencies.    VP6 sequencing was conducted to discriminate    I genotype between the Wa and DS-1 genogroup. The unusual DS-1-like    G3P[8] strain was most prevalent amomg rotavirus strains detected in this study (29.6% 67/226) and the corresponding    VP7 sequences showed high nucleotide identity with unusual DS-1-like globally circulating strains. Our study demonstrates that rotavirus outbreaks in adults are attributable not only to high prevalence of RV infection but also the unusual DS-like genogroup. The collective findings reinforce the importance of investigating rotavirus diagnosis in adults suffering from acute gastroenteritis and taking appropriate preventive measures.    ,
PMC7316275,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\206_22_abstract.xml,   The 2014–2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak revealed the fragility of the Guinean public health infrastructure. As a result the Guinean Ministry of Health is collaborating with international partners to improve compliance with the International Health Regulations and work toward the Global Health Security Agenda goals including enhanced case- and community-based disease surveillance. We assessed the case-based disease surveillance system during October 1 2015–March 31 2016 in the Boffa prefecture of Guinea. We conducted onsite interviews with public health staff at the peripheral (health center) middle (prefectural) and central (Ministry of Health) levels of the public health system to document leadership structure; methods for maintaining case registers and submitting weekly case reports; disease surveillance feedback; data analysis; and baseline surveillance information on four epidemic-prone diseases (cholera meningococcal meningitis measles and yellow fever). The surveillance system was simple and paper-based at health centers and computer spreadsheet–based at the prefectural and central levels. Surveillance feedback to stakeholders at all levels was infrequent. Data analysis activities were minimal at the peripheral levels and progressively more robust at the prefectural and central levels. Reviewing the surveillance reports from Boffa during the study period we observed zero reported cases of the four epidemic-prone diseases in the weekly reporting from the peripheral to the central level. Similarly the national District Health Information System 2 had no reported cases of the four diseases in Boffa but did indicate reported cases among all four neighboring prefectures. Based on the assessment findings which suggest low sensitivity of the case-based disease surveillance system in Boffa we recommend additional training and support to improve surveillance data quality and enhance Guinean public health workforce capacity to use these data.  ,
PMC7319105,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\207_23_abstract.xml,   Abstract  It is unclear how historical adaptation versus maladaptation in a prior environment affects population evolvability in a novel habitat. Prior work showed that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) populations evolved at constant 37°C improved in cellular infection at both 29°C and 37°C; in contrast those evolved under random changing temperatures between 29°C and 37°C failed to improve. Here we tested whether prior evolution affected the rate of adaptation at the thermal‐niche edge: 40°C. After 40 virus generations in the new environment we observed that populations historically evolved at random temperatures showed greater adaptability. Deep sequencing revealed that most of the newly evolved mutations were de novo. Also two novel evolved mutations in the VSV glycoprotein and replicase genes tended to co‐occur in the populations previously evolved at constant 37°C whereas this parallelism was not seen in populations with prior random temperature evolution. These results suggest that prior adaptation under constant versus random temperatures constrained the mutation landscape that could improve fitness in the novel 40°C environment perhaps owing to differing epistatic effects of new mutations entering genetic architectures that earlier diverged. We concluded that RNA viruses maladapted to their previous environment could “leapfrog” over counterparts of higher fitness to achieve faster adaptability in a novel environment.  ,

PMC7319941,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\209_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause intermittent community and nosocomial outbreaks. Obtaining data on specific source(s) and transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV during nosocomial outbreaks has been challenging. We performed a clinical epidemiological and phylogenetic investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV at a University Hospital in Riyadh Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.       Methods   Clinical epidemiological and infection control data were obtained from patients and Healthcare workers (HCWs). Full genome sequencing was conducted on nucleic acid extracted directly from MERS-CoV PCR-confirmed clinical samples and phylogenetic analysis performed. Phylogenetic analysis combined with published MERS-CoV genomes was performed. HCWs compliance with infection control practices was also assessed.       Results   Of 235 persons investigated there were 23 laboratory confirmed MERS cases 10 were inpatients and 13 HCWs. Eight of 10 MERS inpatients died (80% mortality). There were no deaths among HCWs. The primary index case assumed from epidemiological investigation was not substantiated phylogenetically. 17/18 of MERS cases were linked both phylogenetically and epidemiologically. One asymptomatic HCW yielded a MERS-CoV genome not directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Five HCWs with mild symptoms yielded &gt;75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. HCW compliance with use of gowns was 62.1% gloves 69.7% and masks 57.6%.       Conclusions   Several factors and sources including a HCW MERS-CoV ‘carrier phenomenon’ occur during nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses of MERS-CoV linked to clinical and epidemiological information is essential for outbreak investigation. The specific role of apparently healthy HCWs in causing nosocomial outbreaks requires further definition.    ,

From November 2016 through February 2017 we collected sociodemographic and clinical data by interview and tested serum samples for CHIKV IgG. CHIKV seroprevalence was 11.8% (95% CI 9.8%–13.7%) and 15.3% of seropositive persons reported an episode of fever and arthralgia. Infections were independently and positively associated with residences served by unpaved streets a presumptive clinical diagnosis of chikungunya and recall of an episode of fever with arthralgia in 2015–2016. Our findings indicate that the chikungunya outbreak in Salvador may not have conferred sufficient herd immunity to preclude epidemics in the near future. The unusually low frequency of symptomatic disease points to a need for further longitudinal studies to better investigate these findings.   ,
PMC7324804,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\211_13_abstract.xml,   Biological risks were mentioned by the “European Agency for Safety and Health at Work’s Expert Forecast on Emerging Biological Risks related to Occupational Safety and Health” the second most important emerging risk. In an era when the “one health approach” is considered the right way to address public health issues occupational safety continues to look at biological agents as a minor issue compared to other agents. The food industry is known to be very committed to food safety assurance but less concerned with the safety of food operators unless they may compromise the quality of the food product. However the focus on biological agents is essential not only due to air spread or contact with organic dust but we must not overlook another crucial aspect which is the antimicrobial resistance that may be associated with biological agents nowadays one of the biggest threats to global health food security and development.  ,
PMC7324857,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\212_17_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Clinical diagnosis of hepatitis E viral (HEV) infection mainly relies on serological assays and the current status of misdiagnoses regarding HEV infection is uncertain. In this study patients with acute HEV infection were tested for anti-HEV IgM and IgG a HEV antigen (Ag) and viral loads (HEV RNA). Serology was performed using four commercial HEV ELISA kits: Wantai Kehua Lizhu and Genelabs IgM and IgG. The HEV RNA was detected using RT-PCR assays. The sensitivities of different kits for anti-HEV IgM ranged from 82.6% to 86%. Each kit for anti-HEV IgM was highly specific (97.8–100%). The sensitivities of all kits to detect anti-HEV IgG with (87.2–91.9%) had a substantial agreement but the Kehua and Genelabs tests were more specific than the Wantai and Lizhu tests. The Wantai tests for the HEV Ag and HEV RNA were also important for acute HEV infections (Kappa = 0.787). Furthermore a total of 6.98% of HEV infections were positive for HEV RNA but negative for both the HEV Ag and anti-HEV antibodies of IgM and IgG classes. Our findings demonstrate that the diagnosis of hepatitis E may be missed if only serological assays are used. Thus a combination of serological and nucleic acid testing provides the optimal sensitivity and specificity to the diagnostic process.  ,
PMC7324928,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\213_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus mainly transmitted in tropical areas by     Aedes spp. mosquitoes. It has been responsible for small-to-large outbreaks in temperate areas including southern Europe and North America. Past outbreaks in 2006 on the islands of Maldives as well as on other islands in the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia demonstrated for the first time the capacity of CHIKV to disseminate through travel and transcontinental commerce and revealed the major socio-economic impact of CHIKV epidemics. Recently CHIKV has been circulating in highly touristic areas including the Maldives where 1736 cases were notified by the Health Protection Agency during 2019.          Case series   Among EuroTravNet/GeoSentinel patient records eight CHIKV-confirmed cases imported the Maldives to France Germany Denmark Italy and Spain were identified between February 2019 and February 2020; exceeding the total number of CHIKV infections travel-acquired in Maldives reported to this surveillance network during the previous 10 years.       Conclusions   The prevention and control of CHIKV introduction into naïve areas colonised by competent vectors is crucial. CHIKV outbreaks must be detected and reported in a timely manner. This must lead to adapted health information for international travellers and to prompt management of suspected imported cases. Conversely travellers make for excellent sentinels and increased reports of imported cases might reflect a change in the level of endemicity or even herald an outbreak. Feedback to the local health authorities and matching this with local epidemiological surveillance data may lead to health benefits for the local population.    ,
PMC7325039,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\214_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella primarily in childhood and some rare adults also report varicella. Herpes zoster mainly occurs in adults by endogenous reactivation of latent VZV. Until now varicella and herpes zoster have seldom been reported simultaneously in one patient. Here we report a rare case co-presenting with varicella and herpes zoster in a Chinese adult.       Case presentation   A 44-year-old Chinese man suffered papules and vesicles with pain on the left ear. Five days after onset he was admitted to the Department of Dermatology of The Third Hospital of Xiamen. Physical examination revealed that small vesicles surrounded by erythema had developed on his trunk back and neck and unilateral papules and vesicles in ribbons had also developed on the left ear. This patient was excluded from human immunodeficiency virus and     Treponema pallidum infections by ELISA antibody tests. Laboratory tests revealed that the ratio of eosinophils (0.1%) and eosinophil count (0.0 × 10    9/L) were significantly downregulated. Treatment with valacyclovir ebastine mecobalamine pregabalin and calamine lotion for 5 days was effective therapy for varicella and herpes zoster. Polymerase chain reaction for vesicular fluids from varicella and herpes zoster was positive for VZV and further phylogenetic analysis and single nucleotide polymorphism variations confirmed that the VZV genotype was type J (clade 2).          Conclusions   This rare case highlights awareness of varicella and herpes zoster caused by VZV infection in adults. Our report provides novel insight into the rare clinical presentation of VZV genotype J.    ,

PMC7329513,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\216_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Uganda has experienced seven Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks and four Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) outbreaks between 2000 and 2019. We investigated the seroprevalence and risk factors for Marburg virus and ebolaviruses in gold mining communities around Kitaka gold mine in Western Uganda and compared them to non-mining communities in Central Uganda.       Methods   A questionnaire was administered and human blood samples were collected from three exposure groups in Western Uganda (gold miners household members of miners non-miners living within 50 km of Kitaka mine). The unexposed controls group sampled was community members in Central Uganda far away from any gold mining activity which we considered as low-risk for filovirus infection. ELISA serology was used to analyse samples detecting IgG antibodies against Marburg virus and ebolaviruses (filoviruses). Data were analysed in STATA software using risk ratios and odds ratios.       Results   Miners in western Uganda were 5.4 times more likely to be filovirus seropositive compared to the control group in central Uganda (RR = 5.4; 95% CI 1.5–19.7) whereas people living in high-risk areas in Ibanda and Kamwenge districts were 3.6 more likely to be seropositive compared to control group in Luweeero district (RR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.1–12.2). Among all participants filovirus seropositivity was 2.6% (19/724) of which 2.3% (17/724) were reactive to Sudan virus only and 0.1% (1/724) to Marburg virus. One individual seropositive for Sudan virus also had IgG antibodies reactive to Bundibugyo virus. The risk factors for filovirus seropositivity identified included mining (AOR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.3–8.5) male sex (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.01–9.5) going inside mines (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.2–8.2) cleaning corpses (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.04–9.1) and contact with suspect filovirus cases (AOR = 3.9 95% CI 1.04–14.5).       Conclusions   These findings indicate that filovirus outbreaks may go undetected in Uganda and people involved in artisan gold mining are more likely to be exposed to infection with either Marburg virus or ebolaviruses likely due to increased risk of exposure to bats. This calls for active surveillance in known high-risk areas for early detection and response to prevent filovirus epidemics.    ,
PMC7330273,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\217_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Since 2011 the Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) has used active surveillance to prospectively collect epidemiological and virological data on patients hospitalized with influenza virus infection. Here we describe influenza virus strain circulation in the GIHSN participant countries during 2017–2018 season and examine factors associated with complicated hospitalization among patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza illness.       Methods   The study enrolled patients who were hospitalized in a GIHSN hospital in the previous 48 h with acute respiratory symptoms and who had symptoms consistent with influenza within the 7 days before admission. Enrolled patients were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to confirm influenza virus infection. “Complicated hospitalization” was defined as a need for mechanical ventilation admission to an intensive care unit or in-hospital death. In each of four age strata (&lt; 15 15–&lt; 50 50–&lt; 65 and ≥ 65 years) factors associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive patients were identified by mixed effects logistic regression and those associated with length of hospital stay using a linear mixed-effects regression model.       Results   The study included 12803 hospitalized patients at 14 coordinating sites in 13 countries of which 4306 (34%) tested positive for influenza. Influenza viruses B/Yamagata A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 strains dominated and cocirculated although the dominant strains varied between sites. Complicated hospitalization occurred in 10.6% of influenza-positive patients. Factors associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive patients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15–&lt; 50 years and ≥ 65 years) diabetes (15–&lt; 50 years) male sex (50–&lt; 65 years) hospitalization during the last 12 months (50–&lt; 65 years) and current smoking (≥65 years). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (50–&lt; 65 years) other chronic conditions (15–&lt; 50 years) influenza A (50–&lt; 65 years) and hospitalization during the last 12 months (&lt; 15 years) were associated with a longer hospital stay. The proportion of patients with complicated influenza did not differ between influenza A and B.       Conclusions   Complicated hospitalizations occurred in over 10% of patients hospitalized with influenza virus infection. Factors commonly associated with complicated or longer hospitalization differed by age group but commonly included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diabetes and hospitalization during the last 12 months.    ,
PMC7330967,4-part\_summary\myoutputdir\218_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Three different genotypes of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have been classified: East/Central/South African (ECSA) West African (WA) and Asian. Previously a rapid immunochromatographic (IC) test detecting CHIKV E1-antigen showed high sensitivity for certain ECSA-genotype viruses but this test showed poor performance against the Asian-genotype virus that is spreading in the American continents. We found that the reactivity of one monoclonal antibody (MAb) used in the IC rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is affected by a single amino acid substitution in E1. Therefore we developed new MAbs that exhibited specific recognition of all three genotypes of CHIKV.       Methods   Using a combination of the newly generated MAbs we developed a novel version of the IC RDT with improved sensitivity to Asian-genotype CHIKV. To evaluate the sensitivity specificity and cross-reactivity of the new version of the IC RDT we first used CHIKV isolates and E1-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. We then used clinical specimens obtained in Aruba in 2015 and in Bangladesh in 2017 for further evaluation of RDT sensitivity and specificity. Another alphavirus sindbis virus (SINV) was used to test RDT cross-reactivity.       Results   The new version of the RDT detected Asian-genotype CHIKV at titers as low as 10^4 plaque-forming units per mL a concentration that was below the limit of detection of the old version. The new RDT had sensitivity to the ECSA genotype that was comparable with that of the old version yielding 92% (92 out of 100) sensitivity (95% confidence interval 85.0–95.9) and 100% (100 out of 100) specificity against a panel of 100 CHIKV-positive and 100 CHIKV-negative patient sera obtained in the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh.       Conclusions   Our newly developed CHIKV antigen-detecting RDT demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and lacked cross-reactivity against SINV. These results suggested that our new version of the CHIKV E1-antigen RDT is promising for use in areas in which the Asian and ECSA genotypes of CHIKV circulate. Further validation with large numbers of CHIKV-positive and -negative clinical samples is warranted. (323 words).    ,
