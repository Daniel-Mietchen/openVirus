<p>Smoke from burning biomass materials is the most widely used mosquito repellent in the rural tropics [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Burning vegetation, leaves, and other plant products have been shown to be effective mosquito repellents [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but there has been scant research on whether smoke from household firewood fires influences mosquito populations, mosquito bites, or mosquito-borne diseases. The few studies of associations between firewood smoke and mosquito abundance are inconsistent. Some studies report firewood smoke reduced 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> populations in the household resulting in fewer mosquito bites [

 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Another study demonstrated inverse associations between firewood smoke and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Other studies were unable to support firewood smoke as an effective mosquito repellent with respect to malaria infection, which is transmitted by 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> [

 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The repellent effect is lost when occupants leave the home and its smoky environment, but smoke residue on skin may provide some repellency by masking human kairomones such as carbon dioxide [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We are unaware of any studies assessing the impact of firewood smoke on 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted arboviruses. Mosquito repellent benefits from burning firewood are also likely outweighed by other serious health problems from inhaling biomass smoke [
