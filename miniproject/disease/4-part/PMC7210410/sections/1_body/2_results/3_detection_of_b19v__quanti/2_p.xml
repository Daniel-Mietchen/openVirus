<p id="p0085">B19V DNA was detected in seven of the 731 samples (0.96%, 95%CI 0.46–1.96%). All of them also had detectable viral DNA by qPCR, but concentrations under the limit of quantification. In addition, none had detectable anti-B19V IgM, while 6/7 were anti-B19V IgG-positive (of them, only one had high level IgG, in the range of 100–200 IU/ml, 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, one donor had an ongoing acute infection and the other six were classified as long-term or potentially persistent infections (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The estimated rates of acute and long-term/persistent infections were 1.4 and 8.2 per 1000 donors, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, given that none of these seven donors presented any co-infection with other pathogen of mandatory control in the pre-transfusion screening, the corresponding blood components were used for transfusion/production of blood derivatives.
