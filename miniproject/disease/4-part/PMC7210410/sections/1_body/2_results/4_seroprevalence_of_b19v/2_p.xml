<p id="p0090">Among 358 samples, 55 (15.4%) were anti-B19 IgG-negative, 279/358 (77.9%) were positive and 24/358 (6.7%) indeterminate. In the subgroup of IgG-positive individuals, 151 (54.1%) were male (estimated population odds 1.2, 95%CI 0.9–1.5) without statistically significant differences compared with positive women frequency (p = 0.036). There were no differences in the distribution of IgG-positive results according to age groups (p = 0.9) nor regarding epidemiological week ranges (p = 0.5), but the proportion of indeterminate results was significantly higher in older donors (p &lt; 0.0001, OR 4.0, 95%CI 1.7–9.4), as shown in
