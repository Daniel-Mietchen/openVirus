<p>The correlation between the larval density and the adult mosquito density of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was analyzed. Considering the possible effect of time lag, 1~4 weeks were selected as the lag effect period. The 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density was correlated with CI (rs = 0.260, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.041), CI pre 1 week (rs = 0.259, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.046), and CI pre 3 weeks (rs = 0.329, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.013). BI was correlated with female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density pre 4 weeks (r = -0.299, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.028). Female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density was correlated with CI pre 3 weeks (rs = 0.303, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.023). The three indices of larval density were highly correlated with each other (the r for BI and CI was 0.741, for BI and HI was 0.916, for CI and HI was 0.753, respectively, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), and were also correlated with a lag effect of 1~4weeks, with correlation coefficients decreased gradually over time.
