<p>The correlation analysis was carried out to explore the relationships between meteorological factors and mosquito density, and 1~4 weeks was selected as the lag effect period. The results showed that the meteorological factors such as precipitation, average air pressure, average humidity, sunshine hours, average temperature, and average wind speed were correlated with different indices of the mosquito density, with or without a lag effect. The significant parameters of the correlation were shown in
