<p>Precipitation played a crucial role in the transmission of mosquito borne diseases, due to the fact that mosquito required water for the aquatic larval and pupal breeding stages. Higher pupal productivity and entomological indices was found in the rainy season than dry season [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and the effect of the precipitation to the larval density may have a time lag from 2 months to 1 month [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Precipitation could also influence the adult mosquito capturing. One study found that the BGS traps consistently captured nearly 20% of the marked female 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> population in the wet season and about 30% in the hot and dry season [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Besides, BGS traps could increase the biting rate of mosquito via increasing the contact between humans and mosquitoes, as humans often stayed indoors when it rained [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on our results, with the increase of precipitation 4 weeks ago, HI increased at the beginning, and then reached a plateau period. Less precipitation reduced amount of water retained in containers which affect mosquito breeding. However, extremely heavy precipitation could lead to water containers saturation or even flush mosquito larvae away from breeding sites, eliminating habitats to decrease the vector population [
