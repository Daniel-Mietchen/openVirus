<p>Our study had several strengths. This is one of the few studies investigating the relationships between larval indices and the adult mosquito with BG-trap method in mainland China. Besides, during the analysis procedure, various meteorological factors were taken into consideration in our study. Meanwhile, some limitations must be recognized in this study. Firstly, as the study sites and samples were only selected from rural area of Zhejiang Province, our results cannot be generalisable to broader national level. Secondly, the study relationships may be confounded by other factors such as socio-economic characteristics and human activity, which were not included in the current analysis.</p>
