<p>The BG-mosquito trap (BG-trap), which mimics convection currents created by human bodies and releases attractants through a large surface area, can catch significantly more 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> than the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap and Fay-Prince traps in laboratory settings and field trials [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Besides, BG-trap is not subjected to the ethical problems of the human landing catch methods, and has a higher efficiency than the human-baited double net trap [

 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since BG-trap is an effective method in monitoring adult 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, until now, there are no thresholds of the BG-trap that can be served either as reference to determine the timing and intensity of control activities or as a surrogate of dengue transmission risk. The larval indices such as Breteau index (BI), House index (HI) and Container index (CI), are considered more qualitative and often used in

 <italic>albopictus</italic> density assessment in dengue control [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Especially the BI, establishing a relationship between positive containers and houses, is considered the best indices for predicting dengue fever risk [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, incongruences have been found between those larval indices, with the facts that they are limited used in assessing dengue transmission risk and have a poor proxy for measuring adult mosquito emergence [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies have found that the larval indices are not in accordance with one another or with adult mosquito infestation [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the strength of correlations between larva and adult populations may depend on season, year, or geographic location [
 <xref rid="pone.0234555.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the relationships of larval indices with adult

 <italic>albopictus</italic> collected by the BG-trap are still uncertain, and more research is needed to confirm.
