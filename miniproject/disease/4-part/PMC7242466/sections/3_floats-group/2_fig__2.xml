  <title>Comprehensive taxonomic breakdown for IAV-free (left) and IAV-infected (right) human subjects.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Each column is a specific sample. The plot summarizes the relative taxonomic abundances at the class level for taxonomic groups that are present in &gt;5% of the samples (see legend below), sorted in decreasing order by the most abundant taxonomic group in each cohort. Gammaproteobacteria (
   <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, orange) bloom is prevalent among the infected patients (right), whereas Actinobacteria is the most abundant among healthy patients. 
   <bold>b</bold> An order (left) and family (right) level breakdown of the Gammaproteobacteria observed in infected patients. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
