<p id="Par11">The iDMM model was run over 2000 iterations over all data points (50 patients at multiple time points), which collapsed the data into a total of four ecostates (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Plotting the mean of the likelihood ratio at each iteration showed that, 25 iterations into the analysis, the maximum likelihood ratio converges for the model. One of the four ecostates included all 127 uninfected data points (or the healthy ecostate), while the 135 infected data points were distributed across the three other ecostates (or unhealthy ecostates). Interestingly, a few patients moved from the unhealthy ecostates during acute influenza infection to the healthy ecostate in the later time points. This suggests that the human microbiome exhibits resilience but potentially a weak elasticity; however, this could be due to the lack of a precise temporal control of the time of infection.
