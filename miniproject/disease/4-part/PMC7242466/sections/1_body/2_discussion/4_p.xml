 </sup>. It is currently unknown whether infection with other respiratory viruses can also induce the modulation of the URT microbiome; however, since severe viral infections often require respiratory support, including intubation, it is likely that co-infection with pathogens such as the 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> could actually be favored due to previous perturbations of the microbiome. Hence, additional associative studies to elucidate factors that modulate the temporal change of the microbiome structure could also aid in understanding the factors that promote or support secondary bacterial colonization during severe respiratory viral infections.
