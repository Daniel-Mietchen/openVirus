<p id="Par21">The sole statistical exception to the high community diversity of infected microbiomes was the increased relative abundance of 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic>, regardless of age, sex, antibiotic treatment, or even host organism. Yet, the bloom of 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> is consistent with previous reports in H1N1-infected patients

 </sup>. It must be noted that, while the DNA extraction method used could result in a slight underrepresentation of Gram-positive bacteria, this bias would be consistent across both infected and healthy control samples. In our study, 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> are present in relatively low proportions in the healthy microbiome of these host organisms. Therefore, their bloom might be due to a more hostile environment for the other taxa or perhaps a more hospitable environment for the 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic>, making this an excellent candidate for future strain isolation, genome sequencing, and transcriptional profiling. The differences in relative abundance observed between the infected cohorts opens the idea of using treatments capable of modulating the microbiome back into the healthy ecostate

 </sup>. Such a treatment would be homologous to those proposed for perturbing or restoring the gut microbiome

 </sup>. Understanding how and why 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> succeed after disturbance will provide valuable information for conducting future microbiome centric URT studies in a controlled setting. It should be noted that the blooming 
 <italic>Pseudomonads</italic> are not 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), and understanding their functional potential and role requires shotgun metagenomics analyses for more detailed phylogenetic and functional profiling.
