<p id="Par23">In the ferret model, there is a clear demonstration of ecological resilience in the URT microbiome; namely a return to the original community after disturbance, a phenomenon also observed, albeit less clearly, in the human samples, which had an unknown and likely more diverse ecostate prior to infection. Similar observations have been reported in the human gut microbiome after the disturbance associated with antibiotic treatment

 </sup>, though our findings expands it to the URT and the indirect effects of the IAV infection. The controlled experiments with ferrets resulted in near complete recovery. Human URT microbiomes do not unequivocally show a return to the health state, but in several patients, the microbiome returned to the healthy ecostate. Although it is tempting to suggest that the ferret microbiome might have greater elasticity (i.e., less time required for demonstration of resilience), there are multiple potential reasons for the discrepancy between ferrets and humans. For instance, the routes of and mode of infection are different, with the ferrets receiving a high volume containing a high titer dose intranasally, whereas human likely get infected by the aerosol route at potentially lower titer. On the other hand, considering metabolic rate relative to organism size, the ferret may recover at a more rapid rate simply due to a higher metabolism. More pertinently, the human cohort has an undetermined infection date, were infected by different viral strains (and viral variants as determined by whole IAV genome sequences) and had a selection bias towards phenotypically responsive patients (e.g., symptomatic hospitalized patients), where zero time (day 0) was the first day of symptom. Beyond the potential differences in absolute temporal trends in microbiome resilience and elasticity, the human and ferret microbiomes share similar trends at the ecosystem and individual taxon level that warrant further experimentation. The results here provide an experimental baseline for examining both predictive and therapeutic intervention focused experiments in the ferret model system. For example, the presented hypothesis that IAV driven microbiome disturbance increases the propensity for bacterial pathogen co-infection can be robustly tested by bi-partite exposures to viral, and then bacterial pathogens. The effects of lifestyle (diet, smoking, exercise) and abiotic influences (humidity, temperature) on the microbiome and its resilience should also be examined, particularly with regards to temporal dynamics of microbiome disturbance and recovery. Potential therapeutic approaches involve thwarting the associated threat of opportunistic bacterial pathogens or interventions focused on the bloom of

Multiple studies, including this one, have now shown that a subset of the taxa that are most frequently associated with secondary infections have increased relative abundance during IAV infection. It is possible that such outcomes could be reduced by modulating the host immune response during IAV infection
