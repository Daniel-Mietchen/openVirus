<p id="Par24">Patient clinical–epidemiological data, along with nasopharyngeal swabs were collected after informed written consent was obtained under protocols 11-116 and 16-066, reviewed and approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) before the start of sample collection. Between July and August of 2011 and June and September of 2012 (during the Southern Hemisphere autumn–winter season), a total of 146 nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from 30 hospitalized patients in Santiago, Chile, diagnosed clinically with influenza-like illness (ILI). Of the 30 patients in the study, 28 were confirmed and subtyped as H1N1pdm09 or H3N2 Influenza through RT-PCR by the Clinical Virology Laboratory at PUC. The remaining two patients could not be confirmed as influenza positive by qRT-PCR, RT-PCR and/or the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, so they were not included in further analyses. Samples were also tested against 13 other pathogens. In only two cases, we detected co-infections at the day of recruitment, one patient had Rhinovirus and another had Respiratory Syncytial virus; however, they tested negative in subsequent test. Between one and six samples from the acute phase of infection were taken from each patient, together with a sample up to 22 days post diagnosis (convalescence phase or healthy baseline) from 14 out of the 28 individuals analyzed. Upon collection of all samples, the timing of the infected cohort samples was established as the time in days since the onset of symptoms. Control samples from 22 healthy individuals, confirmed as negative against influenza A virus and 13 other common respiratory viruses, were obtained at the outpatient clinic with the same criteria in March to June of 2014. Epidemiological history, signs and symptoms, other diagnostics and treatments of each patient were also collected during hospitalization as detailed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Furthermore, 96.4% of patients received oseltamivir antiviral treatment, and 89.3% received antibiotics originating from the families of the fluoroquinolones (levofloxacine, morifloxacine, or ciprofloxacine), 3rd-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone or cefepime), carbapenems (meropenem or imipenem), metrodinazole, cotrimoxazole, or vancomycin. These treatments where supplied in a combination of 5 (4% of patients), 4 (8%), 3 (12%), 2 (40%), or one (36%) antibiotics in a complete treatment (at least 7 days) or less. Severe infection criteria were established in accordance with the hospitalization due to influenza and/or derivation to critical care unit (which involves oxygen support or mechanical ventilation and/or vasoactive drug administration) after symptoms onset. The microbiome data analyzed were obtained from the nasopharyngeal swabs of 28 infected subjects (13 male and 15 female), ages ranging from 1 year to 76 years, for a total of 121 samples. The naming convention of influenza A viruses detected from patients are as follows: A/Santiago/p
 <italic>x</italic>d
 <italic>y</italic>/2011 or A/Santiago/p
 <italic>x</italic>d
 <italic>y</italic>/2012 (p = patient and d = day). The negative controls analyzed in the study were nasopharyngeal swabs taken from 22 healthy patients (10 males and 12 females), ages ranging from 19 year to 65 years, most taken at all six time points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 28 post enrollment), for a total of 127 samples, which were negative for influenza and other respiratory infections.
