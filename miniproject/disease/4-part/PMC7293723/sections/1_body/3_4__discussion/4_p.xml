<p>Our study has some limitations. First, all samples positive with AIV were found in the Khe Sanh market; no positive sample was found in Lao Bao. This may be explained by the difference of poultry's sources for sale in two markets that need to be further studied. Second, due to limited resources, we have done sequencing for only H5 samples, not for H3 and H9 to confirm subtypes of these strains.</p>
