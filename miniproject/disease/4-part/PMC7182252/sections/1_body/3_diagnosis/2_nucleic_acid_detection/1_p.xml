<p id="p0380">Molecular diagnostics, such as multiplex real-time PCR, have replaced cell culture, fluorescent antigen-antibody detection, and antigen detection methodologies because they have high sensitivity and specificity, excellent quality control procedures, and detect a large battery of viral and bacterial pathogens rapidly in a single sample. The use of molecular diagnostics has significantly improved the yield of detection. Numerous rapid multiplex PCR assays are now commercially available that can detect up to 18 or more viruses simultaneously. These assays are sensitive and specific and can detect RSV, HMPV, influenza, HRVs, and HCoVs and differentiate all four PIV subtypes.</p>
