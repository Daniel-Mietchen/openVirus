<p id="p0290">In healthy individuals, most respiratory viral infections are associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract symptoms. Notable exceptions include a stronger association between RSV and bronchiolitis in young infants, PIV and laryngotracheobronchitis, and HRVs and reactive airway disease exacerbations. In immunocompromised patients, respiratory viral infections can be associated with prolonged shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death. Prolonged viral shedding can be associated with persistent respiratory symptoms or can be asymptomatic with durations up to 4 weeks (mean).
