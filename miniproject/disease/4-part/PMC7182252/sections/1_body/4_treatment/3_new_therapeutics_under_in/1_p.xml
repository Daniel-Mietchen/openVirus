<p id="p0435">New RSV antiviral candidates have been investigated, including presatovir (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA), an oral RSV fusion inhibitor, and lumicitabine (Alios/Janssen, Titusville, NJ), an RSV nucleoside analog acting on the RSV viral polymerase. Both antivirals have been tested in human challenge models and have successfully demonstrated antiviral efficacy. Presatovir subsequently underwent two large placebo-controlled clinical efficacy trials for the treatment of RSV in placebo-controlled studies conducted in 185 and 60 adult HSCT patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, respectively. Clinical trial endpoints of efficacy were not met for presatovir; studies with lumicitabine have also been suspended. New studies of another nucleoside analog, JNJ-53718678 (Janssen), are underway in young children. Nanobodies, small antibody-like molecules derived from the heavy-chain variable Ig domains that occur naturally in camels, are being developed to be administered by inhalation for the treatment of RSV infection (Ablynx NV, Ghent, Belgium). Vaccines for RSV and PIV are under development, as discussed earlier.</p>
