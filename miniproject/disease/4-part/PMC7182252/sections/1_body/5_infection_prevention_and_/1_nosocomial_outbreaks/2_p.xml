<p id="p0455">Nosocomial outbreaks characteristically occur from multiple introductions of community respiratory viral strains as well as patient-to-patient spread (perhaps with health care providers as intermediaries). For prevention of nosocomial transmission, contact isolation precautions are effective, provided that compliance with the policy is maintained among personnel. Hospital personnel may play a role in the transmission of RSV and other respiratory viruses to susceptible patients. Viral spreading can be limited by adherence to strict handwashing procedures and cohorting of infected and exposed individuals. Use of gloves, masks, and goggles in the hospital setting also limits spread. Such strict measures are appropriate in high-risk settings such as pediatric intensive care units or bone marrow transplant wards. Restriction of visitors, including young children, in hospital wards with patients at high risk for RSV infection may be necessary during epidemic periods in the community. Continued compliance through the respiratory virus season by all members of the health care team is critical.</p>
