The concern for progressive illness from respiratory viral infection needs to be balanced against concern for underlying disease progression and donor availability. In a large prospective study, respiratory viruses were detected in 116 of 458 HCT patients before transplantation, and viral detection was associated with prolonged hospitalization and lower survival at day 100.

 </xref> This risk was also present in patients with HRV alone. A recent retrospective review of HRV detected in pediatric HCT recipients demonstrated that HRV detection without the presence of lower respiratory tract infection was not associated with decreased days alive and out of the hospital, suggesting the HCT delay is not always warranted.

The impact of other factors such as viral-specific risk scores, location of infection and viral load, need to be evaluated. In pediatric patients, diagnostic PCR should be considered on all transplant candidates, regardless of symptoms, and transplant delay should be considered, if feasible, with ongoing symptoms or evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.
