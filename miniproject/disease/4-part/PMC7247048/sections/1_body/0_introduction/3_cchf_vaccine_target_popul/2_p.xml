<p>Nosocomial transmission constitutes a major route of CCHFV spread accounting for a large proportion of global CCHF cases,

 </sup> Nosocomial outbreaks often serve as an indicator of unrecognized infections in the general population and seroepidemiological surveys carried in the wake of nosocomial outbreaks reveal prior presence of the virus in the community. Human serum CCHFV titers are high (10
 <sup>8</sup>–10
 <sup>10</sup> copies/mL) during the prehemorrhagic stage, especially in fatal cases

 </sup> and the virus has been detected in urine and saliva.

 </sup> The high CCHFV titers put medical professionals in contact with patients at risk and the nonspecific symptoms early in the course of disease exacerbates the risk. Laboratory personnel handling live virus comprise another risk group who could be a target for the CCHF vaccine. Laboratory-acquired infections arising from handling patient samples

 </sup> have been reported. Besides humans, livestock could be vaccinated to prevent viremia in animals and subsequent transmission to humans. Vaccinating livestock also prevents them from serving as amplifying hosts although small mammals are considered principal amplifying hosts.
