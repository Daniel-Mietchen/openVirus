<p>Considering that CCHF cases are sporadic, global mass vaccinations are unlikely, thus targeting vaccinations would be ideal. People residing in endemic areas who are prone to tick bites, especially 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks, are at risk of acquiring CCHF.

 </sup> Development of an efficacious vaccine will prevent infections and possible mortality from the disease in risk groups. CCHF vaccine target population would include farmers dealing with agriculture or animal husbandry. Even though livestock does not develop CCHF, they present with transient viremia. Contact with blood or tissues from infected livestock and bites from infected ticks have been reported as transmitting CCHFV, resulting in outbreaks in farming communities.

 </sup> Besides farmers, individuals participating in religious activities such as the Muslim Eid-ul Azha who get exposed to livestock blood and tissue during animal slaughter are at an increased risk of CCHF.

 </sup> Veterinarians and abattoir workers stand a high chance of occupational exposure to tick bites or contact with viremic animal blood and thus constitute another risk group. Outdoor activities such as hiking and camping as well as some rural lifestyles where people live in close proximity to livestock pose as risk factors for tick bites and contact with infected animals.
