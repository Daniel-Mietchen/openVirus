<p>CCHFV is sustained in an enzootic cycle encompassing ticks and several vertebrate animals with humans regarded as dead-end hosts. Sources of human infections include bite from an infected tick, close contact with blood or tissue from diseased animals, and CCHF patients. Animals do not display symptoms, but disease in humans progresses through four phases: incubation, prehemorrhagic, hemorrhagic, and convalescence.

 </sup> Incubation period depends on the route of transmission; 1–3 days, up to 9 days for tick transmission while after exposure to infected blood or tissues incubation period is mostly 5–6 days and reach up to 13 days.
