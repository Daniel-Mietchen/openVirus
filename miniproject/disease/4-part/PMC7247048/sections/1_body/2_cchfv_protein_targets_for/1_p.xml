<p>Recent, CCHF vaccine development has focused on the viral glycoproteins and the nucleoprotein (NP) even though the immune correlates of protection are yet to be described. The investigated CCHFV proteins are recombinant proteins produced either 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> proteins were produced in cell cultures, purified, and vaccinated into animal models while 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protein production utilized vectors, which were used to deliver genes encoding CCHFV antigens facilitating endogenous protein production. 
 <italic>In situ</italic> antigen generation is desirable since proteins acquire post-translational modifications similar to natural infections.
