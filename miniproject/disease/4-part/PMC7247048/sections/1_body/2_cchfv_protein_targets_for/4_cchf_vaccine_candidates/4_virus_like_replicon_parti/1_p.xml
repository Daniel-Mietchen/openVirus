<p>Using reverse genetics, a transcriptionally active virus-like particle (tc-VLP) system, has been developed.

 </sup> Structurally, the VLPs consists of a genome like a reporter encapsidated by the CCHFV NP and L protein enclosed in a membrane displaying Gn and Gc proteins on the surface. Thus, VLPs have morphology and protein antigenicity resembling native CCHF viruses. Vaccinating three times intraperitoneally with the tc-VLP displaying the envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) from the CCHFV IbAr 10200 strain on their surface was accompanied by a strong induction of
