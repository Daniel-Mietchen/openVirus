<p>The CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 strain was propagated in cell culture, harvested, and inactivated by formaldehyde to prepare an inactivated vaccine. The vaccine was mixed with the Imject Alum adjuvant and delivered intraperitoneally using a prime, boost, and boost strategy

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice (

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice following lethal challenge infection. The effect of the vaccine on the T cell immune response was not evaluated.
