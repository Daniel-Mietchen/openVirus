<p>In the face of safety challenges and antivector immunity posed by commonly used viral expression platforms, there is a need to explore new platforms. BoHV-4 possesses features such as a less complex genome compared with other herpesviruses coupled by large package size, easy growth in cell culture, limited or no pathogenicity or oncogenicity,

 </sup> which makes it a good candidate. A BoHV-4 vector encoding the full-length NP of the CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 strain utilizing a prime and boost strategy provided complete protection of IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice against lethal challenge infection, and partial protection was observed in the antibody passive transfer and T cell adoptive transfer experiment
