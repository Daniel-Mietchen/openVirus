<p>A naked conventional CCHF mRNA vaccine has been described. The vaccine expresses the NP of the CCHF Ank-2 strain flanked by a 5′ cap (antireverse cap analog), 3′-polyA tail, 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions to enhance stability and translation of the construct. Intramuscular vaccination of IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> using a prime boost approach provided 100% protection following viral challenge while a single dose of the vaccine construct conferred 50% protection
