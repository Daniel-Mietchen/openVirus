<p>The role of the CCHFV NP in protection against infection and clearance of viruses is not known. However, the NP possesses features which make the antigen ideal for CCHFV vaccine development. The protein is produced in large amounts during infection and is highly immunogenic containing B and T cell epitopes.

 </sup> Besides that, the NP amino acid sequence shows the least variation

 </sup> Even though the NP is an internal protein and is not expected to induce neutralizing antibodies, the NP is released from infected cells
