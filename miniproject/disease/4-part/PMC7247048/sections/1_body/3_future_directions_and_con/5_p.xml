<p>The utility of a BoHV-4 viral vector in comparison to an AdV-5 and a DNA vector in NP-based vaccine development was evaluated.

 </sup> BoHV-4 persists in monocytes and macrophages. Persistence in white blood cells could eliminate the need for booster doses for antigens delivered by BoHV-4. Besides that, delivering antigens by the BoHV-4 vector can enhance antigen presentation since the virus persists in monocytes and macrophages, which are antigen-presenting cells.

 </sup> Even though similar protection rates in knockout mice were obtained with vaccine constructs delivered with the BoHV-4 and AdV-5 vectors, the advantages offered by the BoHV-4 vector needs to be further explored in detail. The role played by the various expression systems in shaping CCHFV immune responses in animal models warrant investigation.
