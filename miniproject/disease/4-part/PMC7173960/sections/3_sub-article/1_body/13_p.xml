<p>c) Subsection “Mapping of the SBV VHHs on the SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> domain” and Discussion paragraph six: Escape mutant for SB10 encoded the mutation of Y541C. It is not determined whether the mutation affects the binding of SB10, or the mutation alters the conformation of Gc, which leads to less efficient neutralization via SB10. Thus, the result does not provide conclusive evidence of binding region for SB10 and this conclusion should be softened.
