<p>Eighteen male and female IFNAR-/-mice with a C57BL/6 genetic background (B6.129S2-Ifnar1tm1Agt/Mmjax) were obtained from the specific pathogen free breeding unit of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut. The animals were 4 to 6 weeks old and were randomly divided into 3 groups of 6 animals with equally distributed sexes. The group size calculation followed the same assumptions as for the RVFV challenge experiment. 24 hr prior to challenge infection, the mice were intraperitoneally treated with 200 µg (SB10-ELP2
 <sub>ABD</sub>-SB10) or 100 µg (SB10-ELP2
 <sub>ABD</sub>-SB9) of purified VHH complexes diluted in 100 µl PBS/mouse. Control animals received an equal volume of PBS. The mice were subcutaneously infected with SBV strain BH619 (

 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse, diluted in 100 µl PBS). After challenge infection, the animals were closely monitored and weighed daily for 9 consecutive days. On days 3 and 7 post infection, EDTA blood samples were collected for RT-qPCR analyses. Animals showing severe clinical symptoms were immediately humanely euthanized. The remaining animals were euthanized after 21 days. At necropsy, serum and EDTA blood samples as well as tissue samples from liver and spleen were collected. RNA extraction was performed using a KingFisher 96 Flex (Thermo Scientific) and the MagAttract Virus Mini M48 Kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For RT-qPCR analyses a previously described SBV-S-segment-specific assay was used in combination with the beta actin housekeeping gene as internal control (
