<p>Scaffold sequences of three different lengths (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), based on previous work of Howarth and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Veggiani et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>), were codon-optimized for expression in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and synthesized by GenScript. The gene fragments were cloned into the pQE-80L expression plasmid (ORF organization: HisTag – SnoopCatcher – ELP(1/2/3) – SpyCatcher – GlySer linker- ABD – Entero kinase- Twin Strep-tag) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For the expression of the scaffold that facilitated formation of a trispecific VHH complex the ORF organization was as follows: HisTag – SnoopCatcher – ELP – SpyCatcher – ELP - SdyCatcher – GlySer linker- ABD – Entero kinase – Twin Strep-tag. Plasmids were subsequently introduced into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 competent cells by standard procedures. Transformed colonies were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and induced by IPTG using standard procedures. Cells were subsequently lysed under denaturing conditions, using 6 M guanidine hydrochloride as a denaturant. The scaffolds were purified from the supernatants by IMAC using Ni-NTA resin. Finally, the scaffolds were refolded by buffer exchange to PBS using 30 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore).
