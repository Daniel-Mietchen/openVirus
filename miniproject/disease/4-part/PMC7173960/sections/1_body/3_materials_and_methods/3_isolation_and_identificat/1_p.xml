<p>After the second or third round of panning and transduction to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> TG1 cells, individual colonies were picked and the VHH expression was induced with 3 mM IPTG. Soluble VHHs, extracted from the periplasm, were tested for binding to the RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub> and SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> antigens at 10-fold dilution as described below (ELISA). Individual VHHs were sequenced and aligned according to the IMGT system as described (
