<p>Cells were fixed with 4% v/v paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT and then washed with PBST
 <sub>20</sub>. For cell permeabilization, the fixed cells were incubated with PBS supplemented with 1% v/v Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT. After three washes with PBST
 <sub>20</sub>, plates were subsequently blocked with IPMA blocking buffer (5% v/v horse serum in PBS) and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Diluted primary antibodies (VHHs) in blocking buffer (100 µL/well) were added. Plates were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C and then washed three times with PBST
 <sub>20</sub>. Subsequently, a HRP-conjugated goat anti-llama IgG H+L secondary antibody (Bethyl, A160-100P) in blocking buffer (1:1000, 100 µL/well) was added. Plates were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C and then washed three times with PBST
 <sub>20</sub>. For staining, 100 µL/well of a 0.2 mg/mL amino ethyl carbazole (AEC) solution in 500 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 88 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was added as a substrate. Plates were incubated for 15–30 min at RT. Titers were calculated as the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>)/mL using the Spearman-Kärber method.
