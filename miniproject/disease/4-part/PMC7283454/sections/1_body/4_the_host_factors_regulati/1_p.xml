<p>BatIVs, like all viruses, have to compromise with positive and negative genetic factors present in target cells for their survival at each replication stage. Little is known regarding the interaction of BatIV proteins and RNA with the host or viral factors even though such interactions may determine the fate and/or efficiency of infection, transmission, and epidemic potential of the viruses. Previous studies revealed that the bat Nonstructural NS1 proteins can act as interferon (IFN) antagonists in human cells, and likely inhibit induction of IFN at a pretranscriptional level (Ciminski et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that the IFN-induced human MxA protein controls the replication of H18N11, but it is not clear whether sufficient MxA-escape mutations in H18N11 NP can be acquired 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> that could potentially result in full MxA resistance (Ciminski et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>). Nearly all lab work examining host and viral immune-modulating proteins is performed with human/rodent cell lines. The difficulty in interpreting these data is that evolutionarily-optimized immune factors behave differently in non-natural hosts. Certainly, comprehensive kinetic analyses of immune-responses to BatIVs using primary or immortalized bat cell lines will be particularly informative. For instance, a comparison of the transcriptome of BatIV infected versus uninfected bat cells could help us identify specific immune genes contributing to host resistance and the molecular mechanisms underlying the viral pathogenesis.
