<p>However, the abilities of BatIVs to (i) reassort between themselves, (ii) to mutate in order to infect and transmit sustainably among their hosts, and (iii) enter human HLA-DR
 <sup>+</sup> cells, highlight that a zoonotic transmission of BatIVs is theoretically possible. The documented spillover of other non-reassortant bat-borne RNA viruses following continued host-pathogen interaction (i.e., NiV and EBOV) lends certain credence to this hypothesis, albeit clearly, supporting evidence is lacking.
