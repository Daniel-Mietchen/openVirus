<p>At our hospital, there were 17 AFM cases (10 confirmed and 7 probable cases) in 2018, mostly occurred in Julyâ€“December, and particularly in October. Nine of eighteen AFM patients were EV-D68 positive (seven based on stool samples and two based on nasopharyngeal swabs plus stool samples). The EV-D68-positive rate in our AFM patients was higher than the rates reported in other studies (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). It is possible that the cases mostly occurred in the summer and early autumn, which are the periods associated with an active EV-D68 circulation pattern (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). All the EV-D68 strains identified in this study belonged to clade B3. This is in line with previous findings regarding the EV-D68 epidemics in Hong Kong (2014) (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and Taiwan (2014) (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), which indicated that EV-D68 subclade B3 was the predominant lineage circulating in China during the epidemics.
