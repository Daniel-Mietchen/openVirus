<p>An entomological field survey was conducted in the islands of the territory of Wallis and Futuna in order to characterize and map the different 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species, which are confirmed or potential vectors of arboviruses. The objective of the present work was to acquire new entomological data that cover the three islands of Wallis and Futuna to i) check the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species previously recorded on the islands, ii) monitor a possible dissemination of these species in the islands and between islands, and iii) control the possible colonization of the territory by new 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species. Furthermore, we investigated the vector competence of local 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> populations for CHIKV to determine the risk of transmission of chikungunya in the territory.
