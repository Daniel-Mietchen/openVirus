<p>This is a well written paper that deals with the determination of factors affecting the spatiotemporal variability of WNV cases in humans through identification of the fine scale drivers of WNV transmission in an urban area with a repeated history of WNV outbreaks. The findings are very interesting since they include multi-level modeling of weekly data from over a decade and they extend our knowledge in the correlation of variables related to temperature, precipitation, mosquito infection, land cover, and demographic characteristics with the probability of an area having a WNV case or not.</p>
