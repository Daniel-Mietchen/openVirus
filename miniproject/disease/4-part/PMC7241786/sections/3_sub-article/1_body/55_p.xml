<p>This manuscript analyzes the available long-term data of mosquito infection rates, West Nile virus human cases and weather variables from 2005 to 2016 combined with landscape and demographic characteristics of two Illinois counties of the Chicago region in order to evaluate relationships between the factors on fine temporal and spatial scale and identify the drivers that potentially affect the presence of human WNV illness and may act as early warning predictors.</p>
