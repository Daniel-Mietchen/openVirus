<p>We chose to summarize all variables into hexagons to provide a neutral spatial unit of consistent size and shape, which is not possible with political boundaries. For this, we overlaid hexagons measuring 1000 m in diameter on the outlines of Cook and DuPage counties to create a grid of 5,345 hexagons for the study area. Out of these, 328 were excluded after a comparison with fine scale population data from the 2010 U.S. Census indicated that there were no households on record within those hexagons. Thus, 5,017 hexagons were included in the analysis. All independent variables related to weather, land cover, mosquito infection and demography were calculated for each hexagon, as described below.</p>
