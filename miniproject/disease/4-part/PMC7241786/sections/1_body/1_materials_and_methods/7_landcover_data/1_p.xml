<p>Landcover data for the entire United States was obtained from the national landcover database (NLCD) for the years 2006 and 2011. The NLCD database is a Landsat based landcover data available at a 30 m resolution (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrlc.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.mrlc.gov</ext-link>). The landcover raster was clipped for Cook and DuPage counties, including a surrounding 1 km buffer. From this clipped raster, the total number of pixels for each land category within each hexagon was calculated using the tabulate as area tool in ArcGIS 10.1. The proportion of each land cover category for each hexagon was then calculated by dividing the number of pixels for that category by the total number of pixels for all categories. In Cook and DuPage counties, 15 different types of landcover were available: urban areas (developed open space, developed low intensity, developed medium intensity, developed high intensity), forests (deciduous, evergreen and mixed), barren land, shrubs, grassland, pasture, cultivated crops, woody wetlands, herbaceous wetlands, and open water. The land cover data from 2006 was used to analyze the WNV cases for the years from 2006 to 2010, while the land cover data from 2011 was used for 2011 to 2016.
