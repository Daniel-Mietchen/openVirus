<p>In this study, we did not consider prior seasonal differences in the weather conditions, which we recommend be incorporated in future studies. In addition, the calculation of MIR for hexagons may be biased as the IDW interpolation technique used to develop continuous surface maps is affected by the uneven distribution of mosquito traps across the study area. Alternatively, other interpolation methods such as kriging might be used to develop continuous surface maps for MIR, as this method takes into account spatial autocorrelation and also creates an error map. In this study, we did not distinguish between neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive WNV cases. Separate analysis for only neuroinvasive cases might help us to identify what conditions drive the occurrence of the severe form of WNV infection and should also help to reduce diagnostic bias. Also, in future studies, we might consider using different spatial scales to identify if the geographic scale has affected the results. We were also unable to use data from avian or equid surveillance in this study, despite its usefulness in other modeling approaches [

 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], due to the lack of consistent data across the time period. Bird surveillance in Illinois is limited to passive surveillance of a small number of dead birds tested in each county per year, and is generally suspended after WNV is known to be circulating in the area, while equid surveillance is based entirely on passive self-reporting [
