<p>In Illinois, WNV human infections have been endemic since 2002, with annual variability in the number of cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The majority of the human WNV cases have been reported from the northeastern region, where the largest number of people in the state is congregated. A census tract level analysis in this region using human WNV occurrence data from the 2002 outbreak year identified that census tracts with lower population density, relatively close WNV positive dead bird specimens, a higher percentage of older white residents, and housing built between 1950 and 1959 were more likely to be associated with spatial clusters of WNV cases [

 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This analysis determined that white populations and housing from the 1950s were associated with increased illness in some years, but this was not consistent. Interestingly, census tracts with lower rainfall had higher rates of WNV illness, but the mosquito infection rate was not an important variable in any of the models [
