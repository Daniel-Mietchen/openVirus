<p>Public health surveillance for West Nile virus (WNV) involves collection and testing of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> vector mosquitoes, collection and testing of dead birds suspected to have died of WNV, testing of sentinel chickens or of wild birds captured for this purpose, and reporting of cases of human and equine illness [

The ultimate goal of these surveillance data is to target mosquito control, and thereby reduce illness through the reduction of the number of infected vector mosquitoes, and to target educational messages to warn citizens to reduce individual exposure. One additional advantage of having a strong surveillance system in place is that the long-term data generated can be integrated with publicly available weather, landscape, and socioeconomic data and can be used effectively to identify the important drivers of WNV transmission and to develop predictive models [
