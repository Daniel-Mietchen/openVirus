<p>We used remote sensing satellite imagery (Google Earth, California, USA) to map the communities within the LRGV using QGIS 3.4 (QGIS Development team 2019). We estimated household densities using the 2010 US census blocks shape file and extracted the information regarding number of houses, number people/house and area of the community. We also quantified household density in Nuevo Amanecer as a representative community in the city of Reynosa with prior DENV transmission activity (Rodríguez-Pérez Mario A, A. M. A., Russell Tanya L, Olguin-Rodriguez Omar, Laredo-Tiscareño Stephanie V, Garza-Hernandez Javier A, Reyes-Villanueva Filiberto. Host-seeking Aedes aegypti linked to dengue seropositive households at northeastern Mexico. Journal of Vector Borne Diseases (in press)). We used satellite imagery (Google Earth, California, USA) to quantify homes manually and census block information to identify the boundaries of the neighborhood. Nuevo Amanecer was chosen because of its known dengue endemicity.</p>
