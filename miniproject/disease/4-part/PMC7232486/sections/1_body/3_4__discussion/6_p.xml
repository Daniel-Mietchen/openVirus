<p>The blood meal analysis results for 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> yielded 75.6% of the bloodmeals from birds, with chickens being the dominant species (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These results are consistent with prior studies which show that 
 <italic>Culex</italic> are principally ornithophilic [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Both the bloodfed 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> were processed with the exact same protocol, and the contrasting results provide more confidence in the accuracy of the identified blood meals. The high host chicken use is consistent with 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> host feeding patterns in tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The inclusion of Passerines as hosts by 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> would suggest their potential role as an amplification vector for West Nile virus (WNV) in South Texas, while the observation of human feeding would suggest the potential to bridge WNV to humans. In some regions of the world, 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> can be highly anthropophilic [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and it was surprising to not find more human-derived bloodmeals. A good example of a study that analyzed both forage ratio (FR) and the human blood index (HBI) for 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes was conducted by Garcia-Rejon et al. in Yucatan State, Mexico [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. They found an HBI of 6.7, but the FR for humans was &lt; 1 when compared to that of other vertebrate hosts, indicating that 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes in this area under-utilized humans as hosts. In fact, species of the Passeriformes and Galliformes orders were the only hosts that had a FR &gt;1 [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This ornithophilic pattern of 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes was also demonstrated in College Station, Texas (95.5% blood meals on birds) [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; and Harris County, Texas (39.1% on birds) [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].
