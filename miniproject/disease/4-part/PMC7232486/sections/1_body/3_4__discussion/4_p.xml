<p>The low rate of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> anthropophily in the current study could be explained by several reasons. The most parsimonious explanation is the higher availability of non-human hosts, limited opportunity for human biting, and lower human density [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In our Texas study sites, humans make up 41% of all domestic hosts in the four study sites combined. Our analysis does not account for wild birds and wild mammals which, if included, would further reduce the relative abundance of humans compared to non-human animals. Although many human-amplified urban arboviruses occur in densely populated settings, a study in Thailand found the largest dengue epidemics occurred in low to moderate population densities, where water storage and the production of mosquitoes is an additional factor driving transmission [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Another factor influencing the ability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to feed on humans is the integrity of the home and frequency of indoor feeding. Our recent study in nearby neighborhoods shows that the outdoor 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> relative abundance is about eight times that of the indoor population [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Prior studies in the Texasâ€“Mexico border region have shown that the presence of air conditioning units and larger lot size are associated with a lower probability of homeowners being exposed to DENV [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A final hypothesis explaining the low rate of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> feeding on humans is that there is a genetic basis. A genetic basis for host selection has been well documented in 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In 1967, Macdonald [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] reviewed the progress on understanding the ecology of multiple forms of 
 <italic>Ae. Aegypti</italic>, including 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti formosus</italic> found in east Africa which tended to be more exophilic and frequently fed on non-human hosts. More contemporary population genetics studies have confirmed that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti formosus</italic> is the ancestral form of the domesticated 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti aegypti</italic>, which lives in tight association with human landscapes and is more anthropophilic [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The host preference of the ancestral and domesticated forms of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in east Africa is considered to have a genetic basis [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Although the domesticated form of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has spread around the world, Macdonald [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] postulated that, outside Africa, the plasticity of the species means the potential for non-human feeding and exophily exists, and the current study supports the ability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to adapt to an environment with lower availability of human hosts [
