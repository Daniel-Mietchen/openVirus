   <tr>
    <td align="left">– Quarantine the infected and develop a vaccine. Quarantines are difficult to maintain and vaccines take time develop</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">– Hide the uninfected. A great plan if you’re outnumbered, until the zombies breach your zone and find what the scientists says is a ‘perfect environment’ for the disease to spread</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">– A selective cull. Effective if precisely orchestrated, but nearly impossible to achieve given that early cases may not show obvious symptoms</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">– Eradicate the infected area. It’s guaranteed to end the outbreak, but moral issues remain given the ‘heavy losses of uninfected individuals’</td>
