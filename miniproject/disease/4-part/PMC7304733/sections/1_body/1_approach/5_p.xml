<p id="Par12">With the infection information, and an understanding of the type of zombie we are dealing with, it’s time to develop and validate models of the outbreak (steps 7–10). These can extend on the models used in the assignment, described earlier. Steps 11–12 look at the response and monitoring of the situation, while the final step looks at communicating the plans and progress of the response. The steps may be carried out in parallel, and may have feedback loops to update and reassess based on additional information throughout the investigation [
