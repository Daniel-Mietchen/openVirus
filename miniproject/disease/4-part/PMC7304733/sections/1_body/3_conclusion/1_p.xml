<p id="Par45">We have described an outreach project intended to increase awareness of computational science and the multi-disciplinary teams that are required to address the challenges facing our planet. The project has been able to capture the imagination of students, teachers and parents through interaction with our models and simulations. Lengthy interactions, requests for additional resources and school visits indicate that we have succeeded in engaging our audience. The media interest supports our belief that we have a useful premise and plausible resources. Future work will be to develop an improved online presence and additional resources, including browser and/or app-based simulations, lesson plans and more detailed materials to expand on specific aspects of the scenario.</p>
