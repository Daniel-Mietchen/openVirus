<p id="p0040">The replication of influenza virus in host cells is dependent on a variety of intracellular signaling pathways that synchronously initiate the pro-inflammatory response to limit virus spread. Therefore, the inhibition of signaling required for viral replication exerts antiviral effects and attenuates virus-mediated excessive pro-inflammatory responses. Activation of inducible transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays essential roles in the regulation of diverse biological processes, such as immune responses to pathogen infection, differentiation, apoptosis and cell survival. In fact, NF-κB signaling plays a critical role in productive replication of influenza viruses. Cell lines with decreased NF-κB activities result in decreased susceptibility to influenza virus propagation [
