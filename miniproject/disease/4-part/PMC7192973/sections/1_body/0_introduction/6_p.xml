 <italic>Isatis indigotica Fort.</italic> belongs to the plant family of Cruciferae, which is used in the treatment of colds, fever, sore throats and headaches in traditional Chinese medicine. Previous studies revealed that active components from

Among these active components, the monounsaturated fatty acid erucic acid has been reported to ameliorate scopolamine-induced memory impairment via activation of the PI3K-PKCζ-ERK-CREB and AKT signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, potential beneficial properties of erucic acid against influenza have not yet been reported. In the present study, we hypothesized that erucic acid exerts a protective effect against influenza diseases and the underlying mechanism of anti-viral properties and suppression of virus-mediated pro-inflammatory responses was investigated.
