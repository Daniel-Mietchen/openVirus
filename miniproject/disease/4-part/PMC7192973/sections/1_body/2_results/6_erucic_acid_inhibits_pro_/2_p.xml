<p id="p0180">Apart from lung injury caused by an imbalanced over-production of pro-inflammatory mediators, lung damage is worsened by apoptosis induction during influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this regard, the effect of erucic acid on influenza virus-induced apoptosis in A549 cells was determined. Annexin V staining revealed that erucic acid significantly decreased the percentages of apoptotic cells (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). Additionally, treatment with erucic acid exerted significant anti-apoptotic effects as determined by Western blot analysis of expression of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP in influenza virus-infected cells (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). It is well established that viral products such as vRNA, containing a 5′ppp end groups, NS1, PB1–F2 and M2 serve a crucial role in inducing apoptosis [

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>]. Therefore, effects of erucic acid on apoptosis in cells transfected with vRNA derived from IAV were analyzed. Supporting data were obtained, describing the induction of apoptotic cells and expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP after transfection with vRNA and effects were reversed by erucic acid treatment (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>C and D). Based on previous results that showed erucic acid treatment blocked IAV-induced p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling activation (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A), we therefore questioned whether the transfected vRNA-mediated signaling was affected by erucic acid treatment. NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling was activated by vRNA transfection following inhibition by erucic acid treatment; however, ERK MAPK signaling was not affected (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E). Additionally, cells transfected with vRNA triggered upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IP-10, IL-8, MCP-1, MCP-2 and RANTES that were decreased by erucic acid treatment (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>F). Additionally, increased expression of COX-2 and its downstream product PGE2 in the culture supernatant by vRNA stimulation were abrogated by erucic acid treatment in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>G and H). Of note, cellular (c) RNA or the 5′ppp of vRNA removed by treatment with CIAP did not induce apoptosis, signaling transduction and pro-inflammatory mediator production. The data suggested that erucic acid inhibited pro-inflammatory responses and apoptosis in cells with vRNA stimulation through inhibition of NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling, which might significantly attenuate IAV-induced lung injury.
