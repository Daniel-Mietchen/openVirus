<p id="p0200">To provide insights into the mechanism of action of erucic acid in IAV infection in vivo, effects of erucic acid on IAV-mediated signal transduction and pro-inflammatory responses in the lung were assessed. It was found that erucic acid significantly decreased IAV-mediated phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK, ERK MAPK, STAT1, STAT3 and AKT signaling in the lung (

These results suggested that inhibition of these signaling pathways via erucic acid may attenuate IAV-mediated excessive expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contributes to severe lung immunopathology. Additionally, it was demonstrated that erucic acid administration inhibited levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the BALF, including IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, MIP-1α and GM-CSF, and lung tissue, including IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1 and RANTES (

As results from the in vitro analysis suggested that erucic acid reversed IAV-induced expression of IFNs associated with amplification of pro-inflammatory response, it was important to determine whether erucic acid affected the levels of IFNs in vivo. As expected, members of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) were reduced by erucic acid treatment (
