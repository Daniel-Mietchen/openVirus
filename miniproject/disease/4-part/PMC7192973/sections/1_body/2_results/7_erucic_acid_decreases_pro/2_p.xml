<p id="p0185">IFNs released by host cells are vital cytokines in response to viral infection. Previous reports have shown that NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling cascades are essential for initiation of IFNs expression [

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To investigate whether erucic acid affects virus-induced expression of IFNs by targeting NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling, IFNs levels were quantified in culture supernatants after erucic acid treatment. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, in virus-infected cells with erucic acid treatment, NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 (column 8) and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (column 6) treatment resulted in suppression of type I INF (IFN-β) and III INF (IFN-λ1) production. Combined treatment with the two inhibitors generated synergistic effects (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, column 10), suggesting NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling were critical for maximum IFNs expression. Furthermore, we observed that the combination of erucic acid with an inhibitor enhanced the inhibitory effects on the expression of IFNs (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, column 7 and 9). This indicated that IFN suppression effects by erucic acid were potentially associated with NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling inhibition properties. Erucic acid suppressed increases of IFN levels induced by vRNA (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To investigate effects of erucic acid on IFN-associated inflammatory responses, cells were pre-treated with IFN-β (500 ng/mL) for 4 h prior to IAV infection in the presence and absence of erucic acid. Pretreatment with IFN-β significantly amplified expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IP-10, IL-8 and MIP-1β (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C). Whereas, the pro-inflammatory amplification effect elicited by IFN-β was diminished by either erucic acid or two inhibitors (BAY11-7082 and SB203580) treatment. Of note, combination of erucic acid and the two inhibitors caused an additive effect on inhibition of cytokine expression (
