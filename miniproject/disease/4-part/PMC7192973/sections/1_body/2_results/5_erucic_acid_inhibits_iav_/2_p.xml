Since erucic acid suppressed activation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling, it was investigated whether erucic acid would affect virus-induced cytokines and chemokines excessive release by using Luminex assays. The cytokine profile revealed that infection with influenza A virus resulted in a significant elevation of an array of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IP-10, RANTES, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-25, IL-31 and sCD40L (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], were associated with the pathogenesis of influenza infection. Therefore, we suggested that erucic acid may decrease virus-induced expression of COX-2. As expected, treatment of virus-infected cells with erucic acid inhibited COX-2 and derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) expression (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>B and C). These results demonstrated that erucic acid treatment impaired virus-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators through inhibition of the p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
