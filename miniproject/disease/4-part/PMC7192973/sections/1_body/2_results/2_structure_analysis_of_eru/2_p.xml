<p id="p0160">The chemical structure of the compound isolated from 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica Fort.</italic> was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy. White amorphous powder, 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>): δ = 5.36 (2H, m, H-13,14), 2.36 (2H, t, J = 7.3 Hz, H-2), 2.02 (4H, m, H-2,15), 1.63 (2H, m, H-3), 1.5–1.1 (28H, m, 14×CH
 <sub>2</sub>), 0.90 (3H, t, J = 6.0 Hz, H-22). 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>): δ = 179.89 (C-1), 34.01 (C-2), 24.68 (C-3), 27.21 (C-4), 129.89 (C-13), 129.91 (C-14), 29.0–32.0 (14×CH
 <sub>2</sub>), 22.70 (C-21), 14.13 (C-22). The compound was identified as erucic acid by comparison with literature 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A and B). Erucic acid induces biological effects at certain concentrations; therefore, we performed MTT assays to evaluate cytotoxic effects of erucic acid on A549 cells (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). The results showed that the TC
 <sub>50</sub> value of erucic acid was 1.78 mM. Then 0.9 mM erucic acid was selected as the maximum dose for investigating the mechanism of action against virus infection.
