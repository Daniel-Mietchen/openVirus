<p id="p0230">In vitro data suggested that an increasing percentage of apoptotic cells following influenza virus infection and vRNA stimulation was decreased upon erucic acid treatment (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>A–D). Similarly, erucic acid reduced levels of pro-apoptotic protease granzyme B as well as apoptosis marker active caspase-3 in vivo (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>J). During viral infection, apoptosis of the virus-infected cells was regarded as the host defense mechanism to eliminate invading pathogens. However, an increasing evidence suggests that influenza progression has a direct link to the apoptosis of viral-infected cells. Characteristic pathological findings in H5N1- or pandemic H1N1-infected patients with ARDS exhibited severe lung damage involving apoptosis of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that pro-apoptotic factor TRAIL that is released from recruited macrophages into the atmosphere is significantly associated with the rapid development of IAV-mediated acute lung injury and progression to ARDS [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, CTLs utilize pro-apoptotic factors, including TRAIL, perforin or granzyme B, to trigger apoptosis in IAV-infected cells [

 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], which is as an important limitation of viral replication. However, excessive CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes recruitment contributes to immunopathology in the course of a viral infection. Peripheral blood CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes are more abundant in patients with severe pneumonia than moderate pneumonia [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Histological findings of the lungs of novel swine H1N1-infected patients supported that increased CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte and granzyme B
 <sup>+</sup> expression correlates with diffuse alveolar damage and fatal outcome [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Recipient HA-transgenic mice with HA-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocyte transfer develop progressive lethal lung injury [
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. IAV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes trigger non-specific apoptosis of bystander alveolar epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The current data showed that erucic acid reduced CTL recruitment and cytotoxic granzyme B expression in lungs, which is potentially associated with reduction of IAV-mediated lung injury and mortality.
