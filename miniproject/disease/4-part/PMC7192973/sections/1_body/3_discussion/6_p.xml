<p id="p0225">Erucic acid treatment was also found to decrease the expression levels of IFNs in IAV- or vRNA -stimulated cells and BALF form IAV-infected mice lungs (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>D). IFNs were firmly established as crucial components of innate immunity against viral infection. Type I and III IFNs with their receptor-triggered activation of tripartite transcriptional complex ISGF3, drive expression of antiviral effectors through binding to an ISRE DNA element [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. IFN-β deficient samples exhibit increased susceptibility to various types of viral infection, including vaccinia virus [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], coxsackievirus B3 [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], Friend retrovirus [
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and influenza virus [
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, given immunomodulatory properties of IFNs, the emerging concept is that IFN-β acts in a disease-promoting role in response to viral pathogens. Recent evidence suggests that IAV-mediated IFN-β expression in macrophages increases expression levels of the pro-apoptotic factor TRAIL and contributes to lung injury [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It was reported that IFN signaling deficiency attenuates inflammation and protects mice from IAV- or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-mediated morbidity [

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In line with this, the current study demonstrated that cells with IFN-β pre-treatment amplified IAV-mediated expression of cytokines that was reversed by erucic acid intervention (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C). Further investigations revealed that the underlying mechanism responsible for the amplification of IAV-mediated pro-inflammatory mediator production was associated with the enhancement of the transcriptional activity of the ISGF3 complex induced by IFN-β pre-treatment, while erucic acid treatment reduced the transcriptional activity (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref>D and E). As erucic acid possesses NF-κB and p38 kinase inhibitory activities, the results presented in the current study hypothesized that optimal pro-inflammatory mediator secretion driven by the ISGF3 complex may be associated with NF-κB and p38 kinase activities. These claims were directly confirmed by observations that treatment with NF-κB or p38 kinase inhibitors individually suppressed the transcriptional activity of the ISGF3 complex and amplified pro-inflammatory response elicited by IFN-β pre-treatment. Combination treatment enhanced observed inhibitory effects. Previously, a synergy between the NF-κB and IFN signaling pathways for optimal cytokine IL-12p70 production was described for dendritic cells following LPS or poly (I:C) stimulation [
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Moreover, inhibition of p38 kinase has been suggested to interfere with IFN signaling transduction by impairing ISGF3 complex formation and STAT1 phosphorylation at serine

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Our data added to the aforementioned studies that involvement of NF-κB or p38 kinase signaling may contribute to the IFN-mediated amplification of a detrimental pro-inflammatory response to influenza virus infection.
