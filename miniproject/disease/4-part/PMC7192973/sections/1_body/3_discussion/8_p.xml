<p id="p0235">In conclusion, it was revealed that erucic acid treatment of influenza virus-infected cells resulted in the significant suppression of viral propagation and pro-inflammatory mediator production via NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling inactivation. This further involved interference with ISRE transcriptional activities accompanied by abrogation of the amplification of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in IFN-β pre-treated cells. Moreover, erucic acid protected mice from influenza virus-induced lung injury and improved mortality by attenuating viral load, CTL recruitment and excessive pro-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, it is suggested that erucic acid exerted inhibitory effects on viral replication and modulated virus-evoked excess pro-inflammatory responses that may have potential in the treatment of influenza illness.</p>
