<p id="p0205">Seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics of influenza viruses constitute a serious public health risk and inflict immense morbidity and mortality. Antiviral drugs are used clinically in influenza therapy; however, even early oseltamivir treatment does not improve the outcome of critically ill patients with HPAI H5N1 or H7N9 virus infection due to induction of an uncontrollable cytokine storm [

Clinical evidence demonstrated an association of influenza pathogenesis with the intensity of the inflammatory response, highlighting the potential benefits of immunomodulatory agents for influenza treatments. Nevertheless, given that viral PAMPs are detected by cellular PRRs and subsequently evoke pro-inflammatory responses, the development of dual-functional drugs with both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties shows potential in the treatment of hypercytokinemia in severe influenza cases. Antiviral activity further acts to reduce inflammation by decreasing the presence of PAMPs to be sensed by cellular PRRs.
