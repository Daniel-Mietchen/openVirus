<p id="p0105">At day 5 p.i., mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were harvested. Paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffinized lung sections (4-μm) were deparaffinized and dehydrated. Lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathology analysis. For immumohistochemistry, lung sections were microwaved for 20 min in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>; 3%) was used to block peroxidase activity. Sections were blocked with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse CD3 antibody in the humidified chamber for overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Multi-Sciences). Sections were developed with DAB reagent (Maixin, China) and counterstained with hematoxylin.
