<p id="p0125">Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from mice was obtained by washing the lungs with 0.6 mL PBS three times. After centrifugation (500 × g; 5 min), BALF supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. BALF cell suspensions (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/100 μL) were collected and stained with FACS buffer (2% BSA with 0.01% azide in PBS). Cells were then stained with fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse mAbs purchased from eBioscience for 30 min at 4 °C: CD45-APC-eFluor780 (clone NO.30-F11), CD3-PE-Cyanine7 (clone NO. UCHT1), CD4-FITC (clone NO. RM4-5) and CD8-APC (clone NO. 53–6.7). After staining, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 300 μL FACS buffer for analysis on a NovoCyte flow cytometer.
