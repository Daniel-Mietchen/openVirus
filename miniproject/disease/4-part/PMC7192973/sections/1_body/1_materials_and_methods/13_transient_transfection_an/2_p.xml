<p id="p0140">The effect of erucic acid on viral minigenome reporter systems was assessed as described previously [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, components of the vRNP complex, including PB1, PB2, PA and NP, together with a luciferase reporter plasmid PHY-luci and phRL-TK plasmid were co-transfected into A549 cells. At 6 h post-transfection, cells were treated with or without erucic acid for 24 h and lysed to determine luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).
