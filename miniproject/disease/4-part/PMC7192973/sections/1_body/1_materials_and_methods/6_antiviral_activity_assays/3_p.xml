<p id="p0090">MDCK cells in 6-well plates were infected with influenza viruses (100 PFU/well) and incubated with the indicated concentration of compounds or DMSO. The culture supernatant containing viral particles was collected at 24 h post infection (p.i.) and stored at −80 °C. Then, MDCK cells were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of the supernatant. Cells were stained with trypan blue after 48 h to visualize virus plaques.</p>
