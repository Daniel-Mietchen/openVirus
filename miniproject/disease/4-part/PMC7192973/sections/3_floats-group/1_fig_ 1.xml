  <p>Chemical structure and cytotoxicity of erucic acid. (A) 
   <sup>1</sup>H and 
   <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra for the compound isolated from 
   <italic>Isatis indigotica Fort.</italic> recorded in CDCl
   <sub>3</sub>. (B) Chemical structure of erucic acid. (C) Cytotoxic effects of erucic acid on viability of A549 cells. A549 cells were incubated with varying concentrations of erucic acid for 48 h and viability was determined by MTT assay. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean, representative of three independent experiments. ∗
