  <p>Erucic acid administration protects against lethal IAV challenge in vivo. Female BALB/c mice received erucic acid (50 and 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 days prior to intranasal inoculation with A/FM1/H1N1 virus (5 LD
   <sub>50</sub>). (A) General appearance of mice with or without erucic acid treatment at day 7 p.i. (B–C) Survival rate (B) and weight loss (C) of virus-infected mice with or without erucic acid administration were monitored daily for 14 days (
   <italic>n</italic> = 13–15/group). Survival curves were compared by log-rank test; ∗

(F–G) On day 7 p.i., viral titers in lungs were determined by plaque assay and lung homogenate was analyzed for viral proteins (PB1, PB2 and M1) by immunoblotting; GAPDH was used as loading control. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. ∗
