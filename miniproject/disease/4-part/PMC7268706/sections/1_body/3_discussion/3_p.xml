<p id="Par34">These pathogens differ in their transmission efficiency with exposure types [

 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> transmissions were more efficient than HIV transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our study illuminated that HCV infection, but not HIV infection, was significantly associated 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection in men. 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection might contribute to HCV/HIV coinfection or HCV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A study in FSWs shows that HCV is spread mainly by blood, rarely by sexual contact [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which could explain why HCV infection associated with 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection only occurred in males. Although HBV infection is not a classical STD, it can be transmitted through sexual contact with low efficiency [
