<p id="Par36">Consistent with previous studies, spouse having syphilis was a risk factor for 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection in females [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] while syphilis was associated with drug abuse in males. Sharing syringes and drug related sexual activities dramatically increase the risk of 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. IDUs who engage in unprotected sex, place their female spouses at high risk for STDs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It is common for Yi drug users to engage in sexual behaviors with no condom [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and the proportion of condom use is extremely low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, females are highly vulnerable to 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection due to their unprotected sexual contacts with their high-risk husbands.
