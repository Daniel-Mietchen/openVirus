<p id="Par22">A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2014 to August 2015, in a Yi Prefecture of southwestern China, where almost half the residents are of the Yi ethnicity. It remains one of the most undeveloped regions in China as a result of mountainous terrains coupled with sparsely distributed population. A two-stage sampling was conducted in the study. Three counties (Pg, Zj, and Mg) were selected in first step, whose residents shared similar health and socio-demographic characteristics, such as the proportion of minority, ethnic identity, age structure, and education level. Subsequently, four towns were selected from these counties by simple random sampling, where A and B from Pg County, C from Zj county and D from Mg county. Residents were eligible for investigation if they had to be over 14 years old and lived here for more than 6 months. The individual over14 years is permitted to have sexual practices, one of the criteria attributed to local Yi culture. We invited those who met the enrollment criteria to participate in our study. Village chiefs were asked to coordinate the side-by-side observations and the communication between local dialects and official language.</p>
