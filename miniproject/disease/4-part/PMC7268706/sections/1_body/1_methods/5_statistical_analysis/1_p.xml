<p id="Par26">Data entry employed the EpiData software (version 3.1; the EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark). The data processing and analysis was performed with the SPSS software (version 18.0, IBM SPSS Institute, Inc., Chicago). Descriptive statistics were carried out for sociodemographic variables. The proportions of 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic>, HBV, HCV and HIV infections and co-infections were calculated as well as their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pearson χ
 <sup>2</sup> test or Fisher’s exact test was applied to examine potential variables associated with 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> infection. Crude odds ratios (cORs) along with their 95% CIs were also calculated. A stepwise logistic regression was employed to build a final multivariable model (
 <italic>P</italic> value of retention≤0.05). Adjusted ORs and 95% CIs were calculated for identified associated factors. Since sex was interacted with some covariates, sex-specific analysis was performed. The statistical significance was symbolized by a two-sided 
 <italic>P</italic> value ≤0.05.
