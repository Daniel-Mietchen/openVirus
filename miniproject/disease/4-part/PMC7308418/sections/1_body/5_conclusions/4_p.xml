<p>Although the HuNoV viral replicative cycle has not been fully clarified due to the limitation in knowledge about the functions of the HuNoV proteins, we propose their roles in the HuNoV replicative model as follows: (1) VPg plays a role in recruiting cellular translation initiation factors; (2) NS proteins are released from the generated polyprotein by the viral protease, which is self-cleaved first; (3) p48 and p22 function in interfering cell signaling pathways; (4) VP1 and VP2 function synergistically, increasing their transduction rates; (5) RdRp, VP1, NTPase, and p48 work coordinately in the HuNoV replication process; (6) NTPase acts as a chaperone protein; and (7) NTPase and p48 proteins may have pro-apoptotic activities.</p>
