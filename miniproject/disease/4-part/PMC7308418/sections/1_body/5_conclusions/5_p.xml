<p>Additionally, the study of the immune response against HuNoV has been challenging due to the great variety of circulating genotypes and the constant evolution of these strains. The high rate of mutation of VP1 is what allows the alteration in the antigenicity regions of the virus. Although there is no clear evidence on the development of long-term protection against HuNoV, the generation of short-term protection has been evidenced by different studies, resulting in a high frequency of reinfection cases. A Th1 response and the activation of IFN-Î³ production have also been described upon HuNoV infection, which is suggested to play a role in the immune response to this pathogen.</p>
