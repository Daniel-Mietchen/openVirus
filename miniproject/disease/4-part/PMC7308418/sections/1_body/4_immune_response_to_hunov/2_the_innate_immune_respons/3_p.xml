<p>Moreover, in a recent study by Dang et al. (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>) using a HuNoV (NV) replicon system, it was possible to evaluate the antiviral activities of different types of IFNs. Specifically, this study showed that HuNoV replication was sensitive to the three types of IFNs: type I IFN (IFNα), type II IFN (IFNγ), and type III IFN (IFNλ1 and 3). Furthermore, by expressing different interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) into the human Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells expressing the NV replicon (HG23), RTP4, and HPSE were identified, which showed moderate anti-NV effector activities. Additionally, it was found that the transcription factor IRF-1, with RIG-I, and MDA-5 were induced in the HGC3 cells treated with types I and III IFNs. Likewise, IRF-1 was predominantly induced in HGC3 by treating them with type II IFN. Interestingly, these investigators demonstrated that there is a synergic effect of the different IFN systems. Specifically, it was observed that these ISGs were induced coordinately by the three IFN systems in effectively controlling HuNoV replication. It was also found that NV did not impede the antiviral response induced by these different types of IFNs (
