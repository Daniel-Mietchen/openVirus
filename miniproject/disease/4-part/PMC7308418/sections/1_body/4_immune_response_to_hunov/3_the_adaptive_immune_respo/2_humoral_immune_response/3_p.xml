<p>On the other hand, no evidence of long-term protective immunity has been proven for these viruses. Indeed some volunteers who became ill after a NV challenge showed partial immunity against the disease in a re-exposure after 6–14 weeks. However, this partial immune protection was completely lost after 2–3 years (
