<p>The 
 <italic>S</italic> domain of NV VP1, which comprises from the N-terminal end to residue number 225 of the protein, conforms with the icosahedral shell of the virus and possesses a Pro-Pro-Gly sequence, which is conserved among different HuNoV viruses (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This domain has been associated with the development of a smooth layer of virus-like particles (VLPs). NV VLPs lacking the expression of the 
 <italic>P</italic> domain have a diameter slightly smaller than 30 nm, which is the expected size for the native NV structure, suggesting that the 
 <italic>S</italic> domain has the necessary components to start the HuNoV capsid assembly (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Also, since the 
 <italic>S</italic> is a conserved domain among genotypes of a same genogroup, it is used for the identification of norovirus genogroups (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).
