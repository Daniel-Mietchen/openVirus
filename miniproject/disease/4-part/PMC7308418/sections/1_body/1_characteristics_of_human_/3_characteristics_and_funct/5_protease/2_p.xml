<p>An analysis of the GII.4 protease crystal structure shows that this protein presents changes in the S2 substrate-binding pocket and the active site (catalytic triad residues) compared to those sites in the GI homologous protein. Another characteristic of the active site of the GII.4 protease is that there is a conserved arginine that interacts with the catalytic histidine, which restricts the access of inhibitors or substrates to the S2 pocket and makes the proteolytic activity of this protease sensitive to pH changes (
