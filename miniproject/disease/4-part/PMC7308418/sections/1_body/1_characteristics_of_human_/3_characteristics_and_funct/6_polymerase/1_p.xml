<p>The HuNoV polymerase protein, also called Pol (NS7), is a RdRp whose main function is the replication of the viral genome. This protein is cleaved by the HuNoV protease at residues 1,190 and 1,699 of the polyprotein, resulting in a mature protein of 509 aa and 56.8 kDa in molecular weight (MD145-12 GII.4) (

 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family, suggesting that ProPol is a bifunctional complex that acts during viral replication (

The three-dimensional structure of the NV Pol protein has been described with resolutions of 2.17 and 2.95 Ã… in the absence and the presence of metals, respectively. Also, it has been described that the structure of the NV Pol protein is very similar to that of other viruses, varying only in the sense that this viral Pol has a carboxyl terminal in the slit of the active site that could be involved in the synthesis of viral RNA (
