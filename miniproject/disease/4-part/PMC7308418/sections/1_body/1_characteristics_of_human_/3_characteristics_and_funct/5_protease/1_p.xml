<p>Protease plays a fundamental role in viral activities by cleaving the proteins involved in genome replication, virus pathogenesis, and the interaction with host cellular factors. The HuNoV protease, also called 3CL Pro (NS6), is similar to the 3C protease of 
 <italic>Picornavirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), which processes the NS proteins by cleaving them from the viral polyprotein (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). It has an approximate molecular weight of 19.4 kDa (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), and it has been estimated that its evolutionary rate from a collection of GII.4 sequences is ~6.03 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The cleavage process of the polyprotein by the HuNoV protease consists of “early” cleavage sites (p48/NTPase and NTPase/p22), which are more efficiently cleaved than the “late” cleavage sites (p22/VPg, VPg/Pro, and Pro/Pol) (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Additionally, the HuNoV protease has been characterized as a chymotrypsin-like protease (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), containing in its active site Cys139, His30, and Glu54 catalytic residues (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Moreover, the optimum pH and temperature for its proteolytic activity are around 8.6 and 37°C, respectively (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>).
