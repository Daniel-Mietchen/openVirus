<p>Although the functions of p22 are not completely known, some of its characteristics have been elucidated. Indeed it has been shown that NV p22 harbors a YXÎ¦ESDG motif (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), which mimics an export signal for vesicles coated with COPII that migrate from the rough ER and prevents these coated vesicles from fusing with the trans-Golgi network (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In this way, p22 interferes with the protein secretion and post-translational modification pathways. It should be noted that this motif is highly conserved among different genotypes of the GI and the GII genogroups (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).
