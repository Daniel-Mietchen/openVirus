<p>The p48 protein, also denoted as N-terminal (NS1-2), is a characteristic protein of the 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic> genus, located at the N-terminus of the polyprotein. When it is cleaved by the viral protease, it results in a mature NS1-2 protein. In GI.1, this protein has 398 aa (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) and a molecular weight of 37 kDa (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). The length of GII p48 is the same as the one of GI.1, but its weight varies between 45 and 48 kDa (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The evolutionary rate of the region that encodes for the p48 proteins of the GII.P4 Den Haag 2006b strain is 6.60 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year, which is higher than the evolutionary rate determined for its entire genome (6.15 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year) (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Even though these proteins share a low similarity, through an 
 <italic>in situ</italic> analysis it was determined that the HuNoV p48 protein has amino acid sequence characteristics like the MNV p48 protein that include: (1) a disordered region of proline-rich N-terminal, containing the alleged immunogenic regions for MHC-I binding, (2) a transmembrane hydrophobic domain at the C-terminal end, (3) H-box and NC sequence motifs of the permutated NlpC/P60 family of circular peptidases that adapt different enzyme capacities within the same structure, improving the stability and the reducing degradation caused by proteases, and (4) caspase cleavage and phosphorylation sites, which in eukaryotic cells are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and activation of the immune system (

The specific function of the p48 protein of the different HuNoVs within the viral replicative cycle and its role in HuNoV pathogenesis in the host have not yet been elucidated. Moreover, a confocal microscopy analysis in HeLa and Crandell–Rees feline kidney cells transfected with a vector plasmid that expresses the NV p48 protein revealed that this protein can co-localize with the trans-Golgi network protein markers and it induces the disassembly of this cellular organelle in discrete aggregates (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Besides that, the expression of p48 as a fusion protein in COS-7 cells, an African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like cell line, revealed that this protein binds to the protein A associated with the vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAP-A) located at the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the trans-Golgi network. Also, VAP-A can bind to the SNARE protein complex that regulates vesicular transport by the interaction of p48 with VAP-A. The p48 protein is localized in the vesicle membranes of the ER, the trans-Golgi network, and the endosomes, suggesting that the interaction of p48 with VAP-A could act as a scaffold for the assembly of replication complexes (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Hence, a transcriptomic analysis determined, by expressing the HuNoV p48 protein in murine monocytes, revealed that it can interfere in many intracellular pathways, such as those involving the Jak-STAT, MAPK, p53, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Additionally, HuNoV p48 has been shown to interfere with apoptosis, Toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling pathways, and the production of chemokines and cytokines (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thus, the p48 protein can play an important role in the HuNoV replicative cycle by participating in the development of the viral replication complex and by hampering the normal function of cellular signaling pathways, as well as, the activation of the immune response induced by the viral infection.
