<p>The different rearrangements of vesicular and tubular membranes play a critical role in the development of viral replicative complexes in RNA(+) viruses. Indeed in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study using the Huh7 cell line, it was shown that the GII p22, when expressed individually, can constitute single-membrane and double-membrane vesicles, contributing to membrane alterations within the cell to promote, together with the p48 and NTPase, the formation of the viral replication complex (
