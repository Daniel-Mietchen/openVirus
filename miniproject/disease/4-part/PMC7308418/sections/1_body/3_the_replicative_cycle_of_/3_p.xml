<p>The replication process is carried out by the action of Pol, VPg, and NTPase proteins. The latter has three activities: helicase, NTP hydrolase, and chaperone (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Subsequently, the p48 protein will be integrated into this process, which will enhance the Pol activity (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Then, synthesis of the viral genome and the sub-genomes with the VPg protein, attached at their 5â€² ends, which recruits the cellular translation initiation factors will occur (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Finally, both the genome and the sub-genomes will be mobilized by the NTPase protein chaperone activity (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). A viral polyprotein will be produced from the translation of the viral genome, and VP1 and VP2 proteins will be generated from the sub-genomes (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Once the three proteins have been generated, the assembly and the release of the virions take place through a mechanism that remains to be elucidated (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>).
