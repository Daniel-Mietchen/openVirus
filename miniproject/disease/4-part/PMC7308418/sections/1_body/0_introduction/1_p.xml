<p>Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are the main cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, producing high morbidity and mortality rates (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It has been estimated that HuNoV causes 699 million illnesses and 219,000 deaths per year worldwide (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Even in a developed country, such as the United States, it is estimated that the burden of the disease caused by HuNoV infection produces 570–800 deaths, 56,000–71,000 hospitalizations, 400,000 visits to the emergency room, 1.7–1.9 million ambulatory visits to health centers, and 19–21 million total diseases per year (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), among the high-risk populations are children under 5 years of age—who have the highest rates of medical care associated to HuNoV (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), the elderly—who have the highest mortality rates (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), immunocompromised patients (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and travelers visiting developing countries (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). HuNoV produces rapid and self-limited acute gastroenteritis characterized by the development of symptoms such as vomiting, watery diarrhea with or without nausea, and abdominal cramps (
