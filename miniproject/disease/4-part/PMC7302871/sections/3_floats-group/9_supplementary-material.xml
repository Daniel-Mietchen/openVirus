  <title>Accessory genome with strong clade association.</title>
  <p>Gene families with a strong clade association in clade α or β (A), or in one of the third level clades (B). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and based on sequence variation (SNPs) in the core genome with reference to 
   <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain SL1344 (left). Third-level clades are indicated and colour coordinated with that in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008850.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Genes in each clade were assigned a score based on the number of strains containing the gene within the clade. This score was also calculated for the strains outside the clade. Clade associated genes were defined as genes that had scores greater than the mean plus two SD of the score for all other clades. Genes are colour coded based assignment to non-prophage chromosomal (red), prophage (green), plasmid (blue), or undefined (grey).
