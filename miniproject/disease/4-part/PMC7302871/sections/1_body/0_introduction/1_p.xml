<p>Bacteria of the genus 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> are a common cause of foodborne disease. Most of the approximately 2500 serovars cause gastroenteritis in humans and other animals, while some have evolved host adaptation associated with extra intestinal disseminated infections in specific host species [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium) and 
 <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis circulate in multiple vertebrate host species and cause food borne infections in the human population. These and other non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes result in an estimated 75 million cases and 27 thousand deaths from gastroenteritis worldwide [

 <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and 
 <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A circulate exclusively in the human population and cause an estimated 2.5 million infections resulting in 65 thousand deaths each year as a result of the disseminated disease typhoid and paratyphoid disease [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similarly, other serotypes evolved host adaptation to specific non-human host species, such as 
 <italic>S</italic>. Gallinarum with poultry, 
 <italic>S</italic>. Dublin with cattle, and 
 <italic>S</italic>. Choleraesuis with pigs, where they are associated with disseminated infections [
