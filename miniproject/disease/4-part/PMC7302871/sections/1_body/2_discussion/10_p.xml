 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium phylogroup indicated that the common ancestor likely contained six prophage, Gifsy1, Gifsy2, Fels1, ST64B, sal3 and BcepMu, that were well conserved during subsequent diversification. Just two of these ancestral prophage, Fels1 and Gifsy1, were lost from the genome, on three occasions in different lineages. The majority of the prophage flux was from the acquisition of between one to three prophage in each lineage, with the exception of a lineage containing clade Î²3 (DT2), that only contained the ancestral prophage repertoire.
