<p>Bacterial genome diversity is largely driven by the flux of genes resulting from acquisition by horizontal gene transfer and deletion, rather than allelic variation [

The accessory genome contributed significantly to genetic variation that distinguished third order subclades in both clade α and β, especially phage and plasmid genes. Non-phage chromosomal genes exhibited relatively little clade specific accessory genome suggesting that the majority was the result of deletions or gene acquisition on small mobile genetic elements that were neutral and subsequently lost, as observed previously in
