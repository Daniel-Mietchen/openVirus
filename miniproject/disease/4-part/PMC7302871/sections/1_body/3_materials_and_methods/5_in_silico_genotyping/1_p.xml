<p>The presence of antibiotic resistance, virulence and plasmid replicon genes in short-read data was determined by the mapping and local assembly of short reads to data-bases of candidate genes using ARIBA [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The presence of candidate genes from the resfinder [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], VFDB [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] and PlasmidFinder [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] databases was determined. Reads were mapped to candidate genes using nucmer with a 90% minimum alignment identity. This tool was also used to determine the presence of specific genes or gene allelic variants. The results of the ARIBA determination of the presence or absence of the 
 <italic>lpfD</italic> gene were confirmed using SRST2 [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] setting each alternative form of the gene as a potential allele. SRST2 was also used to verify the ARIBA findings of the VFDB data set, as the presence of orthologous genes in the genome was found to confound the interpretation of results. Candidate SNPs in key genes associated with AMR were determined from the SNP matrix created by SNIPPY and used for the phylogeny reconstruction. Sites were then verified by interrogation of the assembled and annotated short-read sequences.
