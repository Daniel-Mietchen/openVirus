<p>HDCS were identified in high-quality finished Pacbio sequences and previously published reference sequences by identifying putative altered open reading frames using the RATT annotation transfer tool [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strains SL1344 annotation (accession no. FQ312003) was transferred to each assembled sequence and coding sequences identified as having altered length were manually curated by comparison of aligned sequences visualised using Artemis comparison tool (ACT) [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Genes that contained either a premature stop codon or a frameshift mutation were classified as HDCS. The identified HDCS were used to construct a database that could be used as a reference for SRST2 (above) to detect presence or absence in short-read sequence data. Alleles were called based on matching to 99% sequence identity and allowing one miss-match per 1000 nucleotides.
