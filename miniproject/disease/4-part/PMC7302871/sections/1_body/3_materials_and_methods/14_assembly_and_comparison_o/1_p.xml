<p>Plasmid sequences were determined by assembling Illumina short-read sequences with spades-3.8.0 using the plasmidSPAdes algorithm [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] with varying with k-mer sizes of 31, 41 and 51. Contigs larger than 70 kb were then compared against the NCBI blast database to identify forms of pSLT.
