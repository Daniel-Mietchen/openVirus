<p>Illumina short-read sequences were mapped to the SL1344 reference genome and annotated using PROKKA and then analysed in a pairwise fashion against SL1344 using delta-bit-score (DBS), a profile hidden Markov model based approach [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] with Pfam hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. The mean DBS per genome and percentage of genes with mutations in Pfam domains (non-zero DBS) are reported.
