<p>In order to investigate the flux of prophage genes resulting in clade-specific repertoires, we identified prophage in eleven complete and closed reference genomes of 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium sequences. A total of 83 complete or partial prophage elements were identified in the eleven reference genomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008850.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Prophage were present at twelve variably occupied chromosomal loci and the number per strain ranged from five in DT2 (strain 94–213) to nine in monophasic 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST34 (strain SO4698-09) (
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Clustering of gene families in the prophage pangenome identified 23 prophage, although in some cases blocks of genes were replaced resulted in mosaic prophage for example “
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> virus ST64BX” and “
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> virus Gifsy1X” (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008850.s011">S6 Table</xref>), and the definition of families of prophage with a high confidence was consequently problematic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008850.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Thirteen prophage elements encoded at least one identifiable cargo gene, capable of modifying the characteristics of the host bacterial strain, including eleven genes previously implicated in virulence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008850.s008">S3 Table</xref>). Ten prophage families contained no recognisable cargo genes. The evolutionary history of prophage acquisition and loss was reconstructed based on principles of maximum parsimony. Six prophage (
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> viruses “BcepMuX”, “Gifsy1X”, “Gifsy2X”, “Fels1X”, “ST64BX” and “sal3X”, hereafter referred to as BcepMu, Gifsy1, Gifsy2, Fels1, ST64B and sal3) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008850.s011">S6 Table</xref>), that together accounted for 61 of the prophage in these genomes, were most likely present in the common ancestor of 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. Loss of two of these ancestral prophage by three isolates (NCTC13348, L01157-10 and D23580) represented the only evidence for decrease in prophage repertoire in the dataset.
