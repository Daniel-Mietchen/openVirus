<p>Hypothetically disrupted coding sequences (HDCS) due to frameshift mutations or premature stop codons were determined in high quality finished and closed genome sequence of 11 representative strains from major subclades (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008850.s008">S3 Table</xref>). Representative strains of clade α generally contained fewer HDCS than those from clade β, with the exception of NCTC13348 (DT104) and SL1344 (DT204/49) that had atypically high and low numbers of HDCS, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008850.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, none of the HDCS in NCTC13348 were in genes previously been implicated in pathogenesis, while SL1344 contained two virulence gene HDCS (

 <italic>ratB</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008850.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In general, clade α strains had 0–3 HDCS in virulence genes (mean 0.8 SD 0.9), while clade β was characterised by multiple lineage containing three or more virulence gene HDCS (mean 5.0 SD 3.2) (
