<p>To quantify the relative level of functional divergence in the proteome of isolates in each clade we used a profile hidden Markov Model approach, delta-bitscore (DBS profiling) [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008850.s010">S5 Table</xref>). The method assigned a value (bitscore) to peptides of the proteome that indicated how well each sequence fitted the HMM. We determined the difference in bitscore of the proteome of each isolate relative to that of

A greater DBS is therefore indicatives of excess of polymorphisms that potentially alter protein function, and most likely a loss of function as it indicates divergence from the profile HMM. Mean DBS was significantly greater (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon test) for proteomes of strains in clade-β compared with clade-α (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008850.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In general, third-level clades in clade-α exhibited DBS of approximately zero, consistent with limited functional divergence. Notably, despite considerable numbers of HDCS in strain NCTC13348 (α15, DT104), DBS was only moderately elevated in this clade. Proteomes of strains in clade β exhibited mean DBS of 0.03 and above with the exception of clades β1 and β2. The proportion of the proteome with any deviation in DBS was also greater in clade-β than clade-α (
