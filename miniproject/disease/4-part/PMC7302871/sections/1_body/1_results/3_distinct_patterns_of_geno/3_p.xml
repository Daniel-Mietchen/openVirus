<p>We also used a machine learning approach to predict the ability of strains to cause extraintestinal disease based on convergent patterns of mutation accumulation detected by delta bitscore (DBS), in 196 proteins that were recently determined and reported as the most predictive of the invasiveness phenotype in 13 serotypes (six extra-intestinal pathovars and seven gastrointestinal pathovars) of

The invasiveness index metric is the fraction of decision trees in a random forest algorithm that vote for an invasive phenotype based on DBS values. The invasiveness index was significantly greater (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon test) in clade-β than clade-α, consistent with the epidemiology and pathogenicity of the isolates located in these clades [
