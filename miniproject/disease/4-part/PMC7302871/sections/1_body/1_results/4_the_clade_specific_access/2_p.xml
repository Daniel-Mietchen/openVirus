<p>Some gene families exhibited a distinct distribution in clade α or β, or within individual third-level clades of clade α or β (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008850.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Four non-phage chromosomal genes were specifically associated with clade-β strains, STM0038 a putative arylsulfatase, 
 <italic>tdcE</italic> encoding a pyruvate formate lyase 4, 
 <italic>aceF</italic> acetyltransferase and 
 <italic>dinI</italic> a DNA damage inducible protein. A series of plasmid genes in clade β2 corresponded to a region of p2 seen in LO1157-10. This region is likely a transposon as it contains an IS200 transposase and an integrase. Also, a number of prophage-associated genes were present throughout clade-β due to apparent recombination in the ST64B prophage. The rate of gene flux in clade α and clade β was determined by computing the number of accessory genes as a function of SNPs in each clade. By this measure, the rate of gene flux was nearly twice as high in clade α compared to clade β (
