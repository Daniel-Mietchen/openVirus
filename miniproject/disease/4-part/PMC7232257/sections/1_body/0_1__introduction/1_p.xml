<p>Bacteriophages or phages, viruses that infect bacteria, are ubiquitous on Earth. Discovered just about 100 years ago, their potential to cure infectious diseases, later called phage therapy, was soon applied [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During the first half of the 20th century the study of phage by physicists interested in understanding the basis of life, lead to the birth of a new scientific field, Molecular Biology (for a review [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). During the second half of the 20th century however, phage research declined, due to the increasing number of antibiotics and because many scientists shifted their interest toward more “complex” living systems. Nowadays, with the alarming increase of animal and human pathogen resistance to antibiotics [
