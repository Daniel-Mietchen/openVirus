<p>This small session, chaired by 
 <bold>MÃ¼ge Senarisoy</bold> (research fellow, I2BC, Orsay, France), was introduced by the keynote lecture of 
 <bold>Stefanie Barbirz</bold> (University of Potsdam, Germany), who dissected the biophysics of the interactions between the different families of phages (short-, long flexible- and long contractile-tailed phages) and the outer surface of Gram-negative bacteria, covered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Very elegant experiments were performed on either purified LPS preparations or LPS-containing outer-membrane vesicles to explore the effect of LPS composition and environment on the kinetics of binding and of DNA ejection of the different families of phages. Stefanie could show that tail morphology dictated DNA ejection velocity, short tailed phages being much slower than long tailed phages, and that binding and cell wall perforation can be dissociated in short-tailed phages, depending on temperature, whereas it is coupled for the other phages [
