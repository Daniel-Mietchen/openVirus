<p>This session ended with a lecture by 
 <bold>Raphaëlle Delattre</bold> (research fellow, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) presenting a summary of the diverse topics discussed this year by the Comité Scientifique Spécialisé Temporaire de l’Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé about phage therapy. Regarding the compassionate administrations of bacteriophages in France, the ten patients treated were in complex clinical situations, sometimes without an alternative. The majority of them suffered from joint and bone infections due to 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> or 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The specificities of phage therapy, the difficulty to access phages, the lack of clinical trials (activity and fate of phages, modes of administration) and the misinformation about phage therapy were evoked. The committee was favourable to the creation of a national platform managing patients’ requests and a phage library, and to the promotion of academic phage production.
