<p>The session continued with a presentation of 
 <bold>Ildikó Nagy</bold> (Enviroinvest Environmental and Biotechnological Corporation, Hungary). The bacterial leaf blight is responsible for important economic losses in rice production, especially in Asia and in western Africa. The challenge is to find pesticides against the causative agent, 
 <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>oryzae</italic> (
 <italic>Xoo</italic>), which are both effective and safe for the environment. Nagy’s laboratory characterised twelve 
 <italic>Xoo</italic> bacteriophages from Asia (from water or soil in the Philippines and Vietnam) and from France (from a laboratory in Montpellier). Genome-based comparisons allowed the establishment of the phylogenetic relationship among different phages, with the identification of a 322 bp conserved intergenic region. Additionally, all phages were efficient against 
 <italic>Xoo</italic> from Asia, but not against 
 <italic>Xoo</italic> from Africa and 
 <italic>X. oryzae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>citri</italic> strains.
