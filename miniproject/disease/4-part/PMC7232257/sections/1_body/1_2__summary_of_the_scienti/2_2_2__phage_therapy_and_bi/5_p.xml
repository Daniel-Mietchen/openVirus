<p>Beyond the presence of multi-resistant bacteria, infections can be complicated to eradicate due to their location, the presence of prosthetic devices or the immunological context. 
 <bold>Alexandre Bleibtreu</bold> (Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, France) described the first utilisation of phages combined with antibiotics for treating a patient suffering from an extradural empyema. The patient was a 29 year-old woman with a type I neurofibromatosis and a pilocytic astrocytoma (in 2007), further complicated by an extradural empyema. Despite the use of appropriate antibiotics and surgeries, the infection due to methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> persisted. Clinical and microbiological failure status was declared at the end of 2018. At the request of the patient and her family, she was allowed to receive a personalised cocktail of two phages produced by Pherecydes Pharma, in combination with intravenous injection of dalbavancin. The infection was successfully cured; she has left the hospital a few months after phage administration.
