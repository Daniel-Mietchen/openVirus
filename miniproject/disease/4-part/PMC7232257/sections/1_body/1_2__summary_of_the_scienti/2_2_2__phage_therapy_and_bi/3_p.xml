 <bold>David Olivenza</bold> (PhD student, Departamento de Genética, Sevilla, Spain) talked about the development of biosensors for phage detection and phage receptor discrimination. The rapid detection of phages may have important implications in many fields, such as assessing the presence of phages in industrial processes and following up the evolution of phage population during and after therapeutic treatment; however, only a few methods are available to detect specific phages in a given sample. Olivenza’s work consisted of using opvAB-
 <italic>gfp</italic>-based construction as a biosensor for detecting phages using the O-antigen as a receptor. 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> opvAB operon allows the production of short chained-LPS and provides resistance to phages recognizing LPS as a receptor. Upon phage infection, cells expressing opvAB operon are the ones to be selected. The fusion of the operon with a 
 <italic>gfp</italic> reporter gene allowed the high sensitivity monitoring of LPS-binding phages in various media.
