<p>Phages and plasmids are two major groups of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) shaping bacterial evolution. Although literature distinguishes them clearly, several MGEs were reported to be plasmids encoding 
 <italic>bona fide</italic> phage genes (or 
 <italic>vice versa</italic>), enterobacteriophages P1 and N15 being the most prominent examples of the so-called “phage–plasmids”. 
 <bold>Eugen Pfeifer</bold> (research fellow, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) presented work aiming at better understanding those MGEs through the study of known phage–plasmids, the identification of novel ones and the evaluation of their impact on bacterial evolution. The screening of phage and plasmid databases for typical phage characteristics in plasmids and plasmid features in phages resulted in the prediction of around 500 putative phage-plasmids. Genome-based clustering allowed the determination of 29 phage–plasmid families, each containing two to fifty members, amongst which a few encode many virulence and resistance traits. Future work will aim at understanding the evolution of these phage–plasmids.
