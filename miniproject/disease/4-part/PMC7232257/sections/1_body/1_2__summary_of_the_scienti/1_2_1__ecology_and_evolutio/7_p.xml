<p>To enable a phage epidemic to occur, phages need to bypass the host immunity, especially the widespread prokaryotic adaptive immune system CRISPR–Cas. 
 <bold>Hélène Chabas</bold> (research fellow, ETH Zürich, Switzerland) investigated why, in some cases, phage infection results in large epidemics or in other cases in phage extinction. Using a stochastic epidemiological model describing CRISPR–phage interactions, she determined that, in the absence of phage evolution, higher probabilities of CRISPR-resistance acquisition increase the probability of phage extinction. However, when phage can escape CRISPR through single mutations, the probability of phage extinction is bimodal: below a certain epidemiological tipping point, phages always remain in the population, whereas above this point, phages are always led to extinction. She then explored whether phages can increase their probability of survival by increasing their mutation probability and found that this has only a minimal effect.
