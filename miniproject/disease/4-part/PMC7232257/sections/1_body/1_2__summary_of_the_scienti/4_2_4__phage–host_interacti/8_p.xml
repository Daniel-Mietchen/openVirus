 <bold>Audrey Labarde</bold> (engineer, I2BC, Gif–sur–Yvette, France) presented her work about the sequential program of phage SPP1 genome replication during infection of 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. She found that viral replication occurs in a specific focus in the cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and that large quantities of SPP1 DNA are synthesised within the first thirty minutes following infection. This involves the rapid and massive recruitment of the bacterial replisome machinery at this focus. This process is orchestrated by the SPP1 helicase gp40, known to bind the DnaG primase as well as DnaX, a subunit of the DNA polymerase III [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00446" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Audrey showed that these three partners are found in the viral DNA focus a few minutes after infection and that their concentration increases over time. She finally observed that the viral DNA compartment is dynamic and takes different shapes during the infection process.
