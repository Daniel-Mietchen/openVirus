<p>The session ended with the presentation by 
 <bold>Kovacs Tamas</bold> (Enviroinvest Environmental and Biotechnological Corporation, Hungary), who proposes a COST Action on bacteriophage research and applications. COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) is a funding organisation for research and innovation networks. It aims at financing conferences, workshops, training and short missions between members of the network. Thirty-nine countries are eligible, and at least seven should be included in a COST. COST actions are bottom-up networks, and the new COST Kovacs proposes to setup would include five working groups: Ecology, Evolution and Taxonomy; Phageâ€“Host interaction; Structure (including genome); Applications in Plant Protection; Application in Human and Animal Health.
