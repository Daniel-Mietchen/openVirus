 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. NP formation was assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electron microscopic (EM) analyses. DLS analysis was performed using Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern instruments, Malvern, UK) after adjusting the concentration of purified protein to 300 µg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl/50 mM NaCl (pH 8.5). For EM examination, the purified protein concentration was adjusted to 5–10 µg/ml, in 20 mM Tris-HCl/50 mM NaCl (pH 8.5), applied onto carbon-coated EM grid (1–2 min), negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate (30 s ) and washed (using Milli-Q water), before visualisation under a Tecnai electron microscope.
