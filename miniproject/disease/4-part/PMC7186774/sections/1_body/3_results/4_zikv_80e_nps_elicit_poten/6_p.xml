<p id="para0039">That the antibody response to ZIKV-80E NPs is predominantly directed to EDIII, prompted the question: what is the contribution of EDIII-specific antibodies to ZIKV neutralising activity? To address this, we depleted EDIII-specific antibodies from the anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum by pre-incubating it with amylose resin-bound MBP-ZIKV EDIII, and determined residual antibody titres, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. In this experiment, we analysed immune sera from the memory recall experiment above. Total EDIII-specific antibody titres in the day 170 immune serum, which were virtually unaffected following mock depletion using immobilised MBP, underwent considerable decrease following depletion on immobilised MBP-ZIKV EDIII (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a). For example at a 1000-fold dilution of serum, ELISA absorbance values decreased ∼60% following depletion on immobilised MBP-ZIKV EDIII. As a next step, nAb titres in the un-depleted and MBP-ZIKV EDIII-depleted immune sera were determined. This showed that nAb titres were also reduced by ∼70% following depletion of EDIII-specific Abs (NT
 <sub>50</sub> titres before and after depletion were 301 and 91, respectively), as can be seen from the data in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b. That the depletion of EDIII-specific antibody titres is paralleled by a corresponding reduction in nAb titres, strongly suggest a significant role for EDIII-specific antibodies in ZIKV neutralisation.
