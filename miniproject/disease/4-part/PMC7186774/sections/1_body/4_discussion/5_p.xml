<p id="para0048">It is conceivable that the lack of prM could adversely affect the structural integrity of key EDIII epitopes presented on the NPs. We carried out an EDIII-focused antigenic analysis using a small panel of six mAbs. Four of these were ZIKV EDIII-specific conformational mAbs, the fifth mAb specific to EDIIIs of ZIKV as well as DENVs, and the sixth mAb specific to the FLE of flaviviruses. Three out of four conformational mAbs recognised ZIKV-80E NPs efficiently, attesting to the preservation of the overall conformational integrity of EDIII epitopes. However, subtle differences between the prM-lacking ZIKV-80E NP and the prM-containing ZIKV particle could be inferred from the mAb probing analysis. For example, the EDIII C–C’ loop which is not accessible on the ZIKV particle, is accessible on the ZIKV-80E NP, as evidenced by its recognition by mAb ZV-48. Similarly, the pan-flavivirus cross-reactive mAb 4G2 specifc to the FLE, which can efficiently bind flavivirus particles, did not recognise the ZIKV-80E NPs. This has implications for vaccine safety as ZIKV FLE-specific antibodies have been reported to mediate ADE of DENV-2 infection
