 <xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Not only do these viruses share the same mosquito vector 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but also are genetically and antigenically similar. DENV-antibodies which cross-react with ZIKV can enhance its uptake 
 <italic>via</italic> Fcγ-R pathway, to increase tissue ZIKV load. Likewise, anti-ZIKV antibodies from ZIKV-infected humans can cross-react with DENVs and promote their uptake into Fcγ-R-bearing cells, contributing to increased tissue DENV load. While epidemiological data in support of this is currently not available, recent experiments have demonstrated that ZIKV mAbs specific to EDI/II from ZIKV-infected patients can enhance DENV-2 infection both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Thus, a potential safety attribute of a future ZIKV vaccine is that, in addition to eliciting adequate levels of virus-nAbs, it must not contribute to ADE of DENV infection, especially in the current situation when DENV infections continue to occur in the absence of new ZIKV infections. Our data showed that ZIKV-80E NPs induced DENV cross-reactive, but non-neutralising antibodies. Would these antibodies enhance DENV infection? That they may not is evident from the failure of anti-ZIKV-80E NP antisera to escalate a sub-lethal DENV-2 S221 infection of AG129 mice into a lethal infection. It is to be emphasised that ADE 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> was not evident despite the inability of these anti-ZIKV-80E NP-induced antibodies to neutralise DENV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The precise mechanism underlying the lack of ADE needs to be understood. One possibility is that the cross-reactive epitopes on DENV-80E NPs recognised by anti-ZIKV-80E NP antibodies are not accessible on the DENV-2 S221 virion surface, and presumably this precludes ADE. Another likely explanation is that the EDIII-directed antibodies elicited by ZIKV-80E NPs, being highly type-specific, lack any inherent heterotypic ADE potential.
