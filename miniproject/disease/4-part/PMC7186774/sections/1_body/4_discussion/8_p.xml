<p id="para0051">It is believed that neutralisation is not possible when the number of antibody molecules bound to their cognate docking sites on the virion is below a certain threshold 
 <xref rid="bib0059" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In fact, it has been demonstrated that such non-neutralised virion-antibody complexes can enter cells 
 <italic>via</italic> the Fcγ-R pathway in K562 cells. In the light of this, we also examined if anti-ZIKV-80E NP antibodies at low levels might possibly possess homotypic ZIKV infection-enhancing potential. However, passive transfer of anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum (20 µl) into ZIKV-susceptible 
 <italic>Stat2</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice (resulting in ∼100-fold dilution, lowering nAb titres to sub-neutralising levels), followed by live ZIKV (strain PRVABC59) challenge, did not exacerbate morbidity and mortality in these mice. This leads to the obvious conclusion that the EDIII-focused anti-ZIKV antibodies do not possess any homotypic ZIKV infection-enhancing activity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, even at very low concentrations. However, it is pertinent to point out that the hypothesis predicting the homotypic ADE potential of nAbs at sub-neutralising levels is based on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> observation 
 <xref rid="bib0059" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Further support that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ADE data may not mirror the true 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> situation comes from recent data using the AG129 mouse ADE model 
 <xref rid="bib0054" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. This study showed that cross-reactive mAbs, 4G2 and 6B6C-1, cause ADE of DENV-2 even at neutralising concentrations, while the DENV-2 type-specific EDIII-directed mAb 3H5 did not cause ADE, even at sub-neutralising concentrations. Having shown that ZIKV-80E NP-induced antibodies lack ADE potential, but possess potent neutralising activity, it would be informative in future to examine the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protective efficacy of this vaccine candidate in a pregnancy mouse model
