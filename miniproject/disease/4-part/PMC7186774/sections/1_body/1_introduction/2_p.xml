<p id="para0011">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, phylogenetically related to West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and dengue viruses (DENV) 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It has a plus sense genomic RNA of ∼11 kb bases which contains a single open reading frame encoding three structural proteins, capsid, pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), and seven non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5 (

 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. ZIKV is spread to humans by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and has been historically associated with mild and self-limiting fever, akin to dengue fever [

 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ZIKV may also be transmitted between humans sexually 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> or vertically [

 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. ZIKV outbreaks have been documented in recent times starting from 2007 until about mid-2016, by which time it had spread to several countries in the Pacific as well as to countries in Asia, Africa and the Americas [

 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More severe clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection became apparent in the Brazilian outbreaks during 2015. Exposure of fetuses to ZIKV in the first trimester of pregnancy has been linked to neurodevelopmental malfunction resulting in congenital birth defects including microcephaly [

 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>]. On the other hand, ZIKV infection in adults appears to lead to an autoimmune disease known as Guillain Barré syndrome 
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These neurological abnormalities have been linked to the capacity of ZIKV to infect human neural progenitor cells 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. ZIKV infections are beginning to be reported in India. It is currently estimated that more than 2 billion people live in areas considered suitable for ZIKV transmission 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The incidence of ZIKV infections has almost totally vanished as of now and it has been hypothesised that herd immunity resulting from these recent outbreaks will likely delay the occurrence of the next epidemic by about a decade 
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It has been suggested that a preventive ZIKV vaccine is an urgent need 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and that this lull period should be taken advantage of to develop ZIKV vaccine candidates for possible future use
