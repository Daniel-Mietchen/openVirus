<p id="p0390">At present, the main treatment processes for removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogens from HWW are membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and various advanced oxidation technologies, but there are some emerging technologies with great potential. Mousaab et al. 
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> have employed an upgraded MBR system for treating HWW. The aim of this study is to improve the pharmaceuticals removal efficiency with membrane function. Ultrafiltration membrane module was used to couple with an activated sludge basin. The sludge retention time and hydraulic retention time were 20 days and 22Â h, respectively. The study revealed that the removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and volatile suspended solids reached 91.8%, 100%, and 93.2%, respectively. The removal efficiencies of codeine, pravastatin, ketoprofen, diclofenac, roxithromycin, gemfibrozil, and iohexol were greater than 95%, which almost remained the same concentration before and after treatment with activated sludge process. The presence of biofilm supports also enhanced particle sorption and improved effluent quality, thus offering better protection of the membranes against fouling and reducing cleaning operations.
