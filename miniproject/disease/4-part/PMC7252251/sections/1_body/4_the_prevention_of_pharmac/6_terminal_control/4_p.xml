<p id="p0400">It has been widely reported that advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are able to completely oxidize and/or destroy organic pollutants in water and wastewater into H
 <sub>2</sub>O, CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and mineral salts. AOPs have also been applied on the HWW treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogens. Fenton oxidation and ozone oxidation are commonly used. During advanced oxidation, a variety of radical reactions such as hydroxyl radical (HO•), superoxide radical anion (

The energy can be provided with UV irradiation, electronic current, y-radiation, and ultrasound. Among all, HO• is the most frequently applied oxidant in AOPs. It is mainly attributed to that unlike many other radicals HO• is nonselective, and could readily react with many organic pollutants by converting them into more hydrophilic compounds than the original ones.
