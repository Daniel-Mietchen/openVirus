<p id="p0080">Hormones are commonly found in the environment including water and soil as they are widely applied in livestock breeding, aquaculture, and clinical treatment. They have great impact on human and other organisms (such as birds, mammals, and fish). The major impact of hormones on humans includes endocrine dyscrasia, nervous system disorders, obstruction of the reproductive system, and even causing the malformed fertility. Similar impacts of hormones on other organisms are observed as well. Overall, the threat of hormones on humans and other organisms is on the nervous system, reproductive system, and immune system.</p>
