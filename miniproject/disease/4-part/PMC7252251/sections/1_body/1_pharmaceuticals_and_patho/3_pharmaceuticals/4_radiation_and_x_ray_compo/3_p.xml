<p id="p0070">Radioactive materials could cause many serious negative impacts on both proliferative and nonproliferative tissues of humans and animals. The leakage of radioactive material should be controlled. After utilization of the radionuclides, the radioactive pollutants enter to the environment along with the waste including wastewater. In fact, nowadays along with the development of nuclear medicine, the application of radionuclides in clinical diagnosis, treatment, and medical research has become much more extensive. Apart from the direct discharge to the wastewater, the radionuclides can also go to the environment from patient discharge. After they enter to the WWTP which is not capable of removing radionuclides, they reach to water source and threat on mammalian systems
