<p id="p0085">HWW usually contains a variety of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasitic worms 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These bacteria, viruses, and parasitic worm eggs have strong resistance in the environment and could survive in sewage for a long time. These pathogens are discharged along with wastewater to the receiving water bodies. The vegetables could be contaminated when the water recycled from WWTP or river water is used for watering. Through food chain, humans thus could get contacted with pathogens and get sick. It could even lead to the outbreak of infectious diseases 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. HWW contains various high concentration of antibiotics. Thus it is normal that multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) are found in the HWW. The major MDRB include ESBL-producing 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic>enterococci</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. The HWW characteristics and the types of pharmaceuticals and pathogens are summarized in
