<p id="p0045">The composition of HWW is very complex. It mainly contains pharmaceuticals and pathogens. Pharmaceuticals are widely prescribed and consumed in the world. It has been reported that the prescription on pharmaceuticals would remain the high level or even elevated 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The adverse effect of pharmaceuticals in the environment has been extensively studied 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Among all, the most concern one is the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes as it would lead to transfer of resistant gene to antibiotic sensitive microbial species. There is the risk of treatment failure when humans or animals are infected with the bacteria which already developed antibiotic-resistant gene. Apart from antibiotics, there are also other compounds such as radiation and X-ray compounds, which can induce reform of DNA and thus cause abnormal diseases. Pathogens are also big problems of HWW. It transforms among the environment and humans.
