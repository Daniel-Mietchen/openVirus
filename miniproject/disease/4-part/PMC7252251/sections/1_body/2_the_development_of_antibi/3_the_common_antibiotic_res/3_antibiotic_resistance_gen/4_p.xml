<p id="p0115">Tet has a broad host range and is found in many environmental genera, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. So far, more than 22 tet or otr genes were isolated from the bacteria of aqueous environment. Many tet genes are located in nonflowing plasmids or incomplete chromosomal transposons, but some genes encode efflux enzymes (tetA, B, C, E, H, Y, Z, and 33) and ribosome protective proteins (tetM and O). TetA, B, C, D, and E efflux genes are frequently found in activated sludge (AS) of WWTPs, fish ponds, and surface waters
