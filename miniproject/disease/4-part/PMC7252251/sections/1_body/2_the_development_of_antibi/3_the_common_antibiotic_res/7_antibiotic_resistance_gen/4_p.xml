<p id="p0165">The βla gene usually coexists with other antibiotic resistance determinants and may also be associated with mobile genetic elements. It thus increases the possibility of multidrug resistance and environmental transmission. Plasmids containing βla obtained from WWTPs are often associated with transponders and integrons. They could also carry other resistance determinants, including aad (or aac) encoding amino glucoside nucleoside transferase, encoding chloramphenicol CML of the effluent, and cat encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
