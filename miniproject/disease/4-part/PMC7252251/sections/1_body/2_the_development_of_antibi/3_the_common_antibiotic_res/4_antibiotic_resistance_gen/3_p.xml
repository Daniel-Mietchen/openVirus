<p id="p0130">The aph, aac, and ant genes are widely distributed in multiple genera such as 
 <italic>Aeromonas</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Listeria</italic>, as well as a variety of pests isolated from contaminated or natural water. AacC1 gene C2, C3, C4 encoding aminoglycoside-3-
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (aminoglycoside-3-
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase) is often found in microbial communities or isolated from AS, and two glands. The basal transferase genes aadAI and aadA2 have been detected worldwide in aquaculture isolates of rivers, sewage treatment plants, and urban surface waters. Aminoglycoside ARGs encoding antibiotics (neomycin-resistant and streptomycin phosphorous transferase genes) are found in rivers of Canada.
