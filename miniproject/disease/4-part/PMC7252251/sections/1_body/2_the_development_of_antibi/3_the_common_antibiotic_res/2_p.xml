<p id="p0100">ARGs are mainly developed by the following mechanisms: (1) target bypass: antibiotic cannot access their target enzyme due to mutational changes or loss on the enzyme gene; (2) efflux pump: the intracellular concentration of antibiotics is reduced due to the change of cell membrane structure; (3) antibiotic inactivation: antibiotic molecules are directly deactivated; or (4) target modification: the action sites of antibiotic are modified. The development of ARGs may occur through multiple routes
