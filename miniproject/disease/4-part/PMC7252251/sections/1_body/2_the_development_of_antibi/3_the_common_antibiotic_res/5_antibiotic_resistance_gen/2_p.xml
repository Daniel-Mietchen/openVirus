<p id="p0135">Although macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin are structurally unrelated, macrolide-resistance genes and lincosamide-resistance genes (lincosamide and streptogramin) are often simultaneously studied. It is due to that they encode resistance to these two or all three compounds. In total, more than 60 different genes are resistant to one or more macrolide streptomycin (MLS) antibiotics. It includes methylation, excretion, and related genes of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). MLS resistance mainly mediates methylated adenine residues through rRNA methylase (encoded by erm gene), preventing the entry of three antibacterial drugs into ribosomal proteins. The erm gene can be easily transferred from one host to another as they are usually acquired and related to mobile elements such as plasmids and transposons
