<p id="p0185">Due to the development of ARGs in bacteria, it could cause death when the humans are infected with the bacteria. The development of ARGs in the bacteria could lead to the treatment failure as the original antibiotic cannot control the bacteria. It requires stronger antibiotic for treating the patient. However, the development of the antibiotic is normally later than the emergence of the bacteria infection. It indicates that the patient may have die before the suitable antibiotic is developed. It is reported that around 2 million persons are infected by bacteria every year, and around 50%â€“70% belong to antibiotic resistance bacteria. Out of these, around 14,000 death cases are due to the antibiotic treatment failure. In Europe, more than 25,000 persons die each year due to the infection with antibiotic-resistance bacteria 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. As stronger antibiotics are applied in the patient treatment, more powerful antibiotic resistance bacteria will be created. Then the treatment becomes much difficult thereafter.
