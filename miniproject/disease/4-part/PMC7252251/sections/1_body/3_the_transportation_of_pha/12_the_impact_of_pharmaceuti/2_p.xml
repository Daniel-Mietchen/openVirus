<p id="p0340">HWW contains a large number of unique and highly toxic pharmaceuticals, pathogens, etc., which can accumulate in drinking water and aquatic foods. As mentioned earlier, most of the HWWs are not completely treated before discharging into the water body. There are many ways in which humans come into contact with the contaminants of HWW: directly drinking contaminated source water; taking aquatic animals and plants grown in contaminated water; and inhaling these toxic and harmful substances after volatile poisons entering the air.</p>
