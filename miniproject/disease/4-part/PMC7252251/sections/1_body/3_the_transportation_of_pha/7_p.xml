<p id="p0220">Most hospitals use liquid chlorine and sodium hypochlorite to disinfect the HWW. Such disinfection method will form chloroform and other chlorine derivatives, which have potential carcinogenic effects and are difficult to biodegraded naturally. In addition, the HWW contains nonbiodegradable compounds such as mercury, which cannot be removed by general biological treatment 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. After being discharged from the WWTP, it will not only accumulate in the fish and other organisms in the river, but also exist in the sediments. When the river water is utilized for irrigation, nonbiodegradable compounds in the water will be transported to the soil and be absorbed by crops. When poultry, livestock, and humans take these crops, the metals will accumulate in the body, and with the improvement of nutrient level, the accumulation will be much more.
