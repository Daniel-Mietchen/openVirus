<p id="p0255">The abuse of antibiotics and their widespread in nature will enhance the resistance of certain viruses. Certain viruses with resistant genes will continue to evolve into super virus, which is in a broad sense refer to incurable viruses that can kill humans 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. For example, NDM-1 is a typical representative of super viral disease. NDM-1 is in fact a super virus resistance gene, and SARS virus carries NDM-1. In fact, the super virus has been existed for a very long time, which means it is not a new virus. The reason why the super virus is now entering the public view is due to that its strong drug resistance problem is now highlighted. Since the advent of antibiotics, the global use of viruses has increased resistance to traditional antibiotics. If the virus is multidrug resistant, once it spreads, it will be very difficult to be controlled.
