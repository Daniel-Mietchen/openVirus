<p id="p0250">Antibiotics mainly kill bacteria by blocking or interfering with the key life processes of the bacteria. The targets of these antibiotics are usually highly genetically and structurally conserved in the pathogens 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Hence, the antibiotics kill the pathogens. It also causes collateral damage to human microbial flora that live in the same environment. The destruction of the structure of human microbial flora is likely to cause some pathogenic bacteria to play a pathogenic role. The genes, metabolites, and interactions between the human microbial flora and the host form a normal ecosystem of the human body. When the microbial flora is disturbed, the whole organismâ€™s genes will be disordered.
