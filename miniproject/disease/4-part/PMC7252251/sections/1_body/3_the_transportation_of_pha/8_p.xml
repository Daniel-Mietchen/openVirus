<p id="p0225">Due to the characteristics of high toxicity, persistence, and accumulation, persistent compounds pose a serious threat to environmental pollution and human health. Moreover, most of the persistent compounds have volatile properties. Even at room temperature, they could volatilize into the air, and thus cause an impact on the quality of the atmosphere. As the air flows, it will have a global impact. After entering the organism, persistent compounds will accumulate in the organism at all levels of nutrition through the food chain. Studies have shown that persistent compounds have been found in Antarctic ice, snow, and sediments. It indicates that persistent compounds could be transported over long distances and can be transferred around the world
