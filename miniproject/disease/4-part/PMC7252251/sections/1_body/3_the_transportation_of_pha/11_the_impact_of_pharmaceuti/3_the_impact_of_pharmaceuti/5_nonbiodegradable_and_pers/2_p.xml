<p id="p0330">General HWW contains nonbiodegradable and persistent drugs. Persistent organic pollutants are characterized by toxicity, bioaccumulation, semivolatility, and stable in nature, and can remain in seawater for a long time. The persistent compound normally has hydrophobic and lipophilic properties, large molecular weight, complex structure, easy to be enriched in the organism, and not easily biodegradable. The persistent compound is easy to accumulate in the environment, and thus can lead to damage the ecosystem, weaken the immunity of the ecosystem, and increase the biological diseases
