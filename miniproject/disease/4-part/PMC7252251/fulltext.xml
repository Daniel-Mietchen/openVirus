The hospital wastewater (HWW) is the effluents which are generated from all the hospital activities, such as surgery, emergency and first aids, laboratories, diagnosis, and radiology <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. HWW is produced in a wide range. The quantity and characteristics of the HWW are varied mainly according to the size (big: &#x0003e;500 beds; middle: 100&#x02013;499 beds; small: &#x0003c;100 beds) and the type (general or special) of the hospital <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It was reported that the generation rate of HWW was around 400&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;L per bed per day worldwide <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">HWW may contain various hazardous materials which can be classified into physical remaining, chemical substances, and biological risks <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The majority of physical hazards presenting in HWW are the radioactive substances which are utilized in nuclear medicine therapies and diagnostics. The common isotope utilized is the <sup>131</sup>I (iodine-131) radio isotope compared to other radionuclides (phosphorus-32, strontium-89, yttrium-90, etc.). The concentration of <sup>131</sup>I in the HWW is in the range of 15.0&#x02013;61.8&#x000a0;Bq/L <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It normally poses a much higher physical risk.</p><p id="p0020">The main chemical substances in HWWs are the pharmaceuticals, which are partially metabolized and excreted in the urine <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These pharmaceuticals can be antibiotics, analgesics and antiinflammatories, psychiatric drugs, b-blockers, anesthetics, disinfectants, chemicals from laboratory activities, and developer and fixer solutions from photographic film processing and X-ray contrast media <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The hazard chemicals are commonly flushed into the sewer and transported to the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) without any pretreatment <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">In general, the biological risk of HWWs is a large variety of pathogen microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and viruses), which are principally from the feces of infected humans. Like partially metabolized pharmaceuticals, the pathogens are also flushed into the sewerage pipeline without pretreatment <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">Generally, the HWW is required to be treated in situ to reduce the discharge of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, there are still some places cotreating the HWW along with municipal wastewater. In fact, municipal WWTPs are designed to remove the general contaminants including fats, oils, organic matters, nitrogen, and phosphorus from human wastes <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore the traditional wastewater treatment processes are not suitable for the removal of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and ARGs. It reveals that these substances would discharge to the environment along with wastewater treatment effluent when HWW was treated with municipal wastewater treatment processes. HWW containing all kinds of hazard materials is often transported to the traditional urban WWTPs. Unfortunately, HWW may not be properly treated in the WWTP <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is found that substances, such as antitumor agents, antibiotics, and organ halogen compounds, are barely degraded by the WWTPs and left in the effluents <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Nowadays, pharmaceuticals can be detected in surface waters, ground waters, and drinking water due to their inefficient removal in WWTP <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Pharmaceuticals, which are often water soluble, are generally biologically active compounds and not easily biodegraded <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p id="p0035">Even though most pharmaceuticals are in low concentrations in the ecosystems and might not induce any harmful impact as single compounds <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, pharmaceuticals may be mixed and interacted in the ecosystem <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The mixtures of pharmaceuticals have higher toxicity and more serious environmental impact than they are recognized as single compounds <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A good understanding of the pharmaceuticals&#x02019; impact on the environment and ecosystems is necessary.</p><p id="p0040">In this chapter, the following contents were presented, including the characterization of HWW; the development of ARG; the transportation of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and ARGs in the environment; and the impact of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and ARG on human health and environment.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3.2</label><title>Pharmaceuticals and pathogens in hospital wastewater</title><p id="p0045">The composition of HWW is very complex. It mainly contains pharmaceuticals and pathogens. Pharmaceuticals are widely prescribed and consumed in the world.

The adverse effect of pharmaceuticals in the environment has been extensively studied <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Among all, the most concern one is the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes as it would lead to transfer of resistant gene to antibiotic sensitive microbial species. There is the risk of treatment failure when humans or animals are infected with the bacteria which already developed antibiotic-resistant gene. Apart from antibiotics, there are also other compounds such as radiation and X-ray compounds, which can induce reform of DNA and thus cause abnormal diseases. Pathogens are also big problems of HWW.

The leakage of radioactive material should be controlled. After utilization of the radionuclides, the radioactive pollutants enter to the environment along with the waste including wastewater. In fact, nowadays along with the development of nuclear medicine, the application of radionuclides in clinical diagnosis, treatment, and medical research has become much more extensive. Apart from the direct discharge to the wastewater, the radionuclides can also go to the environment from patient discharge.

Carbamazepine is frequently detected in both WWTP effluents and river water. In fact, carbamazepine can be completely transformed during metabolism. Normally, less than 5% of a dose remains unchanged after being taken by human being. Therefore high concentrations of the metabolites of carbamazepine are detected instead of the parent compound in WWTPs influents and effluents, even reaching few micrograms per liter <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>3.2.1.4</label><title>Hormones</title><p id="p0080">Hormones are commonly found in the environment including water and soil as they are widely applied in livestock breeding, aquaculture, and clinical treatment.

The presence of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide in water could induce cancer risk to humans. In the cancer and tumor treatment, large amount of the antitumor agents are prescribed. Most of the unused agents and their metabolites would end up in the HWW, municipal wastewater treatment processes cannot eliminate pharmaceuticals; they would remain in the effluent and finally go to receiving water bodies, and then causes genotoxic and carcinogenic effects on humans. Due to the lack of specific risk assessment mechanisms, carcinogens in the water environment cannot be accurately quantified, but existing studies have been able to determine that they have a greater impact on newborns and children than adults <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. In addition to this, there is a great possibility of synergism between various trace amounts of toxic and harmful substances present in water bodies, which cannot be ignored.</p><p id="p0350">The impact of HWW on humans, in addition to direct exposure to intake, its toxicity can also be affected by the bioconcentration of the food chain and the flow of substances through the biological chain, which is considered as bioaccumulation. It is another important pathway of pharmaceuticals transported to humans. For example, antibiotics are a major class of drugs. Antibiotics discharged into the water with the hospital&#x02019;s wastewater are accumulated in drinking water and aquatic foods. Humans can accumulate antibiotics in the body by taking water which are contaminated by antibiotics or taking the aquatic products obtained from the antibiotic contaminated waste. It then can cause biomagnifications to increase their concentration, and then lead to chronic toxicity, allergic reactions, and &#x0201c;three-in-one.&#x0201d; It will also break the balance of normal flora in the human body; thereby impact on various physiological functions of human beings to threaten human health. In addition, antibiotics can produce drug resistance genes in migration and transformation, and drug resistance genes transmit mutations in different bacteria <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. When these drug resistance genes are transferred to pathogenic bacteria, they increase the threat to human health.</p><p id="p0355">It could also inherit from generation to generation. HWW contains a variety of chemical, physical, or biological compositions, which may cause permanent damage to cell structure or function, prevent growth, cause embryo, and even cause embryo death. Reflected on the macrolevel, the harm caused by HWW mainly affects in microcephaly, cardiac and facial edema, and axials. Most importantly, it can cause teratogenesis, which means that if a mother was deformed, the probability of child malformation will be particularly large <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.
</p><p id="p0360">The close contact of human with pathogens could cause many diseases. It has been reported that the physicochemical and bacterial pollution caused by the discharge of improper treated HWW has become serious problem to the environment, and it is getting worse. Pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Vibrio</italic>, which are significantly harmful to the human body, have been considered the main media for the transportation of epidemics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0190"><label>3.5</label><title>The prevention of pharmaceuticals and pathogens into environment</title><p id="p0365">When micropollutants accumulate to a certain amount, the quantitative change will cause a qualitative change, which will have a huge impact on the environment. The impact of this latent pollution is enormous.</p><p id="p0370">In summary, how to effectively treat HWW and prevent pharmaceuticals, pathogens, etc. from entering the environment is actually a problem. In fact, it can be controlled from different points including the source control, process control, and final control.</p><sec id="s0195"><label>3.5.1</label><title>Source supervision</title><p id="p0375">HWW refers to the sewage discharged by hospitals to the natural environment or urban pipelines. The water quality varies with the nature, scale, and location of the hospitals. The substances contained are mainly various pharmaceuticals and pathogens. Essentially, the most direct way to prevent all types of pharmaceuticals and pathogens in HWW from entering the environment is to control their emissions from the source.</p><p id="p0380">Taking example of the current wastewater discharge regulations, the government should set policies and regulations for HWW discharge, improve and strengthen the relevant regulations of HWW, and strictly limit the limits of pharmaceuticals and pathogens in HWW. The government should be actively attending to the carrying out of the regulations and strictly supervise the hospital to follow the regulations. The hospitals should strictly implement the regulation for reduce the content of pharmaceuticals and pathogens in HWW before discharged.</p></sec><sec id="s0200"><label>3.5.2</label><title>Process management</title><p id="p0385">HWW can go into surface water, groundwater, soil, etc. One of the most important factors causing the widespread distribution of HWW is the disorderly discharge. HWW itself has more pharmaceuticals such as pathogens and antibiotics, which are discharged into the environment and enter the organism through various cycles, posing a threat to humans (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3&#x02013;1</xref>). Therefore the hospital&#x02019;s wastewater discharge process is strictly regulated to monitor the occurrence of disorderly discharge, which can make the HWW centralized treatment and reduce its threat to humans and the environment.
</p></sec><sec id="s0205"><label>3.5.3</label><title>Terminal control</title><p id="p0390">At present, the main treatment processes for removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogens from HWW are membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and various advanced oxidation technologies, but there are some emerging technologies with great potential. Mousaab et al. <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> have employed an upgraded MBR system for treating HWW. The aim of this study is to improve the pharmaceuticals removal efficiency with membrane function. Ultrafiltration membrane module was used to couple with an activated sludge basin. The sludge retention time and hydraulic retention time were 20 days and 22&#x000a0;h, respectively. The study revealed that the removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and volatile suspended solids reached 91.8%, 100%, and 93.2%, respectively. The removal efficiencies of codeine, pravastatin, ketoprofen, diclofenac, roxithromycin, gemfibrozil, and iohexol were greater than 95%, which almost remained the same concentration before and after treatment with activated sludge process. The presence of biofilm supports also enhanced particle sorption and improved effluent quality, thus offering better protection of the membranes against fouling and reducing cleaning operations.</p><p id="p0395">It is revealed that nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) processes are potential technology for further removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogens from HWW after being treated with MBR. Residues of pharmaceuticals in the effluent of MBR can be further separated from water by NF or by RO being retained due to molecular weight and size, sorption, and charge attraction. Among all, sorption is considered as the primary removal mechanism for poorly soluble nonpolar compounds <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>.</p><p id="p0400">It has been widely reported that advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are able to completely oxidize and/or destroy organic pollutants in water and wastewater into H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and mineral salts. AOPs have also been applied on the HWW treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals and pathogens. Fenton oxidation and ozone oxidation are commonly used. During advanced oxidation, a variety of radical reactions such as hydroxyl radical (HO&#x02022;), superoxide radical anion (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.svg"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x02022;</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>), and hydroperoxyl radicals (HO<sub>2</sub>&#x02022;, ROO&#x02212;) are generated on site. The formations of these radicals are generally induced due to the combinations of chemical agents and auxiliary energy sources <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. The commonly employed chemical agents are ozone, hydrogen peroxide, transition metals, and metal oxides. The energy can be provided with UV irradiation, electronic current, y-radiation, and ultrasound. Among all, HO&#x02022; is the most frequently applied oxidant in AOPs. It is mainly attributed to that unlike many other radicals HO&#x02022; is nonselective, and could readily react with many organic pollutants by converting them into more hydrophilic compounds than the original ones.</p><p id="p0405">For the treatment of HWW, the effective way is to start from the control of source of HWW, control the transportation process of HWW, and continuously strengthen the treatment process of the final HWW.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0210"><label>3.6</label><title>Conclusions and perspectives</title><p id="p0410">HWW contains variety of harmful materials including pharmaceuticals and pathogens. HWW is normally treated with sewage wastewater together, although it is not allowed. However, WWTPs are not designed for treating HWW. Pharmaceuticals and pathogens will be then discharged to the receiving water bodies. Antibiotic as one of the most common pollutant in the HWW can cause the development of ARGs. Therefore pharmaceuticals, pathogens, and ARGs have become the three most important contaminants in the HWW. These pollutants can cause server problems to the environment, microorganism, organism, and humans.</p><p id="p0415">Many studies have revealed the harmful impact of pharmaceuticals on the organisms and humans. The most concerned ones are hormones, antibiotics, radiation, and X-ray compounds. Many others could cause problems to the environment, ecosystem, and humans as well. However, there are not reported due to that the effect is chronic. The strategy for controlling the harmful materials in the HWW can be performed by source control, process control, and terminal control.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carraro</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonetta</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bertino</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lorenzi</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonetta</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilli</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hospital effluents management: chemical, physical, microbiological risks and legislation in different countries</article-title><source>J.
