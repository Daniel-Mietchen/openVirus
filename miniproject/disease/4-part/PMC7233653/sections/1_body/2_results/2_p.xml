<p>The distribution of detected IVs is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. During the study period, co-circulation of A type IVs and B type IVs was observed, although with a different intensity; in five seasons A type IVs predominated over B type IVs. An overview of the eight seasons shows a mixed IVs circulation: co-circulation of A/H1N1pdm09 IVs and B type IVs in 2010-2011 season (46.7% vs 49.61%); co-circulation of A/H1N1pdm09 IVs and A/H3N2 IVs in 2014-2015 season (41.1% vs 46.2%). During 2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 seasons, A/H3N2 IVs were predominant (99.5%, 72.5%, 46.2% and 97.2% respectively); during 2012-2013, 2015-2016, 2017-2108 seasons, B type IVs were predominantly detected (72.6%, 79.0%, 58.3% respectively). In all seasons, the highest number of positive samples were recorded in younger patients 5-14 aged with relative frequencies ranging from 40% in the 2013-2014 season and 78% in the 2012-2013 season (
