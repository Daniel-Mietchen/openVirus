<p>During 2016-2017 season type B IVs circulating in Emilia-Romagna belonged to B/Yam lineage (clade 3), while in Italy, both B lineages co-circulated. The reference strain B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Vic) was reconfirmed for the following two seasons, where almost the whole B IVs belonged to B/Yam lineage circulated. Only one virus detected in Emilia-Romagna in 2016-2017 season belonged to B/Vic lineage.</p>
