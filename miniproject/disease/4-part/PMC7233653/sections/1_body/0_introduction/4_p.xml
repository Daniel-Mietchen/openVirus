<p>Periodically, in the range of 10-40 years, IVs type A caused pandemic events, due to the emergence of a new variant against which there is no pre-existing immunity in the population. The pandemic in 2009 was caused by a unique quadruple reassortant A/H1N1 IV, including a complex combination of swine, avian and human IV genes (

Moreover, a progressive diversification of B type IVs into two lineages, genetically and antigenically distinct, occurred starting from 1983 (
