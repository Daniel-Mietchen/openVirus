Preclinical studies have demonstrated that an adenoviral vector-based RSV F vaccine candidate (Ad26.RSV.FA2) induces Th1-biased protective immune responses, without signs of ERD upon subsequent RSV challenge. We here developed an Ad26 vector encoding the RSV F protein stabilized in its prefusion conformation (Ad26.RSV.preF). In adult mice, Ad26.RSV.preF induced superior, Th1-biased IgG2a-dominated humoral responses as compared to Ad26.RSV.FA2, while maintaining the strong Th1-biased cellular responses. Similar to adult mice, Ad26.RSV.preF induced robust and durable humoral immunity in neonatal mice, again characterized by IgG2a-dominated RSV F-binding antibodies, and high and stable virus-neutralizing titers. In addition, vaccine-elicited cellular immune responses were durable and characterized by IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a profound Th1 bias. In contrast, immunization of neonatal mice with FI-RSV resulted in IgG1 RSV F-binding antibodies associated with a Th2 phenotype, no detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, and a Th2-biased cellular response. These results are supportive for the clinical development of Ad26.RSV.preF for use in infants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Viral infection</kwd><kwd>Vaccines</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an orthopneumovirus of the <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> family that causes annual epidemics of acute lower respiratory tract infections, while in addition, reinfection is common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Whereas infections in healthy adults are mild, RSV causes severe disease in immunocompromised persons and elderly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, RSV remains the leading cause of hospitalization due to respiratory disease in infants and children under 5 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite the high disease burden of this viral pathogen and a strong incentive for vaccine development, no safe and effective vaccine is yet available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Young infants are an important target population for an infant RSV vaccine, as the disease burden is highest in infants of &#x0003c;6 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Several factors complicate RSV vaccine development for this target population, which include the relative immaturity of the infant immune system and the presence of maternal anti-RSV antibodies that might suppress vaccine-induced immune responses. Another major obstacle in RSV vaccine development is the legacy of vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (ERD). In clinical trials in the 1960s, children vaccinated with formalin-inactivated (FI-) RSV were not protected against natural infection, but instead experienced more severe illness requiring hospitalizations during subsequent natural infection (including two mortalities), compared to children that did not receive this vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the FI-RSV-vaccinated children, the vaccine induced antibodies with poor virus-neutralizing capacity, and those were associated with immune complex formation and complement deposition in the small airways in the infants who died. Studies in animal models have shown that immunization with FI-RSV induced, next to these poorly neutralizing antibodies, CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2-biased responses and reduced cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming and evidence of eosinophilia in the lung after RSV challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The neonatal immune system is characterized by a preferential differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper 2 (Th2) cells, thereby antagonizing T helper 1 (Th1) and cytotoxic responses that are crucial for protection against intracellular pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, the immune profile induced by an ideal RSV candidate for infants should be skewed away from the immune profile induced by FI-RSV and preferably induce Th1 responses, even in the Th2-prone neonatal immune environment.</p><p id="Par3">The RSV fusion surface glycoprotein (RSV F) is an attractive vaccine antigen, since it is the principal target of RSV-neutralizing antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This concept is further supported by the clinical efficacy of the currently available anti-F neutralizing monoclonal IgG1 antibody (Palivizumab) for RSV prophylaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. RSV F is present on the viral surface in a metastable prefusion (preF) conformation, which is easily triggered to convert into a postfusion (postF) conformation. RSV preF is highly immunogenic and most RSV-neutralizing antibodies in human sera are directed against the preF conformation. We previously demonstrated that stabilized preF, when given as protein antigen, elicits superior levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against viral challenge in animal models when compared to non-stabilized F<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors based on serotype 26 have a favorable safety profile and are potent inducers of humoral and cellular Th1 responses in both animals and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This contrasts to the Th2-biased profile of FI-RSV vaccine which has been associated with ERD upon infection with RSV. Therefore, the expected Th1 immune response elicited by an adenoviral-vectored RSV vaccine likely minimalizes the probability of ERD upon subsequent RSV infection of vaccine recipients. We have previously shown that immunization with Ad26 encoding the wildtype RSV F transgene elicited strong and long-lasting humoral and cellular responses in adult mice and cotton rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. As antibodies directed against preF-specific epitopes are more potent in viral neutralization than those targeting postF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and based on our successful stabilization of the RSV F protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, we have genetically engineered an Ad26 vector encoding the full-length RSV F protein with amino acid substitutions that stabilize the RSV F protein in its prefusion conformation. In our present study we show improved immunogenicity of this Ad26.RSV.preF vector when compared to its parent Ad26.RSV.FA2, and furthermore demonstrate its induction of a potent Th1-biased immune response in neonatal mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>A single immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF induces a Th1-biased immune response in adult mice</title><p id="Par5">Previously we demonstrated that intramuscular immunization of adult mice with Ad26 encoding the wildtype F gene from RSV A2 (Ad26.RSV.FA2) elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We subsequently generated Ad26 with a transgene encoding the RSV A2 F protein but now with mutations that stabilize the protein in its prefusion conformation (Ad26.RSV.preF). Surface expression of prefusion F induced by Ad26.RSV.preF was confirmed by flowcytometric analysis of in vitro-transduced cells using an antibody specific for the prefusion F conformation. Under temperature stress, cells transduced with Ad26.RSV.FA2 loose the preF conformation of the expressed protein, whereas preF expressed on cells transduced with Ad26.RSV.preF appeared more stable. In contrast, total F expression, detected with an antibody recognizing both preF and postF, remained relatively constant for both Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Immunogenicity of Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad26.RSV.preF given at 10<sup>8</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>10</sup> vp/animal doses was compared in adult mice. Single intramuscular immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF resulted in higher VNA titers against RSV A Long and RSV B1 when compared to Ad26.RSV.FA2 in an across dose statistical comparison. VNA titers were on average 5.6-fold and 3.6-fold higher for Ad26.RSV.preF when compared to Ad26.RSV.FA2, for RSV A Long and RSV B1, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, d</xref>). Levels of IgG-binding antibodies against the preF protein were higher in Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized animals, whereas titers of postF-binding antibodies were similar between Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2 immunized groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, d</xref>), resulting in a significantly increased ratio between preF-binding and postF-binding antibodies in the former group.

Whereas FI-RSV did not induce VNA titers, VNA titers were induced in all Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized animals. Ad26.RSV.preF-induced antibodies bound both to preF and postF proteins, whereas antibodies induced by FI-RSV were mainly directed against postF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Th1/Th2 skewing of the response was assessed by determining the IgG subclass of postF antibodies. Ad26.RSV.preF induced a predominant Th1 response characterized by relatively high levels of IgG2a antibodies. In contrast, the FI-RSV response was characterized by high levels of IgG1 antibodies, and thus a Th2 skewing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The difference in IgG2a/IgG1 ratio at 10 weeks post immunization was observed for the complete dose range of Ad26.RSV.preF tested (10<sup>8</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>10</sup> vp/animal), and also observed when analyzed 4 weeks post immunization (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A</xref>).

We have previously demonstrated that Ad26 expressing the wildtype F protein from RSV A2 is immunogenic in adult mice and induces both humoral and cellular immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Earlier, we and others showed that a subunit protein vaccine of RSV F stabilized in its prefusion F conformation induces increased quality and quantity of antibodies with RSV-neutralizing activity and an increased protection against RSV challenge in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. These earlier findings are further substantiated by the results described in this manuscript using a membrane-bound prefusion F encoded by Ad26. The observed improved immunogenicity of Ad26.RSV.preF is mainly characterized by increased titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies, linked to increased prefusion F-binding IgG titers, whereas the titers of antibodies binding to postfusion F were not substantially different between Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2 immunized mice. Moreover, similar cellular immunogenicity is observed between Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2, indicating that the processing of the protein and MHC presentation is not altered by the mutations introduced to stabilize F. Vaccine candidates based on non-stabilized F protein have been used in various clinical studies, however clinical efficacy could not be demonstrated in recent large late stage efficacy studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In contrast, encouraging phase I results have been reported recently for the prefusion F-based subunit vaccine candidate DS-Cav1 that induced high increases in VNA titers in healthy adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">In the here presented mouse studies, a second dose of Ad26.RSV.preF did not significantly increase the induced humoral responses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In contrast, in non-human primates we recently observed an increase in (neutralizing) antibody titers after immunization with a second homologous dose of an Ad26-based vaccine candidate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, it has been demonstrated in humans that a homologous two dose immunization regimen with an Ad26 vectorized HIV vaccine candidate did boost the humoral responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In the current mouse study, the cellular responses were significantly boosted upon a second homologous Ad26.RSV.preF immunization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), suggesting that the lack of a boost effect on the humoral responses is not due to the presence of anti-Ad26 immunity induced by prime immunization (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Immaturity of the newborn immune system might contribute to the increased susceptibility to pathogens and to lower vaccine response when compared to adults. Due to this immaturity, routine childhood vaccination often requires multiple immunization to elicit full immunity. An earlier study with an Ad35 vector-based TB vaccine candidate in young infants (4&#x02013;6 months of age) indeed demonstrated a lower cellular immune response rate and magnitude when compared to adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, potency of novel childhood vaccine candidates should preferentially be tested in neonatal nonclinical models prior to proceeding to clinical testing. However, it should be kept in mind that the ontogeny of the immune system differs between humans and different animal species. Animals with relatively short gestation periods (e.g. mice, rats) have relatively immature immune systems at birth with ongoing immune system development after birth compared to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Even in the very immature immune system in mice of 4&#x02013;5 days of age, Ad26.RSV.preF induced robust and durable immune responses. These responses were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in animals immunized at 3&#x02013;4 weeks of age when the immune system is considered to be matured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and in adult mice. This suggests that responses to Ad26.RSV.preF are not severely affected by immaturity of the immune system, and that this vector might also be immunogenic in young infants. Recently, the potency of various RSV vaccine candidates was studied in larger infant animal models, for which the immune system ontogeny might better parallel the human situation. However, these studies do not describe a direct comparison of the vaccine potency or Th1/Th2 bias of the response between infants and adults of the same species. &#x00394;F/TriAdj, a truncated adjuvanted fusion protein, was shown to be immunogenic in lambs, both in the presence and absence of maternal anti-RSV antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Efficacy of adjuvanted bovine RSV F-based vaccine candidates has been demonstrated in calves in a species homologous bovine RSV infection model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Interestingly, human RSV F, N and M2-1 antigens expressed by a chimpanzee Adenoviral vector were immunogenic and protected calves against challenge with the heterologous bovine RSV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">ERD is a serious concern in neonates and young infants. ERD is, among other things, characterized by a Th2-biased immune response. Neonates, both mouse and human, are prone to mount Th2-biased responses, which for mice was shown to be due to epigenetic imprinting in CD4+ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. However, neonates are able to mount a Th1-biased response when given the right stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. As Th2-biased responses are undesirable for an RSV vaccine intended for the infant population, we carefully examined the Th1/Th2 skewing of the response in neonatal mice immunized with Ad26.RSV.preF. In mice, a Th1-biased immune response is dominated by antibodies of the IgG2a subclass, whereas IgG1 antibodies are a hallmark of a Th2-biased response making the IgG2a/IgG1 antibody ratio an indication for Th1/Th2 skewing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Upon FI-RSV immunization, a relatively low IgG2a/IgG1 antibody ratio was observed in both adult and neonatal mice, indicative for a Th2-biased response, although the absolute IgG titers differed considerably between both age groups (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Antibodies induced by Ad26.RSV.preF were strongly dominated by IgG2a in adult mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), whereas a more balanced response between IgG2a and IgG1 was observed in neonatal mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Thus, although differences were observed in the Ad26.RSV.preF response between adult and neonatal mice, the subtyping of the antibody response strongly deviates away from the Th2-biased profile induced by FI-RSV for both age groups. Cytokine profiles induced by FI-RSV were markedly similar between adult and neonatal mice, with relatively high levels of IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Completely different profiles were induced by Ad26.RSV.preF, again very similar in adult and neonatal mice, with high levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, and background levels for IL-5 and IL-10 (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate a profound Th1 bias of the immune response in both adult and neonatal mice after Ad26.RSV.preF immunization. These data are in line with previously published data on newborn rhesus monkeys showing that an Ad26 vectored vaccine induces CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-&#x003b3; when given on the day of birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Altogether this indicates that the Adenoviral vector platform is able to overcome the Th2 bias of the neonatal immune system, and instead induces Th1-biased responses. Another feature of the FI-RSV-induced immune response thought to contribute to the predisposition to ERD is the induction of antibodies with poor neutralizing capacity. We previously demonstrated that Ad26 encoding wildtype RSV F did not induce any signs of ERD in an adult cotton rat RSV challenge model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We here demonstrate that Ad26.RSV.preF induces even higher levels of neutralizing antibodies accompanied by a higher ratio of RSV neutralizing to RSV postF-binding antibodies, combined with a similar Th1-biased cellular response when compared to Ad26 encoding wildtype RSV F. As these characteristics skew the response away from FI-RSV-induced immune responses, this is highly suggestive of a lack of ERD predisposition by Ad26.RSV.preF.</p><p id="Par22">In recent clinical studies, the safety and induction of durable anti-RSV F cellular and humoral responses were demonstrated in healthy adults and elderly immunized with Ad26 encoding RSV F (11th International RSV Symposium Asheville, 2018).
