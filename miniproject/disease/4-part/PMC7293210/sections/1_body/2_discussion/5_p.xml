<p id="Par22">In recent clinical studies, the safety and induction of durable anti-RSV F cellular and humoral responses were demonstrated in healthy adults and elderly immunized with Ad26 encoding RSV F (11th International RSV Symposium Asheville, 2018). In addition, various animal and human studies have demonstrated the safety and clinical immunogenicity of adenoviral vector vaccines in infants and young children

 </sup>. Combined with our results demonstrating that a single immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF in neonatal animals induces robust and durable neutralizing antibodies and cellular Th1-biased immune responses, indicative for a very low likelihood of ERD predisposition, further clinical development of this vector for prevention of RSV in young infants was initiated (NCT03606512, Clinical Trials.gov). In addition, use of this vector for other target populations is currently clinically explored (ClincialTrials.gov, NCT03982199).
