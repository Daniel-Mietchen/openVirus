<p id="Par18">Although development of an RSV vaccine has been a high priority, there is still no licensed vaccine available. We have previously demonstrated that Ad26 expressing the wildtype F protein from RSV A2 is immunogenic in adult mice and induces both humoral and cellular immune responses

 </sup>. Earlier, we and others showed that a subunit protein vaccine of RSV F stabilized in its prefusion F conformation induces increased quality and quantity of antibodies with RSV-neutralizing activity and an increased protection against RSV challenge in animal models

 </sup>. These earlier findings are further substantiated by the results described in this manuscript using a membrane-bound prefusion F encoded by Ad26. The observed improved immunogenicity of Ad26.RSV.preF is mainly characterized by increased titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies, linked to increased prefusion F-binding IgG titers, whereas the titers of antibodies binding to postfusion F were not substantially different between Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2 immunized mice. Moreover, similar cellular immunogenicity is observed between Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2, indicating that the processing of the protein and MHC presentation is not altered by the mutations introduced to stabilize F. Vaccine candidates based on non-stabilized F protein have been used in various clinical studies, however clinical efficacy could not be demonstrated in recent large late stage efficacy studies
