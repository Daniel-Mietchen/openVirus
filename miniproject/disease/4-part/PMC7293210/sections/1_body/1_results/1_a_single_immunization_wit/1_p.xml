<p id="Par5">Previously we demonstrated that intramuscular immunization of adult mice with Ad26 encoding the wildtype F gene from RSV A2 (Ad26.RSV.FA2) elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses

 </sup>. We subsequently generated Ad26 with a transgene encoding the RSV A2 F protein but now with mutations that stabilize the protein in its prefusion conformation (Ad26.RSV.preF). Surface expression of prefusion F induced by Ad26.RSV.preF was confirmed by flowcytometric analysis of in vitro-transduced cells using an antibody specific for the prefusion F conformation. Under temperature stress, cells transduced with Ad26.RSV.FA2 loose the preF conformation of the expressed protein, whereas preF expressed on cells transduced with Ad26.RSV.preF appeared more stable. In contrast, total F expression, detected with an antibody recognizing both preF and postF, remained relatively constant for both Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2 (Supplementary Fig.

 <sup>8</sup>â€“10
 <sup>10</sup> vp/animal doses was compared in adult mice. Single intramuscular immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF resulted in higher VNA titers against RSV A Long and RSV B1 when compared to Ad26.RSV.FA2 in an across dose statistical comparison. VNA titers were on average 5.6-fold and 3.6-fold higher for Ad26.RSV.preF when compared to Ad26.RSV.FA2, for RSV A Long and RSV B1, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, d</xref>). Levels of IgG-binding antibodies against the preF protein were higher in Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized animals, whereas titers of postF-binding antibodies were similar between Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2 immunized groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, d</xref>), resulting in a significantly increased ratio between preF-binding and postF-binding antibodies in the former group. Cellular responses were not significantly different in Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2 immunized mice, as determined by ELISPOT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>), and by ICS analysis of the CD8+ T cell subsets, whereas CD4+ responses were below background levels for both vectors (Supplementary Fig.
