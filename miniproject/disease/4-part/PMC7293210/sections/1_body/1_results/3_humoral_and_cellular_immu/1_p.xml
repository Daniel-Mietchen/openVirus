<p id="Par13">Similar to the observations in adult mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), a single immunization of neonatal mice with 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp Ad26.RSV.preF resulted in high VNA titers with antibodies binding to the F protein in both its prefusion and postfusion conformation, whereas immunization with FI-RSV resulted in no detectable VNA titers, and hardly any prefusion F-binding antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). PostF-specific binding antibodies induced by Ad26.RSV.preF in neonatal mice were of both IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses. In contrast, FI-RSV induced only RSV F-specific IgG1 antibodies but no detectable IgG2a antibodies, indicative of a Th2-biased profile (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>).
