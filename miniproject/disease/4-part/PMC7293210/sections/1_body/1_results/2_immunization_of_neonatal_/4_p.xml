<p id="Par12">At 25 weeks after single Ad26.RSV.preF immunization, high RSV F-specific IFN-γ cellular responses were still detectable and significantly above levels found in animals that received mock immunization (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0087) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Prime-boost regimens had a beneficial effect on the durability of the cellular responses with significantly increased numbers of IFN-γ+ splenocytes in the prime-boost groups compared to the prime-only immunization group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Again, ICS analysis demonstrated high percentages of IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>, IL-2
 <sup>+</sup> and TNF-α
 <sup>+</sup> cells mostly within the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population. In addition, percentages of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α producing CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells were also above baseline levels at 25 weeks after Ad26.RSV.preF immunization. Furthermore, the enhancing effect of a homologous Ad26.RSV.preF boost immunization on cellular responses as observed by ELISPOT analysis, was confirmed by ICS (Supplementary Fig.
