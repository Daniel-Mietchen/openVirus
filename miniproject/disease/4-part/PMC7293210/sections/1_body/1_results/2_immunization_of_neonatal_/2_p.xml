<p id="Par10">Cellular responses were assessed in splenocytes isolated at 9 weeks after immunization. Stimulation of splenocytes with RSV F peptides resulted in significantly increased numbers of IFN-γ-positive cells in Ad26.RSV.preF-immunized neonatal mice (Fig.

A significantly increased response was detected in the group that received a boost at 6 weeks after prime immunization compared to the prime-only immunization group, whereas no significantly increased response was observed in the group that received a boost 3 weeks after prime immunization compared to the prime-only immunization group.
