<p id="Par11">Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) at week 9 post immunization of RSV F-stimulated splenocytes revealed that significantly increased numbers of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α-positive cells resided both in the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> populations after immunization, when compared to the non-immunized control group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0087 for all comparisons), with higher percentages of IFN-γ and TNF-α-producing cells within the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population when compared to the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The effect of boost immunizations observed for the ELISPOT responses was confirmed by ICS analysis (Fig.
