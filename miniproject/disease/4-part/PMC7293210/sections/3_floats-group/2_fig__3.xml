  <title>Subcutaneous Ad26.RSV.preF immunization induces durable humoral responses in neonatal mice.</title>
  <p>Pups were subcutaneously immunized at Day 4–5 after birth, and boosted 3 or 6 weeks later with 10
   <sup>10</sup> vp Ad26.RSV.preF in the immunization regimens displayed (
   <italic>n</italic> = 12 per group). Control groups received no immunization (indicated with - or sham), or FI-RSV (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). 
   <bold>a</bold> Prefusion (upper rows) or postfusion (middle rows) RSV F-binding antibody titers were determined by ELISA in serum at 3 weeks (left panels), 6 weeks (middle panels), and 9 weeks (left panels) after prime immunization. RSV CL57 VNA titers (lower row) in sera were determined 6 and 9 weeks after prime immunization. The lower limit of quantification of the assays are indicated with dashed lines, and horizontal bars represent the mean response per group. 
   <bold>b</bold> Mice were followed for 25 weeks post-prime immunization, and RSV CL57 VNA titers were assayed in sera obtained 6, 9 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 12 per group), 13, 17, 21, and 25 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group) weeks after prime immunization. Data are presented as mean ± s.d. per group. ELISA titers are given as the log
   <sub>10</sub> value of relative potency, and VNA titers as the log
   <sub>2</sub> value of the IC90. NA not analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and Bonferroni correction, or Tobit regression and Tukey or Tukey–Kramer correction.
