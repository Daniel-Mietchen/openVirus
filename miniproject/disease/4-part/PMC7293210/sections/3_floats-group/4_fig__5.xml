  <title>The immune profile induced by Ad26.RSV.preF in neonatal animals deviates significantly from the profile induced by FI-RSV.</title>
  <p>Neonatal mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) received a single immunization with 10
   <sup>10</sup> vp Ad26.RSV.preF at Day 4 or 5 after birth, or 3 weeks later. Control groups were not immunized (indicated with -), or received a prime-boost immunization with FI-RSV. IgG1 (left panel) and IgG2a (right panel) subclass RSV F-binding antibodies were determined in serum taken 9 weeks 
   <bold>a</bold> or 25 weeks 
   <bold>b</bold> after prime immunization. 
   <bold>c</bold> A subgroup of animals was sacrificed 9 weeks post-prime-immunization and splenocytes were isolated and stimulated with RSV F peptide pools. IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 secretion in the supernatant of F-stimulated splenocytes was determined by a multiplex ELISA-based analytical method. Ratios between Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, or IL-10) were calculated for samples with at least one of the values above background levels (95th percentile of unstimulated splenocytes). Means 
   <bold>a</bold> and 
   <bold>b</bold> and geometric means 
   <bold>c</bold> per group are indicated with horizontal lines. Statistical analysis was performed with Tobit regression and Dunnett or Dunnett–Hsu correction.
