  <title>Ad26.RSV.preF polarizes the immune response towards Th1 type in adult mice.</title>
  <p>Adult BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group) were immunized intramuscularly with a single dose of 1 × 10
   <sup>10</sup> vp/animal Ad26.RSV.preF, two doses of FI-RSV given 4 weeks apart, or formulation buffer (indicated with -). At 10 weeks post-immunization, animals were sacrificed and sera and spleens were collected. 
   <bold>a</bold> Serum was assayed for VNA against RSV A2 (left panel), or for preF and postF RSV F-binding IgG antibodies (middle and right panel, respectively), 
   <bold>b</bold> RSV-specific IgG1 and IgG2a subclass antibodies against postF as determined by ELISA. 
   <bold>c</bold> Splenocytes were stimulated with RSV F peptide pools. IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 secretion in the supernatant was determined by a multiplex ELISA-based analytical method. Ratios between Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, or IL-10) were calculated for samples with at least one of the values above background levels (95th percentile of unstimulated splenocytes). Means 
   <bold>a</bold> and 
   <bold>b</bold> or geometric means 
   <bold>c</bold> per group are indicated with horizontal lines. Statistical analysis comparing Ad26.RSV.preF and FI-RSV-induced responses was performed using Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test in case censored values were included (VNA and IgG2a ELISA).
