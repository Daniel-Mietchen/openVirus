  <title>Stabilization of the fusion protein in its prefusion conformation increases humoral responses in adult mice when expressed in an Ad26 vector.</title>
  <p>Adult BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 per group) were immunized intramuscularly with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup>–1 × 10
   <sup>10</sup> vp/animal of Ad26.RSV.preF (•), Ad26.RSV.FA2 (∘) or formulation buffer (▫). Animals were sacrificed 8 weeks post immunization. Serum was analyzed for 
   <bold>a</bold> RSV A Long (left panel) and RSV B1 (right panel) neutralizing antibodies and 
   <bold>b</bold> prefusion (left panel) and postfusion (right panel) IgG antibodies. 
   <bold>c</bold> Splenocytes were stimulated with RSV.F peptides and IFN-γ ELISPOT results are expressed as spot forming units/10
   <sup>6</sup> splenocytes. The background levels are indicated with dotted lines and means 
   <bold>a</bold> and 
   <bold>b</bold> or geometric means 
   <bold>c</bold> per group are indicated with horizontal lines. 
   <bold>d</bold> Across dose statistical analysis was performed with Tobit regression and Bonferroni correction. The estimated mean difference between Ad26.RSV.preF and Ad26.RSV.FA2 is indicated with a dot, and the lower and upper confidence limits with whiskers. Statistical differences are indicated. NS: not significant.
