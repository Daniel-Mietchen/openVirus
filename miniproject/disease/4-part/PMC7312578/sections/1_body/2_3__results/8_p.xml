<p>Finally, Miner J et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], in an experimental study of mice in the United States from January to February 2016, carried out tests to determine the degree of association of Zika virus with neonatal microcephaly as well as with other congenital disorders. Scientists, referring to the urgent need to investigate intrauterine Zika transmission and its pathological consequences, developed two models of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. In the first model, Zika crosses the placenta barrier resulting in fetal infection and CNS damage and residual intrauterine growth, in more severe cases the infection resulted in fetal death, in the second case, after treatment with anti-interferon (IFN)-AB antibodies in the placenta, infection of the developing embryo occurred but was less severe and did not cause the death of the fetus. Furthermore, in Noguchi et al.’s 2019 [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] study, the effect of the Zika virus infection on the brain and the CNS of the mouse are presented—resulting in massive neurodegeneration of infected regions. The Brazilian Zika virus stain is also reported in the research and produces particularly devastating neuropathology in the fetal brain opposed to the viral French Polynesia stain.
