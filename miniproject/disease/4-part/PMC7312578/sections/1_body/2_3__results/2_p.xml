<p>More detailed, in the study of Magalhães et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which was carried out in Brazil, all available data support a causal relationship between the Zika virus and related microcephaly and (CNS) abnormalities in infants. The 8301 cases of microcephaly were analyzed and confirmed by laboratory tests and neuroimaging methods, thus excluding incidents due to other congenital abnormalities. The results showed that 15% of the patients with microcephaly was related to Zika virus infection. According to the Melo et al. 2016 [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] study, two newborns with congenital Zika infection were observed from their intrauterine life. The infection was found during the first twotrimesters of pregnancy and confirmed with maternal–fetal laboratory tests (mother serological tests, amniocentesis). Both neonates were shown brain damage with reduced brain volume, brain celiac disease, cerebral hypoplasia, hydrocephalus, and arthropathy. The cross-sectional study of Sarno et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], had the aim to describe CNS lesions in fetuses with microcephaly after congenital Zika infection. The researchers concluded that Zika syndrome is linked to neurological abnormalities such as abdominal pain, abdominal calcifications and posterior cingulate damage which become apparent only at the end of the second trimester and beyond. Furthermore, referring to CNS lesions, they observed that damage to the posterior cavity and articulation are unusual findings in other infections and their presence may indicate Zika infection. In addition, the 1501 cases studied by Franca et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], were the first to be fully investigated and funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The purpose of the research was to identify infants with microcephaly and make a complete clinical record. From this study, 602 cases were finally confirmed as congenital Zika syndrome. The research also shows that the earlier the rash is reported in pregnancy, the smaller the circumference of the newborn’s head.
