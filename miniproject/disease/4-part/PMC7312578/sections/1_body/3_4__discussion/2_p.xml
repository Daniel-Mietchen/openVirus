<p>The results, according to the articles, show that the prevalence of microcephaly cases in Southern America (confirmed by laboratory tests), has been shown to be related to maternal infection with Zika virus in pregnancy, especially in the first and second trimesters [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Particularly in the first trimester, the disorder is associated with the process of neuronal migration and spinal cord formation. Of course, while the first trimester appears to be more prone to risk than the second trimester, cases of microcephaly are confirmed (or not) by reporting mothers’ infection symptoms at weeks 18–20 [

The fact that 80% of infections in pregnant women are asymptomatic, while high viral load values in the fetal brain, placenta, and fetal membranes are isolated, indicates that the timing of infection is crucial for the outcome of the disease [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, the risk of developing Zika virus infection is greater in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy as the CNS and brain develop. It is also of importance that Zika does not cross only the placental barrier. Elements of the virus genome were found in breast milk, saliva, urine, and mother’s blood serum even a few days after childbirth [
