<p>We identified a recent systematic review by Wong et al. on RCTs designed to assess the efficacy of hand hygiene interventions against transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>8</italic>
 </xref>). We used this review as a starting point and then searched for additional literature published after 2013; we found 3 additional eligible articles published during the search period of January 1, 2013–August 13, 2018. In total, we identified 12 articles (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>9</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>), of which 3 articles were from the updated search and 9 articles from Wong et al. (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>8</italic>
 </xref>). Two articles relied on the same underlying dataset (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>16</italic>
 </xref>,
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>); therefore, we counted these 2 articles as 1 study, which resulted in 11 RCTs. We further selected 10 studies with &gt;10,000 participants for inclusion in the meta-analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We excluded 1 study from the meta-analysis because it provided estimates of infection risks only at the household level, not the individual level (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>). We did not generate an overall pooled effect of hand hygiene only or of hand hygiene with or without face mask because of high heterogeneity in individual estimates (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> 87 and 82%, respectively). The effect of hand hygiene combined with face masks on laboratory-confirmed influenza was not statistically significant (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73–1.13; 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 35%, p = 0.39). Some studies reported being underpowered because of limited sample size, and low adherence to hand hygiene interventions was observed in some studies.
