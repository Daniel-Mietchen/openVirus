  <p>Apo structure of the SFTSV L protein. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic linear representation of the domain structure of the SFTSV L protein. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Illustrated representation of two views of the apo-L cryo-EM structure as a ribbon diagram (PDB 6Y6K). Domains are colored as in (A). The magnesium ion in the active site is shown as a sphere. A more detailed view and comparison with the LACV L (PDB 5AMQ) and the influenza virus polymerase complex (PDB 6QCV) are shown in

   <bold>C</bold>) Superposition of the 5 Å low-pass filtered cryo-EM map with the SFTSV apo-L structure model. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Representation of the polymerase core of the SFTSV L with the conserved motifs A–H as a ribbon diagram. The divalent magnesium ion is shown as a sphere.
