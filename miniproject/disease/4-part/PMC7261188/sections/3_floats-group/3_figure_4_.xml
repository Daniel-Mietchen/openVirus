  <p>Initiation of replication. (
   <bold>A</bold>) RNA products synthesized by the SFTSV L (D112A) protein in the presence of the conserved 5′ and 3′ terminal 20 nt of the M segment (5′ M: HO-ACACAGAGACGGCCAACAAU-OH, 3′ M: HO-UGUGUUUCUGGCCGGUUGUG-OH, 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and radioactively labeled primers listed in (C). The experiment was performed as described for the standard polymerase assay (see Materials and Methods). Where indicated, radioactively labeled primers were used instead of [α]
   <sup>32</sup>P-GTP. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The intensity profiles of the gel lanes from (A) were analyzed using ImageJ software (
   <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and illustrate the size differences between the product bands shown in (A). Sizes were determined by linear regression using the RNA marker (lower X-axis). (
   <bold>C</bold>) The table summarizes the RNA oligonucleotides used as primers in this experiment and the possible products with and without realignment. In brackets the length of the product RNA, relative to the 
   <italic>de novo</italic> product is given. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Schematic representation of the possible priming scenarios. Scenario 1 depicts terminal initiation: ATP primes the reaction by binding to the first nucleotide (position +1) of the template and is further elongated without realignment, resulting in a product with the same length as the 
   <italic>de novo</italic> reaction product (+/−0). Scenario 2 depicts internal initiation and realignment: the reaction is primed internally by binding of the first ATP to the position +3 and the addition of a C to form a di-nucleotide primer followed by dissociation of the AC dinucleotide and its realignment to position +1 and +2. This realigned AC dinucleotide is then elongated, resulting in the same product as the terminal initiation (+/−0).
