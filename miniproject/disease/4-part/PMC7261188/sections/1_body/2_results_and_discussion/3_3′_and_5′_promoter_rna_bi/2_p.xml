<p>In LACV L protein, the 3′ RNA was bound in a narrow cleft leading away from the polymerase active site and formed by the PA-C like domain, the thumb and thumb ring with the clamp of the vRBL serving as a lid over the cleft (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). By comparing with LACV L protein bound to the 3′ and 5′ promoter RNA, we suggest that the RNA binding sites of SFTSV L protein are in the equivalent locations. The 3′ RNA is likely bound in a positively charged cleft formed by the thumb and the PA-C like domain, especially the vRBL (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8A</xref>). The vRBL domain, however, would have to undergo a slight conformational change, as, in the current conformation, a loop between two β-strands (indicated in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> by a dashed circle) would block parts of the cleft. The clamp, which is missing clear density in the SFTSV cryo-EM map, indicating flexibility in the apo-L, could close the 3′ RNA-binding cleft on the top as observed for LACV (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although the clamp is missing we observed potential RNA interacting residues whose location and number in this area would correspond to LACV 3′ RNA binding site (compare Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and
