<p>An important feature of all sNSV polymerase proteins is the ability to bind to the conserved RNA promoter ends, the almost complementary 3′ and 5′ termini of the genome segments. For LACV and influenza virus polymerases, distinct 3′ and 5′ RNA binding sites have been described (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we were able to detect interaction of SFTSV L protein with the conserved termini of all three genomic RNA segments (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). To avoid RNA degradation during the experiment we used an endonuclease active site mutant (D112A) of the L protein. The migration behaviour of the protein–RNA complex in the native gel was different depending on whether 3′ or 5′ termini were bound (compare Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, right and left panel) indicating that 3′ and 5′ RNA binding induces distinct conformational states of the L protein. The migration behaviour of the complexes is consistent with previous findings on the LASV L protein (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Interestingly, for the S segment, two different sequences of the conserved termini are published which differ from each other by an insertion/deletion of an A at position 9, counting from the 5′ end (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We found that both versions bind to the L protein with comparable affinities (
