<p>Binding of a capped primer to the CBD of the L protein could lead to endonuclease cleavage products of specific length depending on the distance between the CBD and the endonuclease active site. Therefore, we tested for cap-dependent endonuclease activity using poly-A RNA with either cap0 (m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP), cap1 (m
 <sup>7</sup>GpppNm) or no cap at the 5′ end but did not detect any specific cleavage product (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15B</xref>). In summary, we provided evidence that residues 1695–1810 form a functional CBD within SFTSV L protein that is structurally similar to RVFV and influenza virus CBD, but were unable to demonstrate any cap-dependent polymerase activity of the full-length L protein. It remains unclear what activates the cap-binding function of the full-length L protein. Interaction with host factors or the viral nucleoprotein might be necessary for the L protein to switch to transcription mode (

 <sup>7</sup>GTP binding to the CBD
