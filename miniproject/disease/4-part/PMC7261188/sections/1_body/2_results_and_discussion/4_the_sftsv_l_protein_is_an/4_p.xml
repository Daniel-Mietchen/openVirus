<p>The product detected in our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> primer-independent genome replication reactions was larger than expected. This has previously been observed for LASV in i
 <italic>n</italic> vitro polymerase assays (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It was argued that this could be due to missing termination signals as the assay contains only physically separated short promoter strands of 20 nt rather than the continuous RNA genome comprising all necessary 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting signals (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Another possibility is that the template and the completely complementary product form very stable RNA duplexes, which are not separated even by the denaturing PAGE conditions used. We tested this hypothesis using perfectly complementary 20 nt RNAs that were fluorescently labelled instead of radioactively labelled, and performed denaturing PAGE at either 20°C (as usually done) or higher temperatures (60°C). Indeed, we were unable to separate the RNA duplex at electrophoresis temperatures of 20°C even though samples were heated to 95°C and supplemented with denaturing loading buffer prior to denaturing PAGE, whereas at 60°C we detected the RNA at the expected size (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12B</xref>). Therefore, we can explain the large size of our products in the assays by the difficulty to separate perfectly complementary RNA, a product that cannot be avoided when investigating viral genome replication. However, this does not compromise the specificity of our assay.
