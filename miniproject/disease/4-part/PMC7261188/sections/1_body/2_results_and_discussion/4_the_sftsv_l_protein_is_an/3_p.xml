<p>As already described for other polymerases (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), the enzymatic activity was also dependent on divalent metal ions. SFTSV RdRp displayed strong activity in the presence of magnesium ions with an activity plateau reached at Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations of &gt;2 mM (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), which is similar to what has been reported for LASV RdRp and manganese ion concentrations (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The presence of 5 mM Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, nucleotides and both 3′ and 5′ promoter RNA was defined as the standard reaction conditions for 
 <italic>de novo</italic> replication by SFTSV L protein and resulted in a single and strong product band after 60 min incubation at 30°C (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In the presence of manganese ions, the RdRp activity was also detectable. However, with higher Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations (&gt;1 mM) the product band got more diffuse resulting either from digestion by the endonuclease (stimulated by the high concentration of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>) or from less accurate replication initiation by the RdRp. For arenaviruses, the RdRp activity was greatly enhanced when the 5′ end had a single nucleotide G-overhang compared to the complementary 3′ promoter template strand (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), originating from a prime-and-realign mechanism for genome replication. The reason for this enhancing effect was speculated to result from either improved promoter binding or effects on the secondary structure of the 5′ hook. However, such an enhancing effect was not observed for SFTSV L protein (
