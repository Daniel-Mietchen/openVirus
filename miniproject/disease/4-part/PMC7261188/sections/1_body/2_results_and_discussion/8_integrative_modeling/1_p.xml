<p>We used the pure, monodisperse and monomeric full-length SFTSV L protein to perform SAXS experiments and obtain a low-resolution structure of the L protein in solution (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S16A</xref>). Three representative SAXS models were obtained by clustering analysis of forty 
 <italic>ab initio</italic> dummy atom models and averaging of the structures within each of the three biggest clusters. All three models feature a compact core domain with a hollow center that is decorated with at least one protruding sub-domain (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S16B</xref>), as observed for LASV L protein previously (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, the three SAXS models differ slightly in the size and location of a second protrusion from the core domain. We used these SAXS models for integrative modelling of an SFTSV L protein containing the described incomplete SFTSV cryo-EM structure (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S17</xref>). The cryo-EM map overall fits the SAXS envelopes, to the exception of the volume of the endonuclease domain (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, dashed circle) indicating mobility of this domain relative to the polymerase core in solution. As mentioned above, the endonuclease domain structure was added to the model by rigid-body fitting of the recently published crystal structure of the isolated domain (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). As our model of the L protein core region and the endonuclease crystal structure overlap within 14 residues, we were able to connect these two structures and include the endonuclease in our final model. These overlapping 14 residues form a helix, which has been demonstrated to be very flexible in its position relative to the endonuclease core, suggesting a role in regulation of the endonuclease activity by controlling access to the active site (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The structural data presented here suggest classification of this flexible helix as the endonuclease-polymerase linker region (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>). In the SFTSV apo-L structure, this linker is in an extended conformation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). However, it is conceivable that the linker can also be present in a more collapsed conformation as observed in LACV and influenza virus polymerase proteins, depending on the functional state of the L protein, which would be compatible with the hypothesized function in endonuclease activity control. Indeed, in the integrated model, it is conceivable that the endonuclease domain can rotate relative to the polymerase core and thereby fill the larger protrusion of the SAXS envelope (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In that state, the part of the endonuclease denoted as additional β-sheet in phenuivirus endonucleases, which was predicted to play a role in protein-protein interactions (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), could make contacts to the polymerase core or unresolved C-terminal region (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).
