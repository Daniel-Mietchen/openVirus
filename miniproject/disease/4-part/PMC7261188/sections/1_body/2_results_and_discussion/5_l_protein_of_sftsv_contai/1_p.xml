<p>We tested the SFTSV full-length L protein for endonuclease activity using a ribonuclease assay with a radiolabeled 40mer ssRNA substrate. Substrate degradation in the presence of different divalent metal ions was detected by denaturing PAGE and autoradiography. We found that the endonuclease in SFTSV L protein was active in presence of either manganese or magnesium ions, but not calcium ions (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Residual activity was also detected when zinc, nickel and cobalt ions were added to the reaction (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). As a negative control, we expressed a full-length L protein with a mutation in the endonuclease active site (D112A). Contrary to previous findings on the isolated endonuclease domains of SFTSV and TOSV with mutations of the active site (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), the full-length D112A L protein mutant showed some residual RNA degradation activity in the endonuclease assay. We hence added either EDTA or the known endonuclease-specific inhibitor DPBA (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) to our negative controls (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).
