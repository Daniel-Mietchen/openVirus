<p>RNA oligonucleotides (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were chemically synthesized (Biomers) and 3′ labeled with T4 RNA ligase (Thermo Fisher) and pCp-Cy3 (Jena Bioscience). Labeled RNA substrates were subsequently separated from excess pCp-Cy3 by ethanol precipitation. RNA was mixed in 1:1 ratio in 100 mM HEPES(NaOH) pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.5 U/μl RNasin (Promega), 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin and incubated at 30°C for 30 min before an equal volume of RNA loading buffer (98% formamide, 18 mM EDTA, 0.025 mM SDS) was added. The samples were heated at 95°C for 3 min before separation on denaturing 7 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide Tris–borate–EDTA gels and 0.5-fold Tris–borate buffer.
