 <sup>32</sup>P-GTP. Labeled RNA substrates were subsequently separated from unincorporated [γ]
 <sup>32</sup>P using Microspin G25 columns (GE Healthcare) or ethanol precipitation. RNA was heated for 3 min at 95°C and cooled down on ice to give single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Reactions containing 0–14 pmol L protein and 2 pmol 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labelled ssRNA were set up in 10 μl binding buffer (50 mM HEPES(NaOH) pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg/μl Poly(C) RNA (Sigma), 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin and 0.5 U/μl RNasin (Promega)). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the products were separated by native gel electrophoresis using 6% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels and Tris-glycine buffer on ice. Signals were visualized by phosphor screen autoradiography using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare) and quantified using ImageJ software (
