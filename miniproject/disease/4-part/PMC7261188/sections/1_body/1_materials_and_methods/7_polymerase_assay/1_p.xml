<p>If not indicated otherwise, 5 pmol L protein were pre-incubated for 15 min with 6 pmol of 5′ promoter ssRNA (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES(NaOH) pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.5 U/μl RNasin (Promega), 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin). Subsequently, 6 pmol of 3′ promoter ssRNA (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and NTPs (0.8 mM UTP/ATP/CTP and 0.5 mM GTP supplemented with 5 μCi [α]
 <sup>32</sup>P-GTP) were added to a final reaction volume of 10 μl. After 1 h at 30°C the reaction was stopped by adding an equivalent volume of RNA loading buffer (98% formamide, 18 mM EDTA, 0.025 mM SDS, xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue) and heating the sample for 5 min at 98°C. Products were separated by electrophoresis on denaturing 7 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide Tris–borate–EDTA gels in 0.5-fold Tris–borate buffer. Signals were visualized by phosphor screen autoradiography using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). For primer extension assays, 2.5 nmol RNA oligonucleotides were 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled with 6.6 pmol [α]
 <sup>32</sup>P-GTP (10 μCi) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Thermo Fisher) in a final volume of 20 μl standard reaction buffer. Reactions were stopped by heating to 95°C for 15 min. Primer extension assays were carried out as described for the standard polymerase reaction except 125 pmol of 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled primer was used for each reaction instead of [α]
 <sup>32</sup>P-GTP.
