<p>SFTSV CBD crystals grew within 14 days after mixing of one part SFTSV CBD at 18.6 mg/ml protein concentration supplemented with 4 mM m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP in 50 mM Na-phosphate pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol with two parts of 7% (v/v) 2-Butanol, 150 mM MES pH 6.0 and 27.4% PEG 4000 in a sitting drop vapor diffusion setup at 20°C. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen without cryo protectants and datasets were obtained at beamline P14 of PETRA III at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany. Datasets were processed with XDS (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and the SFTSV CBD structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and the RVFV CBD (PDB: 6QHG) monomer without the β-hairpin and loops as an input model. The structure was refined by iterative cycles of manual model building in Coot (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and computational optimization with PHENIX (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Visualization of structural data was done using either the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7 Schrödinger, LLC or UCSF Chimera (
