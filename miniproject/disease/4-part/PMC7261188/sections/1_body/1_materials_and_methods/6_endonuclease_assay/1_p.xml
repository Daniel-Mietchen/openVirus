<p>Poly-A RNA 27mer and 40mer were chemically synthesized (Biomers) and 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Thermo Fisher) or ScriptCap m7G Capping System (CellScript). RNA substrates were subsequently purified with a Microspin G25 column (GE Healthcare). Reactions containing 2.5 pmol protein and 3 pmol 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNA were carried out in a volume of 10 μl with 0.5 U/μl RNasin (Promega), 100 mM HEPES(NaOH) pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, divalent cations as indicated in the figure legends and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding an equivalent volume of RNA loading buffer (98% formamide, 18 mM EDTA, 0.025 mM SDS, xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue) and heating the samples at 95°C for 3 min. Products were separated by electrophoresis on denaturing 7 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide Tris–borate–EDTA gels in 0.5-fold Tris–borate buffer. Signals were visualized by phosphor screen autoradiography using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare).
