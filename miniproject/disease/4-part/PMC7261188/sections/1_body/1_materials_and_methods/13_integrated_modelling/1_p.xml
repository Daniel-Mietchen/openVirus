<p>The SAXS envelopes of SFTSV L protein were visualized using molmap within UCSF Chimera (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) at 15 Å resolution and the SFTSV L protein 3D EM map A was low-pass filtered to 5 Å to smoothen the volume. After filtering, the flexible C-terminal region became visible in the 3D EM map A, which was subsequently used to guide the initial fitting into the SAXS envelope, and further refined with the ‘fit in map’ function of Chimera. The atomic model for SFTSV apo-L was fit into the 3D EM map A.
