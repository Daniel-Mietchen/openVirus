The pluviometric indexes of T1 and T2 presented a similar monthly distribution pattern with peaks between May and August and total amount of rainfall (T1 = 2316 mm³, T2 = 2450 mm³). When the data is analysed throughout the year, a relationship between the rainfall pattern and monthly density of eggs can be observed in T1 (
