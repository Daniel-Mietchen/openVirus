 <italic>The spread of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus</italic> - This evaluation for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> identification was based on a total of 8133 adults obtained from the eggs collected in s-ovt from four assessments, two performed during T1, and two during T2. The overall analysis shows that 70.7% and 29.3% of them were recorded as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, respectively (
 <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>). Both species were found in all four sampling assessments performed for this purpose, with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> being predominant (68-85%) in the three first assessments, while the last survey showed a similar abundance (~50%) of both species. Data from this last assessment indicated that fluctuations in the composition of these two species that were collected in the very same stations in this area can take place in short period of time, since there is only a nine month-interval between the assessments (February and December 2013), but the reason behind this change could not be detected.
