 <italic>Statistical analysis</italic> - The comparative analysis of the total egg count distribution for each period was performed using box plots, and the significance between these totals was calculated using the Wilcoxon test. The monthly distribution of egg averages by sampling station for each year was also plotted. A spatial smooth kernel density estimator (KDE)

 <italic>Aedes</italic> density. Although the KDE is a simple method for analysing focal behavioural patterns, it does so by estimating the intensity of the point process throughout the study region. The KDE parameters were a quadratic function of the KDE kernel with a bandwidth of 120 m. The same grid and colour definitions were applied to all cycles to compare results across time. Analyses were performed using TerraView (www.dpi.inpe.br/terraview), an open Geographic Information System (GIS) application.
