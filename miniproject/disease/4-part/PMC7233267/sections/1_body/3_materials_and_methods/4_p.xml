 <italic>Aedes species identification</italic> - With the purpose to investigate the presence and relative abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the study area, egg samples from 15 s-ovt were analysed twice a year in T1 (May and December 2005) and from 59 s-ovts during T2 (February and December 2013). For this specific investigation, the s-ovt were set without Bti treatment and, after seven days, the paddles were recovered and sent to the laboratory for egg counting. Subsequently the paddles were immersed in water containing grass infusion (5%) to stimulate hatching of first instar larvae (L1) and then transferred to plastic trays with water (4 L) and cat food (Friskies
 <sup>Â®</sup>). Those larvae were reared to adult stage for species taxonomic classification. Larvae from each s-ovt were placed in one identified tray to record the distribution of the identified species.
