<p>The infestation pattern of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> population should also be analysed in the light of the arbovirus transmission dataset. According to the epidemiological bulletins of Recife, arbovirus cases in SÃ­tio dos Pintos residents have been confirmed in 10 of the 15 years between 2005 and 2014 (excepting 2007 and 2009) and the greatest number of cases reported were in 2005 (10), 2006 (12), 2008 (42), 2010 (3), 2011 (1), 2012 (8), 2013 (10), 2014 (9) and 2015 (3). This indicates that the decrease in the vector population size observed in 2013 in that area was not enough to prevent arbovirus transmission in the same and in the subsequent years, although PNCD control actions continue to be carried out until the present.
