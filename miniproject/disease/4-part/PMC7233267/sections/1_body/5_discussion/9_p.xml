 <italic>In conclusion</italic> - Populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have been stably established in the SÃ­tio dos Pintos neighbourhood whose occupation in the urban space is characterised by the continuous presence of a reproductively active vector population in most houses throughout two years analysed. Vector control actions performed in the scope of the National Program of Dengue Control have not a substantial impact in the pattern of infestation found in the years of 2005 and 2013 and, although the absolute number of eggs recorded in 2013 was lower, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation is still high and well spread. The present study demonstrated the robustness of the spatial occupation and permanence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations in endemic urban areas, indicates the need to adopt complementary methodologies to improve the surveillance and control of these species.
