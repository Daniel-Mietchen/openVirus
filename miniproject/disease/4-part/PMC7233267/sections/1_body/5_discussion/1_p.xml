<p>The pattern of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation in SÃ­tio dos Pintos neighbourhood from Recife city was assessed during two independent 12-month periods (2005-T1, 2013-T2) and showed major similar features: (i) the detection of egg-laying females in most houses (OPI &gt; 90%); (ii) the presence of a reproductively active population in all months of the year and (iii) the heterogeneous distribution of the population density in all months, but with some sub-areas of persistently higher concentrations. Although the size of the mosquito population in T2, as recorded by the total number of eggs from the ovitrap network, was approximately half that in T1, the ovitrap positivity index continue to be near 100% (96.6-100), which corroborate the permanent occupation of this territory by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations. In addition egg abundance, and density recorded throughout T2 are expressive and corroborates the maintenance of a high infestation level seem in T1.
