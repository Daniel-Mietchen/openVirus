<p>Therefore the results from the present study corroborate previous data from Santa Cruz do Capibaribe city (SCC), a municipality from Pernambuco State in Brazil,

 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations can be well established in urban areas, despite the PNCD actions. In SCC, for instance, a continuous network of s-ovt recorded a widespread 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> infestation with a 97-100% trap positivity and an estimated average of 1587 (67-6027) eggs/trap/month in 2008-2009,

On the other hand, after a two-year trial that employed additional intensive control interventions targeting eggs, larvae and adults, a significant level of control with a 90% decrease in the egg density was finally achieved in that city.

 </xref> This trial proved that a marked reduction in the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> population could be achieved when suitable, intensive and sustained control measures were adopted and maintained in order to result in the significant mass elimination of eggs/larvae detected in SCC city. These results provide practical evidence of Schofieldâ€™s claim
