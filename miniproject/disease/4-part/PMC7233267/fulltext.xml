<sup>3</sup>
</xref> In the Americas, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is considered the primary vector of the dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), Yellow Fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV).<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Dengue was reintroduced in Brazil in 1981-1982 and was associated to serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-4.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> A wide-ranging National Program for Dengue Control (PNCD) was established in 1996 and currently operates in more than 5,000 Brazilian municipalities.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> The PNCD actions for monitoring and controlling the vector are based on the estimated number of infested houses using a visual search for larvae-pupae in household breeding grounds, bimonthly applications of larvicides throughout the year in water containers, campaigns to eliminate larval breeding sources and sporadic focal adulticide spraying in cases of active viral transmission.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> Within the last decades, the country experienced four major epidemics, associated with the predominant viral serotype DENV-1, DENV-3, DENV-2, and DENV-4 in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2010, respectively.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> In the past years, dengue epidemics have been caused by the circulation of more than one serotype. In 2015, states from the northeast of Brazil reported the first outbreaks of ZIKV and CHIKV infections.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> One of the major challenges for the surveillance and control of <italic>Aedes</italic> species in the scope of PNCD is the limitation of the index employed to perform the surveillance of this species in urban areas.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> Those are based on the percentage of houses infested with larvae and/or pupae (House index) and the number of containers/reservoirs found positive for them per a set of 100 houses inspected (Breteau index).<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> However, these metrics have shown low levels of infestation or even negative results in areas where <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is present in 60% to 90% of the surveyed houses.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> A more sensitive method for the large-scale sampling of <italic>Aedes</italic> species must be adopted to evaluate the abundance and impact of vector control strategies.</p><p>In fact, the complexity of the contemporary urban environments suggests the need to develop new surveillance tools to replace the current methods, which date back to 80 years ago. A tool commonly used to monitor and control <italic>Aedes</italic> is the oviposition traps or ovitraps,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">

<italic>Ovitrap surveillance network</italic> - <italic>Ae. aegypi</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations from S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos were assessed for 12 months in 2013, and the data were then compared with partially published results from this same location in 2005.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">

<italic>Ovitrap management</italic> - A modified model of a previously described ovitrap<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref> was used for sampling <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs. These s-ovt were designed to remain safe and functional in the field for collecting eggs for a 30-day period.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> Ovitraps were set outdoor, one meter above the soil, in places protected from sun exposure and rainfall. They consist of a black plastic cups filled with water (1.5 L) and two wooden paddles (5 x 15 cm), used as oviposition substrates, vertically fixed to the inner wall of the cup. All s-ovts used to monitoring eggs density were treated with a commercial Bti-based larvicide (VectoBac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> WG, 6 drops/trap or ~4.8 mg/L), to prevent larvae development, and protect the ovitraps to become a breeding site, since they were set for a 30-day period. The s-ovt were set in January 2013 and kept continuously for 12 months. Monthly, the s-ovt were inspected to replace water, add Bti and news paddles, as performed in T1.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> Labelled paddles collected every month from the s-ovt were transferred to the laboratory and air-dried at room temperature (26&#x000ba;C). The egg number was recorded under stereoscopic microscope based on all eggs from the paddle, including hatched and non-hatched ones.</p><p>
<italic>Aedes species identification</italic> - With the purpose to investigate the presence and relative abundance of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the study area, egg samples from 15 s-ovt were analysed twice a year in T1 (May and December 2005) and from 59 s-ovts during T2 (February and December 2013). For this specific investigation, the s-ovt were set without Bti treatment and, after seven days, the paddles were recovered and sent to the laboratory for egg counting. Subsequently the paddles were immersed in water containing grass infusion (5%) to stimulate hatching of first instar larvae (L1) and then transferred to plastic trays with water (4 L) and cat food (Friskies<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). Those larvae were reared to adult stage for species taxonomic classification. Larvae from each s-ovt were placed in one identified tray to record the distribution of the identified species.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref> This procedure was repeated for two consecutive weeks for each month/year, after that the s-ovts were treated with Bti, as performed during the whole study.</p><p>
<italic>Climatic data</italic> - Historical climatic data for Recife, according to the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET),<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> show an average annual rainfall of 2200 mm&#x000b3; which is more frequent and intense between February and August. During T1, the rainfall was 2316 mm&#x000b3; with monthly variations from 8.7 to 709 mm&#x000b3;, the mean monthly temperature varied from 21&#x000ba;C to 32&#x000ba;C, and the relative air humidity varied from 70 to 87%. T2 showed total annual rainfall of 2450 mm&#x000b3; varying from 47.7 to 491.4 mm&#x000b3; from month to month while the mean monthly temperatures and relative air humidity were similar to those of T1.</p><p>
<italic>Statistical analysis</italic> - The comparative analysis of the total egg count distribution for each period was performed using box plots, and the significance between these totals was calculated using the Wilcoxon test. The monthly distribution of egg averages by sampling station for each year was also plotted. A spatial smooth kernel density estimator (KDE)<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref> was used to produce surface maps of eggs collected in the s-ovt network over successive counting cycles to identify hot spots of <italic>Aedes</italic> density. Although the KDE is a simple method for analysing focal behavioural patterns, it does so by estimating the intensity of the point process throughout the study region. The KDE parameters were a quadratic function of the KDE kernel with a bandwidth of 120 m. The same grid and colour definitions were applied to all cycles to compare results across time. Analyses were performed using TerraView (www.dpi.inpe.br/terraview), an open Geographic Information System (GIS) application.</p><p>

<italic>Infestation by Aedes spp</italic> - In order to evaluate the density and spread of <italic>Aede</italic>s in the study area, a network of 59 s-ovt installed in the same sampling stations during two 12-month cycles corresponding to the years 2005 (T1) and 2013 (T2) was set. The goal of this network of s-ovt was to record egg density for surveillance purpose only, and the same set of 59 s-ovt were used to obtain data from both years analysed.

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The pattern of <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation in S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos neighbourhood from Recife city was assessed during two independent 12-month periods (2005-T1, 2013-T2) and showed major similar features: (i) the detection of egg-laying females in most houses (OPI &#x0003e; 90%); (ii) the presence of a reproductively active population in all months of the year and (iii) the heterogeneous distribution of the population density in all months, but with some sub-areas of persistently higher concentrations. Although the size of the mosquito population in T2, as recorded by the total number of eggs from the ovitrap network, was approximately half that in T1, the ovitrap positivity index continue to be near 100% (96.6-100), which corroborate the permanent occupation of this territory by <italic>Aedes</italic> populations. In addition egg abundance, and density recorded throughout T2 are expressive and corroborates the maintenance of a high infestation level seem in T1.</p><p>The monitoring of the <italic>Aedes</italic> population carried out in T1 was part of a broader study conducted in six neighbourhoods of Recife, representing distinct geographical situations and scenarios of urban occupation.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> In these areas previously assessed, the characteristics of <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation were similar to those from the present study, despite the substantial environmental and socio-economic differences among the neighbourhoods surveyed.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos, in particular, showed a geographical infestation pattern that showed only discrete alterations in both assessments conducted in T1 and T2, as seem by the data collected by the same ovitrap network used to investigate those periods. Longitudinal studies using this ovitrap network, named &#x0201c;Sistema de Monitoramento e Controle Populacional de <italic>Aedes</italic>&#x0201d; (SMCP-<italic>Aedes</italic>), in other municipalities from Brazil also showed a pattern of permanence of spatial occupation by <italic>Aedes</italic> populations. This pattern was found at urban sites with mosquito populations of contrasting densities such as in Fernando de Noronha Island a low density site<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref> and in the heavily infested neighbourhoods of Bras&#x000ed;lia Teimosa and Engenho do Meio, from Recife city.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Another important aspect to raise is that the permanent and high level of infestation of <italic>Aedes</italic> in such territories, as S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos, was detected over almost a decade of systematic municipal control programme actions in the scope of the PNCD. This program preconises six cycles of larvicide application per year, in addition to mechanical actions to eliminate breeding sites in the households.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>10</sup>
</xref> Although the total number of eggs recorded in S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos in T2 was lower compared to T1, it is not possible to conclude if this was only a consequence of the PNCD actions and/or from other factors as, for instance, natural fluctuations of population density that could occur throughout the years. Longitudinal entomological studies could clarify the amplitude of such variations throughout the years, however, those are not available for this study area.</p><p>Therefore the results from the present study corroborate previous data from Santa Cruz do Capibaribe city (SCC), a municipality from Pernambuco State in Brazil,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref> which indicated that <italic>Aedes</italic> populations can be well established in urban areas, despite the PNCD actions. In SCC, for instance, a continuous network of s-ovt recorded a widespread <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> infestation with a 97-100% trap positivity and an estimated average of 1587 (67-6027) eggs/trap/month in 2008-2009,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref> after one decade of PNCD control actions in this city.

</xref> This trial proved that a marked reduction in the <italic>Aedes</italic> population could be achieved when suitable, intensive and sustained control measures were adopted and maintained in order to result in the significant mass elimination of eggs/larvae detected in SCC city.

Retrieved 07-05-2019), while the OPI shown by our study was close to 100%.

</p><p>The infestation pattern of <italic>Aedes</italic> population should also be analysed in the light of the arbovirus transmission dataset. According to the epidemiological bulletins of Recife, arbovirus cases in S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos residents have been confirmed in 10 of the 15 years between 2005 and 2014 (excepting 2007 and 2009) and the greatest number of cases reported were in 2005 (10), 2006 (12), 2008 (42), 2010 (3), 2011 (1), 2012 (8), 2013 (10), 2014 (9) and 2015 (3). This indicates that the decrease in the vector population size observed in 2013 in that area was not enough to prevent arbovirus transmission in the same and in the subsequent years, although PNCD control actions continue to be carried out until the present.</p><p>Recife had its first dengue epidemic in 1987, and from 1995 to the present, there has been a prolonged period of annual transmission of the virus with severe outbreaks. The introduction of CHIKV in 2014 and ZIKV in 2015, worsened the epidemiological situation and the pattern of mosquito infestation in many areas of Recife city, including S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos, allowing the transmission of arboviruses at important levels. In 2019, up to the 52nd epidemiological week (December) 61.451 dengue, 8.467 Chikungunya and 3.827 Zika notified cases were reported in Recife, and this virus transmission has always been attributed to <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>

</p><p>Besides that, the presence of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Brazil was first recorded in 1986 in Rio de Janeiro,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref> while in Recife it was detected only after 1996, within PNCD larval surveillance. Its first notification in a silvatic area was in a remnant of the Atlantic Forest<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> closely located to S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos, our study area. The present study showed a widespread population of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, in this neighbourhood whose eggs were found in 67% of s-ovts in T1 and 75% in T2. In those same samples, most s-ovts were colonised by both species demonstrating their co-occupation of the environment and the potential colonisation of the same oviposition sites in that area. Moreover, no difference was observed in the relative abundance of <italic>Aedes</italic> species in the samples collected eight years later, when ~70% of the eggs were laid by <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and ~30% by <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Dataset showed that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> coexist in the same physical space in an area of ongoing human population expansion with vegetation spots that displays both urban and rural characteristics, and our dataset from two independent moments do not provide evidence of the displacement of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> by <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Therefore, their populations are not concentrated in clearly distinct territories, as it has been observed in other studies which showed <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was associated with more vegetation and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in urban sprawl,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> and S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos area could be under transition. The high percentage of traps simultaneously containing eggs of both species appears to indicate a process of continuous dispersion and naturally occupying the breeding sites available in the environment, as expected from invasive species.</p><p>
<italic>In conclusion</italic> - Populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have been stably established in the S&#x000ed;tio dos Pintos neighbourhood whose occupation in the urban space is characterised by the continuous presence of a reproductively active vector population in most houses throughout two years analysed. Vector control actions performed in the scope of the National Program of Dengue Control have not a substantial impact in the pattern of infestation found in the years of 2005 and 2013 and, although the absolute number of eggs recorded in 2013 was lower, <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation is still high and well spread. The present study demonstrated the robustness of the spatial occupation and permanence of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations in endemic urban areas, indicates the need to adopt complementary methodologies to improve the surveillance and control of these species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>To the insectary team at Instituto Aggeu Magalh&#x000e3;es &#x02015; FIOCRUZ, for technical support, the field team for assistance in the field and the Secretary of Health of Recife, Brazil.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn1"><p>Financial support: This study received funds from the Brazilian Swiss Joint Research Programme (Grant no.
