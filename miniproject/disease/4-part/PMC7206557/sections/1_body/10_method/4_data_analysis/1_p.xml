 <xref rid="bibr28-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Parker’s (1992)</xref> guidelines for analysis. Keywords and phrases in the reports were subjected to a process of free association. In other words, shared social meanings were listed by free associating to words and phrases, but which were relevant to the research question. This led to describing how the Ebola virus/disease was understood in the texts, making way for identifying discourses or the ways in which the disease/virus was constructed. Both researchers critically reflected on the meanings arising from associations to ascertain if they contained unduly idiosyncratic or overpersonalised projections, and they validated each others’ inputs throughout analysis. Simply, they discussed associations and reached consensus by focusing on the relevance of meanings to the research question. Because the meanings arose from the social worlds and culturally consensual realities of the researchers as South Africans who wished to interrogate the representations of diseases, but who were also often sympathetic to African disasters and human loss, they acknowledge that, in line with discursive practice, their shared subjectivities are instrumental in making interpretations following a poststructuralist approach as opposed to aiming for an objectivist and realist encounter with the texts.
