<p>The keyword search identified 145 articles in full text (pdf) format. After reading all articles, a manual search excluded those that did not relate directly to the Ebola virus. We removed 34 articles because they did not discuss the Ebola virus itself. The excluded articles either addressed the management of the epidemic or did not refer to explicit cultural representations of the virus. We were interested in how the disease itself had taken on a particular social and metaphorical reality.</p>
