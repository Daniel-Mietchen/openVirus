<p>We typed in the keywords ‘EBOLA’ and ‘SOUTH AFRICA’ into the online news database South African Bibliographic and Information Network (Sabinet), where South African newspaper articles are archived. The date range was restricted from March 2014, the date when the WHO officially announced the Ebola outbreak, to June 2015. June was chosen as the end-date because that was when data analysis commenced, despite the ongoing occurrence of Ebola beyond this date. Even so, news coverage of Ebola became saturated and tailed off in November 2014.</p>
