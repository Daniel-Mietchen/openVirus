<p>Common images about social, psychological, and national threats have been used in Ebola discourse. Predominantly, the Ebola virus, based on the outbreaks occurring until 2001, was subjected to a rhetorical construction of predation (

Weldon argued that, in comparison to other deadly viruses, Ebola does not kill millions of people and representations of the epidemic were based on misperceptions and, specifically, on predation images derived from a 1994 text,

 <xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon’s (2001a)</xref> analysis of the predatory discourse showed that ‘the issue with Ebola involves a rhetorical construction, in addition to a social construction’ (p. 8). The discursive construction of Ebola functioned to detract responsibility from the problem of compromised medical practice for managing Ebola. This shift, through personifying the virus that led to fear being elicited by this construction, removed focus away from the poor health systems and practices of the affected areas. Movies and books, which capitalised on this image at that time, further shifted agency away from humans responsible for the spread (

In other words, governmental systems and human agency threatened the broader-accepted belief system that Western medicine was infallible. As one epidemiologist and microbiologist also pointed out, the clinical picture presented in Preston’s book is inaccurate (
