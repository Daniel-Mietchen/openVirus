<p id="p0135">Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an RNA virus with eight currently described genotypes, five of which can infect humans (genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7).

 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">58a.</xref> Genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to higher primates and humans and are associated with epidemic outbreaks and an oral-faecal transmission mode, while genotypes 3-8 show a broad mammalian phylogenetic reservoir including pigs, boar, deer, rodents, ferrets, bats, cattle, sheep, foxes, dromedary camels and horses and cause zoonotic, autochthonous (i.e., acquired regionally) infections, typically through poorly or undercooked meat.

 <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">58c.</xref> HEV has caused epidemics in Asia and has also been found in Africa, North and South America and Europe. Infections with genotypes 1 and 2 resulted in an estimated &gt;3 million symptomatic cases and 70,000 fatalities in endemic regions in 2005.
