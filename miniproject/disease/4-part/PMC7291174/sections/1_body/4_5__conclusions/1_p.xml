<p>This study provides an up-to-date catalogue of the 
 <italic>Culicidae</italic> fauna along a transect of levels of urbanisation and identifies the potential mosquito vectors that may be involved in arbovirus transmission in the West region of Cameroon. Given their presence in at least two habitats, 
 <italic>Ae. africanus, Cx moucheti, Culex (Culiciomyia</italic>), 
 <italic>Cx. duttoni</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have the potential to act as bridge vectors that can transmit arboviruses from rural to urban areas. The persistence of mosquito species during the dry season suggests the possibility of year-round transmission of arboviruses in the area. Further research is required to assess the prevalence of arboviruses in these areas and to study the arboviral vectorial capacity of these mosquito species as well as to assess their anthropophilic and zoophilic feeding behaviours through blood-meal source identification.
