<p>From a recent metadata study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and a serological study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the ratio 
 <italic>ρ</italic> of GBS to symptomatic ZIKV cases was found to be 0.00024 and 0.00032 respectively (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Introduction</xref> of this study). Similarly, based on the data from eleven countries, Mier-y-Teran-Romero 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found the overall estimate for the risk of reported GBS “was 2.0 (95% CI 0.5-4.5) GBS reported cases per 10,000 ZIKV infections, i.e., 0.02%, (which is) close to the point estimate of 2.4 GBS cases per 10,000 ZIKV, i.e., 0.024%, infections estimated using only data from French Polynesia.” In this study, the model estimation finds a ratio between GBS and symptomatic ZIKV cases as 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.000061 or equivalently 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.0061% with 95% CI 0.0050%-0.0086%. That is, 1 GBS case per 16,400 ZIKV symptomatic cases which is approximately one quarter or 25% the magnitude of existing estimates. Our estimate, although still tentative and based on reasonable first approximations, seems plausible since ZIKV surveillance was generally unreliable and probably severely under-reported, especially before 2016 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For this reason, we avoided using the ZIKV surveillance data to fit the epidemic model, and our estimate of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> depends on the more reliable GBS data.
