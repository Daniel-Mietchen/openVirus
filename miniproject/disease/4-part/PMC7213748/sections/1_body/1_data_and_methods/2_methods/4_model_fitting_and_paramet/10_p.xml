<p>The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is employed as a criterion for model comparison, and quantifies the trade-off between the goodness-of-fit of a model and its complexity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The simulations were conducted by deploying the Euler-multinomial integration method with the time-step fixed to one day [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Since a plug-and-play inference framework has been adopted, our model (simulation scheme) includes both demographic noise (Euler-multinomial type) and measurement noise (negative binomial). The deterministic model we analyse in the main results is the mean field model of the stochastic version. The inference scheme which infers model parameters, requires that the underlying model is stochastic, which is the case here. The
