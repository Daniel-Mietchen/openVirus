<p>Bellan (2010) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] argued that the mosquito lifespan is 30 days on average but under control and/or age dependent mortality the lifespan is much shorter. For this reason Kraemer et al (2017) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] implemented a mosquito lifespan of average 7 days but with a maximum of 30 days. However, according to the results of Bellan (2010) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] this would correspond to a high level of mosquito control or age-dependence. We believe a more appropriate (less extreme) choice for the NE Brazil context would correspond to an average 14 day mosquito lifespan.
