<p id="par0145">CNS infections are challenging syndromes to diagnose and treat, even in the most highly resourced centers (

 <xref rid="bib0810" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>). While the analysis of brain biopsy material is the gold standard, it is not possible in most cases. Aetiological diagnosis usually involves an invasive lumbar puncture (LP) to obtain CSF, which in turn requires the appropriate clinical skills, infrastructure, and patient acceptability. Diagnostic assays are frequently difficult to interpret, may demonstrate poor accuracy and poor discrimination between previous vaccination or non-neurological JEV infection (
