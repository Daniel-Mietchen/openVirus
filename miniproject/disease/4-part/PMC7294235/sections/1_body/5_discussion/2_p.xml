<p id="par0115">Seroneutralization tests: Seroneutralization is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of infections due to pathogenic viruses such as JEV, but in the published literature cited here, it was only performed in approximately 16% (32/205) of studies as laboratory confirmation. This is probably because performing seroneutralization is technically demanding and requires sufficient volumes of serum/CSF to enable the inclusion of control viruses and duplicates of each titration. Since JEV is a human pathogen with high individual risk, seroneutralization has to be performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory, placing additional burdens on time, cost, and qualified personnel. Another potential complication may arise when sera from patients who have previously been exposed to JEV-related flaviviruses may contain higher titers against the closely related flaviviruses than against JEV (“doctrine of original antigenic sin”) (
