<p id="par0110">This review reveals that current JE diagnostic techniques are confined mainly to those with a low confidence level, i.e., anti-JEV IgM detected in serum samples, or in which reported results do not differentiate between detection of anti-JEV IgM in CSF and serum. There is no doubt that the introduction of IgM ELISA testing in serum samples represents real progress. However, we are now much better informed about the limitations of relying on this method of detection. We also acknowledge as a limitation that the studies included in this review were performed in different settings, with different constraints, financial limitations, and resources available. Nonetheless, we highlight the need for both an improvement in the accuracy of routine laboratory diagnostics, and also the development of point-of-care tests to confirm cases in JE endemic areas that frequently have no laboratory capacity. Below, we discuss the existing assays in more detail.</p>
