<p id="par0035">JE cases reported to WHO/UNICEF have significant limitations. For example, increased awareness of the disease and access to laboratory capacity may contribute to increased case reporting. Conversely, surveillance data are likely to represent only a small proportion of patients (
 <xref rid="bib0495" ref-type="bibr">Mâ€™Ikanatha et al., 2013</xref>). This is particularly relevant for JE, occurring predominantly in rural areas lacking diagnostic capacity (
 <xref rid="bib0785" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn and Hoke, 1992</xref>). There are no rapid or point-of-care tests for JE in clinical use (
 <xref rid="bib0685" ref-type="bibr">Sengvilaipaseuth et al., 2017</xref>), and the WHO recommended standard diagnostic assay is an ELISA test that requires trained professionals, appropriate resources, and several hours for the results of the tests to be obtained (

 <xref rid="bib0830" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2017b</xref>). Equally, there are problems of specificity of the most widely used diagnostic test, JE MAC-ELISA (
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Dubot-Peres et al., 2015</xref>). This is an increasing issue, with increasing endemicity of other flaviviruses and vaccination coverage.
