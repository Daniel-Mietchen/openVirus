<p id="par0040">The reasons for the persistence of JE as a public health problem are complex and multifactorial. A fundamental principle that must be kept in mind is that JE is a zoonotic infection; human immunization will never eradicate it in the natural environment and therefore sustained vaccination coverage is necessary. However, in countries that do have vaccination programs, they are not necessarily uniformly implemented nationwide, and in some areas, vaccine coverage is sub-optimal. While there are many reasons for inadequate coverage, this remains a neglected aspect of JE vaccination programs (
