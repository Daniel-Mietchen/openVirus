<p id="par0070">In the mid-twentieth century, investigation of the antigenic properties of JEV soon led to the development of serological assays, including complement fixation (

 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Clarke and Casals, 1958</xref>), and virus neutralization tests (

 <xref rid="bib0690" ref-type="bibr">Sever, 1962</xref>). Early reports of human infection in 1947 used a seroneutralization technique in which a patient sample was mixed with virus and inoculated into mice (

 <xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">Kuttner and Tsâ€™un, 1936</xref>). In 1941, Casals and Palacios published a report on the application of the complement fixation technique (
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Casals and Palacios, 1941b</xref>). The method was used for many years, although it was insensitive, particularly during the acute illness (
 <xref rid="bib0635" ref-type="bibr">Rose, 1992</xref>). In 1958, Clarke and Casals published a report on the application of the haemagglutination inhibition test (HI) (
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Clarke and Casals, 1958</xref>). The principle exploits the fact that JEV envelope protein agglutinates erythrocytes. Anti-JEV antibodies, developed following infection, bind to JEV protein and thus prevent erythrocyte agglutination, hence the term haemagglutination-inhibition. This remained the method of choice for JE diagnosis, by serological methods, for many years (

 <xref rid="bib0750" ref-type="bibr">Thisyakorn and Nimmannitya, 1985</xref>) and was subsequently adapted as a more convenient microtiter method (

 <xref rid="bib0690" ref-type="bibr">Sever, 1962</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">Gunakasem et al., 1981</xref>). However, limitations in the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were recognized by Clarke and Casals (
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Clarke and Casals, 1958</xref>). Moreover, the test relies on the combined paired results obtained from acute and convalescent serum samples, thus taking weeks for confirmation (
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al., 1987</xref>). Other serological methods, such as single-radial hemolysis (
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 1985</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">Duca et al., 1979</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">George and Pavri, 1986</xref>), were also introduced. However, inadequacies were readily acknowledged, and it was accepted practice to perform these tests in parallel with others, thus increasing the workload and extending the time for results to be obtained (

 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Cardosa et al., 1991</xref>).
