<p id="par0100">Molecular tests: Forty-one studies (25%) reported the use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR), of which 13 (68%) described the methods used or cited corresponding references. These targeted various regions of JEV genome, including the capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), envelope (E), non-structural (NS) proteins NS2A, NS3, NS5 and the untranslated regions (UTR). These studies reported the use of the conventional RT-PCR standard test, with nested or hemi-nested techniques, and real-time techniques (RT-qPCR) using hydrolysis probes or SYBR green. The studies reported the use of conventional RT-PCR either standard, with nested or hemi-nested techniques, and the real-time techniques (RT-qPCR) using hydrolysis probes or SYBR green. In total, 332 (1.7%) patients were positive when tested by RT-PCR.</p>
