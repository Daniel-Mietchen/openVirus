<p id="Par2">In an era when the “one health approach” is considered the right way to address public health issues, occupational health continues to look at biological agents as a minor issue compared to other agents, although the former include microorganisms capable of causing infections, allergies and/or toxicity to humans, and their presence in the workplace implying an increased risk to workers. Biological risk assessment is usually neglected by the occupational health professionals due to the lack of systematized information about the biological agents involved in many work activities. The publication 
 <italic>bias</italic> and a large amount of confounding factors don´t help the risk assessment activity although, since microorganisms are omnipresent in the environment, exposure to biological agents in various contexts is inevitable. The occupational safety professional is always facing gaps in hazard assessment of the risks, engendered by biological agents, such as: (i) lack of information on biohazards in the workplace; (ii) lack of training of workers; (iii) lack of maintenance of ventilation systems/air conditioning/water systems, and; (iv) lack of knowledge of combined effect of biological and chemical agents. When biological agents are introduced into workplaces, as part of the process, for example in a biotechnology laboratory, workers usually show high levels of awareness of the biological hazards to which they are exposed, knowing and using correct protective measures. However, this level of consciousness does not exist in other workplaces where biological agents are present, as a core of the activities performed, but as contaminants.
