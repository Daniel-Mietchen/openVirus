<p id="Par8">The methods more commonly used for bioaerosol sampling are: impact, that promotes particle separation from a forced air stream and uses particle inertia to force deposition on a solid, semi-solid or liquid collection surface; filtration, that captures airborne particles that are trapped in a porous material as air passes through it and the sampling is done using different filters with different constitution and porosity, with the main objective of sampling different particle sizes; and sedimentation, that uses gravity to quantify sediment particles on adhesive surfaces. This last method is a non-quantitative method recurrently used due to its simplicity and low cost, a plate with nutrient medium that will identify the colonies arising from the growth of spores retained during the time of exposure to air.</p>
