<p id="Par6">Bioaerosols are considered the main responsible for the mobility of microorganisms by air. According to Cox and Wathes (1995), bioaerosols are fully defined as a collection of aerosol-shaped biological particles. However, exposure to bioaerosols and dust is not the only risk factor to consider, and the transmission of biological agents can be effective through contact with surfaces [

The effects related to exposure to biological agents are diverse as: irritant effect (eyes, nose, throat and skin); toxic reactions (mycotoxins, endo and exotoxins); allergic Reactions (Rhinitis, Sinusitis, Asthma) and Infections (Legionnaires Disease, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, Cryptococcosis) [
