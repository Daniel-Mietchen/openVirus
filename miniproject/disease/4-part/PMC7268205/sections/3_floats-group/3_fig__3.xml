   <italic>Crystal structure of an HA (left) and HEF (right) trimers</italic>. Polypeptide chains are displayed as green (HA
   <sub>1</sub>, HEF
   <sub>1</sub>) and magenta cartoons (HA
   <sub>2</sub>, HEF
   <sub>2</sub>). HA (left): The amino acids contributing to receptor-binding (Phe-95, Ser-140, Trp-158, His-191, Tyr-202, Pro-238 and Ser-240) are shown as red stick in one HA
   <sub>1</sub> subunit. The fusion peptide at the N-terminus of the HA
   <sub>2</sub> subunit is displayed as blue sticks. HEF (right): The esterase domains shown in blue within one HEF
   <sub>1</sub> subunit. The catalytic triad of the esterase domain (serine 57, aspartate 352, histidine 355) is shown as red sticks. The amino acids contributing to receptor-binding (Tyr 127, Thr 170, Gly 172, Leu 184, Thr 186, Phe 225, Tyr 227, Arg 236, Phe 293) are shown as red stick in one HEF
   <sub>1</sub> subunit. The fusion peptide at the N-terminus of the HEF
   <sub>2</sub> subunit is displayed as a blue line. Figures were created with Pymol2.2 (
