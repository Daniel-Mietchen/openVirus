<p id="p0290">Influenza C virus does not use sialic acid as its receptor on the target cell, but an acetylated derivative, namely 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid. 9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac as the terminal sugar on both glycoproteins and glycolipids can be used as a receptor, regardless of whether it is attached to galactose via an α-2,3 or α-2,6 linkage. There is some evidence that the abundance of 9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac influences the tropism, since MDCK II cells (a standard cell line used for growth IAV and IBV) is resistant to ICV infection due to insufficient number of receptors. Instead, ICV is usually grown and plaque-titrated in another subline of Madin-Darby canine kidney cell, namely MDCK I cells.</p>
