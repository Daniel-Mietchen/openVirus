<p id="p0130">The nomenclature of the viral gene segments resembles those of IAV, with the largest three encoding the polymerase subunits PB2 (segment 1), PB1 (segment 2) and PA (segment 3), followed by the monocistronic HA (segment 4) and NP genes (segment 5). The residual three segments each encode for two viral proteins, which is achieved by different strategies: Segment 6 differs from its IAV counterpart by encoding not only the viral neuraminidase (NA), but also the fourth viral transmembrane glycoprotein NB in an overlapping reading frame. Its translation is initiated at the first AUG start codon, just four nucleotides upstream of the NA start codon. The NA and NB open reading frames overlap for 292 nucleotides. Translational initiation at the NA start codon is efficient despite being located downstream of the NB start.</p>
