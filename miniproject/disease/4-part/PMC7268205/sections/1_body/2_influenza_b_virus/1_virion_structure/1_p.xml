<p id="p0120">IBV virions show pleomorphic structures that can have spherical, irregular or filamentous appearances and are surrounded by a membrane, in which the viral membrane proteins HA, NA, NB and BM2 are integrated. Type A and B influenza viruses cannot be distinguished based upon their morphology or size as determined by electron microscopy (EM) (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). The average size of spherical IBV virions of the prototypic B/Lee/40 strain grown in embryonated chicken eggs was determined to be 137 ± 27 nm. Apparently, different organizational patterns have been reported for the eight viral negative-strand RNA gene segments, which together with the viral nucleoprotein and polymerase exist as viral RNPs inside IBV virions. Analysis of ultrathin sections by transmission electron microscopy suggested that virions of laboratory and clinical IBV strains package mostly eight RNP structures that are organized in a 7 +1 configuration with a central long RNP encircled by 7 others. In contrast, 3D reconstructions by cryo-EM tomography were rather indicative for a disordered organization of IBV vRNPs. Studies of purified virions by electron microscopy revealed the presence of 400–500 spike-like projections per spherical virion corresponding to the viral glycoproteins. Quantitative analysis of purified virions by mass spectrometry showed that M1 is the most abundant IBV virion component followed by NP, HA and NA, whereas the level of NB and P proteins were the lowest.
