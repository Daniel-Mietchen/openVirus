<p id="p0330">Infection of humans by IDV has not been reported, but based on serological studies it is assumed that the virus circulates widely in cattle, especially in calves and the virus may spread to pigs and small ruminants (sheep and goat). Based on the comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the HEF gene, two distinct co-circulating lineages are currently described, which frequently reassort with each other, but not with ICV. HEF of IDV is also stable in evolution, but the substitution rate for HEF from IDV is 1.54 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup> per site and year, and thus faster than in the HEF of ICV. The reason for the slow evolutionary rate of HEF from ICV is unknown. It may be either a low error rate of the polymerases and/or that HEF does not tolerate many amino acid changes without compromising its functionality.
