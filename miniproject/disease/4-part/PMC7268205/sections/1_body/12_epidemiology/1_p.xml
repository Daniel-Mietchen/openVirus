<p id="p0325">Although influenza C virus infections occur primarily in a pattern of sporadic cases or in limited outbreaks, serological studies indicated that this virus is widely distributed around the world and that the majority of humans develop antibodies against the virus early in life, which prevent subsequent infections with ICV or mitigate the symptoms. According to a phylogenetic analysis of their HEF genes the existing strains are divided into six genetic and antigenic lineages. The average rate of nucleotide substitution in HEF has been calculated to be 4.9 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup> substitutions/site/year, an order of magnitude slower compared to the corresponding rate for the HA gene of IAV. Only 40 residues (~5%) are not completely conserved through all lineages of HEF, the variable amino acids are mainly located in the globular head domain of HEF
 <sub>1</sub>. Reassortment between viruses of different lineages occurred frequently, and newly emerged reassortants replaced previously circulating viruses and became epidemic strains. The primary host and reservoir of influenza C virus are humans, but antibodies against influenza C virus are present in dogs and especially in pigs. A number of influenza C virus strains were isolated from pigs in China and these strains could be experimentally transmitted from pig to pig.
