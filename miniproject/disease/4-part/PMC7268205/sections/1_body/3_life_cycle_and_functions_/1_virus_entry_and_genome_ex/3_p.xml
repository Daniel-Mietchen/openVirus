<p id="p0160">The major component of the vRNPs is the viral nucleoprotein (NP) that is a basic (pI &gt; 9.0) 62 kDa protein and wraps around the viral RNA. It is an essential cofactor for viral transcription and replication and it consists of a head domain, a body domain and a tail loop like its IAV counterpart, to which it has sequence identity below 40%. The tail loop of one NP monomer can insert into a neighboring monomer, which drives the formation of homo-oligomers. A distinct feature of the IBV NP protein is an extended N-terminal region of 70 amino acids that appeared intrinsically disordered in structural analyzes. In a study by NMR and small-angle X ray scattering the N-terminal NP region was bound to nuclear import factor importin-Î±7, which together with biochemical and mutational analyzes suggested that the N-terminal region of NP that is enriched in basic amino acids between positions 30 and 71 directs its nuclear targeting.</p>
