<p id="p0210">The IBV NEP protein has a conserved length of 122–123 amino acids. In spite of its similar size the sequence identity of IBV NEP with IAV NEP is below 25%. However, both NEPs have conserved functions as vRNP export factors and regulators of the viral RNA polymerase. The IBV NEP has been shown to interact with human nucleoporins and exportin 1, and this interaction has been mapped in the hydrophobic N-terminal region at positions 10–19 of NES. In contrast to IAV, the IBV NEP has been reported to bind directly to vRNPs, and may, hence, be able to facilitate nucleocytoplasmic export of the viral genome independently of the M1 protein. An additional activity of NEP in regulating polymerase protein functions was observed in minigenome reporter assays, in which increasing amounts of NEP reduced the accumulation of viral mRNA and enhanced cRNA levels without affecting vRNA levels. Neither the precise target of IBV NEP within the viral RNPs nor the mechanism underlying this regulation have been established.</p>
