<p id="p0275">In contrast to IAV, the larger M1 protein of ICV and IDV is translated from a spliced RNA, but the mechanisms of splicing differ between ICV and IDV. In ICV the removal of an intron generates a stop codon whereas in IDV splicing generates a second exon encoding a 4-residue peptide that is added to the primary M1 transcript. The unspliced mRNA encoding CM2 translates into a long precursor protein called M1â€² or p42. P42 contains an internal signal peptide, which targets the protein into the ER. Residues C-terminal to the signal peptide are translocated into the lumen of the ER until translocation is stopped by a second hydrophobic region, the transmembrane region of CM2. The signal peptide is then cleaved by signal peptidase yielding the mature CM2 and the p31 protein, which is rapidly degraded.</p>
