<p id="p0350">Drugs developed against influenza A virus are not effective against ICV or IDV, since their target molecule is not present (neuraminidase inhibitors) or there are different amino acids at the binding site (M2 inhibitors). Since ICV is not thought to be a significant concern for human health, no vaccines have been developed. Prototype vaccines against IVD are currently under development.</p>
