<p id="p0340">Experimental infection of pigs and cattle with IDV causes only mild symptoms (rhinitis and tracheitis) and virus replication is usually restricted to the upper respiratory tract. This is somewhat in conflict with the observation that IDV is associated with a more pronounced disease in the field and it was thus proposed that the manifestation of clinical symptoms requires coinfection with other respiratory viruses or bacteria that colonize the respiratory tract.</p>
