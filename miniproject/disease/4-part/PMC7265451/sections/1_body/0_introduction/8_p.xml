<p id="Par10">Here, we use a 15-year data set of 18,250 typed, subtyped and antigenically characterised seasonal influenza viruses from the five most populous cities in Australia to investigate the impact of environmental and virological factors on the timing and magnitude of city-level influenza virus epidemics. We find that climatic fluctuations and virus antigenic change have no consistent effects on epidemic onset timing or size, while epidemic onset timing itself and heterosubtypic competition have substantial impacts on epidemic size and virus subtype composition. The lack of consistent effect of easily measured climatic and virus antigenic properties, and seeming dominance of noisy short-term transmission processes likely diminishes the feasibility of meaningful long-term influenza epidemic forecasting at local scales.</p>
