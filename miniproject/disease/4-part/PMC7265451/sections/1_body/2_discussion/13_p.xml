<p id="Par39">The intensity of surveillance could also vary over the course of an epidemic. For example, sentinel physicians could become more likely to submit samples for further testing as an epidemic unfolds, or conversely, testing could prematurely cease as facilities become overwhelmed with samples. Despite being unable to definitively rule out the former scenario, the latter is unlikely to affect our data. If reporting ceased after a certain number of samples had been tested, the distribution of epidemic sizes would be truncated, and each epidemic would be unlikely to have an exponentially declining tail. No such patterns exist in our data.</p>
