 </sup> had cautiously suggested, given only virus-type data, that the 2009, 2012 and 2014 influenza A virus epidemics in Australia exhibited greater spatiotemporal synchrony potentially due to the emergence of the novel A/H1pdm09 subtype in 2009 and novel A/H3 antigenic variants in 2012 and 2014. However, with further subtype resolution and antigenic characterisation, we find that the majority of influenza A activity in Adelaide and Melbourne in 2014 was attributable to A/H1pdm09, rather than the (antigenically novel) A/H3; in fact, there was no above-baseline A/H3 activity in Perth. The fact that different virus subtypes caused these apparently synchronous epidemics implies that the epidemic synchrony described by Geoghegan et al.
