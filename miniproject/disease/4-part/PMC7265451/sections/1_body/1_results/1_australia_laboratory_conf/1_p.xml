<p id="Par11">We aggregated 18,250 laboratory-confirmed and antigenically characterised cases of seasonal influenza viruses from 2000 to 2015 by 2-week (14-day) periods, creating a set of subtype- and antigenic variant-specific time series for the five most populous cities in Australia: Sydney (~5.5 million people), Melbourne (~5.0 million), Brisbane (~2.4 million people), Perth (~2.3 million) and Adelaide (~1.4 million) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We excluded all virus cases from the 2009 season from all analyses because the 2009 A/H1N1 virus pandemic was atypical compared with seasonal epidemics and likely to be driven by different processes, affecting both epidemic dynamics and data collection of A/H1pdm09, as well as the other subtypes. Using a Poisson count detection method (see ‘Methods’), we identified periods of sustained, above-baseline levels of epidemic activity for each antigenic variant in each city. To facilitate comparisons among cities, we calculated the laboratory-confirmed incidence per 10
 <sup>6</sup> individuals using the annual estimated resident population values of each city
