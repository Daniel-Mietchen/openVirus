<p id="Par12">Epidemic magnitude and the most common virus subtype varied substantially among cities (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For example, during the 2002 season, A/H3 and B/Vic viruses were the most common strains in both Brisbane and Sydney. Absolute A/H3 virus incidence in Brisbane was much higher than in Sydney (186 vs 38.0 cases per 10
 <sup>6</sup> individuals), as was absolute B/Vic incidence (40.3 vs 22.7 cases per 10
 <sup>6</sup> individuals). But B/Vic had a substantially higher relative incidence in Sydney than in Brisbane (37% of all cases, vs only 18%). In some seasons, a virus antigenic variant caused a major epidemic in one or more cities, but failed to produce any observable above-baseline activity in another city. For example, in 2006, the A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) virus variant caused epidemics in Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne, while above-baseline levels of activity were completely absent in Adelaide.
