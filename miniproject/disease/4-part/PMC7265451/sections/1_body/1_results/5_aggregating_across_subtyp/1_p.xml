<p id="Par23">There may be subtype/lineage-specific differences in the effect of antigenic change and prior immunity. Notably, B/Yam antigenic variants typically cause only one epidemic per city. We repeated these analyses with epidemics aggregated together, across all subtypes and cities to increase statistical power (see the project Github repository for the analyses and code). As before, there were no statistically significant differences in the magnitude of epidemics between the first and subsequent epidemics of an antigenic variant, or any association between epidemic size and the cumulative incidence over prior seasons. Binary logistic regression showed that the probability of successful epidemic initiation may be moderately reduced by the cumulative incidence over prior seasons. Our findings were robust to the method of normalisation used to allow for comparison between cities and subtypes/lineages (see â€˜Methods').</p>
