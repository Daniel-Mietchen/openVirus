Fluctuations in these climatic factors from the historic averages expected for that specific day of the year (T′ and AH′, respectively) were anomalously large and negative when compared against a bootstrapped distribution of random samples from the historical records of observed daily climatic fluctuations recorded over wintertime (defined as 1 October–28 February). Following the same bootstrap-sampling method (see ‘Methods’) and aggregating epidemics across all five Australian cities, there were no statistically significant differences (all

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) between the bootstrapped distribution of random samples of typical wintertime fluctuations (1 April–31 August for Australia) and the observed fluctuations in anomalous temperature and absolute humidity over the 2-, 4- and 6-week periods immediately prior to the onset of the earliest epidemics from 2000 to 2015 (excluding 2009, 15 years × 5 cities = 75 epidemics in total) (Fig. 2). Individual city-by-city analyses (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) showed that there was substantial local variation but no consistent patterns. Epidemic onset times coincided with both high and low temperature and absolute humidity periods, and there were no statistically significant patterns in four of the five cities.
