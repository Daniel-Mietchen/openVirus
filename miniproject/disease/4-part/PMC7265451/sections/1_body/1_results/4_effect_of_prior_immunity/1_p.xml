<p id="Par21">After an antigenic variant causes an epidemic in a city for the first time, the accumulated population immunity to that variant should lead to smaller subsequent epidemics, and eventually render further epidemics of that variant less likely. For each epidemic caused by a given antigenic variant, we investigated the relationship between that epidemic’s size and the cumulative number of cases caused by that antigenic variant in preceding seasons. To account for differences in population size and surveillance intensity among cities, we normalised epidemic and cumulative case counts by the city-specific mean epidemic size. Antigenic variants that emerged prior to the start of the study period, such as A/Moscow/10/99 (A/H3) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (A/H1sea) and all A/H1pdm09 epidemics from 2009 to 2015 were excluded from this analysis, since it was not possible to calculate cumulative case counts for them. Specific B/Yam antigenic variants rarely caused more than one epidemic in a given city, but specific antigenic variants of A/H3 and B/Vic viruses caused repeated epidemics in the same city. For A/H3 and B/Vic viruses, epidemic size and cumulative prior incidence were not correlated (Pearson’s correlation test, Fig.
