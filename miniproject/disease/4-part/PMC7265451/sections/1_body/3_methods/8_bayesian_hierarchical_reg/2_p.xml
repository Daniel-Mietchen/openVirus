<p id="Par68">In the model notation that follows, the symbol “~” is a “sampling statement”; it denotes that a random variable is distributed according to the given distribution. Normal distributions are parameterised as Normal(mean, standard deviation), generalised Student-T distributions are parameterised as Student-T(degrees of freedom, location and scale). Positive-constrained normal distributions (Half-Normal) are parameterised as Half-Normal(mode, standard deviation).</p>
