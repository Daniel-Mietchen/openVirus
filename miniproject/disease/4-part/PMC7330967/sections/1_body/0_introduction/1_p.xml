<p id="Par17">Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>. This pathogen was first isolated in Tanzania, East Africa, in 1952 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since then, CHIKV has caused sporadic outbreaks throughout the African and Asian continents. Although only one serotype CHIKV exists, the virus is classified into three genotypes named after the geographical location where the respective genotype was first recognized: East/Central/South African (ECSA), West African (WA), and Asian [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. CHIKV was considered a neglected tropical pathogen until a large outbreak was reported on Indian Ocean islands in 2005. The outbreak affected 244,000 individuals, one-third of the total population in this region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] . Sequence analysis revealed a specific amino acid change that rendered the virus infective to 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>; this clade of the ECSA genotype therefore was designated as the Indian Ocean Lineage (ECSA-IOL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Subsequently, ECSA-IOL also was identified in India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and South East Asia (including Thailand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Cambodia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and Malaysia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]), and was detected for the first time in European countries (including Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and France [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). In contrast, non-IOL ECSA-genotype CHIKV was detected in Brazil in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Asian-genotype CHIKV subsequently gave rise to a novel clade, designated as Asian/American [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This clade has become a public health problem in the Caribbean islands and the Central American mainland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Worldwide, approximately one billion people are estimated to live in areas at risk of CHIKV outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].
