<p id="Par18">More than 75% of CHIKV-infected individuals develop acute febrile symptoms such as high fever, headache, and muscle and joint pains [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that are similar to those observed in patients infected by other mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue dengue and Zika viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, the CHIKV illness often is associated with prolonged and incapacitating arthritis; for this reason, large CHIKV epidemics have considerable economic consequences, highlighting their significant public health impact. To distinguish CHIKV infection in the acute (viremic) phase, several nucleic acid detection methods are considered the gold standards [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, immunochromatographic (IC) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are user-friendly and easy to store without the need to maintain a cold chain, while facilitating early diagnosis. Such RDTs are expected to increase the accessibility of laboratory diagnosis of CHIKV infection. Previously, Okabayashi et al. reported a prototype IC RDT with high sensitivity (68 out of 76, 89.4%) and specificity (34 out of 36, 94.4%) against clinical samples known to contain ECSA-genotype CHIKV in Thailand and Laos [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, another trial of that RDT with confirmed clinical samples of Asian-genotype CHIKV from the island of Aruba revealed low sensitivity (10 out of 30, 33.3%) [
