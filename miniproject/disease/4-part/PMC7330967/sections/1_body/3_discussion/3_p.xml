<p id="Par39">In terms of the false-positive rate in CHIKV PCR-negative samples, the specificity of the version-O RDT in samples in Bangladesh was 100%, while that of the version-B RDT was 83.3% (45 out of 54) in samples from Aruba. Specificity of the version-B RDT in the Aruba samples was 94.2% (33 out of 35) for anti-CHIKV IgM- and IgG-negative cases, while that in anti-CHIKV IgM- or IgG-positive cases was 63.2% (12 out of 19) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As described above, the version-B RDT uses 3 clones of anti-CHIKV MAbs, while the version-O RDT uses 5 MAbs, including 3 MAbs used in the version-B RDT. Thus, it is unlikely that a specific component present only in the version-B RDT caused the false-positive reactions. Most of the Ct-values of CHIKV-detecting RT-PCR in Bangladesh samples were lower than 20, and the median Ct-value and its IQR was 17.02 (14.89â€“19.92) (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Of course, it is not appropriate to directly compare Ct-values between Aruba and Dhaka patients given that these values were determined with different real-time PCR systems, but these Ct-values suggest that the CHIKV sera in Dhaka were collected earlier in the disease course. Results of ELISA detecting anti-CHIKV IgM also support this idea, since only one out of 100 CHIKV PCR-positive cases was anti-CHIKV IgM positive (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In contrast, among 54 PCR-negative samples from Aruba, 19 were positive for either anti-CHIKV IgM or IgG (Table

 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). As the kinetics of chikungunya antigenemia are not well understood, it is possible that the IC RDT-positive but PCR-negative samples are not truly CHIKV negative. In other words, CHIKV structure proteins might have persisted longer than the viral genome in blood, since the structural proteins might be expressed from a sub-genomic or defective viral RNA without full-length genomic RNA replication. In fact, persistence of a defective alphavirus genome in infected cells has been reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Indeed, three (3%) positive results were obtained when we tested 93 CHIKV PCR-negative and DENV PCR-negative but anti-CHIKV IgM-positive samples (Additional file
