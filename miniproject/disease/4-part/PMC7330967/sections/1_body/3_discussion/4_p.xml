<p id="Par40">The precise mechanisms associated with chronic CHIKV-associated joint disease are largely unknown, although the effects of abnormalities present prior to infection cannot be ruled out. In CHIKV-infected patients, high viral loads are common, and anti-CHIKV IgM or IgG has been observed to persist in patients for 18â€‰months or longer [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These findings suggest that continuous immune stimulation, possibly by persistent or continuously expressed CHIKV antigens, could play a role in prolonged CHIKV-associated poly-arthralgia, although no tools are available to rapidly detect CHIKV antigens. It will be interesting to use the diagnostic RDT described in the present work for follow-up studies on antigen persistence in post-chikungunya chronic poly-arthralgia. Thus, it will be critical to further evaluate these false-positive cases using our revised CHIKV RDT.
