<p id="Par38">As described in Materials and Methods, the sampling dates after the onset of fever were median 7 days and the median Ct value and its IQR of CHIKV-detecting PCR were 35.29 (34.22–35.50) for the Aruba samples. The sampling days after the onset of fever did not differ significantly among 11 PCR-positive and RDT-positive (median 6 days), 15 PCR-positive and RDT-negative (median 7 days), and 9 PCR-negative and RDT-positive groups (median 7 days). Importantly, many of the samples from Aruba were collected after anti-CHIKV antibody seroconversion had occurred. We look forward to confirming our findings in a larger sample size of Asian-genotype CHIKV-infected patients, preferably before seroconversion. After seroconversion, detection of anti-CHIKV antibodies can be used for diagnosis. Therefore, it would be ideal to simultaneously detect both CHIKV antigen and anti-CHIKV antibodies for accurate diagnosis.</p>
