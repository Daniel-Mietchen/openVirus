<p id="Par37">In the present study, using newly obtained MAbs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], we developed new IC CHIKV-E1 antigen detection RDTs with improved sensitivity to Asian- and WA-genotype viruses compared to the previous version-A RDT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although we tested only 5 samples of Asian-genotype CHIKV-infected cases (i.e., Aruban cases before anti-CHIKV IgM/IgG seroconversion), the 2nd generation CHIKV antigen detection RDT version B yielded positive results in 4 of these 5 samples (i.e., 80% sensitivity). Sample numbers are low in this Asian-CHIKV serum panel, but the results suggest increased sensitivity over the previous version of RDT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, the 3rd generation RDT version O showed sensitivity of 92% (92 out of 100, 95%-CI 85.0â€“95.9) in sera from 100 ECSA-genotype CHIKV-infected patients from Bangladesh. The version-O RDT also showed higher sensitivity to cultured Asian- and WA genotype CHIKVs than the version-A RDT did. These results suggest that the version-O RDT will be better for worldwide application compared to the version-A and -B RDTs.
