<p id="Par36">Since the volumes of sera from Aruba island, especially those of CHIKV PCR-positive ones, were limited, we decided to perform testing using clinical samples from other CHIKV-endemic areas. We accessed serum samples in Apollo Hospitals Dhaka, Bangladesh, where molecular detection of CHIKV and DENV was performed by RT-PCR screening during the 2017 CHIKV epidemic in Dhaka. These DENV positive sample sets were used for evaluating the specificity of the CHIKV detection RDT. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the version-O RDT exhibited 92% (92 out of 100) sensitivity and 100% (100 out of 100) specificity in this setting. Among 210 CHIKV RT-PCR-negative and DENV RT-PCR-negative samples identified in Dhaka, 104 were anti-CHIKV IgM positive. We further investigated 93 of these 104 anti-CHIKV IgM-positive cases and found that three (3%) yielded positive results using our E1-antigen IC RDT (Additional file
