<p id="Par33">Although the version-B RDT showed improved sensitivity for Asian-genotype CHIKV, the sensitivity of the version-B RDT to ECSA-genotype CHIKV was not comparable to that of the version-A RDT (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To address this issue, we combined the antibodies used in the version-A and -B RDTs to generate a 3rd generation (designated version O) of the E1-detecting IC RDT. The detection limit of the version-O RDT for ECSA-genotype virus was comparable to that of the version-A RDT, both against live virus (1.0 × 10^4 pfu/mL) and against pseudotyped vectors (6 ng/mL of HIV-1 capsid protein) (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The improved sensitivity of the version-B RDT for Asian- and WA-genotype viruses was retained in the version-O RDT (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
