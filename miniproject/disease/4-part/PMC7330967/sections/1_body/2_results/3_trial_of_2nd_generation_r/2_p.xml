<p id="Par32">Of those 80 samples, a subset of 20 also was tested using the previous RDT version A in order to permit side-by-side comparison with the version-B RDT. These 20 (10 PCR-positive and 10 PCR-negative) samples comprised 6 that were IgG- and IgM-negative and 14 that were IgG- or IgM-positive (Additional files

 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The version-A RDT failed to detect any of these samples, while the version-B RDT detected 4 out of 10 PCR-positive samples (40%). Sensitivity and specificity of the version-B RDT for these 20 samples were comparable to those for the remaining 60 samples (Additional file
