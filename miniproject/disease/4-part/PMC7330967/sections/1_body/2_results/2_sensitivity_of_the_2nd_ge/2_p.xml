<p id="Par30">We next examined the sensitivity of the version-B RDT to WA-genotype CHIKV. Since we do not have access to live CHIKV of the WA genotype, we used CHIKV envelope-pseudotyped lentivirus to evaluate the IC RDT sensitivity. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the version-B RDT showed higher sensitivity than did the 1st version RDT (version A) for detection of WA-genotype virus along with Asian-genotype virus. However, as we anticipated from the results shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, sensitivity of the version-B RDT was not comparable to that of the version-A RDT for detection of ECSA-genotype CHIKV.
