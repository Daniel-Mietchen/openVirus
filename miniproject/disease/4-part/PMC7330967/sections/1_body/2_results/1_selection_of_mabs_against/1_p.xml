<p id="Par28">We began our study by performing screening of the 7 anti-E1 MAbs that we had generated previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We used four different antigens for this screen, as described in Materials and Methods. Mean and standard deviations of signal/background ratios are shown in panel A of Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Thirty-three of the 36 tested combinations yielded low signal/background ratios in the context of immunochromatography. One combination showed high levels of variation and only two combinations showed signal/background ratios above 2.0. In the case of 5 anti-CA MAbs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], more than half of the combinations (16 out of 20) gave signal/background ratios above 2.0 when tested against the culture supernatant of CHIKV CP10-infected Vero cells (panel B of Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Therefore, we chose the combinations of anti-E1 MAbs (IC RDT versions B and E) and anti-CA MAbs (IC RDT versions C, D, F, and M) to construct trial IC RDTs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
