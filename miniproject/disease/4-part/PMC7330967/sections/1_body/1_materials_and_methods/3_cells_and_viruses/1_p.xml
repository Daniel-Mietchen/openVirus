<p id="Par23">African green monkey kidney epithelium (Vero) cells (ATCC CCL-81) and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (ATCC CCL-10) were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.). Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293T) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS. These cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> environment. For culturing cells that had been infected with CHIKV, the concentration of FBS in the medium was reduced to 2%. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>-derived C6/36 cells were maintained at 28 °C in L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS and 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth.
