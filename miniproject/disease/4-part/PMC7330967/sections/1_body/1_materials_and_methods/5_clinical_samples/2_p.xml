<p id="Par27">A second set of clinical samples was obtained from the Apollo Hospitals Dhaka, Bangladesh. In 2017, a sudden increase in febrile cases was observed in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Between July 2017 and February 2018, 1688 patients visited Apollo Hospitals Dhaka, with acute onset of fever (within 7 days from onset), myalgia, arthralgia, and headache; some patients also experienced a maculopapular rash and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. Out of 1688 febrile cases, 643 (38.1%) and 269 (15.9%) were laboratory-confirmed as chikungunya fever and dengue fever, respectively, by RT-PCR with the simultaneous detection and differentiation of CHIKV and dengue virus (DENV) (Fast-Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg). Notably, the sequences of CHIKV in this season in Dhaka (NCBI Accession No. LC364266-LC364269) were reported as ECSA genotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], encoding a 6 K-E1 polyprotein with an E at residue 350 (corresponding to residue 284 in the mature E1 protein). These CHIKVs lacked an alanine-to-valine substitution at residue 226 of the E1. CHIKV PCR-positive or DENV PCR-positive sera were stored at − 80 °C. The titer of serum IgM against CHIKV was measured using an ELISA kit (MBS495200) purchased from MyBioSource (San Diego, CA, USA). One hundred CHIKV RT-PCR-positive and 100 DENV RT-PCR-positive sera were used for evaluation of the 3rd-generation version-O RDT. The median Ct value (IQR) of CHIKV RT-PCR-positive samples was 17.02 (14.89–19.92). The study proposal was approved by the research and ethics committee of Apollo Hospitals Dhaka (ERC 16/2018–1).
