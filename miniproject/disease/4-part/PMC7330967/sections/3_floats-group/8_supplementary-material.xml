    <bold>Additional file 2.</bold> RDT reaction to CHIKV Asian-genotype and ECSA-genotype strains. ECSA-genotype strain CP10 and Asian-genotype strains ARUBA-15801567 (ARUBA1567) and ARUBA-15801125 (ARUBA1125) were grown in Vero cells. The x-axis denotes viral titer in plaque forming units (PFU) /mL. Blue circles, orange squares, and gray diamonds indicate CP10, ARUBA1125, and ARUBA1567 measurements, respectively. The y-axis indicates the intensity of the test line (milli-absorbance units; mAbs).
