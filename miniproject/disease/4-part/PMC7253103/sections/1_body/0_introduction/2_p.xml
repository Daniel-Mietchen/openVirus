<p>Reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays are the mainstay for specific detection of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV acute infection. However, in many resource-limited settings of high disease burden, there is no access to laboratory facilities, especially in rural areas. Point-of-care testing with antibody (Ab)/antigen (Ag)-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is increasingly available and has demonstrated considerable potential for surveillance of diseases such as DENV, but not yet for CHIKV or ZIKV.
