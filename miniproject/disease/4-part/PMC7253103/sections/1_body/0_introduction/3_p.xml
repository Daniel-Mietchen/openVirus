<p>We aimed to produce a pragmatic and low-cost approach to the combined surveillance of the three viruses in rural areas, not only suitable for the Lao PDR (Laos) but also applicable to other resource-limited settings. Successful DENV RNA detection by RT-qPCR from positive dry dengue RDTs used for routine diagnosis in a provincial hospital has previously been described by our group.

 </sup> Here, we aimed to evaluate RT-qPCR detection of both CHIKV and ZIKV from dengue RDTs and to assess the temperature stability of the detection of DENV in RDTs by RT-qPCR. We used serial viral dilutions that were spotted onto dengue RDTs. RNA detection using specific RT-qPCR after extraction from RDTs was compared with direct extractions for all virus dilutions. Rapid diagnostic tests loaded with serial dilutions of DENV solutions were stored at different temperatures, 4°C, −80°C, and 35°C, for up to 2 months before testing by RT-qPCR.
