<p>DENV RT-qPCR results from the RDTs loaded with the three DENV1 dilutions and stored at different temperatures are displayed in 
 <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and supplemental data (

DENV was successfully detected from the RDT stored at 35°C for 1 month for the three viral dilutions. For the “low-titer” dilution, DENV RNA could not be amplified for one of the three RDTs stored at 35°C for 1 week, and for the three RDTs stored at 35°C for 2 months. However, two of the three “low-titer” RDTs stored at 4°C were also found to be PCR negative after 1 month.
