<p>We next report genomic epidemiological findings from our surveillance of two municipalities in the São Paulo State, Araraquara (ARA) and São José do Rio Preto (SJRP), between early June 2017 and the end of April 2019. In Araraquara, a total of 96% (n = 52/54) dengue cases notified to CVE were caused by DENV2 between 2017 and June 2019; in São José do Rio Preto, during the same period, 95% (n = 779/821) were caused by this serotype (

From each location, 10 RT-qPCR positive samples (mean cycle threshold: 19.8, range: 16.4 to 25) were randomly selected for complete genome sequencing using a previously developed amplicon-based approach for on-site sequencing using the minION platform.
