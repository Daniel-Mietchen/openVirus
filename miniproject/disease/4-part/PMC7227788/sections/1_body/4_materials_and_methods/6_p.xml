<p>To investigate the origins of the newly generated genomes we downloaded all DENV2 nucleotide sequences longer than 1400 nucelotides (nt) from GenBank

 </xref> that had a known date (year, and month and day when available) and location (country, and city when available; n = 1630 as of 20 June 2019). We aligned these sequences using MAFFT automatic settings
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> We subsequently constructed an initial maximum likelihood phylogeny to help identify the genotypes of strains that have historically circulated (collected before 2019) and are currently circulating (collected in 2019) in Brazil. For this genotype assessment, we constructed phylogenies using FastTree v.2 with gamma-distributed among site rate heterogeneity and a general time reversible nucleotide substitution model.

 </xref> We observed that all sequences from the Americas (including the newly generated sequences) grouped together in a well-supported monophyletic clade. Therefore, we next constructed a dataset comprising only sequences collected in the Americas (n = 670).
