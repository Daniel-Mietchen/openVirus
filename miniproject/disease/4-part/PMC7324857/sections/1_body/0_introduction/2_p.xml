<p>Currently, HEVâ€™s diagnosis depends on specific serological and nucleic acid tests, as the clinical manifestations and routine laboratory measures of HEV are similar to those of other acute hepatitis (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>). There are four major methods for diagnosing hepatitis E, including the detection of anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibodies, the antigen (Ag), and HEV RNA. Presently, the clinical diagnosis of acute hepatitis E cases mainly depends on the serological detection of anti-HEV antibodies (

However, equivalence, sensitivity, and specificity in the results of the HEV Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits tend to differ between manufacturers, leading to discrepancies in the rates of anti-HEV antibodies among different populations (

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Drobeniuc et al. 2010</xref>), together with the HEV genome heterogeneity, and the different antigenic structure of HEV proteins. Moreover, cross-reactions of anti-HEV IgM with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies have been reported, which cause false-positive results (

Thus, the clinical diagnosis of HEV infection still mainly relies on serological assays with a few reports of hepatitis E misdiagnoses occurring in China.
