 <bold>Performance of anti-HEV IgM assays</bold>. The diagnostic performance characteristic of each anti-HEV IgM kit was determined by the ROC curve. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">I</xref>, the area under the curve (AUC) value of the ELISA kits ranged from 0.909 to 0.93. The sensitivity among the 86 acute HEV infections ranged from 82.6% to 86% (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">I</xref>), suggesting an excellent agreement (Kappa: 0.819–1) in anti-HEV IgM antibody detection between the ELISA kits (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">II</xref>). All the anti-HEV IgM assays evaluated demonstrated good specificities (97.8–100%), except for two false-positive results obtained from the RD cases detected by the Genelabs ELISA kit. No positive results were shown in CMV/EBV infected patients by all the assays (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">I</xref>), which demonstrated that there were no cross-reactions of IgM against CMV and EBV.
