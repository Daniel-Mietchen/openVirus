 <bold>Performance of anti-HEV IgG assays</bold>. The AUC value (0.827–0.929) of the four distinct anti-HEV IgG kits are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">III</xref>. The sensitivity among the acute HEV infection patients ranged from 87.2% to 91.9% and showed a substantial agreement with Kappa coefficients from 0.752 to 0.927 between each different ELISA kit (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">III</xref> and IV). However, the specificities of anti-HEV IgG among the non-HEV population showed significant inconsistency between each ELISA kit (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>). The specificity of the Kehua (96.9–98.9%) and Genelab (96.7–98.9%) tests were significantly higher when compared with the Wantai (64.6–81.3%) and Lizhu assays (69.8–83.5%) (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">III</xref>).
