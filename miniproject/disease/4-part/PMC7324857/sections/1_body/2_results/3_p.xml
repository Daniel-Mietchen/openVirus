 <bold>The HEV Ag and HEV RNA assays</bold>. A total of 36 acute HEV patients were positive for the HEV Ag using the Wantai ELISA kit, with no positive cases found among the non-HEV infection patients. A total of 44 acute HEV infection patients were positive for HEV RNA. The consistency rate between the HEV Ag and RNA was 90.7% (78/86), as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">V</xref>. The two methods had a substantial agreement with a Kappa coefficient of 0.787 (0.656â€“0.918). Furthermore, six of the 86 samples were positive for HEV RNA but negative for anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibodies, and the HEV Ag by all ELISA kits (Fig.
