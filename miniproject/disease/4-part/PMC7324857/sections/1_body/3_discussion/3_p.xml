<p>In general, the detection of anti-HEV IgG is usually used as an indicator of past infection. However, the appearance of the anti-HEV IgG antibody is early, which could be used in the clinical diagnosis of acute HEV infection (

However, a significant discrepancy in anti-HEV IgG results between different assay kits in the non-HEV population was found in our study. The positive rates were significantly higher by the Wantai and Lizhu kits than those of Kehua and Genelabs. A Korean research compared anti-HEV IgG antibody results using the Genelabs and Wantai ELISA kits to estimate HEV serum prevalence in the Korean population (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 2012</xref>). They found a significant inconsistency in the results between the two assays, which was also observed in our study. Therefore, epidemiological investigations of HEV in the population may lead to significant inconsistencies when different kits are used. The Kehua and Genelabs IgG assays had high specificities in the non-HEV population and could be used in the clinical diagnosis of HEV. On the other hand, the Wantai and Lizhu IgG assays were more suitable for epidemiological investigations because the positive rates in the non-HEV population were too high to distinguish the acute HEV infection from the previous disease.
