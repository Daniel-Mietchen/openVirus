 <bold>HEV serological assays</bold>. The commercially available HEV ELISA kits were selected with Wantai (Beijing, China), Kehua (Shanghai, China), Lizhu (Zhuhai, China), and Genelabs (Singapore, Singapore) for the detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies. For the HEV Ag assay, the Wantai was the only available commercial provider for the ELISA kit in China. All the experimental operations were performed according to the instructions recommended by manufacturers. Results of the ELISA tests were listed as ratios (s/co), and interpretations were made as advised in the instructions.
