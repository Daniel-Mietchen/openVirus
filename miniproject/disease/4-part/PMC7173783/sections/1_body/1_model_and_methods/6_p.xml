<p>The time evolution is assumed to occur in discrete time, with a time step of 1 day, which is appropriate for describing influenza infection in a group of individuals in a single season. We simulate for a time of one season: influenza strains mutate on the time scale of a year [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], particular influenza strains tend to dominate in each season, and which strain is a threat varies from year to year. Due to the difficulty in modeling the antigenic drifts on longer time scales, as well as the coarse-grained description of the infection in our model, we limit our simulations to a single season. In addition, it is common for municipalities to collect data on influenza infections for this time period, as is the case for our location. We choose the time step to be one day because available immunological data which details the course of influenza infection for individuals is on the scale of days to weeks [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One day is also roughly the time scale on which a person would be able to characterize their personal immunological state, and is thus a reasonable time unit.
