 <sub>
  <italic>intra</italic>
 </sub> = 1. The intra-cohort connections are always given the same value 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (for explicit values, see 
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The inter-cohort connections are chosen to be weak in comparison, and fewer in number. The inter-cohort connection strength is taken to be 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>/10. This structure defines a hierarchical model in which infections generally spread within cohorts, with infections between cohorts happening rarely. This separation leads to model behavior with peaks in the infected number and which is stochastic with respect to individual simulations. A schematic of this contact structure is given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g001">Fig 1</xref>.
