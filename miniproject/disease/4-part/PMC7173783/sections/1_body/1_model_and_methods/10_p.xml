<p>Now, we describe the rules that govern the transitions of the agents between the states at each time step. At the beginning of the season, every agent is in either of two states. Most are in the susceptible state, and a small fraction are in the exposed state; the latter can be viewed as the initial infection fraction. Each exposed agent remains in the exposed state for a period
