<p>In this paper, we have presented results for the time course of the number of infected individuals from a numerical simulation study of a simple agent-based model of influenza spread. We have investigated the effect of the topology of connections between members of a population and the strength of the immune profile of individuals due to immunization. We identified quantitatively the parameter variations that affect the recurrences and showed that as the population is fragmented into cohorts which are more and more weakly connected, we obtain increasingly better-defined recurrence peaks corresponding to infection spreading into the successive cohorts.</p>
