<p>Despite limiting the variability of various parameters in cohorts and confining our attention to the stationary distributions for immune strengths and infectivities, there is considerable variation in the time interval between the first and second wave of infection in this model in the weak immune case. The histogram for the time differences is shown for weak immune system cases in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g007">Fig 7</xref>, and is broad even though the first peak occurs over a narrow range of times as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The appearance of the second peak is dominated by the weak inter-cohort connections as emphasized earlier. In the case of the strong immune profile, since it is difficult to identify peaks, we have not emphasized the features of the distribution, but have presented the result in the supplementary section. In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s002">S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s003">S3</xref> Figs, we show histograms of the number of peaks identified by our scheme: more than half of the samples in the strongly immune case have only one peak while more than three-quarters of the samples have more than one peak in the weakly immune case. This can be understood since it takes longer for the first cohort to have many infections in the case of a strong immune defense as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Given the bottleneck for the infection to spread to the second cohort, the second peak does not occur on the time scale of a season, the simulation time.
