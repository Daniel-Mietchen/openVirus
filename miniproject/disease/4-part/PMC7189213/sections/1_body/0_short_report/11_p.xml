<p>In contrast with previous recent reports on the 2016â€“2017 HAV outbreak, we investigated among HIV positive MSM patients, unprotected against HAV by prior vaccine immunisation or infection, through a questionnaire, their knowledge about risk factors for HAV infection and about STD transmission. We noticed that these HIV-infected MSM had a very limited knowledge about the route of transmission of major STD, including HA and HIV. Nevertheless they are particularly at risk for these STD, and this is illustrated here by the fact that all had a history of another STD than HAV and HIV. With regard to sexual practices during the 2 months prior the survey, a systematic condom was used by only one third of the patients who reported anal penetration. Nevertheless, one third of them had no idea of the routes of transmission of at least one STD, and of HAV for one fifth of them. The single study conducted in HIV positive MSM explored knowledge about transmission of HIV [

 <italic>et al</italic>. about HIV transmission [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a tremendous lack of knowledge about STD among people the more at risk of acquiring such infections in France. This shows the need for improved education and interventions targeting specifically the MSM population. Finally, an interesting finding was that internet was the link for meeting in more than half of the patients who responded to our survey. The network used by million people to meet sexual partners (applications and websites) could be a way to prevent STD [
