<p>A maximum likelihood (ML) tree revealed considerable genetic diversity both within the first (2006–2010) and the second outbreak (2015–2018) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000673.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). The tree showed that all sequences from the second European outbreak form a well-supported monophyletic clade that is nested within the virus lineages circulating during the first outbreak in 2006–2010 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000673.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). Specifically, the clade of the second outbreak derives from a clade from the first outbreak including predominantly viruses from France and Germany collected in 2007 and 2008. The viruses from the second French outbreak can be distinguished into two further clades, one including viruses from 2015 and 2016, the other including samples spanning the entire outbreak (2015–2018). Interestingly, both clades were already present among the eight samples from the farm in France (in Auvergne-Allier) from which the first diagnosis of re-emerged BTV-8 was made in August/September of 2015. Surprisingly, the branch leading to the re-emerging virus appeared short, given the five-year period between the outbreaks, implying a low rate of evolution during this period (
