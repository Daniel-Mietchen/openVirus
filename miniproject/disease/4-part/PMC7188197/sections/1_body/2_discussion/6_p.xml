<p>Our data cannot reveal the actual source from which BTV-8 was re-introduced in France in 2015. We speculate that laboratory escape of virus preparations, such as the case of FMDV in the UK in 2007, is unlikely, as BTV needs an insect vector for efficient transmission and we are unaware of any in vivo insect experiments in France with BTV during that period. However, due to specific animal husbandry procedures, there are important potential sources of frozen virus that apply to viruses of livestock and not viruses of most other animals, specifically the widespread use of bull semen for artificial insemination and embryo transfer in cows [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. BTV has been detected in the semen of viraemic bulls and rams, can initiate infection in the mother, and can be transmitted vertically to the embryo [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Additionally, contaminated embryos can cause transmission on implantation [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. As such, both semen and embryos may represent potential sources of BTV infection. Contaminated frozen colostrum may also be a potential source, considering that oral transmission has been shown to be possible with BTV-8 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, it is not normal practice to keep colostrum frozen for a number of years. Interestingly, while international regulations specify that bull donors and semen that are exported internationally must be screened for various pathogens including BTV [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], this does not apply to premises trading only locally and carrying out private insemination procedures [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thus, semen from a BTV-8â€“infected bull could have been collected or an embryo generated from an infected but asymptomatic animal and used years later without detection.
