<p>We carried out multiplexed viral targeted enrichment followed by Illumina sequencing using the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ system (Roche, Pleasanton, CA) for improved viral detection from clinical material. This approach was followed in order to increase the number of BTV-8 samples from which we could obtain a complete viral genome sequence directly from clinical material, including those with very low amounts of viral RNA. Libraries were prepared following the standard Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA protocol, described above. They were quantified using Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity (HS) Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Quality and size distribution were validated using the High Sensitivity D1000 Screen Tape assay (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) in a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent, USA) and were normalised according to BTV viral load and mass. A 1-μg aliquot of the pooled library was enriched using a SeqCap EZ Developer Probe (Roche/NimbleGen) (see below), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After a 14-cycle post-enrichment PCR amplification, the cleaned PCR products were pooled and were sequenced with a 151-base paired-end reads on a NexSeq500/550 cartridge (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Probes were designed using all BTV sequences available on NCBI Genbank, RefSeq, DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), and EMBL EBI databases (as accessed by October 2016). The resulting NimbleGen biotinylated soluble capture probe library (“BTV-Cap”) contains a probe set of more than 500,000 probes, designed to minimise capture of
