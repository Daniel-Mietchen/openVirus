<p>Eight-week-old female C57bl/6 mice were infected with the IV strain HA-D222-mpJena/5258, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 or with both pathogens in a co-infection. Therefore, the mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and intranasally inoculated with HA-D222-mpJena/5258 (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)) in 20 μL NaCl or only 20 µl NaCl (mock-treated). The same method was used for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFUs) two days later. During the infection period, the state of the animal health was monitored up to two times per day by controlling the weight, temperature and the scoring of the general behavior condition. Four days after HA-D222-mpJena/5258-infection, animals were sacrificed, and samples of blood and lung were subjected to further analysis. The viral titer and the bacterial counts of infected mice were determined in the right inferior lung lobe.
