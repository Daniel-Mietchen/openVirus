<p>The bacterial infection was performed with a methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>/USA300/wild type (WT), kindly provided by Lorena Tuchscherr [
 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The bacterial strain 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 was grown overnight in brain heart infusion (BHI)-medium at 37 °C with shaking. All bacteria were stored in the BHI medium at −80 °C. Colony-forming units (CFU) of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were determined weekly to calculate the number of infectious particles in the cryopreserved bacterial working solution and to exclude changes in the number of living bacteria by freezing.
