<p>The fixation of the cells was performed inside the human alveolus-on-a-chip model by using a fixative solution (2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer) for 90 min. Afterwards, a fresh cacodylate buffer was used for 30 min to wash out the fixative. The membranes were dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%) for 15 min each. The samples were critical point dried using liquid CO
 <sub>2</sub> and sputter coated with gold (thickness approx. 2 nm) using an SCD005 sputter coater (BAL-TEC, Balzers, Liechtenstein) to avoid surface charging. Finally, the specimens were investigated with a field emission (FE) SEM LEO-1530 Gemini (Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany).
