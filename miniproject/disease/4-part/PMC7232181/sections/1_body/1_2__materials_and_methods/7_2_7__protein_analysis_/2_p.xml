<p>Supernatants were collected at 30 min and 4 h p.i. and transferred to an antibody-coated 96-well plate in duplicates (Human TNF-α ELISA Kit, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and subsequently analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the identification of SP-A, we used NCI-H441-cells and performed the infection as previously described [
 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Next, 4 h and 18 h p.i. cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (RIPA (20 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X 100, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Naβ-Glycerophosphate, 20mM Sodium-Pyrophosphate, 0.2 mM Pefablock, 5 µg/mL leupeptin, 5 µg/mL aprotinin, 1mM sodium vanadate and 5mM benzamidine) for 30min at 4 °C. Centrifugation at 4 °C was utilized for clearing the cell lysate from debris. Afterwards, the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method. For this, the concentration was adjusted to the lowest concentration with RIPA buffer and treated with Laemmli-buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, CA, USA). The samples obtained this way were transferred in duplicates to a coated 96-well plate (Human SFTPA1/Surfactant Protein A ELISA Kit, Sandwich ELISA, LifeSpan BioSciences, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) and the procedure was performed following manufacturer’s instructions. The optical density (OD)
 <sub>450</sub> was determined by the microplate reader SPECTROstar Omega (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Deutschland). The protein concentration was calculated by comparison to a standard curve.
