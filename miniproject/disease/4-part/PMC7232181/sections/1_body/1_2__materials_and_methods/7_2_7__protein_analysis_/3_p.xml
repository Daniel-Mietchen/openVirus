<p>For the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a LEGENDplex™ Human Inflammation Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) was used. Alveolar biochips were infected as previously described and 4 h p.i. supernatants were collected. 25 µL of each sample was transferred in duplicates into the 96-well filter plate and the LEGENDplex panel was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were measured the same day on a flow cytometer (BD, Accuri, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and the cytokine amount was calculated by comparison to a standard curve. </p>
