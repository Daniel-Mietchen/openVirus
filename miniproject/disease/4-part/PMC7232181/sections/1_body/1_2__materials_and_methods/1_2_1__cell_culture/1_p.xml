<p>For the single cell-culture, we use alveolar epithelial cells. The human adenocarcinoma cell line NCI-H441 (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) was cultivated in RPMI-medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma Life Science, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The cell line was sub-cultured in the laboratory and tested for contamination with mycoplasma. NCI-H441 cells were grown up to 80% confluence before being sub-cultured and used until the 18th passage.</p>
