<p>The bacterial infection on NCI-H441 cells was performed with RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 1% human serum albumin (HSA) and 1mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES). The epithelial side of the human alveolus-on-a-chip model was infected with RPMI/BA (10% autologous human serum, 1 mM HEPES, 10 ng/mL GM-CSF) with bacteria (MOI 5). After the bacterial infection was performed, cells were incubated with bacteria for 90 min at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Afterwards, the cells were washed. To eliminate the non-internalized bacteria, cells were treated for 20 min with RPMI-medium containing lysostaphin at a concentration of 6 µg/mL for the NCI-H441 mono-cell culture and 20 µg/mL for the human alveolus-on-a-chip model. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with RPMI for indicated time points at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>.
