<p>Although SP-A is mainly produced by alveolar-epithelial type II cells, other cell types, such as endothelial and immune cells, are in close contact with each other within the alveolus. The different cell types interact via cytokines and influence each other, which cannot be reproduced in vitro in a mono-cell culture system. Consequently, the response to infection in the lung is highly complex and requires appropriate model systems where different cell types interact with each other. Frequently used models to study infections are mice. Here, the infection can be analyzed in the complete organ, including damages in the alveolar structures. Yet, the mice models have some disadvantages. (i) The cells are of murine origin and in particular immune functions can largely differ from human cells. For example, the action of defined bacterial toxins (e.g., superantigens and leucocidins) can be very species-specific and largely restricted to human cells [

To counter these disadvantages, we recently published a human-alveolus-on-a-chip model that is composed of defined cell types (epithelial, endothelial and immune cells) of human origin [
