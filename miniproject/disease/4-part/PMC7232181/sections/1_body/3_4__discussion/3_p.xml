<p>The deficiency of surfactant proteins can lead to various diseases. First of all, in premature infants, the insufficient surfactant production causes neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A decreased SP-A level in amniotic fluid of the mother seems to be associated with an increased risk for the infant to be born with RDS [
 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, infants with RDS have decreased SP-A level in tracheal aspirates [

 <xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and increases the amount of surfactant [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and especially SP-A and SP-B [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] in the fetal lung. The second therapy strategy is the postnatal administration of surfactant [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Early administration of surfactant reduces the risk of pneumothorax and decreases mortality rates in preterm children [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Particularly the combined use of corticosteroids and surfactant therapy improves the outcome of infants with RDS [
