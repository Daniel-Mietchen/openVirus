<p>Surfactant proteins interact with several pathogens, among others, with IAV [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During the IAV invasion into the lung, the viral hemagglutinin binds to sialic acid residues on the surface of epithelial cells to initiate viral internalization [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) also presents sialic acid residues to bind IAV [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The agglutination of SP-A reduces the infectivity and dissemination of the virus and supports its clearance by immune cells [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-00577" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, SP-A promotes aggregation and phagocytosis of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> by neutrophils and macrophages and inhibits bacterial adherence to the epithelial layer, thus preventing the bacterial penetration into the host cells [
