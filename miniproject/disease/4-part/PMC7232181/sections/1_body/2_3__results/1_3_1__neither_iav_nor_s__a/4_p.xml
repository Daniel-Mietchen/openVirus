<p>Macrophage differentiation from monocytes was proven by performing single-cell experiments with hMdM. Here we can demonstrate that macrophages react on their mRNA expression level after challenging with pathogens. All cells infected with virus, bacteria or both, had a significantly higher level of CD80 (mRNA) than the mock-treated cells (
