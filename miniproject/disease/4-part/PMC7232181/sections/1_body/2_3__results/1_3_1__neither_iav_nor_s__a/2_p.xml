<p>After mono-infection with IAV or 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and after co-infection, SP-A mRNA-expression was not changed. By contrast, treatment with TNF-Î±, a well-known suppressor of SP-A, resulted in significantly decreased SP-A mRNA expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00577-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Next, we evaluated the protein levels of SP-A in epithelial supernatants. Here we were able to show that SP-A is significantly decreased after 18 h of bacterial mono- or co-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00577-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). This finding can be attributed to the cysteine protease staphopain A (ScpA, ssPA) that cleaves SP-A. We have verified the presence of ssPA in the bacterial strain 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 by using the PanStaph Alere Genotyping Kit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00577-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Here, we were able to demonstrate that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 disposes of a large number of virulence factors. For instance, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain USA300 expresses leucocidins (lukS, lukF), phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) [
