<p>Our results show a high viral load (PFU/mL) 4 days p.i. (

Comparable to our in vitro results, we could clearly show that the SP-A expression within the bacterial mono- and co-infection was down-regulated four days after infection, whereas IAV did not cause a down-regulation in SP-A expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00577-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). To further analyze the effect of viral and/or bacterial infection in the murine model system, we performed histopathological staining of the lung tissue. In mock-treated mice we recognized a fine and healthy alveolar structure. In infected animals, we detected an inflammatory infiltration of the alveolar structures that was caused by a bacterial, viral or co-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00577-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). These results indicate that infections can trigger lung inflammation by different mechanisms that can be dependent (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection) or independent (IAV infection) on SP-A expression.
