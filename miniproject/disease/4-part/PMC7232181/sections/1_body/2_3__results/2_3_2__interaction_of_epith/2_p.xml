<p>To evaluate the impact of the infection and subsequent TNF-Î± expression on the production of SP-A, we measured the SP-A protein content by immunofluorescence staining in the human alveolus-on-a-chip model following infection with IAV, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> or co-infection (

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and in the co-infection scenario (
