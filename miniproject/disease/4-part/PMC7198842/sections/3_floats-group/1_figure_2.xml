  <p>Immune cell infiltration in CHIKV infected tissues: the primary target organs during CHIKV infection include liver, spleen, joints, and kidney. As the virus is disseminated to these sites during acute phase, it infects non-hematopoietic cells. Active viral replication within these cells generate viral dsRNA and ssRNA which is recognized by RLR and NLR leading to downstream activation of NF-κB and phosphorylation of IRF3 results in type-I IFNs and cytokine production within cells. Increase amount of IFNs in extracellular matrix activates IFNARs leading phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT1 and STAT2 in the presence of IRF9 results in activation of IFN stimulating genes. The presence of viral dsRNA and pro-inflammatory cytokines within these cells also activates OAS and PKR. Downstream of PKR activation is the generation of initiation factor eIF2a leading to a translational arrest. On the other hand, OAS once triggered generates RNase L which degrades viral RNA. In case of hematopoietic cells, endosomal TLRs recognize viral dsRNA. Downstream of TLR7, MyD88-IRAK-1-IRAF4-TRAF6 complex is recruited leading to phosphorylation of IkB. Likewise, signaling downstream of TLR3 involves the recruitment of TRIF. TRIF further interacts with TRAF6 and TRAF3. This complex recruits kinase RIP-1 triggering IRF3 and IRF7 phosphorylation downstream of TBK1 activation as well as IkB phosphorylation. These events lead to NF-κB dependent induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-α and IFN-β. Cytokines within these cells also produce inflammasomes downstream of AIM2, which promotes apoptosis by cleaving pro-caspase1 to caspase1. Active IL-1β production is also enhanced during this event. The pro-inflammatory cytokines are also released extracellularly, generating a cytokine rich milieu and attracting other immune cells causing cellular infiltration.
