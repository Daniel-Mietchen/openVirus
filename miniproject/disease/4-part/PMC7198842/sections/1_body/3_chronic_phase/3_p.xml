<p>Another hallmark of the chronic phase is bone erosion and degradation of extracellular matrix in joints, causing chronic arthralgia in CHIKD patients. Key players of the mechanism involved in bone erosion are resident macrophages, CCL2, IL-6, RANKL (

 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>); degradation of the extracellular matrix, meanwhile, is mediated by several factors such as fibroblast-like synoviocytes IL-1, TNF-α, Janus kinase, ERK, c-jun, and c-fos. These molecules, in turn, activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in chondrocytes that promote extracellular matrix degradation during the chronic phase (
