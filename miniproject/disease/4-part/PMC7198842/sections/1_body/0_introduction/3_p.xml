<p>CHIKD establishes itself and progresses to a prolonged malady involving the joints over a period of time. As the virus infects an individual, there is a period of intrinsic incubation before the clinical symptoms appear and the disease progresses. The disease can then be clinically categorized into acute, post-acute, and chronic phases that can last for a few days up to several months, mainly depending on the individual's immune response to the virus (
