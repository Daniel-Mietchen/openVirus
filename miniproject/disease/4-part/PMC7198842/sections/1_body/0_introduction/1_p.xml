<p>Chikungunya disease (CHIKD), caused by an arthritogenic alphavirus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), is becoming a major public health hazard (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The past few decades have seen the re-emergence of this viral infection as evidenced by epidemics in Africa, Asia, Europe and, in recent years, the Americas (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The first report of this infection dates back to the 1900s; it was then confused with dengue and was largely underreported (

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was the primary vector (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It was identified that specific mutations in the viral E1 glycoprotein provided fitness to the virus by reducing its extrinsic incubation period within the mosquito and thereby was transmitted by the vector over a longer period of time (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Post-2005, the virus spread to different parts of the globe either by travelers or autochthonous outbreaks in tropical and temperate climates involving both mosquito species (
