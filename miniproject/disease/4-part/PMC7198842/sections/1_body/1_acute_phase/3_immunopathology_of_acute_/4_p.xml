<p>During the acute phase, anti-CHIKV IgM could be detected in sera samples of patients and mice from day 3 onwards after the onset of clinical symptoms (

 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) whereas the anti-CHIKV IgG with neutralizing activity is produced from day 4 (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Detection of Anti-CHIKV IgG is mostly rare during the initial days (&lt;4 days) of infection (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Several studies have also established a correlation between antibodies response with cytokine levels, viral titres, and disease progression during the acute and chronic phases (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Patients with high virus titres in the acute phase or viremic phase triggered the production of Anti-CHIKV IgG3 antibodies which are strongly involved in protection against chronicity or arthralgia conditions whereas patients with low virus titres associated with chronic arthralgia (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). This suggested that high virus titres in the acute phase seem to induce high titer of Anti-CHIKV antibodies which protect against chronic stages of CHIKD (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). Additionally, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> null mice showed lower levels of anti-CHIKV antibodies along with significantly reduced neutralizing activity (
