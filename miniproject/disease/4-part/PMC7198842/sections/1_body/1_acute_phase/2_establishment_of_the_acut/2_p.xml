<p>Viral replication in fibroblast cells (primary site of infection) is initially limited by a rapid and robust induction of interferons (IFN-β) and downstream signaling molecules. Interferons help to recruit immune cells that sense the viruses within the infected cells. This sensing may involve the specific pathogen-associated motifs like viral nucleic acids, that are recognized by pattern recognition molecules/receptors (PPRs); these receptors can be cytoplasmic [e.g., Class I—NOD-like Receptors (NLRs), retinoic inducible gene-I like receptors (RLRs), melanoma differentiation factor (MDA)-5, laboratory of genetics and physiology (LGP)-2, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), Gamma-interferon-inducible (IFI) protein-16 and Class II—Protein kinase R (PKR), DNA sensor AIM2 and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)-3] (
