<p id="Par6">The high level of seroreversion can be explained by three scenarios. First, seroreversion in HIV-positive individuals may be associated with lower magnitudes of ZIKV-specific immune responses compared to other subpopulations, consistent with generally lower antibody responses of HIV-positive individuals, e.g., following hepatitis A virus vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the decrease of ELISA ratios in all analyzed subpopulations speaks against this scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Second, cross-reactive antibodies elicited by prior infection with flaviviruses other than ZIKV might have elicited false-positive ZIKV results during first testing. Cross-reactivity of dengue-specific IgG with ZIKV NS1 antigen has been well documented, ranging from 83.3% 3–6 months to 28.1% 1–2 years after secondary dengue infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. If this was the case, patients that are ZIKV antibody positive in both timepoints might show different DENV-reactive antibody responses than serorevertants and participants that were ZIKV-negative in both timepoints. However, our data showed no difference in a DENV-reactive ELISA between the groups in 2016, suggesting comparable exposure to the hyperendemic DENV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Unfortunately, due to low sample volumes, no further test of the DENV antibody response in 2018 was performed. Next, to assess the specificity of the observed ZIKV reactive antibody responses, samples were analyzed by plaque reduction neutralization assays (PRNT) as previously described (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In total, 30.0% (24/85) of the ZIKV NS1-ELISA-positive participants in 2016 where positive by PRNT. Compared to ELISA, PRNT is more specific, but also less sensitive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We observed that patients that seroreverted also had significantly lower PRNT titers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e) and ZIKV NS1-ELISA ratio (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f) at enrollment than patients that remained positive in both timepoints. On the one hand, this may imply unspecific ELISA results at enrollment, hypothetically due to differences in the time since exposure to the hyperendemic DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that hypothetically unspecific results should not have occurred in the sera sampled 2 years later during 2018, because DENV immune responses are usually long-lasting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It thus seems likely that higher PRNT titers and ELISA ratios in study participants that remained positive over time represent stronger immune responses. The last explanation for our data could be that the lower responses observed may be limited to NS1-specific antibodies, which are elicited in infected individuals at much lower magnitude than antibodies against the ZIKV envelope antigen that also remain elevated for longer periods of time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].
