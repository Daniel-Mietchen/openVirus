<p id="Par4">A total of 144 samples were taken from individuals on 2 occasions. The samples from the first timepoint correspond to a cross-sectional study conducted at the University Hospital Professor Edgard Santos (UHPES) in Salvador de Bahia, which is one of the biggest public hospitals in the region, between February and May 2016 during the end of the ZIKV epidemic [

Samples belong to three different subpopulations: immunologically stable HIV-positive patients and healthy individuals from the UHPES and treated tuberculosis patients from the José Silveira Foundation-Brazilian Institute for Investigation of Tuberculosis. These populations were selected due to their regular visits to the hospital, which was the only inclusion criterion for this study. The follow-up assessment was performed to the same subpopulations 1.5–2 years later (median 1.8, IQR 1.5–1.9 years), between August 2017 and February 2018, through new interviews and blood collections (IRB number 2.326.141). Follow-up serum samples were obtained from 28 patients on treatment for active pulmonary tuberculosis; 93 immunologically stable HIV-positive patients under antiretroviral therapy; and 23 healthy individuals. Samples from both timepoints were tested using a highly sensitive real time RT-PCR [

Although there was no RT-PCR confirmation of acute ZIKV infection, it is likely that ZIKV antibody responses are largely comparable between study participants, since all of them were likely infected in a very similar time span during 2015–2016, due to the ultra-rapid ZIKV spread in Salvador, northeastern Brazil [
