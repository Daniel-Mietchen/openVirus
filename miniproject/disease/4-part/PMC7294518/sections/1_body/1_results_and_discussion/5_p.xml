<p id="Par8">Our serologic data from Brazil are thus consistent with data from Pacific island populations in showing loss of ZIKV-specific antibody responses over a comparably short time span irrespective of the serologic method used for testing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since NS1-based serologic tests are widely used, it is possible that future seroprevalence studies will underestimate ZIKV spread, particularly in immunocompromised populations. This could also be the case for Africa, where despite the recent introduction of the Asian lineage from Latin America potentially causing congenital malformations, seroprevalence is several orders of magnitude lower than the observed for the Pacific islands or Latin America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The combination of NS1-specific antibodies with other antigens and tests may be necessary to increase the reliability of future seroprevalence studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The relevance of an adequate determination of the flaviviral serostatus is illustrated by the interaction between DENV and ZIKV antibodies that may both protect from and enhance subsequent infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and by the growing number of flaviviruses that cocirculate in Brazil, for which their potential immune interplay is largely unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since Brazil has licensed a DENV vaccine, adequate determination of the ZIKV serostatus and its potential interplay with DENV vaccination is crucial. Finally, studies analyzing long-lasting ZIKV-specific immune response are needed, as ZIKV immunity in flavivirus endemic countries might be shorter than previously thought. Decreasing individual-level immune responses in addition to the replenishment of susceptible individuals by birth and migration may sufficiently reduce community protective immunity to allow ZIKV resurgence.
