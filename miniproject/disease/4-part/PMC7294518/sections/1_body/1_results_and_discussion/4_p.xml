<p id="Par7">Irrespective of the complex underlying reasons, the observed decrease in ZIKV NS1-specific antibody levels over time was reminiscent of the complete lack of seroconversion in follow-up samples of two different cohorts. First, from RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infections in travelers using the same NS1-based serologic test 42Â days post onset of symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Second, from a recent serological survey in the Pacific islands following patients during a 2-year period, showing a marked decrease in ZIKV overall seroprevalence in French Polynesia from 37 to 22% and in Fiji from 24 to 12% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This decrease was observed for ZIKV and not for DENV, which causes sporadic outbreaks in the Pacific [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, DENV NS1-specific IgG antibodies were readily detected up to three years post-infection in Brazilian patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Those data are not at odds with our results, because DENV seroprevalence is as high as 80% in northeastern Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and individuals frequently have multiple DENV infections likely boosting NS1-specific immune responses compared to ZIKV, which exists as a single serotype.
