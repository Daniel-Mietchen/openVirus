<p id="Par5">Brazil acquired millions of ZIKV NS1 antigen-based indirect ELISA tests (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) for serological testing in public health laboratories [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We used the same NS1-based ELISA to compare detection between the paired serum samples from 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and 2017–2018. The ZIKV seropositivity in the first timepoint in 2016 reached 59.0% (85/144, 95% confidence interval (CI) 50.7–66.7%) in concordance with the 63% seroprevalence from a serologic survey performed at the UHPES in 2015–2016 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, this seropositivity later decreased to 38.6% (56/144, CI 31.3–47.0%) 1.5–2 years later (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Of the 59 ZIKV-negative individuals in 2016, only 1 individual belonging to the healthy individuals subpopulation seroconverted 2 years later, consistent with near-complete lack of ZIKV activity in northeastern Brazil after the large initial outbreak [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, c, median ELISA reactivity for seropositive individuals that remained seropositive in 2017/2018 decreased significantly from a ratio of 4.4 (the ratio is built by dividing sample reactivity by the reactivity of a calibrator provided in the kit; 95% CI 3.8–5.0) to 1.6 (95% CI 1.6–1.9) over the 2-year interval (positivity threshold of the kit is a ratio of 1.1.; 
 <italic>Z</italic> − 6.1; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) irrespective of which subpopulation was analyzed. Among the initially seronegative individuals, median ELISA reactivity was almost identical between both time points (0.36–0.37; 
 <italic>Z</italic> − 0.1; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.88) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Remarkably, 30 individuals (20.6%; 95% CI 14.9–28.4) that were seropositive in 2016 were seronegative for ZIKV in 2017–2018, the majority of which (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25; 83.3%) were HIV-positive individuals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, c). The level of seroreversion did not differ significantly among HIV-positive and tuberculosis patients [25 serorevertants (26.9%) versus 5 serorevertants (17.8%); Fisher, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.23], whereas seroreversion occurred significantly less frequently in healthy individuals (1 serorevertant; 4.3%) than in HIV-positive patients (Fisher, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).
