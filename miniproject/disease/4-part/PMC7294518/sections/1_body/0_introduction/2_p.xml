<p id="Par3">ZIKV was first detected in 1947 in Uganda [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Later in 2007, ZIKV emerged in the Pacific island of Yap, in 2013 in French Polynesia and other Pacific islands and from there expanding to mainland Latin America in 2015 causing the biggest outbreak to date [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The limited serologic surveys that are available found a high-level population exposure reaching from 42% in French Polynesia and 49% in Martinique, to as much as 63% in mainland America, specifically Brazil [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, isolated island populations might not be comparable to mainland America. The Pacific islands are a diverse region in which the combined population consists of approximately 2.3 million people and the island surface usually extends over a few thousand km
 <sup>2</sup> only. In contrast, Brazil has 210 million inhabitants spread over 8 million km
 <sup>2</sup> (latest

In Brazil, as other Latin American countries, cocirculation of other flaviviruses such as DENV, Yellow fever virus, Bussuquara, Cacipacoré, Ilhéus, Rocio and Saint Louis encephalitis virus might elicit unique flaviviral antibody responses that impact ZIKV-specific antibody kinetics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Nonetheless, long-term antibody kinetics of individuals infected with ZIKV in Brazil are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a prospective observational cohort study monitoring putative ZIKV circulation and antibody responses over time of individuals infected with ZIKV in the metropolitan region of Salvador, Brazil.
