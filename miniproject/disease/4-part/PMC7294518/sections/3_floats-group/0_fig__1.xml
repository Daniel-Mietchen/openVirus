   <bold>a</bold> Zika virus NS1-IgG seropositivity in 2016 (shown in black) and in 2017–2018 (shown in gray) in the HIV patients (HIV), tuberculosis patients (TB), healthy individuals (HI) subpopulations and total patients analyzed for the prospective study. 
   <bold>b</bold> Comparison between the ZIKV NS1-specific IgG ratios during the epidemic (2016) and follow-up (2017–2018). Heavy lines (horizontal and vertical) correspond to the positivity cut-off ratio of 1.1 suggested by the manufacturer. Diagonal line divides the results among positive individuals in both time points who had an increase in the ratio of the follow-up sample (above) compared to the first one and the individuals whose value of the ratio decreased (below). 
   <bold>c</bold> Zika virus NS1–IgG ratio per subpopulation. Colors as in 
   <bold>b</bold>. 
   <bold>d</bold> Dengue IgG ratios in 2016 between patients that remained positive in both timepoints (++), patients that seroreverted (+−), patients that seroconverted (−+) and patients that remained negative in both timepoints (–). Colors as in 
   <bold>b</bold>. 
   <italic>n.s.</italic> not significant. 
   <bold>e</bold> Zika virus specific plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Double asterisk denotes
