  <p>Changes of Influenza B virus (IBV)-regulated cellular genes over time. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Counts of genes up-regulated (expression level increase is ≥2 fold) or down-regulated (expression level reduction is ≥½) are shown in red or light blue bars, respectively. Differential expression statistical analysis was conducted using DESeq. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Gene expression Dynamics. A total of 4365 genes showing changed expression at one or more time points (6, 12, and 24 hpi). Each gene’s temporal expression dynamics is displayed as a line with a color according to its expression fold change at a time point post IBV infection. A fold change spectrum is shown as the reference.
