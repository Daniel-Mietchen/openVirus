  <p>Expression levels of cellular genes in the context of functional category upon IBV infection. The functional categories and included genes with significant expression level changes upon IBV infection are shown below the bar graph. Each bar represents the average reads of 2 repeats for the gene at a time point. The orange, green, blue, and red bars indicate reads of each gene at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hpi, respectively. Differential expression statistical analysis was conducted using DESeq.</p>
