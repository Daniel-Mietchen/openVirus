<p>We also deployed the RT-qPCR approach to validate RNA-Seq data on IFN-α and IFN-α7 expression. We also included IRF-3 gene in our validation because RNA-Seq experiment did not reveal a significant change of IRF-3 gene expression in A549 cells following IBV infection. As summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f005">Figure 5</xref>, RT-qPCR data showed that only approximately 1.5-fold increase of IRF-3 gene expression was found in infected A549 cells at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. Despite statistically significant differences of IRF3 gene expression observed at 12 and 24 hpi when compared to 0h hpi (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), we viewed that IRF-3 gene expression was slightly increased in A549 cells in response to IBV infection. RT-qPCR data appeared to be in agreement with the RNA-Seq result where we found that the fold-change for IRF-3 when compared to 0h hpi was 1.16 (6 hpi), 1.38 (12 hpi), and 1.14 (24 hpi), respectively (data not shown). For IFN-α and IFN-α7, similar to what was observed in RNA-Seq experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f003">Figure 3</xref>), these two genes were not significantly up regulated until 24 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Overall, these RT-qPCR data as summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f005">Figure 5</xref> are in agreement with those obtained in our RNA-Seq experiment (
