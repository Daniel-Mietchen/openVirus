<p>The up-regulated metabolic processes are mainly involved in synthesis and metabolism of biomolecules (RNA, lipids, protein, glycan, and nitrogen compound) and regulation of protein modifications (phosphorylation and ubiquitination) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00383">Table S1</xref>). The genes in the secretion process were also up regulated in response to IBV infection, possibly to enhance the secretion of cytokines and other extracellular molecules such as integrin and collagen. In contrast, we observed down-regulation of genes involved in synthesizing small molecules (
 <sc>l</sc>-serine, amino acid, and oxyacid) and their metabolic processes. Future study is needed to experimentally address the consequence of altered metabolic changes in cell physiology or in IBV replication and pathogenesis.
