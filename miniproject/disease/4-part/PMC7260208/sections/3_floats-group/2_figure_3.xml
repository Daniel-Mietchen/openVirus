  <p>RICS measurement of C-mCherry diffusion. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Representative confocal image of a BHK cell transfected with C-mCherry (4 hours post transfection). A ROI of 256 × 256 pixels (12.8 × 12.8 
   <italic>μm</italic>
   <sup>2</sup>) is selected for RICS analysis in nucleus and cytoplasm. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Representation of image shifting for RICS analysis for the nucleus and (
   <bold>c</bold>) the cytoplasm. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Obtained fitted function of an image correlation result in a ROI after averaging 100 consecutive frames (top) and corresponding residual plot (bottom). Pixel shift starting at 0 is plotted from the center. (
   <bold>e</bold>) Effective diffusion coefficients obtained from the autocorrelation function of C-mCherry motion in nucleus and cytoplasm from 3 to 6 hours post transfection. Each bar represents a measurement in a single cell. 40 measurements from at least 5 independent cell cultures are shown.
