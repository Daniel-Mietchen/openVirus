 </sup>. In order to analyze the dynamics of C protein in vivo during one infectious viral cycle, we generated a recombinant full-length viral genomic construct encoding a C protein fused to mCherry coding sequence, in the context of a genome with a duplicated C coding region to ensure the function of RNA cis-acting elements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)

 </sup>. Transfections of transcribed viral RNA into mosquito or mammalian cells led to amplification of the viral genome and productive infections. In order to examine whether the fusion C-mCherry protein behaves as the WT C protein, we performed viral RNA transfections with the WT and the recombinant viral genomes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis using specific antibodies against C protein for the WT virus resembled that observed with the C-mCherry, analyzed by direct visualization of the fluorescent protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d,e</xref>). The viral protein C and C-mCherry were found in the cytoplasm, nucleolus and lipid droplets. Therefore, this system was employed to investigate the properties of C protein in a viral replication cycle.
