<p id="Par29">The difference in the connectivity maps calculated using the same stack of images at different pixel distances is evident. At 4 pixels distance, the connectivity map obtained from the pCF analysis shows an empty nucleoli interior and no organized movement around it. These results have two possible interpretations: (i) C-mCherry inside nucleoli is diffusing in a highly isotropic manner, or (ii) C-mCherry is not moving when inside nucleoli. The comparison between pCF(4) and pCF(16) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b,e</xref>) shows regions in the nucleoli where the anisotropy at larger distances becomes evident, suggesting the occurrence of barriers at the nucleoli-nucleoplasm interface, which are not visible in the short scale analysis with short pixel distances.
