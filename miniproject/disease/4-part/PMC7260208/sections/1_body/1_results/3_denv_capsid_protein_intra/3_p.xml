<p id="Par20">A 2D-pCF analysis was calculated at a distance of 8 pixels (640 nm apart) applied to a stack of 8192 consecutive frames (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In all the experiments, images with a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels were taken. The average intensity from the complete stack of images from a nucleus was measured 6 hours post viral RNA transfection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Intensity scales is color-coded from red (highest) to blue (lowest). At this time scale, when viral translation and RNA replication are actively ongoing, the C protein heavily accumulates in nucleoli (bright red, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In contrast, the nucleoplasm is visualized as a region of low intensity. In addition, the cytoplasm clearly shows higher concentration of that observed in the nucleoplasm, delineating an interface at the nuclear membrane.
