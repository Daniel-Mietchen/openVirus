<p id="Par25">The four histograms are not distinguishable, indicating that further analysis is required. The four images (C-mCherry, the randomized, the synthetic, and mCherry control) were compared by means of the quadratic color difference of consecutive pixels. This analysis consisted of calculating, for each non-black pixel in the image, the color difference (angular direction difference) between neighbor pixels in every direction. The resulting distributions of the sum of the quadratic color differences between neighbor pixels for the four analyzed images is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>. While the distributions for the two synthetic images with the control experiment are not statistically different, there is a significant difference (P &lt; 0.001, two-tailed paired t-test) between them and the anisotropy distribution for the C-mCherry containing cells. The difference becomes clearer in a logarithmic scale plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6j</xref>). These results indicate that during DENV infection, there is a high contribution of small differences between colors of neighbor pixels, which does not occur when the colors are randomized in the image or when a new set of random colors are assigned, nor even in the control experiment with free mCherry.
