<p id="Par14">After fitting, an average effective diffusion coefficient for each imaged area was obtained at different viral RNA transfection times (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Each one of the vertical bars in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> represents one successful fitting result, yielding values between 1–4
