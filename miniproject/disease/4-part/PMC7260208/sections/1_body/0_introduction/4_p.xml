<p id="Par5">Because, for most intracellular cases, molecules move in environments where obstacles to diffusion might exist, the possibility to visualize the path followed by molecules could unveil new aspects of their functions. Recently, a method based on cross correlating the intensity fluctuations at specific points in an image was proposed

 </sup>. By correlating the signal at every pair of pixels, the two-dimensional pair Correlation Function (2D-pCF) determines the time for a particle to go from one location to another, allowing to create a visual map of the molecular average trajectories. This represents a breakthrough in the understanding of cell spatial organization and molecular functions.
