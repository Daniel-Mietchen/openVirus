<p id="Par2">Dengue virus (DENV) is the most significant arthropod-borne viral infection in humans. This virus belongs to the flavivirus genus, together with other important human pathogens, including Zika, Yellow Fever and West Nile viruses. Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that causes large outbreaks and epidemics around the world. In the Americas, the number of dengue infections alarmingly increased in the last decade

 </sup>. Despite the urgent need of controlling DENV infections, lack of understanding of molecular mechanisms of viral replication and interaction with the host cell limits the development of antiviral strategies. In this study, we investigated properties of one of the DENV structural proteins, the capsid (C) protein. This protein participates in two fundamental processes in the viral life cycle: genome encapsidation and genome uncoating. However, the mechanisms by which the C protein functions in these processes is largely unknown (for review see reference
