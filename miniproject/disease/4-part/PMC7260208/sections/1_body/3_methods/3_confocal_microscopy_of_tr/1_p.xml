<p id="Par38">For laser scanning confocal microscopy experiments, images were acquired with a LSM 880 (Zeiss) inverted microscope and a C-Apochromat 40X/1.2 water-immersion objective (Zeiss). All experiments were carried out using a detection pinhole size of 1 Airy disk unit. During the experiment time, cells were kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> temperature-controlled chamber (Pecon). Excitation wavelength was set at 543 nm using a He-Ne green laser (Lasos) and intensities chosen to achieve high photon count rate per molecule to maximize the signal/noise ratio but low enough to prevent molecular photobleaching and phototoxicity processes. The obtained photon count rates per molecule ranged from 1 kcps to 20 kcps approximately. Fluorescence emission was collected between 550 − 650 nm using a spectral filter (Quasar detector) and detection performed by GaAsp detector (Hamamatsu) in photon counting mode. For RICS measurements a sequential image series at a fixed pixel size of 50 nm and with a pixel dwell time of 16
