<p id="Par39">In a typical RICS experiment, data is collected using a confocal (or two photon) laser scanning microscope. A sample is raster scanned with a pixel dwell time which is generally on the order of few microseconds and the pixel size is set to be smaller (about a factor of 3–5) than the waist of the PSF (Point Spread Function). Each line of the scan has duration in the millisecond range and the entire frame is acquired in times on the order of 1 s. One image is enough to calculate the RICS correlation function. However, to increase the statistic and, subtract the immobile features or very slow-motion objects in the image (for example due to the cell movement), a stack of about 50 to 100 images is generally acquired. The subtraction made in this analysis was considering a moving average, this is, the average of a certain range of consecutive frames is calculated and subtracted for the frame in the middle of this range. Every frame will have a subtraction except for a group of frames in the beginning and in the end of the time series. For example, if 100 frames are image and the moving average is calculated with 10 frames, then average between frames 1–10 will be subtracted from frame 5, doing so until frame 95 which will be the last one in the analysis.</p>
