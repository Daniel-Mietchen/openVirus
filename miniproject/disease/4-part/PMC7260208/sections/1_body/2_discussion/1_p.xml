<p id="Par31">The DENV C protein plays multiple functions and associates to several viral and host components in different compartments of the infected cell. However, the relevance of these interactions and the implications of its subcellular localization remain unknown. In this work, we revealed, for the first time, a spatially heterogenous mobility of DENV C protein in different cellular compartments during the infectious cycle. We applied advanced image correlation techniques that are non-invasive, do not need to perturb the system and achieve single molecule resolution in bulk experiments.</p>
