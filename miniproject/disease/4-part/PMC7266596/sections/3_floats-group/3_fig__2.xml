  <p>Histologic (A and B) and immunohistochemical (C) localization of mammary IgA-secreting cells, and expression of mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) (D) and chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25) (E) by immunofluorescent (IF) staining in the mammary gland tissue of PEDV naïve gilts. (A) Hematoxylin and eosin–stained mammary gland tissue of a gilt at 4 days post-farrowing, showing fully expanded alveoli, with mostly empty lumens. (B) Higher magnification of Panel A (inset), showing clusters of plasma cells characterized by the typical peripheral nuclei in the abundant cytoplasm in the interlobular stroma. Original magnification, ×200 (A) and ×400 (B). (C) Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained mammary gland tissue of a gilt at 5 days post-farrowing, showing a moderate number of IgA-positive cells (dark brown) in the intralobular or interlobular stroma (arrows). Original magnification, ×200. IHC was done using a polyclonal goat antibody to pig IgA conjugated with peroxidase (Bio-RAD) and DAB substrate. (D) IF-stained mammary gland tissue of a gilt at 4 days pre-farrowing, showing moderate expression of MAdCAM-1 (green) on the endothelial cells lining the intralobular and interlobular vessels (arrows). Original magnification, ×200. (E) IF-stained mammary gland tissue of a gilt at 4 days post-farrowing, showing moderate expression of CCL25 (green) on the endothelial cells lining the intralobular and interlobular vessels (arrows). Original magnification, ×200. IF staining was done using monoclonal antibodies against human MAdCAM-1 and CCL25 (Novus Biologicals).</p>
