<p id="par0085">We demonstrated the tissue tropism of PEDV to certain intestinal locations (
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2018</xref>). During acute PEDV infection [post-inoculation hour (PIH) 12â€“24] in nursing pigs, PEDV initially infected mainly the mid-jejunum and ileum and to a lesser extent, the proximal and distal jejunum and duodenum (

 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Unlike colonic enterocytes, PEDV-infected small intestinal villous enterocytes undergo acute necrosis and exfoliation from the lamina propria, leading to marked villous atrophy or fusion in the small intestine (
