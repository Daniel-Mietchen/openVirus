<p id="par0090">During acute PEDV infection (PIH 12â€“24) of nursing pigs, early localization of PEDV antigen was evident in the villous-crypt interface of the small intestine, rather than the villous tips (

 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2018</xref>), further studies are needed to investigate whether PEDV or PEDV-loaded CD3 + T cells circulating in blood reach and infect the villous-crypt interface or other villous regions, and other types of cells of extra-intestinal origin (
