<p id="par0120">The minimum infectious dose [0.56 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>)] of non-S INDEL PEDV required to infect 5-day-old nursing pigs was lower than for 3-week-old weaned pigs (56 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) (
 <xref rid="bib0685" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2015a</xref>). Similarly, 3 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/pig of the non-S INDEL PC22A strain caused diarrhea in 100 % of 4-day-old Cesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets (

Compared with nursing pigs that began to show diarrhea, villous atrophy, and fecal virus shedding at PID 1, a longer incubation time of non-S INDEL PEDV was required for weaned pigs to show fecal virus shedding (1 more day), or diarrhea and lesions (2 more days) (
