<p id="par0110">In infected gnotobiotic or conventional nursing piglets (1−10-day-old), a few (&lt;5%) to all of the inoculated pigs began to show diarrhea at PID 1, which mostly coincided with or was detected several hours later than the first detection of viral RNA in serum or feces (

Fecal viral RNA titers shed peaked by PID 1, or occasionally, 1–3 days later, and the titers decreased remarkably during the middle to late stages of infection and then titers remained low (with at least one more recurrent peak, possibly due to PED re-infection of regenerating enterocytes) during the recovery stage of infection (

In infected conventional weaned to feeder pigs (21−56-day-old), a few (&lt;5%) to all of the inoculated pigs began to show diarrhea at PID 1–4, which coincided with or was detected 1−2 days later than the first detection of viral RNA in feces (
