 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2017b</xref>), is critical to prevent direct or indirect contact transmission of PEDV. Transport trailers (19/72 herds surveyed; 26.4 %) or feed (21/72 herds surveyed; 29.2 %) were thought to be the main contaminated fomites (55.6 % in total) in US swine farms during the 2013–2017 epidemic (
 <xref rid="bib0530" ref-type="bibr">Niederwerder and Hesse, 2018</xref>). Spillover of PEDV from PEDV-infected farms to others or wildlife should also be controlled through high quarantine protocols that should include no movement of pigs until the diarrhea is terminated and the disease is controlled (
 <xref rid="bib0530" ref-type="bibr">Niederwerder and Hesse, 2018</xref>). Indeed, 28 of 287 fecal samples (9.8 %) of wild boars in South Korea (2010–2011) were positive for PEDV RNA (
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), and 8 of 7997 serum samples (0.1 %) of US feral pigs during the 2013–2014 epidemic were PEDV-seropositive (
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Bevins et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of cross-species PEDV spillover in the maintenance and transmission of PEDV needs to be further studied.
