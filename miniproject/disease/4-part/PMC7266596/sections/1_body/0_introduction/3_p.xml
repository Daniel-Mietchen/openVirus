In China in 2016â€“2017, another new alphacoronavirus (bat HKU2-like), genetically distinct but clinically similar to the others, was identified in diarrheic pigs and was designated swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) (

 <xref rid="bib0550" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0790" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Clinical signs caused by these four porcine enteric coronaviruses are indistinguishable. Therefore, differential diagnosis is critical to control viral epidemic diarrheas in pigs. This review focuses on updating the current understanding of the etiology, transmission, pathogenesis, and prevention and control of PEDV infection.
