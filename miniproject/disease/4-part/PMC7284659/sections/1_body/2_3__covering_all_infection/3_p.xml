<p>As plant viruses are usually looked upon only from an agricultural perspective, plant viruses are mostly considered as a source of economic losses, and thus, as having a negative impact. Economical losses caused by viral pathogens infecting solanaceous plants can be illustrated by tomato-infecting begomoviruses that are mentioned among the top ten list for economically important viruses [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which reacted to a previous publication of the top 10 plant viruses in molecular plant pathology [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] where six out of ten viruses are infecting solanaceous hosts. Other cases include potato virus X (PVX), potato leafroll virus (PLRV) and PVY viruses infecting potato plants, causing economical losses worth 5.5 million US dollars in the UK [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], or TICV infecting tomato crops in California with estimated economical loss of 2 million US dollars [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This view may however be skewed, as the natural life cycles of plants and viruses are undoubtedly firmly connected by the obligate parasite-host relation between them. The ecological view on plant viruses, even though complex and still lacking sufficient data, can provide precious information for the fields of virology and epidemiology. These are also crucial information for the prevention of future epidemics, and sustainability of food security. The necessity to take into account the viruses present in wild plant populations has thus become more apparent, as we cannot expect to fully understand virus natural life cycles by only targeting cultivated crops [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], since viral cycles can be impacted by human alterations of numerous environmental variables as a consequence of agricultural practices aiming to increase yield. It is also becoming apparent that the extensive crop monocultures, lacking genetic heterogeneity, contribute to the emergence of plant viruses [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In wild ecosystems, plant viruses are subjected to more diverse and possibly stronger selection pressures, as a consequence of biotic and abiotic stress, more limited availability of suitable hosts and vectors or even of competition between viruses [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. At the same time, there are documented cases of crop-infecting viruses undergoing recombination in wild native plants, a clear demonstration of the potential role of wild species in the evolution of crop-infecting viruses. A good example of this situation concerns tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) and black nightshade, which was found to harbor mixed begomovirus infections more often, providing optimal conditions for the development of well adapted recombinants [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. At the other extreme, it has been suggested that under some conditions, it could be beneficial for a virus to preserve, or even improve its host plants fitness in order to increase its chances of successful transmission [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The virus dependence on plant populations is quite clear, as viruses can only replicate within host cells, but as mentioned previously, recent studies have highlighted some potentially positive effects of viruses on plants. For example, Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] reported increased drought tolerance in a number of plant species as a consequence of infection by several plant viruses, including tomato plants infected by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). These findings hint at the broad spectrum of plant virus functioning and of their ecological impact in a broader and hopefully clearer way.
