  <title>SEB administration prior to a sublethal PR8 infection results in reduced antiviral IgG2b levels.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were infected i.n. with 0.3 MLD
   <sub>50</sub> of PR8 three days after they received an i.p. injection of PBS or SEB (50 Î¼g). Three weeks after PR8 infection, mice were terminally bled, and the presence of PR8-specific IgG2b was evaluated in serially diluted serum samples as described in Materials and Methods. Error bars represent SEM. *, ** and *** denote statistically significant differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, respectively.
