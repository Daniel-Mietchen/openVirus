  <title>SEB administration prior to VacV immunization attenuates local and systemic T
   <sub>CD8</sub> responses to the immunodominant VacV-derived epitope.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Mice were injected i.p. with PBS or with 50 μg SEB three days before they received VacV i.p. On day 6 post-immunization, a time point at which VacV-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> responses reach their peak, peritoneal (B,D) and splenic (C,E) responses to indicated peptides were quantified by ICS for IFN-γ. Representative zebra plots in B and C illustrate the frequencies of peritoneal (local) and splenic (systemic) T
   <sub>CD8</sub> responses to F2L
   <sub>26</sub>, respectively. Summary data from PBS- and SEB-treated mice (n = 5/group pooled from two independent experiments) also depict subdominant responses to A52R
   <sub>75</sub> and E3L
   <sub>140</sub> (D,E). Error bars represent SEM, and * and ** denote significant differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively, using an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test.
