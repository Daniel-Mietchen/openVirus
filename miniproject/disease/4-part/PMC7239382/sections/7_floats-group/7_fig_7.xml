  <title>Intraperitoneal administration of SEB before sublethal PR8 infection enhances the splenic, but not the pulmonary, NP
   <sub>147</sub>-specific response.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Indicated numbers of BALB/c mice received no treatment or injected with PBS or SEB i.p. followed, 3 days later, by intranasal instillation of PBS or a 25-μL inoculum of infectious allantoic fluid approximating 0.3 MLD
   <sub>50</sub> of PR8. Weight loss was monitored for 10 days. (B) On day 4 post-infection, viral titres in the lungs and BAL were determined using a modified TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assay detailed in Materials and Methods. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. (C) Ten days after infection, lungs, spleens and BAL fluid were collected from separate cohorts from 5 independent experiments. Epitope-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were enumerated in each spleen and also in pooled lung and BAL samples by ICS for IFN-γ. Error bars represent SEM. * and ** denote significant differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively, using one-way ANOVA (A) or an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (C).
