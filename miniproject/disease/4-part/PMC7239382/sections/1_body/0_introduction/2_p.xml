<p>We previously demonstrated that Gram-positive bacterial SAgs can also activate invariant natural killer T (

This triggers a rapid and heavy-handed inflammatory response, typified by a ‘cytokine storm’, with rebound immunosuppression and susceptibility to potentially fatal secondary infections. Severe IAV infections can on their own cause a cytokine storm in a strain-dependent manner. This creates a complex scenario involving numerous inflammatory mediators with pathogenic or protective roles in host defense against IAV and secondary bacterial infections [
