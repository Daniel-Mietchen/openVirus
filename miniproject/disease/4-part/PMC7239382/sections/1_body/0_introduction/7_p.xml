<p>The impact of bacterial SAgs on T
 <sub>CD8</sub> immunodominance is unknown. This represents a gap in our understanding of host responses to vaccination or infection with IAVs and also to other viruses. Furthermore, how recall T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses to IAV may be manipulated by SAgs is unclear. Finally, whether the time point at which a SAg is encountered may change the immunization outcome is essentially unexplored. We have addressed the above questions by using multiple SAgs or SAg-sufficient/deficient bacteria in several 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> settings in which T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses could be monitored against wild-type (WT) and reassortant IAV strains, a live attenuated nasal flu vaccine, and vaccinia virus (VacV). The implications of our findings for sequential infections, superinfections, anti-IAV vaccination and heterosubtypic immunity will be discussed.
