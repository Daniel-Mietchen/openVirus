<p>To shed further mechanistic light on this phenomenon, we employed SEB
 <sub>N23A</sub> in parallel with SEB in our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. SEB
 <sub>N23A</sub> is a mutant SAg incapable of binding to mouse TCR Vβ8.2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. N23 (Asn
 <sup>23</sup>) should also mediate the reactivity of SEB with mouse Vβ8.3. This notion is supported by a previous report that several SEB variants carrying point mutations at this position (SEB
 <sub>N23S</sub>, SEB
 <sub>N23I</sub>, SEB
 <sub>N23Y</sub> and SEB
 <sub>N23K</sub>) induce only minimal interleukin (IL)-2 production by a Vβ8.3
 <sup>+</sup> hybridoma [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To understand how SEB targets and activates mouse T cells expressing Vβ8.3, we superimposed the β-chain from the crystal structure of mouse Vβ8.3/Vα3.3 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] onto the structure of the homologous mouse Vβ8.2 chain in complex with SEB [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and then built MHC class II into the complex from the SEB-HLA-DR1 crystal structure [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Based on this model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), SEB forms a ternary complex whereby the TCR is ‘wedged’ apart from the antigenic peptide displayed by MHC II, and the sidechain of SEB N23 engages three residues within CDR2β (Asn
 <sup>54</sup>, Leu
 <sup>55</sup> and Gln
 <sup>56</sup>), and likely forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the side chain of Vβ8.3 Asn
 <sup>54</sup>. Although these three residues differ between Vβ8.2 and Vβ8.3, critical contacts between SEB and the TCR β-chain are believed to occur through backbone atoms of the β-chain, rather than sidechains, indicating that Vβ recognition by SEB is based mostly on the conformation of the CDR2 loop [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, similar to SEB
 <sub>N23S</sub>, SEB
 <sub>N23I</sub>, SEB
 <sub>N23Y</sub> and SEB
 <sub>N23K</sub> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], our N23 mutant (SEB
 <sub>N23A</sub>) should be unable to bind Vβ8.3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Indeed, SEB, but not SEB
 <sub>N23A</sub>, enhanced the responsiveness of NP
 <sub>147</sub>- and HA
 <sub>518</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), which are biased towards using Vβ8.1/2 and Vβ8.3, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Moreover, SEB was significantly more potent than SEB
 <sub>N23A</sub> in inducing HA
 <sub>518</sub>- and HA
 <sub>462</sub>-specific responses, and a similar trend was observed in the case of NP
 <sub>147</sub>, which approached but did not reach statistical significance.
