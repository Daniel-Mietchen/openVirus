<p>The above model provides multiple advantages. First, unlike in several other laboratory strains, MHC molecules expressed in BALB/c mice have a sufficient binding avidity for SEB [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Second, i.p. inoculation of mice with PR8 does not lead to viral propagation, which is due, at least in part, to the modest ability of this virus to infect macrophages and to activate or recruit peritoneal leukocytes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, it can prime T cells adequately [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This simulates many seasonal flu vaccination protocols in which inactivated viruses are introduced to the immune system via an unnatural route. Third, the peptide epitopes of PR8 are well-defined in BALB/c mice (
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and give rise to T
 <sub>CD8</sub> clones consistently arranged in a reproducible hierarchical order [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This enables examination of the breadth of IAV-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses. Fourth, since i.p. inoculation of PR8 does not cause active viral infection, cognate T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses could be monitored in the absence of severe complications otherwise ensuing in moribund animals.
