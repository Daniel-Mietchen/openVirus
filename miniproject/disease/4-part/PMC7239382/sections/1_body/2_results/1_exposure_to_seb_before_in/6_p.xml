<p>The ultimate function of T
 <sub>CD8</sub> is to sense the presence of and destroy target cells displaying cognate peptide:MHC I complexes. We employed a CFSE-based 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> killing assay to test whether SAg-expanded IAV-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> could fulfill their CTL function. Syngeneic naïve splenocytes were separately pulsed with peptides corresponding to NP
 <sub>147</sub>, HA
 <sub>518</sub> or NP
 <sub>118</sub> (irrelevant peptide). Control and cognate target cells thus prepared were washed, mixed in equal ratios and injected i.v. into naïve or PR8-vaccinated mice that had received PBS or SEB earlier according to the schematic timeline depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. Four hours later, target cells were tracked based on their differential CFSE intensity. While all three target populations remained intact in naïve mice, NP
 <sub>147</sub>-coated targets were almost completely absent from the spleens of PR8-primed mice regardless of their prior treatment with PBS or SEB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). Importantly, SEB pretreatment dramatically augmented HA
 <sub>518</sub>-specific cytotoxicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). As expected, NP
 <sub>118</sub>-coated target cells were not removed from the spleens. We also confirmed the observed cytotoxicity to be IAV-specific and not due, rather fortuitously, to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to a SAg. Following an identical timeline, mice were given SEB or PBS i.p. and left undisturbed for another 10 days in their cages before they were injected i.v. with a mixture of NP
 <sub>118</sub>-, NP
 <sub>147</sub>- and HA
 <sub>518</sub>-pulsed target cells. As anticipated, in the absence of PR8 inoculation, each of the three target cell populations was still present in the spleens of SEB- and PBS-treated animals, almost in equal numbers. To be precise, four hours after the injection of target cells, the mean remaining event number (per corresponding gate) ± SEM in SEB- 
 <italic>vs</italic>. PBS-treated mice (n = 3 per group) was 1,825 ± 35 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 1,758 ± 37 (NP
 <sub>118</sub>), 1,524 ± 77 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 1,383 ± 28 (NP
 <sub>147</sub>), and 1,434 ± 70 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 1,419 ± 27 (HA
 <sub>518</sub>), respectively.
