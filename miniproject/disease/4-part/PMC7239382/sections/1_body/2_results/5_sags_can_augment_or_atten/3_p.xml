<p>The above findings prompted us to hypothesize that SEB administration before IAV inoculation should increase the precursor frequency of memory T
 <sub>CD8</sub>. We used a prime-boost strategy to test this hypothesis. Accordingly, mice were injected with SEB, primed with PR8 and boosted 30 days later with SEQ12 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). SEQ12 was initially generated through sequential passages of PR8 in the presence of anti-HA mAbs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, it cannot be efficiently neutralized by anti-HA Abs produced by mice during the priming phase. This prevents the removal of the virions before they can induce an anamnestic T
 <sub>CD8</sub> response. It is also noteworthy that SEQ12 has accumulated mutations within its HAâ€™s globular domain while retaining the structure of this membrane glycoprotein and identical sequences in and around HA
 <sub>518</sub>, one of our epitopes of interest. Therefore, the response to HA
 <sub>518</sub> should be preserved as we previously reported [
