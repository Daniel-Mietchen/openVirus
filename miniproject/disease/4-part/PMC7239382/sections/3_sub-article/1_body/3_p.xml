<p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Discordant rearrangement of primary and anamnestic CD8 T cell responses to influenza A viral epitopes through systemic exposure to bacterial superantigens: implications for superinfections, prophylactic vaccination and heterosubtypic cross-protection" (PPATHOGENS-D-19-01248) for review by PLOS Pathogens. Your manuscript was fully evaluated at the editorial level and by independent peer reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important problem, but raised some substantial concerns about the manuscript as it currently stands. These issues must be addressed before we would be willing to consider a revised version of your study. We cannot, of course, promise publication at that time.</p>
