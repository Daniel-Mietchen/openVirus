<p id="p0105">These eight chikungunya cases in returned travellers from the Maldives, over a period of one year 2019â€“2020, indicate an increased risk of acquisition of CHIKV infection at this highly touristic destination, and a risk of exportation. Health professionals and health authorities should adapt their pre-travel advice accordingly, and promptly investigate those with symptoms suggestive of CHIKV on return from Maldives, to reduce CHIKV spread in European regions at risk of local transmission, due to the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. If the current situation in the Maldives evolves into a second large CHIKV outbreak, parameters (including host immunity, virus strains and environmental factors) that have led to a re-emergence 12 years after the first massive epidemic on the Islands, should be investigated.
