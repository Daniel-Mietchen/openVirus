 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> is a species of significant ecological and economical relevance [
 <xref rid="B157-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>,
 <xref rid="B158-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Consequently, this insect has been studied extensively in the past decades. Given the current threats honey bees face, a great share of this research has focused on stressors such as parasites and pathogens, aiming at conserving the host biodiversity and/or ameliorating the profitability of apiculture. In parallel, several features of the biology of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, such as eusociality and social immunity, render this species a perfect study system to investigate fundamental epidemiological questions [
 <xref rid="B159-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>,
 <xref rid="B160-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>,
 <xref rid="B161-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. From the discovery of the first honey bee viruses in 1913 [
 <xref rid="B162-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>] and the pioneer studies by Bailey et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], viruses have constantly intrigued bee scientists. The possibility to work with managed western honey bee colonies in controlled laboratory conditions or directly in the field makes it a very practical and popular study system. Thus, nowadays, over a century after the first reports of viruses infecting 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> colonies, a multitude of studies has focused on these pathogens.
