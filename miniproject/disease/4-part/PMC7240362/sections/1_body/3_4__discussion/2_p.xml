<p>The quasiglobal prevalence of the major viruses of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> demonstrates the influence of the trade of honey bees and bee products across large scales. The distribution of these pathogens can also be facilitated by the introduction or invasion of vectors or alternative hosts to the pathogens [

 <xref rid="B164-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>,
 <xref rid="B165-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. The dispersal of viruses in novel environments is likely to result in the rapid spread of disease-causing agents in dense populations of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic>. Honey bee colonies host tens of thousands of individuals that spend about half of their adult life as foragers, whose prime task is to collect resources on a variety of sites. During foraging flights, they are in contact with great diversity of plant and insect species outside the hives. Once infected, a forager returning to its colony provides a formidable means of transport for pathogens, which may then infect a new nest with plenty of resources to thrive. Thus, due to the anthropic movement of species at medium to large scale, and to the biology of their host at the small scale, viruses of honey bees are therefore extremely mobile.
