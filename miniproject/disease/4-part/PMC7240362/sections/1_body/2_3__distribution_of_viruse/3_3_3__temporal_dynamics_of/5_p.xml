<p>Many viruses of honey bees are not vectored by ectoparasitic mites and remain exclusively orally transmitted (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00239-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), even in mite-infested honey bee populations. Among them, some may not display a clear temporal pattern following the colony demographic development, such as CBPV. This virus is efficiently transmitted by close contact between infected and non-infected bees (e.g., crowding), and its development is therefore as much influenced by inclement weather or foraging opportunities as it is by host population development [

 <xref rid="B45-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], while others may not present any cyclic variation, including viruses with low prevalence [
