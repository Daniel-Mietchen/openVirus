<p>Finally, several viruses are shared among a large number of host species (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-insects-11-00239">Section 2</xref>), and interspecies transmission of viruses may be frequent between co-foraging insect pollinators during spring and summer [
 <xref rid="B156-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. For these multihost pathogens, the temporal dynamics of infection in honey bees are more likely to depend on the life cycle of their main host species and the frequency of transmission to honey bees by host contact or shared food resources [
