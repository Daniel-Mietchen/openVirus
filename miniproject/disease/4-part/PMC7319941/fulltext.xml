Obtaining data on specific source(s) and transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV during nosocomial outbreaks has been challenging. We performed a clinical, epidemiological and phylogenetic investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV at a University Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Clinical, epidemiological and infection control data were obtained from patients and Healthcare workers (HCWs). Full genome sequencing was conducted on nucleic acid extracted directly from MERS-CoV PCR-confirmed clinical samples and phylogenetic analysis performed. Phylogenetic analysis combined with published MERS-CoV genomes was performed. HCWs compliance with infection control practices was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 235 persons investigated, there were 23 laboratory confirmed MERS cases, 10 were inpatients and 13 HCWs. Eight of 10 MERS inpatients died (80% mortality). There were no deaths among HCWs. The primary index case assumed from epidemiological investigation was not substantiated phylogenetically. 17/18 of MERS cases were linked both phylogenetically and epidemiologically. One asymptomatic HCW yielded a MERS-CoV genome not directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Five HCWs with mild symptoms yielded &#x0003e;75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. HCW compliance with use of gowns was 62.1%, gloves 69.7%, and masks 57.6%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Several factors and sources, including a HCW MERS-CoV &#x02018;carrier phenomenon&#x02019;, occur during nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses of MERS-CoV linked to clinical and epidemiological information is essential for outbreak investigation. The specific role of apparently healthy HCWs in causing nosocomial outbreaks requires further definition.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Middle east respiratory syndrome</kwd><kwd>Nosocomial</kwd><kwd>Outbreak</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Healthcare workers</kwd><kwd>MERS-CoV carrier phenomenon</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] is listed in the 2019 WHO Blueprint priority list of pathogens [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] because it causes high mortality rates in humans [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], there are currently no specific treatments or vaccines and it remains a threat to global health security. Since the first identification of the MERS-CoV as a novel zoonotic human pathogen in September 2012 [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it continues to circulate in the Middle East causing intermittent community and healthcare associated outbreaks, as well as in returning travelers from the Middle East [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]As of January 10th, 2020, a total of 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, with 851 deaths (34.5% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to the WHO, the majority (2073 cases, 772 deaths) occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Genomic sequencing of MERS-CoV and molecular epidemiology can reveal spatiotemporal patterns that help identify whether all MERS-CoV infections originated from a single or multiple source(s), with subsequent human-to-human transmission, or from several sources. The focus of nosocomial outbreaks is usually on instituting infection control measures, identification of the primary MERS case, preventing further nosocomial spread between patients and healthcare workers ([<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). Whilst clinical and epidemiological information are usually available from outbreak response, obtaining phylogenetic information remains challenging and has not been forthcoming from KSA since 2015. In a review by Grant et al. the prevalence of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic MERS amongst Health Care Workers (HCW) was 11% and 26% respectively [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Briefly, clinical samples were screened with RT-PCR, with amplification targeting both the upE and ORF1A for confirmation. NGS was performed on nucleic acid extracted from real-time PCR confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. 50&#x0202f;&#x003bc;L of nucleic acid was generated from 200&#x0202f;&#x003bc;L of tracheal aspirate or from a nasopharyngeal or throat swab with automated processing. PCR amplification of DNA amplicons covering the entire MERS-CoV genome were prepared. The PCR amplicons for each sample were pooled for Illumina library (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) preparation with each sample processed to include a unique barcode sequence. Standard MiSeq 150&#x0202f;nt paired-end reads were generated. Sequence data were de-multiplexed into sample-specific readsets, processed to remove adapter and primer sequences at the ends of reads, and trimmed from their 3&#x02032; end until the median Phred quality score was &#x0003e;35, discarding reads smaller than 125 nucleotides using QUASR [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The processed readsets were <italic>de novo</italic> assembled into large contiguous sequences (contigs) using SPAdes v.3.13.0 [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Final quality control of genomes included checking intactness of open reading frames (ORFs) for full genomes, comparison of the obtained sequences and the encoded proteins with reference sequences retrieved from GenBank. All single nucleotide polymorphisms in the outbreak set were verified by counting all quality controlled short reads mapping across the position. A total of 15 samples yielded &#x0003e;80% of the 30119&#x0202f;nt MERS-CoV genome and 18 samples yielded &#x0003e;50% genomes which were examined in detail.

Whilst MERS-CoV outbreaks can occur in any inpatient ward, they have not yet been described from other specialist units. Our study is the first to report a nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV in a cardiac unit setting.</p><p id="p0115">Several factors that have been attributed to increased risk of nosocomial outbreaks, susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection and transmission during the outbreaks. These include: high viral load in MERS case clinical samples, lack of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection at first patient presentation; overcrowding in inpatient wards; and poor adherence to infection prevention and control measures, and increased host susceptibility due to co-morbidities [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. All these factors applied to this outbreak at KKUH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). There was delayed recognition of index case, and of other MERS-CoV-infected patients and HCWs and poor institution of IPC measures by staff. Clinical samples from several patients had very low cycle threshold (Ct) values (which indicates a high viral load by continuous, semi-quantitative measurements of viral load), and may have contributed to high risk of contamination and spread.</p><p id="p0120">Over the past six years, several nosocomial outbreaks of MERS have been reported from hospitals within KSA and other countries [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. Most nosocomial outbreaks have focused on identifying the index case as potential source of the outbreak. This is usually done through an epidemiological investigation which may not be accurate without phylogenetic analyses of MERS-CoV strains causing the outbreak. This is illustrated in our study where the first MERS case to be identified (Case_#1) was erroneously labelled as the as index case by the outbreak epidemiological investigation. The patient had presented to two hospitals with symptoms of ischemic heart disease. A careful retrospective review of his medical records at both hospital facilities and his social history did not identify any possible source of his MERS-CoV infection, either at home or in the hospitals. He only became ill with MERS-CoV as an inpatient at KKUH and was phylogenetically linked with the actual index Case_#2.</p><p id="p0125">An analysis of eleven healthcare-associated MERS-CoV outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015 and 2017 found twenty-five percent of MERS cases who acquired nosocomial infection were healthcare personnel [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A previous study of 280 household contacts of 26 index MERS-CoV-infected KSA patients, with follow-up serologic analysis in 44 contacts determined the rate of &#x02018;silent or subclinical&#x02019; secondary infection after exposure to primary cases of MERS-CoV infection [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Twelve probable cases of secondary transmission, and seven apparently healthy household contacts were MERS-CoV positive in their upper respiratory tract. Another study reported low levels of MERS-CoV RNA from asymptomatic subjects from MERS-CoV outbreaks in a Jeddah hospital indicating MERS-CoV carriage after exposure to infected patients [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In our study 13/23 MERS-CoV infected cases were HCWs. Interestingly, our study detected one asymptomatic HCW whose samples yielded a MERS-CoV genome that could not be directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Our study found 5 mildly symptomatic HCWs whose samples yielded &#x0003e;75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. Although the direction of transmission cannot be inferred from viral sequence data and it is possible that they were sources of new MERS-CoV infections. This MERS-CoV &#x02018;carrier phenomenon&#x02019; in HCWs requires further study in greater detail to determine its contribution to the spread of MERS-CoV in inpatients with co-morbidities and other risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV and succumbing to it. Our study highlights the heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile at the start of healthcare associated outbreaks, and the need to better understand the natural history of asymptomatic infection and role of mildly symptomatic HCWs in MERS-CoV nosocomial transmission.</p><p id="p0130">The impact of MERS-CoV on HCWs, patients and their contacts can be devastating and efforts to be into training and certifying HCWs need to be vigorously pursued and sustained [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>]. Whilst MERS-CoV educational campaigns over the years have heightened awareness, our study shows that compliance with IPC measures can wax and wane. In addition, the strict application of standard IPC with compliance with best practices in wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) needs to be reinforced in all areas of HCFs especially in the emergency room and in all specialist inpatient wards where there are a large MERS-CoV susceptible co-morbid patients. An additional challenge when it comes to HCWs in KSA, is that they are housed in special shared facilities next to hospitals, something unique to this region, leading to continued exposure of HCWs in their accommodation and magnifying nosocomial outbreaks. At KKUH, nurses live in two compounds where they share the same amenities, cafeteria and gymnastics hall.</p><p id="p0135">Our study suffers from a time lag between the occurrence of outbreak, conduct of the studies, collation of results and time to submission of publications. Other studies of MERS outbreaks from KSA have also encountered this. A study of risk factors for infection among 19 cases (8 MERS-CoV-PCR+ and 11 serologically positive individuals) identified during a MERS outbreak in an all-female dormitory Riyadh in 2015 where direct contact or sharing a room with a known case occurred was only published recently [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Whilst educational campaigns are leading to increased awareness of MERS-CoV among HCWS, and the number and size of nosocomial outbreaks appear to have decreased over time [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The FAO-OIE-WHO MERS Technical Working Group [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] met in 2018 and one of their priorities for MERS-CoV research remains mapping of MERS-CoV infection in humans. Performing clinical, epidemiological, and infection control studies during an outbreak are logistically and operationally difficult and accurate identification of the index case and transmission patterns may not be possible without MERS-CoV genomic information. A more coordinated effort at conducting research during outbreaks is required.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0140">We report a detailed analysis of a nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV within the King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
