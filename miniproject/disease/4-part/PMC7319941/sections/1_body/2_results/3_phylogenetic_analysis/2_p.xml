<p id="p0075">MERS-CoV PCR-positive samples from 21/23 individuals were subjected to NGS (2 samples were of poor quality and could not be analyzed further). The phylogenetic analysis and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed the following patterns:
 <list list-type="simple" id="olist0010">
  <list-item id="o0010">
   <label>a.</label>
   <p id="p0080">11 of the 18 genomes clustered phylogenetically supporting a single origin of the infection chain (
    <xref rid="fig1a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a, Lineage A1). Three genomes (from Case #6, Case #12, and Case #23, = Lineage A0) and the Case #2 genome were basal to Lineage A1 (
    <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ) This can also be seen in the pattern of SNPs across the genome set with all genomes sharing SNPs or derived from earlier genomes by the additional of one or a few SNPs (
    <xref rid="fig1b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b). Of interest, Case #2 differed from Lineage A0 by a single nucleotide (position 3932). Lineage A0 to A1 differed by a single nucleotide (
    <xref rid="fig1b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b).

  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0015">
   <label>b.</label>
   <p id="p0085">Within the clusters there were epidemiological features (shared room, contact, or caregiver, with appropriate timing) that supported a transmission chain. For example, the genomes from Case #6, Case #12 and Case #23 clustered closely phylogenetically, and shared unique SNPs (
    <xref rid="fig1b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). The linked Case #6 and Case #12 shared a room and Case #23 was in the next room. Furthermore Case #4 shared a room with Case #2 providing links to later cases and HCW_5 and HCW_11 cared for Case #4.

  <list-item id="o0020">
   <label>c.</label>
   <p id="p0090">The genome from Case #2 appears basal to the cluster and this indicates that Case #2 may be the source for the outbreak (rather than Case #1 which was implicated by the clinic-epidemiological outbreak investigation).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0025">
   <label>d.</label>
   <p id="p0095">The genome from HCW #16 has multiple SNPs that are not shared with any other genomes (
    <xref rid="fig1b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). HCW #16 was mildly symptomatic and had contact with Case #4.

   <label>e.</label>
   <p id="p0100">Minor variant analysis (
    <xref rid="fig1c" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> c) was performed for the 18 samples at 4 genome positions showing changes in the consensus genome across the outbreak (positions 3932, 9365, 9839, 24029). Especially relevant, the sample from HCW #16 showed minor variants at these 4 positions that linked the sample with the Case #2, Case #4, the patient HCW #16 cared for, and the Lineage A1, A0 and B genomes.
