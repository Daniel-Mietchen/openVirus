<p id="p0125">An analysis of eleven healthcare-associated MERS-CoV outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015 and 2017 found twenty-five percent of MERS cases who acquired nosocomial infection were healthcare personnel [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A previous study of 280 household contacts of 26 index MERS-CoV-infected KSA patients, with follow-up serologic analysis in 44 contacts determined the rate of ‘silent or subclinical’ secondary infection after exposure to primary cases of MERS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Twelve probable cases of secondary transmission, and seven apparently healthy household contacts were MERS-CoV positive in their upper respiratory tract. Another study reported low levels of MERS-CoV RNA from asymptomatic subjects from MERS-CoV outbreaks in a Jeddah hospital indicating MERS-CoV carriage after exposure to infected patients [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In our study 13/23 MERS-CoV infected cases were HCWs. Interestingly, our study detected one asymptomatic HCW whose samples yielded a MERS-CoV genome that could not be directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Our study found 5 mildly symptomatic HCWs whose samples yielded &gt;75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. Although the direction of transmission cannot be inferred from viral sequence data and it is possible that they were sources of new MERS-CoV infections. This MERS-CoV ‘carrier phenomenon’ in HCWs requires further study in greater detail to determine its contribution to the spread of MERS-CoV in inpatients with co-morbidities and other risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV and succumbing to it. Our study highlights the heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile at the start of healthcare associated outbreaks, and the need to better understand the natural history of asymptomatic infection and role of mildly symptomatic HCWs in MERS-CoV nosocomial transmission.
