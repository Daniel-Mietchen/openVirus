<p id="p0135">Our study suffers from a time lag between the occurrence of outbreak, conduct of the studies, collation of results and time to submission of publications. Other studies of MERS outbreaks from KSA have also encountered this. A study of risk factors for infection among 19 cases (8 MERS-CoV-PCR+ and 11 serologically positive individuals) identified during a MERS outbreak in an all-female dormitory Riyadh in 2015 where direct contact or sharing a room with a known case occurred was only published recently [

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The FAO-OIE-WHO MERS Technical Working Group [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] met in 2018 and one of their priorities for MERS-CoV research remains mapping of MERS-CoV infection in humans. Performing clinical, epidemiological, and infection control studies during an outbreak are logistically and operationally difficult and accurate identification of the index case and transmission patterns may not be possible without MERS-CoV genomic information. A more coordinated effort at conducting research during outbreaks is required.
