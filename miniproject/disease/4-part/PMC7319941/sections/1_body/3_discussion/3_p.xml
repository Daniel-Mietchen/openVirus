<p id="p0115">Several factors that have been attributed to increased risk of nosocomial outbreaks, susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection and transmission during the outbreaks. These include: high viral load in MERS case clinical samples, lack of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection at first patient presentation; overcrowding in inpatient wards; and poor adherence to infection prevention and control measures, and increased host susceptibility due to co-morbidities [

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). There was delayed recognition of index case, and of other MERS-CoV-infected patients and HCWs and poor institution of IPC measures by staff. Clinical samples from several patients had very low cycle threshold (Ct) values (which indicates a high viral load by continuous, semi-quantitative measurements of viral load), and may have contributed to high risk of contamination and spread.
