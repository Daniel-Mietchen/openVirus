<p id="p0120">Over the past six years, several nosocomial outbreaks of MERS have been reported from hospitals within KSA and other countries [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. Most nosocomial outbreaks have focused on identifying the index case as potential source of the outbreak. This is usually done through an epidemiological investigation which may not be accurate without phylogenetic analyses of MERS-CoV strains causing the outbreak. This is illustrated in our study where the first MERS case to be identified (Case_#1) was erroneously labelled as the as index case by the outbreak epidemiological investigation. The patient had presented to two hospitals with symptoms of ischemic heart disease. A careful retrospective review of his medical records at both hospital facilities and his social history did not identify any possible source of his MERS-CoV infection, either at home or in the hospitals. He only became ill with MERS-CoV as an inpatient at KKUH and was phylogenetically linked with the actual index Case_#2.
