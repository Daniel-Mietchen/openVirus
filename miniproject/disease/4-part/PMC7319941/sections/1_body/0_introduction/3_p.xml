<p id="p0015">Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV strains aligned to epidemiological and clinical information is important for identifying the index case, source(s) of transmission, transmission patterns, surveillance and evolution of MERS-CoV genomes [

Genomic sequencing of MERS-CoV and molecular epidemiology can reveal spatiotemporal patterns that help identify whether all MERS-CoV infections originated from a single or multiple source(s), with subsequent human-to-human transmission, or from several sources. The focus of nosocomial outbreaks is usually on instituting infection control measures, identification of the primary MERS case, preventing further nosocomial spread between patients and healthcare workers ([
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). Whilst clinical and epidemiological information are usually available from outbreak response, obtaining phylogenetic information remains challenging and has not been forthcoming from KSA since 2015. In a review by Grant et al. the prevalence of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic MERS amongst Health Care Workers (HCW) was 11% and 26% respectively [
