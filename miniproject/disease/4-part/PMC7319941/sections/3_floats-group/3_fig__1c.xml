  <p>Minor variants in the short read data at the 4 sites of nucleotide polymorphism (positions 3932, 9365, 9839, 24029, see Figure 1b) were detected as previously described (ref37) using Ack (https://beyondgrep.com/documentation/) to count 21 nt kmers with the centered on each polymorphism. The fractions of each variant nucleotide at each positions are plotted. Lineages and genomes are indicated to the left. Position 27482 also shows variation but coverage was too low for analysis.</p>
