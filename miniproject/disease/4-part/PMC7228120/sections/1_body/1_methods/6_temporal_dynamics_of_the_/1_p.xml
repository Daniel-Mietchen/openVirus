<p>To estimate the evolutionary rate and the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the A/H1N1pdm in China, about 370 sequences of each genomic segment were subjected to Bayesian molecular clock analyses using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in BEAST v.1.10.4 (

A strict molecular clock with a Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) nucleotide substitution model with a gamma distributed model of among site rate variation using four rate categories was used. At least two independent MCMC analyses were run for each segment of the A/H1N1pdm for 300 million generations sampled every 30,000 runs. The genome-wide relative genetic diversity of each genomic segment was estimated using Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) Bayesian Skyride. The BEAGLE library was used to improve computational performance. Parameter convergence was assessed using Tracer v.1.7.1, and a minimum effective sample size (ESS) of 200 was required. After the removal of 10% burn-in, a summary Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree was inferred and viewed using Figtree v1.4.4.
