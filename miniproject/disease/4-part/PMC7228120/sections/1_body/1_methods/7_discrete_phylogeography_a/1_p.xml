<p>To clarify the spatial dynamics of the A/H1N1pdm in China, Bayesian phylogeography analysis was carried out to reconstruct the ancestral geographical area, and to infer the migration patterns using BEAST v.1.10.4. Each HA sequence was assigned two characters reflecting its sampling time and geographic location, and the geographic location was defined as one of the seven major regions: North (Beijing, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Tianjin), East (Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Shandong, and Zhejiang), Central (Henan, Hubei, and Hunan), Northwest (Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang), South (Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan), Southwest (Chongqing, Guizhou, Sichuan, Tibet, and Yunnan), and Northeast China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning). An asymmetric substitution model with stochastic search variable selection, a strict clock model and exponential growth coalescent prior were used to estimate the diffusion rates among locations. Two independent analyses were run using 500 million generations, and sampling was performed every 50,000 generations. The BF was used to determine the statistical significance for the diffusion between discrete locations. The support level of the diffusion route is defined as follows: BF ≥ 1000, 100 ≤ BF &lt; 1000, 10 ≤ BF &lt; 100, and 3 ≤ BF &lt; 10 indicate decisive, very strong, strong and substantial support, respectively.</p>
