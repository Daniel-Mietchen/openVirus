<p>The HA and NA sequences were separately aligned by MAFFT v7.425 (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Katoh et al., 2002</xref>), and subjected to the construction of maximum likelihood (ML) trees. To investigate the evolutionary history of A/H1N1pdm in China, the phylogenetic trees of HA and NA genes were constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method in PhyML3.0, with the general time reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution selected in jModelTest2.1.10. The reliability of the phylogenetic trees was evaluated with 1000 replications. Ancestral codon substitutions at each major tree node was inferred using MEGA7.0. To visualize the locations of the amino acid substitutions involving in receptor binding and genetic drift, these sites were mapped onto a three-dimensional structure of the H1-HA of the A/H1N1pdm (Protein Data Bank code: 3LZG) using PyMol2.3.0. The divergence time was assessed by plotting root-to-tip divergence versus year of isolation using the resulting phylogenetic trees with TempEst v1.5.1 (
