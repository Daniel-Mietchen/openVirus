<p>Since the winter of 2017, higher level of seasonal influenza activity occurred in China and other countries (

The evolutionary reason for the 2017–2019 large outbreak of seasonal influenza remains to be answered. To well understand the evolutionary and spatiotemporal dynamics of the A/H1N1pdm virus in China from 2009 to 2019 and to investigate the evolutionary reason for the 2017–2019 large outbreaks, we performed in-depth phylogenetic analyses of all publicly available sequence data of the virus from China together with genome sequences generated from Shanghai in this study. Our results provide new insights to the spatiotemporal evolution and migration dynamics of the A/H1N1pdm virus in China from 2009 to 2019.
