<p>We further analyzed all available HA sequences of A/H1N1pdm, A/H3N2, and influenza B Victoria and Yamagata lineages, and compared their relative genetic diversities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). A similar genetic diversity pattern of A/H1N1pdm virus was observed even if more HA sequences were used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Distinct from A/H1N1pdm virus, the A/H3N2 virus exhibited a weak seasonal fluctuation of genetic diversity during 2009–2014, followed by a strong seasonal fluctuation during 2014–2019 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Two influenza B lineages, Victoria and Yamagata had similar genetic diversity patterns with almost invariant relative genetic diversity from 2009 to 2015 (especially for Yamagata lineage) followed by elevated genetic diversities with strong seasonal fluctuation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C,D</xref>). A common feature of the four influenza virus lineages was that their relative genetic diversities were elevated since 2016, which might be associated with a sharp increase in influenza cases in China since the winter-spring season of 2017–2018.
