<p>We found a trend of decrease from 2009 to 2017, followed by increase since 2017 in the dN/dS value of A/H1N1pdm virus. As previously observed, higher dN/dS ratio during the 2009–2010 pandemic season might be a consequence of relaxed selection constraint after entering the new host population, and be associated with its rapid population expansion among human population (

The decrease of dN/dS value from 2011 to 2017 might be associated with selective constraints to maintain the functional fitness (e.g., receptor binding) of the virus. The increase in dN/dS values during the 2018–2019 pandemic season might be a consequence of recent virus expansion and increased selection pressure from pre-existing host immunity induced by prior infections or vaccination. The annual variation of relative genetic diversity well matches the seasonal epidemics of this virus. A trend of decrease from 2009 to 2017 followed by increase since 2017 was observed in the relative genetic diversity of the A/H1N1pdm virus. Higher relative genetic diversity during the 2009–2010 matched early rapid population expansion of A/H1N1pdm virus among human population. Decreased relative genetic diversity might be a consequence of transmission bottlenecks (

Apart from A/H1N1pdm, A/H3N2 and two lineages of influenza B virus are also the major agents responsible for the seasonal influenza pandemics. The four influenza subtypes are often co-circulating and compete with each other, resulting in the epidemic dominance of one or two subtypes. We found that all four viruses had consistent, elevated relative genetic diversities during 2018–2019. However, it is unclear why and which factors determine the high level of activity of all four influenza subtypes during 2018–2019.
