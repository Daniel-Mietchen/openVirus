<p>Population density and humidity are demonstrated to be the main factors affecting the seasonal epidemics of influenza viruses (

East China and South China not only are the most important hubs for domestic and international travel, but also densely populated areas. It is not surprising to find that the earliest A/H1N1pdm strains in China originated from East China. Furthermore, East China and South China were found to be two major epicenters responsible for the national migration of the A/H1N1pdm in several epidemic seasons. Suitable climatic condition for influenza virus transmission, high population density, and increasing frequency of domestic and international population mobility via air travel or high-speed rail could explain the seeding hierarchy of East China and South China in influenza epidemics in China. Therefore, to strengthen influenza surveillance in East China and South China will aid the early finding of newly emerging variants and forecast their epidemics in other regions. On the other hand, although frequent introductions of A/H1N1pdm virus lineages into China from outside were observed, they did not change the main national migration patterns of A/H1N1pdm from East China and/or South China to other parts of China. These results suggest that A/H1N1pdm might be persistently maintained in China since its initial introduction in 2009. Subsequent multiple introductions of the virus from outside to China might contribute to its genetic diversity, but have less influence on the domestic pandemic and migration.
