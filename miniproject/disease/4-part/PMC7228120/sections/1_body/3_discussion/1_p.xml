<p>The main force driving the evolution of influenza viruses is the adaptation to the new hosts and/or the escape from pre-existing host immunity (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Taubenberger and Kash, 2010</xref>). Since its origin via triple reassortment and introduction into human population in 2009, A/H1N1pdm virus rapidly spread among human, and replaced the previous seasonal A/H1N1 virus to be the season’s dominant strain. Intra-subtype reassortment and adaptive amino acid substitution are believed to be the main driver for the evolution of A/H1N1pdm virus in humans (
