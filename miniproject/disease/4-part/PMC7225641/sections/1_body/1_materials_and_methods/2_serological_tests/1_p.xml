<p id="Par28">To determine the seroprevalence of arboviruses in the household study, tests for IgG antibodies against various arboviruses were performed using commercially available ELISA. These included tests for anti-DENV IgG antibodies (Vircell, Granada, Spain), anti-ZIKV IgG antibodies (MyBioSource Inc., CA, USA), and anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The controls provided with the kits and the cutoff values listed in the associated information were used to determine the results, as recommended by the manufacturers. The clinical samples from recent DLI cases were tested using non-structural protein-1 (NS1)/IgM/IgG combo rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits for DENV. Tests for the other arboviruses were performed on selected December samples using commercial IgM ELISA kits (ZIKV IgM ELISA, MyBioSource Inc., and CHIKV IgM ELISA, Abcam).</p>
