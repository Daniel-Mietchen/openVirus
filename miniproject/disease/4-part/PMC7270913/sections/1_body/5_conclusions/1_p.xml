<p>The large number of published papers suggests that various viral and bacterial infections, acute or chronic, may be associated with an increased risk of AMI. Why does the influenza remain a potential focus of particular importance? On the one hand, influenza is one of the most frequent respiratory infections, on the other, it is the only respiratory virus for which it is possible to achieve effective prophylaxis with vaccination.

 </xref> Based on this analysis, we can, therefore, deduce that it is highly probable that influenza has a causal role in triggering ACS. However, in the age of evidence-based medicine fundamental elements for its effective demonstration are lacking, i.e. strong data derived from randomized prospective clinical trials.

 </xref> However, these syndromes are multifactorial, and no factor can be considered an absolutely necessary and sufficient causal element. Therefore, acute infection must be seen as a component of a set of causes in which complex interactions with other factors determine the development of a coronary event. Although there is evidence to support the role of influenza vaccination for the prevention of ischaemic heart disease, vaccination is not considered a priority preventive measure in the clinical setting. In fact, despite being recommended by many guidelines in different categories of patients at risk, vaccination rates remain low. In this context, while we await strong results, we are still encouraged to use vaccination as a preventive measure against ischaemic heart disease, considering its favourable cost-effectiveness and safety profile. In the clinical setting, this requires awareness so that there is a change in the paradigm that often sees influenza vaccination as a simple preventive measure against the infectious situation only, rather than an additional cardiovascular preventive strategy.
