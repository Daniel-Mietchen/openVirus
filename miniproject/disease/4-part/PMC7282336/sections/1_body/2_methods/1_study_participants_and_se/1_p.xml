<p>We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study. The source population comprised 131 711 individuals who underwent an annual health screening at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea, between January and December 2018. The following individuals were excluded from the analysis: those who were not tested for anti-HAV IgG (n=54 552); those aged &lt;20 (n=349) or ≥50 years (n=279) because of relatively smaller sample size than other age groups and the fact that people aged under 20 are not workers and that people aged more than 50 in South Korea are likely to have experienced HAV infection
