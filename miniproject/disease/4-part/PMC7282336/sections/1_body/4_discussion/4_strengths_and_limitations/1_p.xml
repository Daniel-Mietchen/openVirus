<p>This study aimed at a group of healthy young Korean workers, the majority of whom were working for multinational corporations. The limitations of the study were as follows: first, its cross-sectional design assess the exposure and outcome simultaneously, so that it makes it difficult to determine temporal causality and there is a need for further longitudinal studies. Second, it was unknown whether hepatitis A IgG antibody seropositivity of participants was acquired by vaccination or past infection because of the absence of records on vaccination history in our study. Third, demographic data such as residence were obtained by self-administered questionnaire so that it may cause possible information bias. Fourth, despite the large sample size, the results may not be generalisable to the whole of the Korean workforce because the study was conducted at only one hospital that does health screening for individuals, most of whom were working in Seoul or its suburb area, and it did not include people in informal employment. Nevertheless, the study reveals several statistically significant associations even after adjustment and provides valuable information about workers who might be vulnerable to HAV infection.</p>
