<p>In our study, women had significantly higher seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG than men. In Korea, a survey of the national influenza vaccination rate revealed that the rate was higher among women than among men, and it is well known that there are biological differences in response to vaccination according to sex.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> In our study, the difference in anti-HAV IgG seroprevalence is also likely because of the behavioural and biological differences according to sex although we could not present vaccination history directly. Geographically, most participants resided in urban areas, and those who lived in Seoul were more likely to be immune to HAV than those who lived in other regions. This difference may be owing to better access to medical care in Seoul so that lower barriers to health behaviour; however, the National Health and Nutrition Survey in Korea did not determine a significant difference in anti-HAV IgG seroprevalence between rural and urban areas.
