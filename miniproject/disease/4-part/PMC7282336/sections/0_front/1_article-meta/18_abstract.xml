  <title>Objectives</title>
  <p>Hepatitis A incidence in Korea has dramatically increased in recent years. Individuals in their twenties and thirties, who account for majority of the workforce in Korea, are particularly susceptible to infection owing to a low seroprevalence of anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) immunoglobulin G (IgG). This study aimed to identify behavioural and occupational factors related to anti-HAV IgG seropositivity.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Of 131 711 individuals who had an annual health screening at the study hospital in 2018, 68 612 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Study participants were predominantly men (64.3%) and in their thirties (55.3%). The overall seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG was 36.2%. In multivariate analyses, anti-HAV IgG seropositivity was independently associated with working in a workplace with ≥2 health managers (vs no health manager, adjusted OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43); age 40–49 years (vs 20–29 years, OR 2.51, 95% CI 2.36 to 2.68); female sex (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.59); experience of any general disease (vs no general disease history, OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.25), obesity (vs normal weight, OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.97); and hepatitis B antibody seropositivity (OR 2.39, 95% CI 2.31 to 2.49).</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>The low prevalence of anti-HAV IgG seropositivity points to a need for implementation of workplace-based hepatitis A vaccine programmes. To promote workers’ health and prevent hepatitis A outbreaks, occupational health managers, healthcare providers and policy-makers should focus on individuals who are susceptible to HAV, such as young men.</p>
