<p id="Par33">Variable competencies of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from around the world to act as vectors for sylvatic DENV have been reported. A sylvatic strain of DENV2 isolated from a mosquito in Senegal in 1965 was found to infect 50–91% of eight different Senegalese 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations. Moreover, these results were achieved from blood meals containing substantially less virus than used in this study (approximately 10
 <sup>6–7</sup> PFU/ml virus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In contrast, infection rates of only 0–27% were observed in another study in which six Senegalese 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations were fed 10
 <sup>6–7</sup> PFU/ml of a sylvatic strain DENV2 isolated from Senegal in 1999 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our infection rates more closely resemble those achieved when 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> collected from Galveston, USA, and from Bolivia were fed on blood meals containing 10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>9.5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml of strains of sylvatic DENV2 isolated from a mosquito in Burkina Faso, West Africa, and from a sentinel monkey in Malaysia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. All these studies used dissemination to distal body tissues as a measure of the potential to transmit these viruses based on an assumption that mosquitos were capable of transmitting DENV if the virus had disseminated from the midgut into the hemocoel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In our experiments with QML22, the virus disseminated into legs and wings but could not be detected in saliva at any time point.
