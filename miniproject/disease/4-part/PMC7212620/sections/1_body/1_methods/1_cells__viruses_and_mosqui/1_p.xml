<p id="Par19">C6-36 (
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquito) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in 10% v/v heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)/RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The QML16 strain of DENV2 was isolated from a dengue fever patient in Australia and strain QML22 was isolated from a dengue fever patient returning to Australia from Borneo [

 <sub>50</sub>/ml) using a cell culture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CCELISA) method. As required, remaining vials were removed from the – 80 °C freezer immediately thawed, diluted and mixed with blood to prepare artificial viremic blood meals as described previously [
