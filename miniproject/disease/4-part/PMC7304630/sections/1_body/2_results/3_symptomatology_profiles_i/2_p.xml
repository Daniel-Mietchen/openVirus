<p>Based on this symptom profiling, Cluster 1 outlines a subgroup of individuals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 282, 24.3%) with minor symptomatology (women with fever and headache as unique manifestations; 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), while individuals in Cluster 2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 256, 22.1%) exhibit fever, difficulty grasping, general discomfort, headache, skin sensitivity, feverish chill, lack of appetite, and abdominal, calf, neck and back pain (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). On the other hand, Cluster 3 is comprised of individuals (
 <italic>n =</italic> 205, 17.7%) who are more likely to experience fever, cough, headache, and neck and back pain, while Cluster 4 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 128, 11%) groups individuals with a symptomatology profile characterized by fever, dizziness, difficulty grasping, general discomfort, nausea, cough, headache, vomiting, skin sensitivity, feverish chill, lack of appetite, as well as abdominal calf, neck, back and hip pain. Individuals belonging to Cluster 5 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 118, 10.2%) have a symptomatology mainly characterized by fever, arthralgia, headache, myalgias and calf, neck, back and hip pain. In contrast, individuals in Cluster 6 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 97, 8.4%) are more likely to experience fever, arthralgia, difficulty grasping, general discomfort, headache, myalgias and feverish chill. Finally, Cluster 7 gathers individuals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 74, 6.4%) with complex symptomatology (fever, dizziness, adynamia, difficulty grasping, retroauricular and submandibular ganglia, general discomfort, nausea, cough, headache, pruritus, myalgias, skin sensitivity, feverish chill, lack of appetite, and diverse sorts of pain) (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Individuals belonging to Clusters 1 and 7 represent extreme profiles of phenotypic response as they deviate from the natural history of the disease (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008281.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008281.g004">4</xref>), and confirm the divergence of the clinical symptomatology spectrum. Interestingly, all LCCA-derived clusters are mostly constituted of females, who, as previously discussed, show a differential phenotypic response pattern when compared to men (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The significance of the χ
 <sup>2</sup>-based test of association for gender (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 34.41, degrees of freedom [
 <italic>df</italic>] = 6, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), age group (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 42.03, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 18, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and gender and age group (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 84.16, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 39, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) by cluster, showed that these variables are both independently and jointly associated with a differential phenotypic response in individuals with CHIKV infection. Closer inspection of the characteristics of the LCCA-derived clusters revealed that the Female:Male ratio by age group is higher in clusters 4 and 7, particularly in the AYA and adult groups, although the extreme patterns of phenotypic response occur in the latter age group for cluster 7.
