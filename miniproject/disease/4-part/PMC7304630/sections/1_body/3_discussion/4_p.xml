<p>We identified different clinical signatures in individuals with CHIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008281.g002">Fig 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For instance, cluster 2 only presented 11/26 (42.3%) symptoms with probability above 50%, while cluster 7 exhibited 24/26 (92.3%) symptoms. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism is not as differentiable in clusters 2, 5 and 6, while there was a distinctive dimorphism in clusters 3, 4 and 7 (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Although we demonstrate distinct CHIKV phenotypic response subpopulations, there are different factors that have shown to modulate human response to arbovirus infection and hence be responsible for the clinical symptomatology differentiation presented herein. Some of these factors include (
 <italic>i</italic>) vector competence, that is, the ability of the vector to acquire the virus and successfully transmit it to a susceptible host;[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] (
 <italic>ii</italic>) the variety of the viral strain, in which genetic studies have shown that CHIKV has evolved into three distinct genotypes—west African, East/Central/South African, and Asian;[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] (
 <italic>iii</italic>) environmental conditions such as ecological factors, global population growth, urbanization, lack of mosquito control measures and decay in public health;[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and (
 <italic>iv</italic>) population genetics, that is, human individual differences such as genetic makeup and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mostly associated with immunological pathways.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Indeed, genetic markers rs179010, rs5741880 and rs3853839 in the 
 <italic>TLR-7</italic> gene, and rs3764879 in the 
 <italic>TLR-8</italic> gene have been associated with increased CHIKV infection susceptibility.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] These SNPs were also found to be associated with enhanced susceptibility of patients infected with CHIKV to developing fever, joint pain, and rashes.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] As our study population has a strong African admixture,[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008281.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] future studies should focus on determining the contribution of these SNPs in this understudied population. Furthermore, considering that CHIKV originated in the African continent, genetic ancestry in our population could help to elucidate its influence on host response. This will be crucial for developing monitoring and diagnostic tools as well as more accurate diagnosis and treatment options, and for outlining public health policies.
