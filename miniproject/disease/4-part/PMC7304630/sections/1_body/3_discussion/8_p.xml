<p>A second limitation of our study is the lack of outcome data, such as vital signs, duration of symptoms and disease evolution. Because of this, we were unable to establish correlations between such variables and the profiles of phenotypic response exhibited by individuals with CHIKV infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008281.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Although we identified that the number of clinical symptoms is associated with the cluster CHIKV infected individuals belong to (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008281.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), more research studies are needed, especially those of a longitudinal nature, to better understand long-term outcomes in individuals with CHIKV infection exhibiting such patterns of phenotypic response to the virus. We argue that these studies will greatly benefit from our findings. In fact, such studies could eventually use the differences between males and females in terms of clinical symptomatology (
