<p>In summary, our study provides, for the first time, strong evidence supporting the existence of different subpopulations among individuals infected with CHIKV, including important differences in patterns of phenotypic response between males and females, which highlights the importance of developing gender-specific approaches to treating this infection. In low-, mid-income and Latin American countries, the use of these characterizations could enhance the development, validation and implementation of alternative ways of diagnosing CHIKV infection based on clinical symptomatology machine learning (ML) algorithms, to accurately identify such patterns in a timely fashion in the clinical setting,[
