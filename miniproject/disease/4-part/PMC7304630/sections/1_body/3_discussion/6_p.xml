<p>Co-occurrence of two or more symptoms may influence symptom recognition and harmfully affect individuals’ quality of life, negatively impacting individuals’ health condition, and accelerating the timing of clinical treatment. Finding that two or more symptoms co-occur or happen in particular combinations in individuals infected with CHIKV during the major outbreak in the Colombian Caribbean region may potentially help to identify specific symptom patterns more clearly in CHIKV infection and facilitate patient management. Future studies assessing the contribution of demographic, immunological and genetic factors to symptom co-occurrence, and correlating this symptomatology with viral strain and/or CHIKV genetic variation could shed some light on the severity of the clinical symptomatology and, ultimately, lead to more accurate, more efficient and differential diagnosis. It will be fascinating to revisit this cohort as new advances in diagnostic and next generation sequencing techniques become more accessible.</p>
