<p>Following the CHIKV protocol from the CNIH, patients were clinical diagnosed based on signs and symptoms, together with the epidemiological history of the population. Individuals were all residents in a geographical place where CHIKV presence was previously confirmed by laboratory testing (i.e., autochthonous cases). Signs and symptoms included fever &gt;38°C, severe joint pain or initial acute arthritis symptoms and rash, which could not attributed to other medical conditions (and after discarding Dengue virus (DV) infection;

Suspected cases were defined as residents of a geographical region where CHIKV presence had not been detected by laboratory testing. Signs and symptoms included fever &gt;38°C, severe joint pain or initial acute arthritis symptoms and rash, could not be attributed to other medical conditions (and after discarding DV infection). Suspected cases were confirmed by laboratory testing using serum-based RT-PCR to detect viral RNA. Serum was sampled within the first eight days of the onset of symptoms. Patients presenting signs and symptoms characteristic of DV infection (
