<p>Although PT may seem a recent idea, mainly due to increasing antibiotic resistance, it was proposed back in the 1920s when Felix d’Hérelle cured patients suffering from diseases, such as dysentery or cholera [

In the context of IBD and the crucial role of the gut microbiome in its pathogenesis, PT is considered a potential tool for microbiome modification via, more or less, the selective destruction of bacterial cells. Furthermore, however, there are two possible ways via which phages can shape the host and its response to their presence. Immune response to the phage particle components represents direct action of the host. Horizontal gene transfer from phages to bacteria represents indirect action.
