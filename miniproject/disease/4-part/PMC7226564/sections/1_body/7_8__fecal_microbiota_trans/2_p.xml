<p>One of the first studies focusing on the composition of the virome after FMT found the transfer of viral sequences from a healthy donor to pediatric UC patients. Among the sequences, the members of 
 <italic>Siphoviridae</italic> were transferred with greater efficiency than other groups [

Of particular importance is also a study by Broecker et al. who found the phage population of a recipient CDI patient after FMT to be very similar to the donor. Unexpectedly, the phage composition remained stable for up to seven months. The composition of bacteria, in contrast, varied longer before reaching donor similarity [
 <xref rid="B71-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Still, evidence of how the composition of the virome changes in time during various gastrointestinal diseases or how changes in the virome correspond to the severity of the disease is unavailable.
