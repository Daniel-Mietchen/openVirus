<p>Wagner et al. amplified viral sequences from ileal and colonic biopsies from pediatric CD patients and found the most viral hits in CD ileal samples followed by control ileal and CD colonic samples. The majority of viral reads belonged to 
 <italic>Caudovirales</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A study by Norman et al. confirmed the expansion of this order in CD and UC patients. They speculated that the virome may contribute to intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis, and that it may play a role in other diseases [
 <xref rid="B29-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, these results were supported by a T-cell transfer model of colitis in mice. In animals treated with T cells, reads mapped to the families 
 <italic>Siphoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Podoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Myoviridae</italic> were more elevated compared with control mice. However, the authors also stated that reads mapped to the genome of 
 <italic>Caudovirales</italic> accounted for less than 0.01% of the total viral reads [
 <xref rid="B30-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, 
 <italic>Caudovirales</italic> phages were more abundant in CD than UC pediatric samples, although the same study did not find any difference between CD and controls [
 <xref rid="B31-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The analysis of the rectal mucosa of UC patients revealed an expansion of 
 <italic>Caudovirales</italic>. However, a decrease in diversity, richness, and evenness of this order in comparison with healthy controls was also observed. The study demonstrated that the mucosal virome might be substantially altered in UC patients [
