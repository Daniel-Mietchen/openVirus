<p>Relatively recently, it was discovered that NF-κB activity can be modulated by 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> phage [

 <xref rid="B53-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. According to the results of Górski et al., the phages can possibly cross the mucosa and enter the systemic circulation even in healthy individuals [

In addition, it should not be forgotten that the rapid lysis of bacterial cells via the action of lytic phages may lead to overaccumulation of proteins, lipopolysaccharides, and nucleic acids, which could potentially fuel the inflammation even more [
