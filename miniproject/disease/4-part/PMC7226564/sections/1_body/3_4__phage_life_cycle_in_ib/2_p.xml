<p>The life cycle of phages is undoubtedly one of the key features that shape the composition and abundance of gut bacteria at any given time. Generally, viruses can replicate in two ways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-01013-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). They can use the proteosynthesis of infected cells to create many copies of its nucleic acid and subsequently release them to the environment via cell rupture, a process known as the lytic cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-01013-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). However, certain viruses are able to incorporate their genetic information directly into the genome of the cell, ensuring that, after the next division, each daughter cell will carry, in its genome, the viral sequence as well. This process is called lysogeny and does not kill the cell instantly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-01013-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). In this case, usually, only a few copies of the viral genetic information are being synthesized at any given time.
