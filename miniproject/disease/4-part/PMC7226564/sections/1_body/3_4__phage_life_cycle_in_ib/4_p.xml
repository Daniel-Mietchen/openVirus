<p>Contrarily, there is also the “Piggyback the Winner” model in which phages may undergo the lytic cycle to take advantage of the rapid reproduction of bacteria. The model presumes that there is a gradient of lysogenic to lytic replication across the mucus layer of the intestine based on the amount of bacterial load in various parts of the mucosal layer [
