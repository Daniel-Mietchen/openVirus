<p>Any potential treatment must fulfill two basic criteria of being safe and causing fewer side effects and being more efficient, at least compared to any treatment already available. Research in this area was already conducted. For instance, the findings of a study by Galtier et al. look promising. Mice were infected with an adherent-invasive 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain LF82 that was previously implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD [

 <xref rid="B83-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. After the isolation, purification, and sequencing of phages, phage preparations were administered to murine intestinal sections, living animals, and homogenates of ileal biopsies taken from CD patients. Across all the samples, phages significantly reduced the colony-forming units (CFU) of the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> LF82 strain. Phage treatment was even helpful in alleviating the symptoms of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice colonized with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> LF82. Strikingly, this effect was achieved after only a single dose of phage preparation. On the basis of these results, the authors concluded that PT may be a suitable treatment option for CD patients infected with adherent-invasive 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains [
