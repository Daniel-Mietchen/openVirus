<p>The putative contribution of bacteriophages to the regulation of the intestinal bacteria was previously reviewed by our group [
 <xref rid="B66-cells-09-01013" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The mechanisms via which bacteriophages modulate the bacterial microbiota in the gut are multifactorial. Upon incorporation into pathogenic bacteria, the prophages carrying genes encoding antibiotic resistance may act as procolitic factors, but may also be anti-colitic when incorporated into probiotic bacteria. Moreover, stress-induced activation of a prophage might lead to activation of its lytic cycle and subsequent reduction of the number of the host bacteria. The disrupted environmental niche might then be replaced by pathogenic (or commensal) bacteria with procolitic (or anti-colitic) effects. In addition, due to the reduced mucosal layer thickness, the protective interactions between phages and mucosal glycoproteins may be damaged, paving the way for pathogenic bacteria.
