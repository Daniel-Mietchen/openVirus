<p>When considering the potential use of phages for therapeutic purposes, advantages and disadvantages compared with antibiotics must be addressed. Phages are of viral origin; therefore, they differ completely from antibiotics in many aspects. For instance, phages are usually strain-specific, whereas antibiotics are active against a wide range of bacterial species, often killing harmless commensals along with pathogens. This approach may, in turn, lead to other problems such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and

These assumptions are, however, based on our incomplete understanding of interactions occurring between phages and bacteria and should, thus, be studied in more depth.
