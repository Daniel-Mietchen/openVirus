  <p>The numbers of T
   <sub>FH</sub> cells were reduced in spleens of 
   <italic>Ifitm3
    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> mice after TIV immunization. (a) Lymphocytes were isolated from splenocytes from each group of mice. The populations of CD3
   <sup>+</sup>CD4
   <sup>+</sup>CD44
   <sup>hi</sup>CXCR5
   <sup>hi</sup>PD1
   <sup>hi</sup> cells were defined as T
   <sub>FH</sub> cells and analyzed by flow cytometric analysis. (b) The percentage of T
   <sub>FH</sub> cells among CD3
   <sup>+</sup>CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells were compared between WT and 
   <italic>Ifitm3
    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> mice at days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after booster (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). The bars represent the mean values and the standard errors of the means. Significant differences are marked by * 
   <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.01, *** 
   <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.001.
