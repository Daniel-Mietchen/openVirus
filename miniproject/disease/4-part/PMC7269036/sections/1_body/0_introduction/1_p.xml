<p>Influenza continues to threaten global public health and causes major morbidity and mortality in humans during seasonal epidemics, occasional pandemics, and zoonotic outbreaks [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Influenza A virus (IAV) has evolved various strategies to evade host defenses and acquire antiviral drug resistance [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The host produces a variety of factors that are able to fight Influenza virus infection through various mechanisms. Interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 3 is upregulated upon stimulation of cells by type I and II IFNs [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. IFITM3 is a 15-kDa membrane-associated protein that localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes and inhibits viral entry into the host cell cytoplasm by impeding the formation of the virus fusion pore [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. IFITM3 was identified as a host antiviral factor following RNA interference genomic screening for host factors involved in influenza virus infection during the pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus outbreak [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. IFITM3 was found to be one of the most potent antiviral factors in restricting influenza virus infection, as IFITM3 knockout mice displayed enhanced morbidity and mortality associated with pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several distinct studies have revealed that IFITM3 plays a role in immune function [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IFITM3 was constitutively expressed in mouse lung-resident memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells after challenge with influenza virus, enabling the mice to withstand viral infection during a secondary challenge and effecting quick protection at the site of viral entry [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, respiratory dendritic cells up-regulate the expression of IFITM3 in response to influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
