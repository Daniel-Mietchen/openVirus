<p>IFITM3 is an important antiviral factor in restricting influenza virus infection. The SNP rs12252-C allele of 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> had been linked with severe illness in adults during pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus infections, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We were curious about whether IFITM3 plays an important role in the regulation of the immune system and so we investigated the antibody responses of three IFITM3 rs12252 genotype carriers after TIV immunization. Our results showed that 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-C/C carriers exhibited a lower level of antibody response to H1N1, H3N2 and B viruses compared with rs12252-T/T carriers after TIV immunization, suggesting that the 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> genotype may be associated with antibody response. The same phenomenon was also observed in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice after TIV immunization. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for IFITM3 in the antibody response. The research from 
 <italic>Ling Qin et al</italic> who investigated the influenza vaccination response is associated with IFITM3 gene in human population. The results showed that the median fold of increasing HI antibody to pdm09H1N1 in volunteers with the rs12252-C/C genotype was much lower than the change in rs12252-T/T genotypes on both days 14 and 28 after vaccination [
