<p>Blood cell count analysis is a simple, effective, and rapid laboratory diagnostic basis for evaluating infectious inflammatory responses.
 <xref rid="jcla23191-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> The influenza virus‐infected patients analyzed in this paper were mainly elderly people. Additionally, elderly people were mainly involved as the controls in this study. Therefore, the age and sex distribution of the selected controls were as close as possible to those of the influenza virus‐infected group. The results showed that routine blood indicators were independent of age and sex, consistent with the findings of previous literature reports.

Influenza virus infection induced a relatively increased N count and a relatively decreased L count, which was different from the changes caused by other common viruses such as adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, EB virus, human herpes virus type 6, and enterovirus.

 <xref rid="jcla23191-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> A hemogram is a basic investigation performed in all admitted patients (including patients with respiratory tract infection), and NLR can be easily calculated from the results. Previous studies have independently assessed the clinical significance of these blood markers in various patients, specifically in those with malignancies. Here, we evaluated the early predictive value of NLR in influenza virus infection. Additionally, no significant difference in hematological parameters was found between different subtypes of influenza virus A (20 H1N1, 9H7N9, and 10 H3), but further elaboration is needed in more cases.
