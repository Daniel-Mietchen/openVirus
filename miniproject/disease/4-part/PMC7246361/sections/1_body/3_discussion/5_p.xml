<p>In addition, our data demonstrated that RBC, Hb, and PNR were higher in influenza virus infection than in bacterial infection. They were differential diagnostic indicators for infection caused by influenza virus vs bacteria. At present, it is well known that influenza hemagglutinin readily binds to sialic acid receptors on the membranes of red blood cells, causing red blood cells to clump together or agglutinate.
