 <xref rid="jcla23191-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Since avian influenza was first identified in Shanghai, China, in March 2013, there have been a total of five epidemics.
 <xref rid="jcla23191-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Patients with influenza virus mostly present with fever and cough are prone to progression to viral pneumonia. Moreover, in the event of acute respiratory distress and important organ dysfunction, the fatality rate is even higher. In addition, late diagnosis of community‚Äêacquired influenza A virus infection is associated with a delay in ICU admission, greater possibilities of respiratory and renal failure, and higher mortality rate. Delay in diagnosis of flu is an independent variable related to death. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment with antivirals are critical for achieving effective therapeutic outcomes.
