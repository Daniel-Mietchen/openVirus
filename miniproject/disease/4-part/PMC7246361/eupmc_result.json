    "BACKGROUND:The differential diagnoses of patients hospitalized for respiratory infections due to influenza virus vs other pathogens are challenging. Our study investigated whether hematological parameters such as neutrophil (N), lymphocyte (L), platelet (PLT), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) contributed in diagnosing influenza virus infections and in discriminating other respiratory infections. METHODS:We retrospectively analyzed the laboratory characteristics of 307 patients with respiratory infections caused by influenza/non-influenza virus and bacteria. The diagnostic abilities of hematological indexes were evaluated in the patients compared with 100 healthy people. RESULTS:The hematological parameters in patients with influenza virus infection were dramatically altered compared with those in the controls. Additionally, among the systemic inflammatory markers, the sensitivity of NLR for influenza detection was higher than that of N and L. PLT was significantly lower in influenza virus-positive infection than in influenza virus-negative infection. Moreover, when patients with influenza virus infection were cured, PLT returned to a normal level. The red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels of influenza virus infection were higher than those of bacterial infection. Compared with traditional N and L, NLR and platelet-to-neutrophil (PNR) showed greater significance between influenza virus and bacterial infection (P < .01). CONCLUSION:Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with high sensitivity is a preferable diagnostic tool to screen influenza virus-infected patients than N and L. PLT accounts in the differential diagnoses of respiratory infections due to influenza virus and other pathogens among patients. In addition, RBC, Hb, NLR, and PNR can significantly differentiate between influenza virus infections and bacterial infections."
