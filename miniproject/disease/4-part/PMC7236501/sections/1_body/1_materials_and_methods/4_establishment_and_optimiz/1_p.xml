<p>To establish the RT-PSR method, firstly, we reverse transcribed the template RNA into cDNA and performed a PCR to ensure availability of the cDNA. To determine whether a PSR occurred, cDNA was used as a template without reverse transcriptase. The reaction was carried out in a final mixture of 25 μl, which consisted of 20.0 mM Tris-HCl, 10.0 mM (NH4)
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, 10.0 mM KCl, 8.0 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% Triton X-100, 0.8M betaine, 1.4 mM dNTP (each), 8 U Bst DNA polymerase, 1.6 μM Ft and Bt, and 0.8 μM LF and LB. After 2-μl templates were added, the total volume was made up to 25 μl with DEPC-treated water. The entire reaction was performed in a Roche real-time PCR instrument. The reaction conditions were set to collect fluorescence signals every 45 s, for 99 cycles, and the reaction temperature was constant at 63°C. After verifying the feasibility of the PSR, 10 U reverse transcriptase was added to the system, and RNA was used directly as a template for RT-PSR amplification.
