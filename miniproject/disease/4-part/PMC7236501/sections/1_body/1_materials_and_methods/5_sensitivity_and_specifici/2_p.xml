<p>For validation of specificity, each non-target virus was validated using a corresponding clinically standardized method. The colloidal gold diagnostic kit was used for the detection of RVA. CVA-6, EV-A71, and NVG II were tested using their qRT-PCR test kits, respectively. The nucleic acid of each virus was separately extracted and detected using RT-PSR. After elected samples that can be used for specific detection, each virus nucleic acid was separately extracted and detected using RT-PSR method. DEPC-treated water was used as the NC. The reaction conditions were 64Â°C, 45 s, 80 cycles, and the reaction system contained both polymerase and reverse transcriptase. After the reaction, all the amplification products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and HNB dye was added for visual identification. Unless noted otherwise, parallel control and NC were included in each run, and the results were reproducible.</p>
