<p>To determine the analytical sensitivity of RT-PSR, the plasmid was diluted 10-fold with TE buffer (2.4 × 10
 <sup>8</sup>, 2.4 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>, 2.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>, 2.4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>, 2.4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 2.4 × 10

 <sup>1</sup> copies/μl). We added 2 μl of the diluted plasmid template to the reaction system. Because the plasmid was used as a template, the system for sensitivity detection did not contain reverse transcriptase. DEPC-treated water was used as the negative control (NC). The reaction conditions were 64°C, 45 s, 80 cycles. For comparison, the sensitivity of clinical qRT-PCR was also tested. The qRT-PCR system contained master buffer solution, Taq enzyme system, and reverse transcriptase system. Its reaction procedure was as follows: reverse transcription at 40°C for 25 min, initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, 93°C for 15 s, and 55°C for 45 s. A Ct value of 34.8 was set as the critical point for its positivity.
