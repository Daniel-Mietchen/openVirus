<p>In RT-PSR, under the action of reverse transcriptase, viral RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA. After that, the primers specifically bound to single-stranded cDNA and were extended by DNA polymerase. During amplification, the reverse transcription process continued, which greatly improved the amplification efficiency (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) and synthesize them, the next step was to establish the reaction process and select the best primers. Template RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and was amplified using the designed PCR primers to ensure availability for PSR. The target band was observed in the electrophoretogram of the PCR results, demonstrating availability of the cDNA template (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). When cDNA was used as a template, primer 1 showed non-specific amplification, while amplification of primer 2 was performed normally (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). When RNA was used as a template, primer 1 still showed dimerization and the amplification efficiency was significantly lower than that of primer 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, primer 2 was selected as the best RT-PSR primer for CVA-16 detection. Subsequently, we used primer 2 for RT-PSR. CVA-16 genomic RNA (100 ng/μl) was used as a positive sample, while DEPC-treated water was used as NC, and the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel, which showed a characteristic DNA ladder in positive samples, while the NC showed no fragmentation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This proved that under isothermal conditions, the method developed in this study performs reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification in the same system. To achieve the best reaction performance, using CVA-16 genomic RNA (100 ng/μl) optimized some important factors, including optimal primers, reaction time, and temperature. According to the optimal primer screening, a series of temperature gradients (62–66°C) was set to observe the effects of different temperatures on the reaction, with 64°C being chosen as the optimum temperature of detection because it showed the shortest peak time and amplification efficiency was higher than at other temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). The fluorescence curve had a longer plateau period, so the number of cycles was reduced to 80. Moreover, by comparing negative and positive results, adding 2 μl HNB dye with a mass fraction of 2% to 25 μl mixtures better distinguished the negative and positive samples (

Additionally, to avoid aerosol contamination and cross-contamination caused by nucleic acid amplification, we premixed and aliquoted the reaction solution. We added 10 μl paraffin oil to each tube and stored it at −20°C (
