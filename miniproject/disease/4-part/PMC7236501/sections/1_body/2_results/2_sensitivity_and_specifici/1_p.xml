<p>To determine the sensitivity of RT-PSR, we tested gradient-diluted plasmid templates. Under natural light, when the target template concentration was ≥ 2.4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μl, the color of the reaction solution became sky blue. When the template was DEPC-treated water or the template concentration was 2.4 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μl, the color of the reaction mixture was violet. Agarose gel electrophoresis yielded the same results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Amplification curves were observed when the template concentration was ≥ 2.4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μl. When the template concentration was 2.4 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μl or the template was DEPC-treated water, no change in fluorescence were observed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). Therefore, the detection limit of this method was between 2.4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> and 2.4 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μl, while the detection limit of qRT-PCR was between 2.4 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 2.4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μl (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).
