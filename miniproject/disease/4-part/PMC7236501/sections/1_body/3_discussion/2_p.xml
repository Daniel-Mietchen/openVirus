<p>In this study, we developed a method based on RT-PSR for rapid identification of CVA-16. In comparison with traditional approaches and other molecular biological methods for CVA-16 detection, RT-PSR was superior. Firstly, compared with traditional virus isolation and identification (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2008</xref>), our method greatly reduces the time required and is more convenient to operate. Secondly, compared with the LAMP method (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2014</xref>), the primer design and amplification principle of RT-PSR are simpler. Only a pair of main primers and a pair of accelerated primers can amplify a large amount of template RNA in a short time. Thirdly, using the assay developed in this study, the detection limit of this method can reach between 2.4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> and 2.4 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μl, which is about 10 times more sensitive than qRT-PCR. Our method greatly shortens the clinical testing time while avoiding the use of large PCR instruments. Finally, the reaction can achieve the purpose of visual detection without the use of fluorescent probes, which effectively reduces the cost. The operator only needs to add the enzyme and RNA template, and briefly centrifuge before the reaction, which further simplifies the operation. The method provides feasible technical support for real-time and on-site testing, especially in poorly resourced rural and suburban areas, which will help expand the control of HFMD and other viral diseases.
