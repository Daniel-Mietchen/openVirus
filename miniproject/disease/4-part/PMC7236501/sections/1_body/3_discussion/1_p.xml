<p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common childhood disease that is increasingly recognized as a major health problem, causing a huge economic and health burden in China (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2013</xref>). By observing the clinical data of 40 cases in this study, we found that the incidence of HFMD was highest in children aged &lt; 5 years. This may have been due to the lower immunity of infants and young children, and handâ€“mouth behavior of children is more frequent, making it easier for the virus to spread. The clinical symptoms and signs are more typical, and the prognosis is better after treatment. Therefore, health education on HFMD prevention and control and awareness of HFMD should be enhanced. In addition, we must strengthen surveillance of the epidemic and detect patients as early as possible. The capability for accurate diagnosis is a prerequisite for adequate clinical and public health response, and early detection and proper treatment remain the keys to reducing mortality (
