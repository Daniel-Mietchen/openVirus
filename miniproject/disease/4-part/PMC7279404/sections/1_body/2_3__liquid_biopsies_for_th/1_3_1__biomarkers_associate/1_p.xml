<p>NAFLD is a well-known liver disorder, with 25% prevalence across the globe. It is broadly distributed in diverse populations and regions. NASH is the severe form of NAFLD, which is characterized by lobular inflammation or the chronic low-grade proinflammatory state of hepatocytes with or without fibrosis. NAFLD is currently the most prevalent cause of liver transplantation [

The prevalence of NAFLD has increased rapidly over the past few decades in the Asiaâ€“Pacific region, at a comparable rate to westernization. NAFLD is an intermediate stage in various progressive diseases that are not associated with high alcohol intake. Clinical manifestations include confined intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation (exceeding 5%) and necroinflammation of the hepatocytes, with some patients progressing to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. Lipotoxicity develops during the progression of NAFLD owing to the accumulation of toxic lipids and stressed/damaged hepatocytes; it is linked to metabolic disorders including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and obesity [
