<p>Chronic liver disease is a major public health issue globally. It includes chronic viral hepatitis, fatty liver disease, among other causes, and accounts for approximately 3.5% of deaths [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Viral hepatitis is a persistent state of liver inflammation caused by various viruses. It increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) and chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC) infections are major risk factors for HCC, and the association has ranged from 45 to 80% in various regional epidemics. In recent decades, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-associated liver disease have emerged as urgent etiologies associated with an increasingly westernized global lifestyle. It is worth noting that the increase in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome may have led, directly or indirectly, to an increase in the incidence of HCC [
