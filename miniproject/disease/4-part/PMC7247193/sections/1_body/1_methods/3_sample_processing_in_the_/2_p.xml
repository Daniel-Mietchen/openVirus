<p id="Par20">This F0 generation was maintained under standard insectarium conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (temperature of 27 ± 1 °C, relative humidity of 80% and a photoperiod of 12: 12 h) and was fed with 10% sucrose and then authorized to take a blood meal for egg production 1 week after emergence. These eggs were then flooded and the hatching larvae reared to F1 adults at the standard insectarium conditions described above. F0 and F1 mosquito adults were frozen, identified and pooled in 1 to 50 individuals by species, breeding site and land cover of origin, and kept at − 80 °C for ZIKV detection attempts by Reverse Transcriptase-Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).
