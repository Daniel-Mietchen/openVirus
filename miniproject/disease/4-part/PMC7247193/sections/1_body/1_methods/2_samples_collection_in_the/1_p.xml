<p id="Par18">Samples were collected in December 2015, October 2016 and March 2017 corresponding to the beginning and middle of the dry season in KÃ©dougou during these years. Collection of soil, sand and detritus from dry breeding sites of arbovirus vectors was done using spoons and washing of the breading sites and water recovery. The known

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] including fruit husks, tree holes, rock holes, discarded containers, and used tires were sampled in 3 villages (Ngari, Bagnomba, and Tenkoto), 2 forests galleries (PK10 and A2F), 2 savannahs (D1S and E1S), 2 barrens (C1B and B2B), and 2 agricultures (B1A and E1A) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These land covers were identified and well described in several previous papers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Samples were put in individual plastic bags or boxes and transported to the Laboratory of the medical zoology pole of Institut Pasteur de Dakar. No permission was needed for samples collection.
