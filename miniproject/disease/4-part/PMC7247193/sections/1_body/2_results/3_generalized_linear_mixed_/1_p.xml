<p id="Par26">Results of the GLMM indicated that breeding site, and landcover types did not affect the abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. bromeliae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The model also revealed that there was no significant difference in abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in land cover classes (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03). The abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in tires was significantly higher than in DC, RH and TH (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. unilineatus</italic> were similar in agriculture, barren, forest and village (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.16), and significantly lower than in Savannah land cover (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03).
