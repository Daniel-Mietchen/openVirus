<p id="Par23">A total of 1016 mosquitoes belonging to 13 species of the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> were collected at our study sites in December 2015, October 2016, and March 2017 (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Adult mosquitoes emerged from eggs collected in forest (734 specimens), savannah (77 specimens), agriculture (7 specimens), village (163 specimens) and barren (35 specimens) land covers. A greater diversity of the mosquito fauna was observed in the forests (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with a total of 12 species collected in this land cover
 <italic>.</italic> The forests were followed by savannahs, villages, and barrens with 5 species collected in each land cover. Agricultures had the lowest diversity with only 2 species collected. Tree holes were the breeding sites with the more diversified mosquito fauna (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with 9 species collected. They were followed by rock holes with 8 species and tires with 3 species. The least diversified breeding sites were discarded containers where only 2 species were collected.
