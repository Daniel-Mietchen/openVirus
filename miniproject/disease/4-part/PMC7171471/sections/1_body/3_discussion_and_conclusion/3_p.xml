<p>Our data also indicated that the incidence of flu B in hospitalized patients was relatively high, in contrast with previous Iranian reports of 2.5% to 2.8% flu B prevalence among hospitalized patients.(4, 6) Other studies have evaluated distribution of types and subtypes of influenza viruses in patients. Horthongkham 
 <italic>et al.</italic> reported 3.1% for flu B and they concluded that Victoria lineage was significantly associated with the duration of hospitalization.

 </sup> However, in here, we did not analyze the lineage of flu B viruses in hospitalized patients. Cohen et al reported prevalence of 8% for influenza, A (H3N2) 37% and flu B (34%).

  <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
 </sup> Garg 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that fluA (H3N2) 62.8% and flu B (28.5%) had the highest rates for 2017-2018 influenza seasonality.
