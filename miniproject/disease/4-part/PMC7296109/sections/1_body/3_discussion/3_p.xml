<p>Eradication was sometimes difficult, long-lasting, and costly, as demonstrated in Spain, where the disease was present for 35 years before its eradication (

It was reached in a reasonable, or very short, period in Cuba, Brazil, Belgium, Malta, mainland Italy, France, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti due to the application of classical preventive and surveillance measures. Cases of particular interest were represented by France and Belgium. In France, the eradication was possible through the application of classical measures, but was facilitated by the presence of the Pyrenees (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) that were promptly eradicated. In Belgium, both the favorable epidemiological circumstances leading to slow viral spread and the short interval between the disease confirmation and eradication in most of the affected farms, enabled disease eradication in 6 months.
