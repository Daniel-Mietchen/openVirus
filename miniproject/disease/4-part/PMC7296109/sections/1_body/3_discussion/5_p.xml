<p>These results are sustained by a recent review (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), in which different surveillance and intervention strategies for ASF and their effectiveness were assessed, based on expert opinion. The authors identified surveillance and intervention strategies perceived as being the most effective. Among the 20 surveillance strategies identified, passive surveillance of wild boar and syndromic surveillance of pig mortality were considered to be the most effective for controlling ASFV spread, whereas culling of all infected herds and movement bans for neighboring herds were considered as the most effective intervention strategies. Regarding wild boar populations, active surveillance, and carcass removal were rated as the most effective surveillance and intervention strategies, respectively, but they were also considered the least practical, suggesting that more research is needed to develop more effective methods (
