<p>It is noteworthy that only in one occasion ASF has spread outside Sardinia: in Piedmont, in March 1983 (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), affecting only three farms. This was due to wild boar meat imported from Sardinia. Strict quarantine and slaughter measures limited the spread of the disease in Piedmont and the outbreak was successfully eradicated (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Therefore, the presence of ASFV in the island seems to pose a limited risk to the pig sector of ASF-free European countries (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>).
