<p>Results of this review also confirmed that the role of wild boar was generally supported by other factors (the presence of tick vectors in Portugal, human-mediated in the Baltic states, human factors in Sardinia, etc.). However, the density and population dynamics of wild boars currently represent a new challenge to solve. A scientific opinion was recently published by the EFSA (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>), with the aim of providing an estimate of the wild boar densities in the EU, identifying thresholds in the wild boar density that do not allow sustaining the disease in different settings, and reviewing wild boar depopulation methods or population density reduction methods. They reported that passive surveillance on dead wild boars is the most effective and efficient method for early detection of ASF in free areas. Preventive measures for reducing and stabilizing wild boar density, before ASF introduction, will be beneficial both in reducing the probability of exposure of the population to ASFV, and the efforts needed for potential emergency actions (i.e., less carcass removal) if an ASF incursion were to occur.
