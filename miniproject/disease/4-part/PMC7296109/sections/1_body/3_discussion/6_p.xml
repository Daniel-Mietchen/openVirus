<p>Currently, ASF is still present in some geographical areas of eastern and northern Europe and it is endemic in Sardinia (Italy) (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). In contrast to countries that achieved eradication, the Italian island of Sardinia is the only European ASF-infected area where the disease has been endemic since 1978 (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) as a consequence of the first European epidemic wave. In the past, the arduous habitat and the old practice of “brado” (free-range pig keeping, illegally maintained in public concession areas in traditional breeding practices) (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) on state-owned pastures represent an essential epidemiological link between the domestic pig and the wild boar population in the central-eastern part of the island (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The overlap of these epidemiological conditions, together with other social and economic factors, represent the main obstacle to eradication. Recently, the fight against illegal breeding was intensified by mandatory culling and economic support to improve the farms' biosecurity levels, aiming to promote high quality pig products in compliance with local traditions (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). At present, the levels of infection in the population of feral pigs are decreasing and wild boars are considered a source of infection that is of secondary relevance to the presence of illegal wild pig breeding. Therefore, a hunting regulation plan, aimed at increasing the biosecurity level of hunting, as well as effective monitoring of the epidemiological situation were applied, and additional actions to limit wild boar population density were promoted.
