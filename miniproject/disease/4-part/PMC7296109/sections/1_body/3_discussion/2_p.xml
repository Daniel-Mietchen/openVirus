<p>Eradication was possible in different epidemiological contexts, with intensive or extensive swine breeding, and also in areas with the presence of or with an intimate association between 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> and pigs, such as in Portugal and Spain (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Nevertheless, it should be considered that eradication of 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> ticks is extremely difficult (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>) and epidemiological studies carried out in infected areas of Spain highlighted that, once ASF was eradicated from the domestic pig population, it also disappeared from the wild pig population. Therefore, most probably, the role of the wild boar population was not relevant in the spread of the disease (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) or in the persistence of viral circulation. Based on epidemiological data from the Spanish scenario, the role of carriers in virus dissemination seemed to be not so important when appropriate control measures were put in place (
