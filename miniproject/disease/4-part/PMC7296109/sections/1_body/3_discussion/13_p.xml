<p>As a matter of fact, ASF can occur as an epidemic, making long jumps, crossing borders, and even passing through continents; very often the first occurrence of the disease is a harbinger of rapid dissemination in na√Øve populations, whereas, in the past, certain outbreaks were immediately resolved by applying restrictive measures to the infected farms due to early detection. On the other hand, the viral spread could evolve in an endemic manner, in both the domestic and wild populations, due to its persistence in vectors or wild hosts, or due to human factors. In these cases, the eradication strategies are less effective and very expensive to apply in terms of direct and indirect costs. These lessons have been widely underestimated; nevertheless, we are learning that new sources of infection, which can create new scenarios, should be considered in risk analysis: the most important factor, which has been underestimated in the past, is the human factor. Probably, when early detection is applied along with strong awareness campaigns, this factor could have a limited effect. Nowadays, globalization, the movements of people, trades, and other similar factors, are currently contributing to increase the risk of ASF spread. Therefore, the most relevant lesson that should be considered is that the human role, human behaviors, social, cultural, and historical factors involved particularly in endemic areas, are crucial in any step of ASF control. Besides the wild boar population and habitat, the current European epidemiological situation also implicates humans as the main cause of both long-distance transmission and virus introduction to domestic pig farms (

The countries that succeeded in eradicating the disease teach us that prompt eradication can be achieved only by applying early detection and proper control and intervention strategies, as foreseen by the EU legal framework for ASF. In fact, the prompt identification of cases allowed rapid eradication of the disease in the case of mainland Italy, Malta, and Belgium, and the epidemiology and laboratory networks played an important role in gathering data and providing epidemiological interpretation. Where a well-structured collaboration among different institutions of affected countries was put in place in the cases of Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, mainland Italy, Portugal, and Spain, successful eradication was achieved even in scarce economic contexts. Effective eradication was achieved when task forces of experts and appropriate communication skills, appropriate to that historical period, were applied. Instead, drastic measures applied for eradication of ASF in Cuba, such as killing of rats, elimination of dogs, cats, and other animals that could have acted as mechanical vectors of the virus, would be inapplicable in EU countries.
