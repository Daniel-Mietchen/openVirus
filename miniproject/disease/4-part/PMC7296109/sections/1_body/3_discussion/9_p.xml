<p>Similarly, as in Sardinia, humans' role was also considered to be relevant in the disease spread in the Northern European scenario (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Epidemiological analysis of ASF in the Baltic States and Poland, performed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), aiming at estimating the relationship between the presence of ASFV in the wild boar population and environmental/biological factors, indicated that the human-mediated spread of ASFV played a critical role in the epidemiology of the disease. It was concluded that reduction of the wild boar population and carcass removal to stop the spread of ASFV in the wild boar population were more effective when applied preventively. The pressure exerted by outbreaks both in the domestic and in the wild population in the former Soviet Republics eventually involved European Union Member Countries, such as Poland and the Baltic Republics (Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia) that were progressively affected from the beginning of 2014 to date (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The analysis of available data regarding the incidence of ASF outbreaks in certain non-EU Countries authorizes the suspect of lack of information. In this context, it is quite impossible to properly investigate the relevance of multiple introduction of the virus in the epidemiology of this disease. However, ASFV does not recognize country borders and if considering the viral circulation in connected wild boar populations, progress of the virus in the border areas can be foreseen. On the other hand, it is pleonastic to remark that in the case of single introduction of the virus in a previously free territory or, better, in the case of focal spread in a very limited area, the chances to promptly reach the disease eradication are significant, especially if associated with an early detection and an efficient application of restriction measures.
