<p>Additional information was considered if new papers (in addition to the primary sources) were retrieved by reading the primary sources of information or by manual searches. Secondary information sources were considered in the analysis to ensure inclusion of all available past literature by including additional papers not directly found by the primary searches. The additional papers found as supplementary source of information were used if they met the eligibility criteria or if they complemented some information already achieved through the primary source of information. They were included as “other sources” within the PRISMA Flow Diagram in the identification section (
