<p>The causative agent of African swine fever is a unique member of the 
 <italic>Asfarviridae</italic> family, the 
 <italic>Asfivirus</italic> (ASFV) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>); a genetically complex double-stranded DNA virus that contains a series of genes related to virulence, immune evasion, and cell process modulation (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Twenty-three genotypes have been described based on the partial sequences of the p72 gene (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). All 23 genotypes are present in Africa, whereas only genotypes I and II have been found outside of that continent. ASF is a notifiable disease in the European Union (EU) and should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Due to the related impact on international trade in live animals and swine products and the socio-economic consequences on individuals' livelihoods, the disease remains a major concern for infected and non-infected countries, as there is no effective treatment and effective vaccines are not still available (
