<p id="Par18">The specific exposure date was not collected by the data source. We calculated the exposure date to H7N9 virus for each case based on the confirmed dates of cases we had. The days from exposure to confirmed days was defined as: days from infection to onset (3.5) + days from onset to hospital admission (3) + days from hospital admission to laboratory-confirmed (7.5) = about 14 days (2 weeks) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The timelines for each city were derived by matching the calculated live poultry exposure dates of the cases with the start and end dates of the LPMs closure on the time axis. We correspond to the peak periods of H7N9 epidemic in different cities as the respective study periods, that is, from exposure date of the first case or the start date of the LPMs closure in each city, to exposure date the last case or the reopening date of the LPMs.
