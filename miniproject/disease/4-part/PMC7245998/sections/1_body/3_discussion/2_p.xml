<p id="Par28">How does the scope of LPMs closure affect? Yu and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] demonstrated that closure of LPMs in four cities reduced the risk of human infections by 97–99% in June of 2013. It has indicated that LPMs closures were effective in controlling the human risk of H7N9 infection at that early time of H7N9 outbreak. But their study suggested that LPMs closure should be sustained in at-risk areas and implemented in any urban areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our study’s results of Hangzhou and Suzhou city indicated if only urban area implemented the LPMs closure would not be effective to reduce the risk for human H7N9 infected, may due to the people who have the habit of eating live poultry are still willing to the suburb or rural area to purchase the live poultry. In one investigated study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] convincingly demonstrated this fact that all respondents were asked about, without consideration of other factors, which type of the chicken they preferred most among the four types of chicken (i.e. live, freshly slaughtered, chilled or frozen). A significant portion of 47% of respondents indicated that they preferred live chicken above other forms of chicken, while 32% expressed “indifferent”. Live poultry is a necessity for many residents and related workers, that may explain why partial closure does not cause have an ideal controlling consequent. The separate area to conducted LPMs closure in a city cannot really block the exposure of live poultry.
