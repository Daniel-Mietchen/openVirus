  <p>Novel alleles observed in the 10 evolved lineages, relative to the VSV reference genome (GI:9627229). (a) Random pool and (b) 37°C pool. The vertical lines on the top panel are the relative position of the observed mutations in the VSV genome. Numbers on the bottom panel indicate the position of the mutations. Symbols indicate the nucleotide of the derived allele: filled square (T), filled circle (A), filled triangle (G), filled diamond (C), circle outline (M), triangle outline (R), square outline (S), and diamond outline (Y). Highlighted in black are derived alleles detected in the ancestral pool at &gt;1% frequency; in grey are derived alleles not detected in the pool but present at low frequency (&gt;1%) in any of the original populations from Alto et al. (
   <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) that gave rise to the corresponding pool. VSV genes are shown: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and large protein (L). Alleles known to have fixed between the reference genome and the ancestral lineages from Alto et al. (
   <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) are not shown
