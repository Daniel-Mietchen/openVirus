<p>We used VSV and tissue culture cells as a model to compare and contrast phenotypic and molecular evolution of RNA viruses, when evolved in constant versus fluctuating temperature environments for host‐cell infection (Alto, Wasik, Morales, &amp; Turner, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). A single ancestral genotype (clone) of VSV was used to found five replicate lineages in a high temperature treatment that imposed constant selection at 37°C and in a random temperature treatment where the selective environment stochastically changed each passage day, in the interval ranging between 29°C and 37°C. The experiment comprised 25 passages total (i.e., 100 generations of VSV evolution; Alto et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Results showed that virus populations passaged at 37°C improved in fitness relative to their ancestor, in both the selective environment and via correlated improvement at the lower edge of the thermal niche, 29°C. In contrast, viruses evolved under stochastic temperatures failed to increase in fitness relative to their ancestor at either temperature extremes, 29°C and 37°C (Alto et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). For these reasons, here we define the constant 37°C ‐evolved virus lineages as adapted to their selective environment, whereas the random temperature‐selected lineages of viruses are maladapted to their prior environment.
