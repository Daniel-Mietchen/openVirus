<p>Despite these expected differences, it is unclear whether previous adaptation versus maladaptation in a selective environment should be consequential for evolvability in a novel habitat where all populations are equally unfit. One possibility is that prior successful adaptation molds genetic architecture, such that the population experiences a relatively greater likelihood of conditionally beneficial mutations in the new environment. That is, previously adapted versus maladapted populations can undergo the same spontaneous mutation rate in the novel environment, but the well‐adapted population could more easily evolve via beneficial mutations that modify existing phenotypic traits to achieve more rapid fitness improvement (Bjorklund,

 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). This idea seems especially plausible if the novel environment is constant and an extension of the prior habitat (e.g., selection at a novel elevated temperature that is close to the thermal condition of the prior environment). On the other hand, if greater standing genetic variation increases the likelihood that a population will harbor conditionally beneficial alleles in the novel environment, the prior‐maladapted population may experience a relative advantage in evolvability. Importantly, this idea assumes that accumulation of mutations in the prior environment is proportional to the probability that this variation will be useful for fitness in the novel condition. Although some experimental evolution studies have tested the role of historical contingency in further evolution (e.g., Kryazhimskiy, Rice, Jenison, &amp; Desai, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Meyer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Travisano, Mongold, Bennett, &amp; Lenski, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>; Zachary, Borland, &amp; Lenski, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), the evolutionary fate of adapted versus maladapted populations in a novel environment has rarely been tested.
