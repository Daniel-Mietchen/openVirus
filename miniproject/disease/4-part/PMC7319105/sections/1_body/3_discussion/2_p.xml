<p>A fundamental goal of evolutionary biology is to improve its predictive power as a science, such as accurately predicting genotype–phenotype associations, and the future adaptive trajectories of evolving lineages (Graves &amp; Weinreich,

These aims are ambitious, because there are many ways that the effect of a beneficial allele on individual fitness can change over time, making it difficult to predict its long‐term evolutionary fate. For example, the biotic and abiotic environments in which the allele resides may change over time, presenting new challenges that may alter whether allele effects on gene expression, pleiotropy, and epistasis remain beneficial for individual fitness. Moreover, the fitness effects of a beneficial allele can change when additional mutations at other loci cause additions/deletions in the genome, and its effects can be altered if fitness depends on the relative abundance of other genotypes in the population (frequency dependence). Essentially, these myriad variables indicate that the fitness benefit experienced by an allele or genotype can change across generations and environments (e.g., evolutionary landscapes, Remold,
