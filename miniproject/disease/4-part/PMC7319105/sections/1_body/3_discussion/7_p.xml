<p>The genetic differences that separated the evolved lineages from their ancestral gene pools suggested that genetic architectures and epistasis may have played key roles. The virus populations historically evolved in random temperatures achieved relatively higher fitness in the novel 40°C environment in the time allowed, but these lineages showed few similarities to one another in terms of genetic changes that could account for their highly similar phenotypic improvements. This result clearly indicates that relatively more genetic “solutions” existed for these populations to meet the adaptation challenge, relative to the obvious parallelism observed among the 37°C ‐evolved populations. Moreover, the latter 37°C ‐evolved populations did not manage to improve in fitness in the new environment, on average, despite the strong selection to evolve similar—and fewer—solutions to the selection problem. So, prior adaptive success among the 37°C ‐evolved populations constrained mutational solutions in the novel temperature environment. Altogether, these data suggest that the prior experiment by Alto et al., (
