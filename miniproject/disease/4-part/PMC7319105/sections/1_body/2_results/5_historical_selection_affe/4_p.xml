<p>In addition, we observed differing patterns of parallel molecular evolution in our study (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a and 3b</xref>). In particular, greater parallelism was observed in the populations that experienced prior selection at 37°C (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). All five of these lineages showed an identical fixed amino acid substitution in the VSV large (L) protein gene (A9594G: Tyr to Cys). Four out of five of these populations also showed an identical fixed or polymorphic change in the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene (A4148C) that does not change the amino acid sequence. In contrast, none of the populations previously evolved under random temperatures showed this allele change in G, and three of these lineages showed evidence of the same change or a different one in the allele position in L (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Otherwise, the random A‐E populations showed no detectable evidence for parallel molecular substitutions.
