<p>Sanger sequencing data in the previous study (Alto et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) suggested that greater average genetic variation was harbored in the five populations evolved in the random temperature treatment, relative to the five lineages evolved at 37°C. These sets of populations were used to create the two ancestral gene pools in the current study (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
