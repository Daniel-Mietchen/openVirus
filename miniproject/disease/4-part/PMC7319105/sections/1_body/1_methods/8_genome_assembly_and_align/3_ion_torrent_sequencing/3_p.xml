<p>Note that while we use two different NGS technologies differing in their manufacturers’ reported error rates (Illumina: 0.001 vs. Ion Torrent: 0.01), Ion Torrent substitution error rates (excluding indels) are an order of magnitude lower (Bragg, Stone, Butler, Hugenholtz, &amp; Tyson, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Huang, Hung, &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) and thus similar to that of Illumina technology. Thus, a minority‐variant filter of &lt;0.01 is appropriate and in agreement with cutoffs suggested by previous reports studying viral quasi‐species (Van den Hoecke, Verhelst, Vuylsteke, &amp; Saelens, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
