<p>In the current study, two ancestral “gene pools” were created, using viruses from the Alto et al., (

 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). One ancestral pool contained a mixture of equimolar samples from the five VSV lineages that experienced prior evolution at 37°C treatment; hereafter, this gene pool is referred to as previously selected under Constant temperature. The other ancestral pool was created identically but using the five VSV lineages that experienced random temperature selection. The current experiment used each ancestral pool to initiate five replicate populations (10 populations total; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) that were allowed to infect a cell monolayer at MOI = 0.01 plaque‐forming units (PFU) per cell (this MOI was chosen to avoid selection favoring defective‐interfering particles, characteristic of high MOI infections with VSV; Horodyski, Nichol, Spindler, &amp; Holland, 
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1983</xref>). After initial 45‐min incubation at 37°C, the infected monolayers were incubated at 40°C for 23 hr. The next day, each population was diluted 10
 <sup>4</sup>‐fold to begin the following passage by transferring an aliquot to a fresh BHK monolayer at MOI = 0.01. This process was repeated for a total of 10 passages. At the end of the experiment, aliquots of the supernatant of each virus population were sampled and stored at −80°C for later analysis. We note that mixing samples from the five evolutionary lineages in the 37°C treatment, and similarly combining those from lineages evolved under Random temperatures, ensures that a broad spectrum of mutations arising in the prior treatment conditions are present together in the same ancestral pool in the current study. An alternative design is to preserve treatment‐lineage independence by creating five separate ancestors per treatment group to study adaptation at 40°C. One important difference is that preserving lineage independence should increase the probability that low‐frequency variants in the population are represented in the founding population, potentially affecting adaptability in the new 40°C environment. This possible evolvability effect of pooling lineage samples versus preserving lineage independence is the subject of our future work.
