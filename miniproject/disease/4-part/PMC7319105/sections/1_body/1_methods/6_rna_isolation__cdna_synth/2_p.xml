<p>Genomic viral RNA was extracted from 22 test viruses: 10 lineages from the Alto et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36287-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) study that were used to establish the two ancestral pools in the current experiment (i.e., each endpoint 37°C and random lineage; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36287-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>); two ancestral pools (constant, random); and 10 endpoint (passage 10) VSV lineages in the current study. RNA isolation was performed via QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and then subjected to cDNA synthesis using 
 <italic>SuperScript II</italic> Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) and random hexamer primers. The majority of the VSV genome was amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as 8 overlapping fragments ranging between 1 and 2.5kb in length, using primers listed in Appendix
