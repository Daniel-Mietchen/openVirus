  <p>Structured coalescent-based phylogenetic tree of the samples included in the present study. Branch colors, as from legend, mark the inferred company where the ancestral strain was circulating, while branch width represents the posterior confidence of the inference. The trees reconstructed assuming just the 
   <italic>Company A</italic> and 
   <italic>B demes</italic> (left figure) and the one including also the 
   <italic>ghost deme</italic> (right figure) are reported. In the top left insert it is reported the network depicting the migration rate between 
   <italic>Company A</italic> and 
   <italic>Company B</italic>. Arrows and circles size are proportional to the inferred migration rate and population size, respectively. Similarly, the top right insert reports the network of the migration rate between 
   <italic>Company A, Company B</italic> and 
   <italic>ghost demes</italic>.
