<p id="Par29">Samples were collected for routine diagnostic purpose in the period 2012-2016 from poultry flocks belonging to the two main poultry companies (here named 
 <italic>Company A</italic> and 
 <italic>Company B</italic>) operating in Italy, which account together for about 90% of Italian poultry production. Samples were obtained mainly from outbreaks of respiratory disease, following a standard protocol that enforced the collection of a pool of 10 tracheal swabs from randomly selected birds. For each sampling, collection date and farm localization were recorded. All considered samples had been performed in the context of routine diagnostic activity and no experimental treatments or additional assays were implemented during the study. Therefore, no ethical approval was required to use specimens collected for diagnostic purpose. Additionally, several samples from 
 <italic>Company A</italic> were already sequenced using the same protocol and published in Franzo 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
