 </sup>. The history of lineage dispersal was recovered from the posterior trees generated using BEAST and annotated with ancestral longitude and latitude reconstruction. Particularly, the distance, duration and velocity of spatial dispersal were recoded as vectors and used to generate different summary statistics of viral spreading, including dispersal velocity and maximal wave front distances (measured from the location of the tree root).
