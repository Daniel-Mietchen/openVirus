<p id="Par35">Accounting for the presence of other farms and companies operating in the Italian poultry sector, which could take part in or mediate the viral transmission among the investigated major companies, a third 
 <italic>“ghost” deme</italic> (a 
 <italic>deme</italic> for which no sequences were available) was added to the model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. The priori of the 
 <italic>ghost deme</italic> size was set to one tenth of the other 
 <italic>demes</italic>, according to the estimated poultry population distribution. However, broad priori distribution (i.e. relatively uninformative priori) was chosen to avoid constrains or biases in the parameter posterior estimation.
