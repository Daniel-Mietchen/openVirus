<p id="Par26">The higher spatial overlap and the likely sharing of some infrastructures (e.g. streets, accessory personnel, services and infrastructures) could nevertheless have a negative indirect effect on the major companies, especially in Northern Italy where 
 <italic>Company B</italic> is located. However, differences between 
 <italic>Company A</italic> and 
 <italic>Company B</italic> in the application of biosecurity measures and production flow management could also explain the different IBV epidemiology, as demonstrated by the dissimilar patterns in viral population fluctuations in the two companies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A further risk factor that would deserve further investigation is the presence of the rural sector, which is highly concentrated in the densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. This sector is characterized by a complex mix of growers, dealers and backyards flocks, often applying poor biosecurity measures and linked together by a poorly traceable contact network

 </sup>. Although interactions with industrial poultry farming is hardly discouraged, illegal/indirect interactions have been documented and multiple epidemiological connections could result in a bidirectional transmission between the two sectors, as demonstrated in the Italian low pathogenicity Avian influenza (AI) outbreaks occurred in 2007–2009

 </sup>. After these episodes, a stricter legislation has been developed, imposing limits to animal movements and more active surveillance in the rural sector. Nevertheless, no measures were taken for the monitoring and control of IBV in these enterprises, and therefore their role as sources of encroachment in intensive farming cannot be excluded.
