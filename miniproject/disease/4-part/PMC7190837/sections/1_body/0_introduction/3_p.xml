<p id="Par4">Currently, the most effective control measure is vaccine application, which proved to effectively reduce clinical signs emergence, infectious pressure and viral population size, at least when properly performed

 </sup>. However, this approach cannot be considered a panacea, and some drawbacks cannot be denied. In fact, it must be kept in mind that IBV vaccination is not able to avoid animal infection and a prolonged circulation of field strains has been demonstrated even in vaccinated flocks
