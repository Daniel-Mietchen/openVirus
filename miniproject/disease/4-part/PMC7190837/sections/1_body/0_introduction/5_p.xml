<p id="Par6">One of the anthropic factors that affects and complicates the understanding of IBV epidemiology is the interaction between viral behavior and poultry production management. Modern poultry farming is typically featured by an integrated system, where all the production phases are organized and managed by a single entity/organization. The independence among the different integrated companies (i.e. separate hatcheries, means of transportation, feed delivery, slaughterhouses, etc.), even in the same country, should guarantee a certain protection from the introduction of new strains, at least from farms belonging to other companies.</p>
