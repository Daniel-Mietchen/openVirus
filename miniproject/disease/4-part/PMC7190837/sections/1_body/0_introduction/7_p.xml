<p id="Par8">In the present study, the spreading process of the most relevant field genotype in Italy, IBV GI-19 lineage (previously known as QX), has been investigated using a continuous phylogeographic approach. The effect of different environmental and social variables, like altitude, road density, poultry population density, etc. on the spreading patterns has been also investigated using dedicated statistical tests. Finally, the migration of viral strains among integrated poultry companies was assessed and quantified.</p>
