<p id="Par17">All the samples phylogenetically belonging to 
 <italic>Company A</italic> but collected from 
 <italic>Company B</italic> originated from farms located in the high densely populated area of Northern Italy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The continuous phylogeographic analysis reconstructed a spreading pattern originating from a single introduction in Emilia Romagna region (
 <italic>Company A</italic>), followed by a progressive expansion and persistence at high level in the Pianura Padana region. More rarely, spreading episodes toward other Italian regions were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). After QX introduction, the infection wave front increased slowly approximatively until 2009, when a rapid expansion led to the final distribution range by the middle of 2012 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Accordingly, the dispersal velocity progressively increased in the first years after QX genotype introduction, peaking in the period 2009–2011 and then remaining essentially constant, despite some fluctuations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The presence of a high dispersal velocity after 2012, when no further increase in wave front was observed, suggests that IBV continued to circulate at high rate after its first establishment in a region.
