According to the model, the potency of the healthcare outbreak in KMAC-R had evolved over its course in the summer 2015 due to the changes in the transmission rates (estimated) ensued by the control plan IDEP. It seems, however, that transmission rates have increased in two wards, ED and hospital, after 26 and 91 days, respectively, after the admission of the index case (see
