<p>The individuals in the model are the patients (P), health care workers (HCW), and mobile health care workers (HCWm). Under the conditions of our SEIR-ward model in a closed population, mobile health care workers travel between wards (units) and are considered to contribute to the nosocomial transmission and the spread between wards. The individuals are divided into eight compartments based on their disease status: S is the proportion of susceptible patients, E is the proportion of exposed patients who are asymptomatic but can transmit the disease to a lesser degree, and I is the proportion of infected (symptomatic) patients. For health care workers, HS is the proportion of susceptible HCW, HE is the proportion of exposed HCW who are asymptomatic but can transmit the disease to a lesser degree, and HI is the proportion of infected HCW. Similar notations are used for mobile HCWs (with an extra subscript m). The quantity V is the viral load in the environment, and Q is quarantined individuals; with all those quantities indexed by their respective unit (
