<p>Genomes from this study were combined with previously sequenced genomes from the Kenyan coast covering the period 2013–7 (

 <xref rid="veaa026-B21" ref-type="bibr">Kamau et al. 2019</xref>). In addition, DENV-2 sequences were downloaded from Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) and used for the initial phylogenetic analysis. These sequences belong to the different genotypes of DENV-2, excluding the sylvatic strains. For a more in-depth evolutionary analysis, we downloaded all the cosmopolitan genotype sequences from ViPR, containing the date of isolation and country of origin. Sequences that did not have this information were manually assigned through literature search and those that could not be assigned were excluded. To normalize the number of sequences from the individual countries, we used CD-HIT (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al. 2012</xref>) to cluster the sequences from Countries that had a disproportionately high number of sequences, using a similarity threshold of 0.98–0.99 depending on the number of clusters from each country. We randomly picked one sequence from each cluster and used them for subsequent analyses.
