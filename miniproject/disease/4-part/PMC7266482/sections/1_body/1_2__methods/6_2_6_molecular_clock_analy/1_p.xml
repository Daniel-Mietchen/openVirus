<p>Time-calibrated phylogeny and phylogeography analyses were performed using the Cosmopolitan genotype sequence dataset only. Prior to performing this analysis, TempEst v1.5.3 (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B39" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al. 2016</xref>) was used to assess the clock-likeness of our data by estimating the root-to-tip regression. We found a strong signal (correlation coefficient = 0.7923), suggesting the dataset was appropriate for the estimation of temporal parameters. The analysis was then carried out using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, implemented in BEAST V1.10.4 (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B46" ref-type="bibr">Suchard et al. 2018</xref>). For a more tractable postanalysis interpretation and reduced computational complexity, we collapsed the country of origin of the sequences to five distinct regions as their trait location; Africa, SE Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. The Kenyan Sequences were assigned ‘Kenya’ as their trait location. We applied a relaxed molecular clock (uncorrelated lognormal) and a nonparametric Bayesian Skyline model, with ten groups, to estimate past population dynamics. The best-fit substitution model of GTR+G, as suggested by jModelTest2 (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B10" ref-type="bibr">Darriba et al. 2012</xref>), was applied in this analysis. An asymmetric trait substitution model was used and reconstruction of ancestral states at all nodes was activated. Two independent runs of 250 million each, sampling after every 25,000 steps, were performed and the runs were combined after removal of 10 percent of the trees as burn-in. The convergence of runs was checked with Tracer v1.7.1 (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B40" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al. 2018</xref>) to ensure that adequate mixing was achieved and that all parameters had reached an adequate effective sample size (ESS &gt; 200). The maximum-clade credibility tree was summarized with TreeAnnotator and visualized in FigTree v1.4.4.
