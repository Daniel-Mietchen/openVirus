<p>Both ML and Bayesian phylogenies were concordant. They showed that 93% (26 of the 28) of the isolates from Kenya fell within a single and well-supported monophyletic clade (Bootstrap, BS = 100; Posterior probability, PP = 1) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). This clade clustered under the C-I lineage of the Cosmopolitan genotype and was closely related to isolates from South Asia; more specifically India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Our phylogenetic analysis also revealed the circulation of a comparatively divergent strain of DENV-2. This strain was represented by one isolate from Mombasa and one isolate from Wajir, which was isolated during the 2013–4 dengue outbreak in the northeastern part of Kenya (BS = 100, PP = 1) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The Mombasa/Wajir genomes clustered under the C-II lineage of the Cosmopolitan genotype. They were closely related to genomes sampled in Burkina Faso from 1983 to 2016 and those from Indonesia sampled in 1975–6 as well as a genome from one case originating from Niger (
