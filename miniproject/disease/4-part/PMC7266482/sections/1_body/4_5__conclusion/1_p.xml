<p>This study has shown that recent epidemics associated with DENV-2 in Kenya were predominantly driven by the newly introduced C-I lineage, which was introduced to Kenya between March 2010 and June 2011 from South Asia, and which subsequently spread and contributed to the DENV-2 outbreak in 2013/4 and 2017. The intercontinental link of the spread, therefore, shows that both local and international strategies should be considered when designing interventions to curb DENV-2 transmission in Kenya and the region. We have also described a comparatively divergent strain of DENV-2, C-II, which may have been circulating in this region since the 1980s. Even though this strain was least isolated during the outbreak in 2013â€“4, its role in the 2016 Burkina Faso outbreak points to the potential for this strain to cause local epidemics and thus continued surveillance efforts on DENV activity are important for effective control.</p>
