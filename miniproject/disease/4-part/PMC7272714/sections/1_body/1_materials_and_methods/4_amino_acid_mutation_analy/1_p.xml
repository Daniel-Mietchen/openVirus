<p>Amino acid mutations in the HA genes of 23 influenza A/H1N1 isolates from residues 7 to 566 were compared to homologous sequences in the 2017–2019 vaccine strain (A/Michigan/45/2015). In addition, amino acid mutations of the HA genes of 80 influenza B/Yamagata isolates from residues 96–215 were compared to the equivalent sequences from the 2018–2019 vaccine strain (B/Phuket/3073/2013). Amino acid mutations in the HA genes from the 19 influenza B/Victoria isolates and the 2018–2020 B/Victoria vaccine strain from residues 93 to 180 were also compared to the counterparts in the 2016–2018 northern hemisphere vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008). These analyses were compared using the software CLUSTAL.</p>
