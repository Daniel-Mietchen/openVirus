<p>According to the report of the National Health Commission of China, from January through March of 2018, 487,773 people were infected with influenza, of which 119 died. During the outbreak, both influenza A and B dominated in Northern China. In contrast, our study found that influenza B, rather than influenza A, dominated in Southern China. Throughout the years, influenza A viruses have attracted a great deal of attention and have caused several global pandemics due to their strong transmission capacity and great variability. In contrast, there is less literature focused on the epidemiology and societal burdens of influenza B, particularly outside the United States and Europe (

It should be noted that a domination of influenza B/Yamagata in both Northern and Southern China has occurred twice, in the past 2007–2008 and in 2014–2015 (
