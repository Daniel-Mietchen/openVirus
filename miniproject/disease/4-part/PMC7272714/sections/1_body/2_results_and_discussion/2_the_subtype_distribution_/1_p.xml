<p>To reveal the subtypes circulating during this outbreak, the HA and NA genes were further analyzed using their sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HA and NA genes of the 23 H1N1 isolates had close sequence relationships to the strains circulating in Northern China, Japan, Italy, England, and the USA during 2017–2018, as well as to the 2016–2017 vaccine strain (A/California/7/2009/vaccine) and 2017–2019 vaccine strain (A/Michigan/45/2015/vaccine). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were few HA and NA genetic variations between the A/H1N1 isolates circulating in 2018 and the 2016–2019 vaccine strains. All of the A/H1N1 strains circulating during January to March, as well as the 2017–2019 vaccine strain (A/Michigan/45/2015), fell into clade 6B.1, which is defined by the HA1 amino acid substitutions S84N, S162N and I216T. The 2016–2017 vaccine strain (A/California/7/2009) and the other four China strains circulating in 2016 formed a clade noted as 6B.2 (
