<p>Female 6‐ to 8‐week‐old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) and housed at the animal facility of the Robert Koch Institute (Berlin, Germany). The minimally required animal numbers per group were determined using the software tool G*Power 3.1.6 (University of Kiel, Germany) with data obtained in an initial immunization study aiming at a power of 80%. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, before 50 μl PBS containing 10
 <sup>11</sup> vg of AAV vectors was added dropwise to both nostrils. Mice were immunized three times with AAV vectors in 3‐week intervals. Likewise, 20 μg of Cal/7/9 (X‐181) in PBS was administered intranasally two times with the first and the second immunization of the AAV vector‐vaccinated animals. Retro‐orbital sinus blood samples were taken from the animals before each and after the last immunization from which serum was obtained for serological assays. Three weeks after the third immunization, animals were challenged with Cal/7/9 virus (7.94 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse, 500 MID
 <sub>50</sub>) or A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus (2.51 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> (low dose) or 5.01 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> (high dose) TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse, 100 or 200 MID
 <sub>50</sub>) in 50 μl PBS. During low‐dose PR8 challenge, a single AAV‐GFP‐immunized animal, which survived without weight loss, remained influenza virus seronegative, indicating that the inoculum was not taken up properly during challenge infection. This animal was therefore excluded from the analysis. Following infection, mice presenting ≥ 20% weight loss were anesthetized and euthanized by isoflurane overdosing and lungs were harvested. Lungs of surviving mice were harvested on day 14 post‐infection. Lungs were homogenized using a Fastprep‐24 tissue homogenizer (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, USA) equipped with matrix D‐lysing matrix tubes for 40 s at 6 m/s. After clarification, 10‐fold serial dilutions of the homogenates were prepared, and plaque assay was done on MDCKII cells.
