<p>Sixteen 4‐month‐old male ferrets (
 <italic>Mustela putorius furo</italic>) were purchased from EuroFerret (Denmark) and housed at the animal facilities of the Paul‐Ehrlich‐Institute (Langen, Germany) and tested seronegative for circulating influenza viruses prior to the experiment. Ferrets were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.05 mg/kg), before a total of 300 μl PBS containing 7.5 × 10
 <sup>12</sup> vg of AAV vectors were added dropwise to both nostrils. The anesthesia was then reversed by subcutaneous injection of atipamezole (0.2 mg/kg). Ferrets were immunized three times with AAV vectors in 4‐week intervals. One human dose per ferret of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine of season 2017/18 containing 15 μg HA per vaccine component (Influsplit Tetra
 <sup>®</sup>, GSK, Brenford, USA) was given intramuscularly into the posterior limbs two times in parallel with the first and the second AAV vector vaccine. Blood samples were collected before each and after the last immunization from which serum was obtained for serological analysis. Four weeks after the third immunization, animals were challenged intranasally with 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of A/Mexico/InDre4487/2009 (H1N1)pdm in 200 μl Opti‐MEM.
