<p>Influenza MN assay was done in essence as described (He

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) with the exception that 3.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of influenza virus was used per 96 well to examine mouse sera and 2 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU per 96 well for ferret sera. Detection of influenza antigen was done with anti‐influenza A polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; 5315‐0064; Bio‐Rad) and suited secondary antibody coupled to HRP (1:1,000; Agilent Technologies). AAV MN was done as described (Meliani 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) with the exception that AAV‐GFP was used as reporter virus and GFP‐positive cells were quantified by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Percent inhibition was calculated at each dilution step, and the MN
 <sub>50</sub> (dilution step at which 50% inhibition was measured) was determined using non‐linear fit of the inhibition curves [(Inhibitor) vs. response‐variable slope (four parameters)] in the GraphPad Prism software. The limits of detection were dilutions of 1:100 (for AAV MN), 1:40 (for mouse influenza MN), and 1:10 (for ferret influenza MN), respectively.
