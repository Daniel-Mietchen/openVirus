<p>293T cells were transfected with AAV vector plasmids for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and immunostained with anti‐V5‐tag (1:250; SV5‐Pk1; Bio‐Rad, München, Germany), C179 (1:250; M145; TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan) antibody, rabbit hyperimmune serum against the influenza subtypes H2, H10, and H13 (1:500; 11688‐RP01‐100, 11693‐RP01‐100, 11721‐RP01‐100 Sino Biological Inc., Eching, Germany), or animal serum followed by suitable secondary antibody coupled to AlexaFluor488 (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells were analyzed using a LSM 780 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For quantification of V5‐tag or C179 or H2‐, H10‐ and H13 HA‐positive cells, samples prepared the same way were analyzed in a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany).</p>
