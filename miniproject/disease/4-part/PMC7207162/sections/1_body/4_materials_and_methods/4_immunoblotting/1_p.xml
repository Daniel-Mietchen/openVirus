<p>293T cells were transfected with AAV vector plasmids for 48 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Alternatively, 293T cells were transduced with AAV vector preparations at an MOI of 10
 <sup>6</sup> by adding the amount of virus diluted in PBS directly to the cell culture medium for 72 h. Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl (pH = 8), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA (pH = 8), 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X‐100, protease inhibitor) with beta‐mercaptoethanol and boiled, before samples were separated by reducing SDS–PAGE under denaturing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed by incubation with anti‐V5‐tag (1:1,000; SV5‐Pk1) antibody and suited secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:10,000; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). Equal loading of samples was controlled with GAPDH antibody (1:1,000) staining.
