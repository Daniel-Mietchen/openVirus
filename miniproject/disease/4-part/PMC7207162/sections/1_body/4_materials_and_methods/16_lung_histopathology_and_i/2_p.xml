<p>For immunohistochemical detection of influenza A virus, heat‐mediated antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mM of citric acid (pH = 6.0), in which samples were microwaved at 600 W for 12 min. Lung sections were incubated with a polyclonal influenza A H1N1 antibody (1:250; 5315‐0064, AbD Serotec, Puchheim, Germany) at 4°C overnight. Incubation with an irrelevant antibody at the same dilution served as negative control. Subsequently, slides were incubated with a suited secondary, phosphatase‐conjugated antibody (1:500; AP‐1000, Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward, triamino‐tritolyl‐methanechloride (Neufuchsin) was added to the slides, yielding a reddish stain upon processing by the phosphatase. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through graded ethanols, cleared in xylene, and cover‐slipped. Samples from non‐influenza infected ferrets served as negative control for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Neither one of the above‐mentioned influenza infection‐specific parameter nor influenza virus antigen could be detected in these control samples.</p>
