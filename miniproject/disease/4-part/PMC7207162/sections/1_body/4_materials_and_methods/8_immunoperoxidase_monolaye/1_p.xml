<p>Immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) was used to determine total antibody titers in ferret sera against Cal/7/9 virus and was done as described previously (Walz 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Briefly, MDCKII cells were infected with Cal/7/9 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and incubated at 37°C for 2 days. Cells were then washed with 30% PBS in H
 <sub>2</sub>O, air‐dried, and heat‐fixed at 65°C for 8 h. Twofold serial dilutions of duplicate serum samples were added to the plate, followed by incubation with a peroxidase‐labeled anti‐ferret IgG antiserum (1:750; Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, USA). Bound antibody was visualized using amino‐ethyl‐carbazole, and antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal value of the last dilution with positive staining.
