<p>To display influenza virus surface antigens on MDCKII cells, cells were seeded into 96‐well plates and either infected with influenza virus (3.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU per well) or transfected with pAAV‐HA or pAAV‐mHL1 plasmids for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 50 μl of twofold serial serum dilutions in R10 medium was added to each well at 37°C for 1 h. MDCKII cells were washed once with PBS, before 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> of either BW:FcγRI‐ζ, BW:FcγRIIB‐ζ, BW:FcγRIII‐ζ, or BW:FcγRIV‐ζ reporter cells were added per well in 200 μl R10 medium, and plates were incubated at 37°C overnight. These reporter cells express one of the four murine FcγR (I, IIB, III, IV), which was fused to the CD3‐ζ transmembrane and signaling domain. Thus, activation of the FcγR by immune complexes triggers IL‐2 production, which is quantified by ELISA (Corrales‐Aguilar

Supernatant was transferred to Maxisorb™ ELISA plates (Thermo Fischer Scientific), which had been precoated with rat anti‐mouse‐IL2 capture antibody (1:500; 554424, BD Biosciences), and plates were left at RT for 1 h. After washing, biotinylated‐IL2 detection antibody (1:500; 554426, BD Biosciences) was added and plates were incubated at RT for 1 h. After washing again, streptavidin–HRP (1:1,000; 016‐030‐084, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ely, IK) was added at RT for 30 min before plates were washed and 1‐Step™ Ultra TMB‐ELISA Substrate Solution (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was added for 1–5 min before reaction was stopped with 1 M H
