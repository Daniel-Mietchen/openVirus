<p>Here, we show that vaccination of mice with AAV‐HA or AAV‐cHA induced broadly protective antibodies. Notably, protection was associated with strong induction of FcγR‐activating antibodies. Finally, we were able to show that three doses of an AAV‐HA vaccine conferred protection in ferrets against an (H1N1)pdm strain, demonstrating the potential of the platform for further development.</p>
