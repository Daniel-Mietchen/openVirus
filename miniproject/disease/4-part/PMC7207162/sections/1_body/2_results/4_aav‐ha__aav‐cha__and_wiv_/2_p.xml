<p>Upon acidification of the endosome HA undergoes major conformational changes, which eventually results in fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. HA‐stalk binding antibodies may interfere with these steps and thus execute an inhibitory effect on viral replication (Ekiert

 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). However, antibodies preventing HA conformational changes were shown not to bind to the low‐pH conformation of HA (Friesen 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed by ELISA the binding of serum antibodies to HA after pre‐incubation at neutral to acidic pH and after the removal of the HA1 subunit by treatment with the reducing agent DTT at acidic pH. As expected, binding of the conformational antibody C179 was strongly reduced at low pH against Cal/7/9 and PR8 (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Sera induced by AAV‐HA bound to Cal/7/9 unless the HA1 subdomain was removed, indicating that homologous binding was mediated mainly by antibodies against the HA head (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). This was, however, not the case for PR8, to which binding was presumably mediated by HA‐stalk antibodies (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and D). Interestingly, unlike C179, AAV‐HA and AAV‐cHA induced sera‐contained antibodies that bind to the low‐pH conformation of the HA stalk (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D and E). The even stronger binding observed with AAV‐cHA serum might result from exposition of epitopes after pH‐induced conformational change, which are otherwise buried within the HA stalk (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>E). Binding of WIV‐induced antibodies did not vary at different pH or with removal of HA1 (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F), which was also the case for AAV‐NP sera (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>G). In conclusion, AAV‐HA induced antibodies against both the HA head and stalk, while AAV‐cHA and WIV elicited mainly HA‐stalk reactive antibodies.
