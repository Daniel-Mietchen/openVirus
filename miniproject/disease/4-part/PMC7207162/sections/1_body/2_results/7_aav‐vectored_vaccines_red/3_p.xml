<p>Virus was isolated from the respiratory tract of all animals to various extents, indicating that no sterile immunity was induced (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F). Significantly, AAV‐HA‐immunized ferrets had reduced virus titers in tissue homogenates of nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung, while all other groups showed higher virus titers (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F). Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers in AAV‐HA‐immunized animals correlated with reduced viral titers in the nasal turbinates (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>E). Immunohistochemical staining detected influenza virus antigen in the lungs of all animals yet with clear differences between groups. The strongest differences were observed between the AAV‐HA‐immunized ferrets, with only rare virus antigen in the submucosal glands and bronchial epithelial cells when compared to the AAV‐cHA‐ or AAV‐GFP‐immunized ferrets, which had massive amounts of antigen‐expressing cells in both locations (Figs 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G and H, and 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>F and G). The load of virus antigen in QIV‐vaccinated ferrets was in between the AAV‐HA‐vaccinated animals and the two other groups (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G and H). Also, all ferrets developed signs of an influenza virus‐induced bronchio‐interstitial pneumonia, although at varying degrees. Damage of bronchi and bronchioles was most pronounced in AAV‐GFP‐immunized animals (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>H), while lesions of lung interstitium as well as submucosal glands were more severe in AAV‐cHA‐ and QIV‐immunized animals (Figs 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>I and J, and 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>I). Ferrets receiving AAV‐HA had less severe lesions in the conducting airways and lung compared to animals from the other groups (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>H–J). These results indicate that AAV‐HA and AAV‐cHA immunization reduced the disease severity after homologous influenza virus infection in ferrets. However, only with AAV‐HA this was also associated with reduced virus replication and pathogenesis.
