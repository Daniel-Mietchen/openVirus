<p>To assess immunogenicity of the AAV vector vaccines, 50 μl PBS containing 10
 <sup>11</sup> vg per mouse was applied equally to both nostrils three times in 3‐week intervals before being challenged with influenza viruses. Control groups received either three times AAV‐GFP or two times Cal/7/9 whole‐inactivated virus (WIV) via the same route in order to be consistent with the application of the AAV‐vector vaccines (Fig
