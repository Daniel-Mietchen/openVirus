<p>The reactivity breadth of serum antibodies was tested against a panel of ten influenza viruses from both antigenic group 1 (H1N1, H2N3, H5N1, H13N6) and 2 (H3N2, H7N9, H10N7; Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Immunization with AAV‐HA, AAV‐cHA, AAV‐NP, and WIV induced a significant increase of homologous Cal/7/9‐specific serum IgG antibody titers compared to pre‐immune serum titers (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Furthermore, AAV‐HA‐ and AAV‐NP‐immunized mice had significantly higher titers against Cal/7/9 compared to AAV‐cHA or WIV (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Interestingly, none of the AAV‐vectored headless HA vaccines induced detectable influenza‐specific antibodies or antibodies against the respective AAV‐vectored antigen (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>D–F). This might be due to the lack of immunodominant epitopes in these antigens. Based on a report by Hessel 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), we evaluated whether the combination of AAV‐mHL with the highly immunogenic AAV‐NP would induce HA‐stalk antibodies. This, however, was not the case, and only NP reactive antibodies were induced (Fig 
 <xref rid="emmm201910938-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>G). Groups receiving AAV‐vectored headless HA were therefore not included in subsequent analyses.
