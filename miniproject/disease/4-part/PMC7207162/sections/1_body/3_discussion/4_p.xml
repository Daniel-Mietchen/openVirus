<p>Previous studies described a restriction of the immune response to HA within the same antigenic group of influenza A viruses (Krammer

Hence, we suggest evaluating in future work AAV‐vectored combinations of HA components, e.g., H1 and H3, or inter‐group stalk consensus constructs for the capacity to expand protection to both antigenic groups. Our findings suggest that AAV vectors might also be explored as useful carriers for other conserved viral antigens such as NA or M2e (Krammer
