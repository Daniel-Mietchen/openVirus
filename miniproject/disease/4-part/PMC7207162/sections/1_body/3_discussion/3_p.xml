<p>The induction of broadly binding but non‐neutralizing serum antibodies by intranasal WIV vaccination in our study recapitulates and extends observations by others (Bhide

However, WIV‐induced responses did not protect against a harsh heterologous challenge, which correlated with the failure to induce heterologous FcγR‐activating antibodies.
