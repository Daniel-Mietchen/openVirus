<p id="Par22">We have discussed how to approach to the determination of the pandemic potential of IAVs. Similar principles may apply to MERS-CoVs. Previously, MERS-CoV replication was noted in NHP-derived cell lines, Vero, and LLC-MK2 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is now known that DPP4 is a functional cellular receptor for MERS-CoVs and that Vero cells express DPP4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>]. Vero cells also express α-2,3 SA, which has been shown to assist receptor binding of MERS-CoVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. Vero cells are well known for an impairment in the type I interferon pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>]. Hence, Vero cells for MERS-CoV infection may function like MDCK cells for influenza viruses. Growth of MERS-CoVs in Vero cells may indicate their inherent replication potential. Better growths of MERS-CoVs in the upper respiratory tract is likely to contribute to their better transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. Therefore, growth characteristics of camel MERS-CoVs in Vero cells may give us initial clues about how efficient the transmission of novel strains might be.
