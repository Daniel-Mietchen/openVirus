<p id="Par28">The protective effect of the antibody transferred from immunized female mice to their newborn progenies against EV71 was experimentally assessed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Six-week-old female mice were vaccinated twice with fusion proteins (0.04 μg, 2 μg, or 10 μg, respectively), positive control (inactivated virus) and negative control (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate), and their neonatal mice (1-day-old) were used for the subsequent experiment. No adverse effects of pre-mating immunity on normal pregnancy and production of female mice were found, and no significant differences in physiological status of their neonatal mice were found either, compared to normal female or neonatal mice (data not unshown).When infected with 200 LD
 <sub>50</sub> of MP10 (a mouse-adapted EV71 strain), all negative control mice died 6 days-post-infection (d.p.i), while those in the positive control group still survived at 10 d.p.i. For the fusion protein immunization group, with an increase in the level of fusion protein, the survival rate of the neonatal mice also increased from 23% (0.04 μg) to 54% (2 μg) and to 87% (10 μg). The protective effect of maternal antibodies was more obvious when encountering a minor viral challenge with 10LD
 <sub>50</sub>. Except for the lowest dosage group (0.04 μg), immunization with the fusion protein completely inhibited EV71-mediated damage to neonatal mice. In contrast, mice in the negative control group died at 8 d.p.i, while those in the positive control group survived. Hence, similar to immunization with the inactivated virus vaccination, immunization of dams with the fusion protein effectively protected the neonatal mice against EV71 infection in cases of an infection at a low viral load.
