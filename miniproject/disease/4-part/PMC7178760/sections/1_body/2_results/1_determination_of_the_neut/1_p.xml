<p id="Par26">We had previously generated a fusion protein with partial fragments of capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 of EV71, which were assembled into virus-like particles after purification and effectively elicit an immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To further investigate the immune efficacy of the fusion protein as a vaccine candidate, we attempted three immunization dosages (10 μg, 2 μg, and 0.4 μg) to determine the optimal level of immunization. With an increase in the levels of the fusion protein, the neutralization activity of mouse serum obtained upon second immunization was significantly enhanced. Using the CPE method, the measured neutralization titers (NTs) were as follows: below 2
 <sup>5</sup> for the 0.4 μg dosage group, above 2
 <sup>6</sup> for the 2 μg dosage group, and approximately 2
 <sup>7</sup> for the 10 μg dosage group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Based on the aforementioned results, we used 10 μg of fusion protein as a vaccine candidate for subsequent experiments. Meanwhile, booster immunization was necessary to gain higher NTs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The neutralization titer in the serum of mice immunized once peaked at 2
 <sup>2</sup> after 2 weeks of immunization, and no decrease in immune response was observed after 6 weeks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). For the mice with booster immunization, 4 weeks after the initial immunization, the NTs peaked at approximately 2
 <sup>7</sup> a week after immunization and remained high (above 2
 <sup>6</sup> 6 weeks post immunization) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The same situation occurred in the positive control, wherein mice immunized with the inactivated virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), demonstrating that booster immunization induced a stronger humoral immune response.
