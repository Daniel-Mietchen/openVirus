<p id="Par15">The design, expression, purification, and assembly of EV71 fusion protein as a vaccine candidate was performed as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In brief, a DNA fragment encoding three truncates of EV71 capsid protein (180 amino acids located at N-terminal of VP2, 120 amino acids located at N-terminal of VP3, and 131 amino acids located at C-terminal of VP1) were amplified via fusion PCR and ligated at the 
 <italic>Nde</italic>I and 
 <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites of pET30a(+) under the control of the T7 promoter, and two flexible peptides of (Gly
 <sub>4</sub>Ser)
 <sub>3</sub> were adopted to ligate the three fragments together to form a 48-kDa fusion protein. The targeted protein was expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3), upon induction with 1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside, as inclusion bodies, which were solubilized and denatured in the denaturant buffer containing guanidine chloride. Thereafter, it was purified via a series of ions exchange in urea buffer, while the additive in solution was eliminated using a desalting column. Thereafter, 1 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> was added into the desalted sample to initiate the assembly of VLPs. Finally, the fusion protein was stored in 10 mM Glycine-NaOH buffer (pH = 8.0) with 5% glycerol [
