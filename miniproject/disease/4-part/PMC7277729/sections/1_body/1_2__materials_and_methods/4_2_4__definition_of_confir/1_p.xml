<p>In Taiwan, chikungunya is a notifiable communicable disease, which is a disease classification determined by the central government in the Communicable Disease Act. For such diseases, doctors or medical institutions must report confirmed cases to the competent health authority and enact measures such as treatment or event isolation pursuant to the act. Notifiable communicable diseases are typically characterized by rapid spread, severe symptoms, or high mortality rates. Therefore, when doctors encounter patients suspected to have chikungunya, they must report these patients to the competent health authority within 24 h. Suspected patients with chikungunya exhibit associated clinical conditions (i.e., acute fever ≥38 °C and severe arthritis or arthralgia that cannot be explained by a medical diagnosis) as well as one of two epidemiological conditions (i.e., the appearance of confirmed cases of chikungunya in an area near patients’ residences or areas they regularly visit or a travel history to places with chikungunya). Patients then receive a test at the hospital; test results are deemed positive if they exhibit one of the following conditions: (1) the separated clinical specimen (blood) contains the chikungunya virus, indicated by nucleic acid testing yielding a positive result; (2) acute-phase serum (or serum collected the first time) tests positive for one of two specific antibodies (i.e., IgM or IgG) for the chikungunya virus; and (3) the paired serum (serum in the recovery and acute phases) exhibits seroconversion for one of two specific antibodies (IgM or IgG) or an increase in antibody level by ≥4 times. The positive results of the PCR viral tests could also represent non-live virus. In this study, in addition to PCR positive results, other epidemiological information or clinical characteristics could be considered in the definition of positive patients. According to the Taiwan CDC, a confirmed case of chikungunya must meet one of the above criteria.</p>
