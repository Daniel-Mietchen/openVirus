<p>This study employed the TNIDSS public network database [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-03615" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which included all notifiable communicable diseases in categories 1–5 (e.g., chikungunya) specified by the Communicable Disease Control Act. The provision of these data has maintained the transparency and currency of Taiwan’s disease information. To ensure information security and prevent personal information leaks, the TNIDSS does not store personal information and stores only secondary statistics. These statistics enable the public, academics, and the press to access current information on chikungunya in Taiwan at any time. Chikungunya was categorized as a category-2 notifiable communicable disease by the central competent authority of Taiwan in 2007. The present study collected the following data from the TNIDSS: date when confirmed cases of chikungunya were reported to the health department, date of symptom onset, date of case confirmation, numbers of confirmed domestic and imported cases, and patients’ region/location, age, and sex. The database does not contain patients’ medical histories, signs and symptoms.
