<p>This study has two limitations. First, the Taiwan CDC’s TNIDSS (infectious disease statistics) includes only basic epidemiological data of patients with chikungunya and provides no clinical data. Therefore, this study could not compare clinical data between patients in terms of their differences or trends. Second, data provided on TNIDSS contain no information about the genotypes or strains of the chikungunya virus. Accordingly, this study could not analyze (1) the type of chikungunya virus strain that spread to Taiwan or (2) the affinity between virus strains in Taiwan and other countries. This study has the advantage of using diverse data provided by Taiwan’s public sector on its online platform (including the initial version of platform). This open platform has stored all historical data, which researchers can use to conduct statistical analyses or create academic value. Such data are worth exploring to expand the monitoring of infectious diseases and their characteristics, thereby continually increasing the capacity of scientific research.</p>
