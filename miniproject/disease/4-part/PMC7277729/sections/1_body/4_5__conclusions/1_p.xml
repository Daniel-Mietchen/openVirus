<p>This study was the first in Taiwan to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and trends of imported and domestic cases of chikungunya from 2007 to 2019. On the basis of data from the Taiwan CDC, this study indicated that one domestic sporadic infection and 20 cases of cluster infection occurred. Moreover, domestic cluster infections of chikungunya in Taiwan exhibited significant differences in age (patients aged 60â€“69 accounted for the largest proportion), month of confirmation (domestic confirmed cases increased in the month after imported cases increased), and place of residence (New Taipei City accounted for the largest proportion). This information will be useful for policy makers and clinical experts in directing prevention and control measures regarding the chikungunya virus, which causes illness among the Taiwanese population. This study highlights the importance of longitudinal and geographically extended studies to understand the implications of zoonotic disease transmission in the Taiwanese population. Critical data were identified to inform future surveillance and research efforts in Taiwan.</p>
