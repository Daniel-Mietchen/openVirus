<p>The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00368-f003">Figure 3</xref>) with sequences exclusively from dogs and wildlife has a similar topology to the maximum likelihood tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00368-f002">Figure 2</xref>), supporting the division of the African civet sequences into the previously established Africa 1 (canid biotype) and Africa 3 (mongoose biotype) clades (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00368-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The majority of represented civet sequences are in the Africa 1, the canid biotype clade and these data support a common ancestor of these civet nucleotide sequences, with the represented dog sequences, that occurred within the last 50 years. There are three well-supported subclades (HPD &gt;90%) in Africa 1; one contains almost exclusively RSA civet sequences from 1991–2005, grouping with one sequence from a black-backed jackal. A second subclade contains four civet sequences from both Zimbabwe and RSA, with single dog and mongoose samples. A third small cluster of three civet rabies viruses sequences from Zimbabwe 1992–1994 has a later common ancestor, within the last 25 years. There are only two civet sequences clustering with the Africa 3 mongoose biotype and, despite being isolated in 1991 and 1994, they are most closely related to a mongoose sequence from 2001.
