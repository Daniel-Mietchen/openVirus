<p>In this study, all the available African civet lyssaviruses at Onderstepoort and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (AHPA, UK) were compared with those from other wildlife and domestic carnivore species, with the intention of identifying the lyssaviruses that are circulating in this unusual wildlife species and to determine whether these viruses are being maintained and transmitted by African civets, or if African civets are merely incidental hosts with no influence on the evolution of these complex viruses. These data highlight the importance of the molecular characterisation of confirmed rabies-positive cases, particularly for wildlife species such as African civets, but also known host reservoir species, such as the RABV biotype, as the lyssavirus species is not always as expected.</p>
