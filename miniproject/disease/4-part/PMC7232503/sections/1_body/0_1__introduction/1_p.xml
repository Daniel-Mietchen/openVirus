<p>Lyssaviruses are highly neurotropic viruses characterised by non-segmented and negative-stranded RNA genomes. These viruses are typically bullet-shaped and belong to the 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> family and the 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The viral genome is approximately 12 kb in size and encodes information for five proteins, namely the nucleoprotein (N), the matrix (M) protein, the phosphoprotein (P), the glycoprotein (G) and the RNA-dependent polymerase (L) [
