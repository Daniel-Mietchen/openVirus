<p>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions of the complete N gene civet sequences were performed in MEGA 6 using 1000 bootstrap replicates [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A GTR nucleotide substitution model with rate variation and a proportion of invariant sites (Gamma+I) was determined to best fit the data using Akaike Information Criterion in MEGA 6 (

To further investigate the genetic relationships of the African civet viruses relative to RABV lineages circulating in Africa, sequences of the complete nucleoprotein gene (N-gene – 1353 bp) were analysed with other complete N-gene sequences available in Genbank (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00368">supplementary file, Table S2</xref>). Sequences derived in this study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 23) were compared with other complete N-gene sequences available in Genbank (
 <italic>n</italic> = 59). A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation was also used to infer phylogenetic relationships (BEAST packagev1.8.1) [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. An HKY nucleotide substitution model with rate variation and a proportion of invariant sites (Gamma+I) was used. Relaxed and strict molecular clock models, and either constant or Bayesian skyline population priors were used in combination and compared using a modified Akaike information criterion (AICM) in Tracer v1.5, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To give a visual representation of the inferred ancestral host for each clade, each sequence was given a discrete trait corresponding to the species in which the virus sequences were detected. All likely ‘dead-end’ hosts (unable to further transmit rabies virus infection) were removed and the remaining hosts were grouped into mongoose, African civet, canine canid (domestic) and wild canid categories. A chain length of 30 million iterations, sampling every 3000 states, gave effective sample sizes of over 100. Maximum clade credibility trees were annotated using TreeAnnotator (v1.8.1) after 10% of trees were discarded, visualised with FigTree (v1.4.0) and coloured by the host species with the highest posterior probability (
