<p>Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria are not controlled nor killed by previously effective drugs through several mechanisms described above. Resistance is largely driven by the abuse of antibiotics in humans and animals, often with little or no therapeutic benefit. The use of antibiotics in viral respiratory infections or abuse in animal care and in agriculture to promote livestock growth, are common examples of the misuse (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Additionally, the inability to rapidly identify the specific infecting pathogen at the point of care make the empiric treatment the only possible choice. In fact, the empiric treatment requires the use of broader spectrum antibiotics to cover all the key pathogens responsible for a particular infection (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Moreover, the relationships between the human microbiome and the host immune system is hugely threatened. Antimicrobials alter the structure of the microbiota, expand the pool of antimicrobial-resistance genes, degrade the protective effects of the microbiota against invasion by pathogens, and may impair the efficacy of alternative medical treatments (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Hence, the abuse of antibiotics has negatively affected the immune response making individuals more susceptible to infections. In fact, the pressure imposed by the antibiotic treatments on microbes other than the targeted pathogen (“bystander selection”) is hypothesized to be a major factor in the propagation of antibiotic resistance (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). International traveling is also a key factor in the dissemination of highly resistant strains. New Delhi metallo-β- lactamase 1 (NDM-1) and 
 <italic>mcr-1</italic> are the mobile resistance genes increasingly spreading worldwide and generating resistance to a variety of antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. This is particularly relevant for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria sensitive only to carbapenems, and for which only very few alternative possibilities are available. Furthermore, the NDM-1 resistance genes are transmitted very easily, as shown by the two Dutch travelers which were infected by a NDM-1-producing bacterial strain during their trip to India, even if not visiting any health centers (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>), 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> are the most common NDM-1-producing bacteria for which colistin is considered the only possible therapeutic option. Nevertheless, with the spread of the 
 <italic>mcr</italic> resistance gene (
 <italic>mcr-1</italic>) a generation of pan-resistant strains is arising. This has been probably due to the large use of colistin to increase pig growth in farms in China. In addition, to the raw meat, 
 <italic>mcr-1</italic> has been isolated also in samples from infected patients (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The 
 <italic>mcr-1</italic> resistance determinant is able to easily spread in different bacterial species and also worldwide due to business globalization (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Hence, the spread of resistant organisms, highly infectious and inducing high rate of morbidity and mortality has a strong economic impact, in terms of costs of treatment and long-term hospital stay, with a great burden on health systems.
