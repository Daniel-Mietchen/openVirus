<p>The rising of AMR is a threat to modern medicine and new measures to control antibiotic-resistant bacteria are desperately needed including the development of new antibiotics. Nevertheless, the discovery of new effective chemical compounds with an appropriate balance of antibacterial activity, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics properties and safety it is a daunting task. In fact, the pipeline run dry ~40 years ago (

An important aspect is that resistance mechanisms are of less concern in vaccination. As reported above the mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics are mediated by the generation of spontaneous mutations or the acquisition of mobile genetic element by HGT. These mechanisms confer to bacteria the ability to tackle the killing effect of a drug and survive. Antibiotics are therapeutic measures since generally prescribed after the settling down of an infection when hundreds of millions of bacteria are infecting the body. On the contrary, vaccines are designed to prevent diseases. Their prophylactic use allows the host to build an immune response before encountering the pathogen or even at the beginning of an infection when only a few hundred or thousands bacteria are present. As the occurrence of resistance mechanisms can stochastically arise among billions of bacteria, it is evident that this is less likely to occur following vaccination. Furthermore, most antibiotics have a single target while vaccines have multiple targets inducing host-specific antibody and/or T cell responses. Even in this case, more mutations are likely needed to confer resistance to vaccines making the development of microbial resistance even harder (
