<p>RNA-based vaccines can be divided into non-replicating and self-amplifying mRNA vaccines (SAM) both of which make use of the host cell translational machinery to produce the selected antigens. More in detail, SAM-based vaccines consist of an engineered RNA viral genome encoding nonstructural proteins (nsPs) in which the genes encoding for the structural protein are replaced with the antigen of choice. RNA vaccines have shown to be effective in case of viral pathogens; however, this technology could be successfully applied also to bacterial AMR targets. Interestingly, a SAM vaccine encoding for a double-mutant of Streptolysin-O (SLOdm) and the backbone protein of pilus island 2a (BP-2a) from Group A (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Group B (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae) was shown to be immunogenic in mice inducing both humoral and cellular immunity (

Differently from viral vectors and DNA -based vaccine, RNA vaccines do not interact with the host-cell DNA, avoiding the potential risk of genomic integration and should not induce anti-vector immunity. Therefore, based on (i) their fully synthetic nature, (ii) relatively low production cost, and (iii) the possibility of expressing complex antigens in large amounts and in a short time, mRNA technologies could represent a rapid and valuable platform to be further exploited for vaccines against AMR infections.
