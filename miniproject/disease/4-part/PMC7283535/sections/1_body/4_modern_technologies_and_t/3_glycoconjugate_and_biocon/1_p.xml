<p>In the previous decades, innovative polysaccharides-based vaccines have been developed to protect against infections caused by 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib). However, these vaccines were not immunogenic in children below 2 years of age and they induced a short memory response. To enhance immunogenicity, an effective strategy was to covalently link the polysaccharide antigen to a carrier protein, thereby providing helper T-cell activation in addition to the B-cell dependent immune response. Examples of protein carriers that have been efficiently used for the chemical conjugation are tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid (DT), and a non-toxic cross-reacting mutant of DT (CRM197). The resulting glycoconjugate vaccines elicited a more potent functional immune response in all age groups. Nowadays, this type of vaccines are available for the meningococcus serogroups A, C, W, Y, and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> type b (Hib) and Pneumococcal vaccines. The glycoconjugate vaccines have been able to successfully prevent the deaths and hospitalization of millions of people during the past three decades (

However, the requirement of complex manufacturing makes the process of glycoconjugation expensive and unsuitable for very complex vaccines, or for their use in low-income countries. These limitations can be overcome by a process called “bioconjugation,” a new platform technology to generate glycoconjugate vaccines 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a single step, drastically simplifying glycoconjugates development and manufacture. Bioconjugation is based on recombinant non-pathogenic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain that co-express (i) a heterologous, antigenic polysaccharide, (ii) a carrier protein encoding the glycosylation sites, and (iii) an enzyme covalently coupling both substrates during bacterial growth. Clinical trials with either mono- and multi-valent vaccine candidates produced using the PglB conjugating enzyme showed safety, immunogenicity and functionality of the immune response (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).
