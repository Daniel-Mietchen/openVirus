<p>To counteract infectious diseases, the discovery of antimicrobial treatment was another significant milestone that has dramatically reduced mortality. The modern era of antimicrobial therapy initiated in the 19th century with the identification of anti-syphilitic and anti-trypanosomal molecules derived from organic compounds chemically synthetized (

Conversely to active vaccination, drugs are therapeutics with different modes of action targeting the bacterial functions such as cell wall integrity, nucleic acid synthesis and repair, or protein biosynthesis. Moreover, drugs can be naturally produced by microorganisms (including environmental fungi and saprophytic bacteria), generated by chemical modifications of the natural antimicrobial agents or fully synthetized (
