 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] for H1N1 HA give seemingly contrasting evidence on the role of electrostatic charge on IAV evolution. Indeed, Hensley and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] demonstrated that successful immune escape was driven by increased HA H1N1 avidity and mediated by increases in electrostatic charge. Yet, Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] found that the H3N2 HA has increased in net charge since 1968, whereas the H1N1 HA has had no appreciable change. To reconcile the very different H1N1 and H3N2 charge trajectories, we investigated the hypothesis that local charge is more germane than global charge for evolutionary dynamics. Moreover, this hypothesis would imply that differences in global patterns of H1N1 and H3N2 HA simply reflect disparities in net charge constraints, instead of contrasting evolutionary pressures. Local charge in natural sequences reflects a combination of functional constraints and evolutionary pressures from host immunity. To isolate these confounding factors and remove bias due to functional constraints, partitioning of residues into functional patches requires per-residue selection experiments in the absence of immune selection on an early H1N1 strain. Constraints of functional relevance for the H1N1 HA are quantified in DMS data for an H1N1 HA from 1933 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By leveraging these data, we found patches on the HA with distinct evolutionary patterns in natural sequences. It should be noted that, due to evolution, similar functional experiments with more recent H1N1 HAs could reveal different groups of residues. However, our analyses require an early H1N1 HA to properly characterize the starting landscape and enable us to appropriately determine the net charge patterns of these patches afterwards.
