<p>Perhaps the discrepancy between H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in the net charge patterns of HAs is simply a reflection of different constraints on HA biophysical factors such as stability, instead of a fundamental difference in the role of electrostatic charge in virion-host cell interactions between these two subtypes. In particular, it may be that the H1N1 HA is less tolerant to charge imbalances than the H3N2 HA, and therefore if a set of sites in the H1N1 HA is under pressure to become more positively charged, other sites must become more negatively charged in counterbalance. Deep mutational scans on H1N1 [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] indicate that the H3N2 HA has a different mutational tolerance profile in comparison to the H1N1 HA. Further experiments should examine and quantify differences in tolerance to charge imbalance for H1N1 and H3N2 HAs to investigate the hypothesis of different tolerances to charge imbalance in these HAs. Furthermore, in natural sequences, H1N1 antigenic evolution is not as rapid as H3N2 antigenic evolution [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and could indicate some differing constraints.
