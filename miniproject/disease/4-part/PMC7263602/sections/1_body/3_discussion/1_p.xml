<p>In this epidemic outbreak, the attack rate of the trainees was significantly higher than that of the trainers; this finding is similar to the findings of Lessler and colleagues, who documented that 35% of students and 10% of employees had an influenza-like illness in middle school during a 2009 outbreak of H1N1 influenza [

We speculate that one reason might be that the trainers had shorter contact with the trainees than the trainees had among themselves; another reason might be that the overall immunity of the trainers was higher than that of the trainees, since trainees felt more stress due to their inadaptation [

The attack rates in the three districts were significantly different, and this difference suggests that the severities of the epidemic in the three districts were different. Additionally, cross-infection among trainees of different districts may have occurred, such as during eating, shopping, and showering in public bathrooms.
