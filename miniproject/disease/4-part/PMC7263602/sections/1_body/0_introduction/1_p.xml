 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Symptomatic patients are the main source of infection, and in cases of individuals with weak immunity, the virus can be continuously discharged from the body of the infected individual in the absence of clinical symptoms [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Infection can be acquired through close contact (such as touching and handshaking) with infected individuals and through the inhalation of aerosols from coughing and sneezing by infected individuals. Humans are generally susceptible to adenoviruses, and people with weak immunity are at a high risk of developing severe symptoms [
