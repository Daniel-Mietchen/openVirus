<p>Cell lines used in this study include BHK21 baby hamster kidney cells (ATCC CCL-10), HeLa cervical cancer epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-2), human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM, Lonza) and C6/36 from 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> embryonic tissue. BHK21 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 media (RPMI-1640, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Capricorn Scientific). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s media (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% inactivated FCS. HSMM cells were cultured in SkGM (Skeletal Muscle Cell Growth Medium, Lonza) with supplied growth factors and 10% inactivated FCS. Throughout the study, BHK21, HeLa and HSMM cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. C6/36 cells were cultured in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% inactivated FCS and incubated at 28°C without humidification.
