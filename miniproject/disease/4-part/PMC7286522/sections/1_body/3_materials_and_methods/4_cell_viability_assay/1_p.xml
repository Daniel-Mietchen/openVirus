<p>BHK21, HeLa and HSMM cells were seeded on 96-well plates at densities of 12,500, 15,000 and 20,000 cells per well, respectively. After overnight incubation, cell culture media was replaced with media containing proteasome inhibitors or vehicle control at various concentrations and incubated for 24h (BHK21 and HSMM) or 48h (HeLa) at 37°C. Cell viability was then determined using the alamarBlue® cytotoxicity assay (Invitrogen) as previously described [
