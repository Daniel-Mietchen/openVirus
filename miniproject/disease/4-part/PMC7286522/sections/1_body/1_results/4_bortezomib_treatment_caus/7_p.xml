<p>To understand the effects of bortezomib treatment on eIF2α phosphorylation in CHIKV-infected cells, the levels of phosphorylated (Ser51) eIF2α as well as total eIF2α were measured in time-point studies. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g008">Fig 8</xref> shows that bortezomib treatment of CHIKV-infected HeLa cells caused a general reduction in levels of phospho-eIF2α over time, with relatively stable levels of total eIF2α. Strikingly, however, bortezomib treatment in mock-infected cells also resulted in reduced phospho-eIF2α levels (approximately 60% reduction) at 24h post-treatment. This indicated that the decrease in phospho-eIF2α levels may not be due to viral ns proteins (including nsP4) accumulation; rather, an alternative pathway that was activated by bortezomib.
