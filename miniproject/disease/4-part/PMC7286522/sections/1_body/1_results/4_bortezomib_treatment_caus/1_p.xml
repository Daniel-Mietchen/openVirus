<p>We next evaluated the possibility that bortezomib affects CHIKV RNA synthesis and/or viral RNA translation events. To investigate this further, the levels of various CHIKV proteins were measured at different time-points post-infection in HeLa cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g005">Fig 5</xref>, bortezomib treatment resulted in a striking decrease of about 50 to 80% in levels of the CHIKV structural proteins, E2, E1 and capsid, from 6 hpi onwards. Correspondingly, structural protein levels were also observed to decrease in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with different concentrations of bortezomib at 6 hpi (
