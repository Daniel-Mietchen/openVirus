<p>In our study, the increase in nsP4 levels upon bortezomib treatment suggests that the CHIKV nsP4, like that of SFV and SINV, is degraded by the proteasome [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and the elevated levels are a reflection of its stabilization by bortezomib. Importantly, the elevations in nsP4 levels was not found to be dose-dependent, suggesting that increased nsP4 levels may not be the main factor contributing to the anti-CHIKV effects of bortezomib.
