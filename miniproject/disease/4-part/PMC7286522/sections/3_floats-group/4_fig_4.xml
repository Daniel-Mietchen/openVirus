  <title>Time-of-addition and time-of-removal studies.</title>
  <p>HeLa monolayers were first infected with CHIKV-122508 for 1.5h. (A) The schematic diagram for the first three time-points (0, 2, 4 hpi) are shown. For time-of-addition studies, bortezomib was added at different time-points post-infection. For time-of-removal studies, bortezomib was added at 0h post-infection and then removed at different times. All samples were harvested at 48 hpi. Dotted lines represent the duration of bortezomib treatment. (B) CHIKV titers from time-of-addition and time-of-removal assays. Error bars represent standard error of means from at least 4 replicates.</p>
