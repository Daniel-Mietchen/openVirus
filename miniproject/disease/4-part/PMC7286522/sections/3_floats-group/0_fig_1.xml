  <title>Effects of bortezomib treatment on CHIKV infection in BHK21 cells.</title>
  <p>(A) BHK21 cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 and treated with indicated concentrations of bortezomib for 24h. CHIKV titers are presented in the bar graphs corresponding to the primary axis. Cell viability is presented by the line graph corresponding to the secondary axis. Error bars represent standard errors of means from two independent experiments done in triplicates. *** 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001 (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test comparing bortezomib-treated samples to vehicle control). (B) In pre-treatment assays, BHK21 cells were treated with bortezomib for 2h, washed and infected with CHIKV-122508 at MOI 10. Supernatants were harvested at 24h for plaque assays. Error bars represent standard errors of means from three technical replicates.
