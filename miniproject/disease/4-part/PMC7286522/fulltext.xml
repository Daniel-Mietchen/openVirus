Despite having re-emerged as a significant public health threat, there are no approved therapeutics or prophylactics for CHIKV infection. In this study, we explored the anti-CHIKV effects of proteasome inhibitors and their potential mechanism of antiviral action. A panel of proteasome inhibitors with different functional groups reduced CHIKV infectious titers in a dose-dependent manner. Bortezomib, which has been FDA-approved for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, was further investigated in downstream studies. The inhibitory activities of bortezomib were confirmed using different cellular models and CHIKV strains. Time-of-addition and time-of-removal studies suggested that bortezomib inhibited CHIKV at an early, post-entry stage of replication. In western blot analysis, bortezomib treatment resulted in a prominent decrease in structural protein levels as early as 6 hpi. Contrastingly, nsP4 levels showed strong elevations across all time-points. NsP2 and nsP3 levels showed a fluctuating trend, with some elevations between 12 to 20 hpi. Finally, qRT-PCR data revealed increased levels of both positive- and negative-sense CHIKV RNA at late stages of infection. It is likely that the reductions in structural protein levels is a major factor in the observed reductions in virus titer, with the alterations in non-structural protein ratios potentially being a contributing factor. Proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib likely disrupt CHIKV replication through a variety of complex mechanisms and may display a potential for use as therapeutics against CHIKV infection. They also represent valuable tools for studies of CHIKV molecular biology and virus-host interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes an illness with debilitating muscle and joint pain. CHIKV has infected millions in a continued wave of outbreaks worldwide. Despite this, there are no approved antivirals or vaccines against CHIKV infection. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors against CHIKV. A panel of proteasome inhibitors was found to reduce CHIKV titres in CHIKV-infected cells. We selected bortezomib, an FDA-approved drug, for further investigation into its antiviral mechanism. We confirmed the anti-CHIKV effects of bortezomib using different cell lines and CHIKV strains. We found that bortezomib resulted in a major decrease in levels of CHIKV structural proteins, which are involved in formation of progeny virus particles. Bortezomib treatment also prominently increased synthesis of viral replicase components and increased CHIKV RNA synthesis. We propose that proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib are likely to inhibit CHIKV through various mechanisms that ultimately lead to a decrease in structural proteins and infectious viral progeny. This study suggests that proteasome inhibitors display a potential for further development as antivirals against CHIKV infection and may be useful tools to study CHIKV molecular biology and virus-host interactions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the MOE Tier 2 grants (MOE 2017-T2-1-078 and MOE 2017- T2-2-014) and Singapore National Research Foundation grant (NRF2016NRF- NSFC002-012) awarded to JJHC, as well as Institutional research funding (IUT20-27) from Estonian Research Council and funding from The Wellcome Trust (200171/Z/15/Z), both awarded to AM.

Despite the significant medical threat posed by CHIKV, there are currently no licensed therapeutics or prophylactics against CHIKV infection. There remains an urgent need for the discovery of novel antivirals against CHIKV infection, accompanied by an improved understanding of CHIKV replication and pathogenesis.</p><p>CHIKV belongs to the genus <italic>Alphavirus</italic> in the <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. CHIKV is part of the Old World alphaviruses, which also include the well-studied model viruses, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus (SINV) [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Chikungunya virions are enveloped, with a positive-sense RNA genome enclosed within a nucleocapsid core [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The CHIKV genome is approximately 11.8 kb long and contains two open reading frames (ORF): a 7.4 kb ORF encoding the non-structural (ns) proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4), and a 3.7 kb ORF encoding the structural proteins (capsid, E3, E2, 6K/TF and E1) [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Glycoprotein spikes consisting of E1 and E2 on the CHIKV envelope mediate virion binding and entry into host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Within the host cell, the viral genome is translated by the eukaryotic translation machinery, producing the polyprotein precursor for the ns proteins, which is then processed into mature proteins. The ns proteins complex with viral genome and cellular components to form the viral replicase [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The viral replicase generates the full-length negative-sense CHIKV RNA, which serves as a template for the transcription of full-length positive-sense genomic (G), as well as the subgenomic (SG) CHIKV RNAs [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is followed by translation of the viral structural proteins from the SG RNA [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the later stages of the CHIKV replication cycle, the nucleocapsid core assembles in the cytoplasm and buds out through the plasma membrane, acquiring a lipid envelope to form mature, infectious progeny [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for degradation of cellular proteins that are damaged, misfolded, or require downregulation [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation are usually covalently tagged with at least four lysine-48 (K48)-linked ubiquitin subunits [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the replication of several positive-sense RNA viruses [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ubiquitin-proteasome system has been found to control intracellular levels of certain viral proteins during replication, including viral proteases, structural proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For instance, the proteasomal degradation of viral proteases has been well documented for picornaviruses, including encephalomyocarditis virus and hepatitis A virus, [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Given the role of the viral protease in triggering apoptosis, researchers speculate that the UPS may be utilized by picornaviruses to maintain sufficiently low levels of the viral protease during early replication to prevent premature apoptosis [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Early studies on SINV and SFV suggested that nsP4, which functions as the RdRp, is degraded by the proteasome due to the presence of a highly conserved destabilizing tyrosine residue at the N-terminus [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In a study with SINV mutants, Shirako and colleagues (1998) found that only nsP4 proteins with N-terminal Tyr, His, Phe or Trp have wild-type activity for RNA replication [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The authors suggested that the metabolic instability of nsP4 is not necessary for its function. Instead, they suggested that SINV nsP4 requires an aromatic amino acid or histidine at its N-terminus, and its metabolic instability is simply a consequence of this requirement [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Proteasomal inhibition has been found to reduce titers of several alphaviruses, including SFV, Mayaro virus and Una virus [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For studies on CHIKV, proteomic analyses have revealed differential regulation of several proteasome subunits upon infection, although results differed between studies [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For instance, upon CHIKV infection, PSMA6 (proteasome subunit alpha type-6) was reported to be downregulated in one study [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and upregulated in another [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin resulted in a reduction of viral titers in CHIKV-infected GripTite 293 MSR cells [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we explored the antiviral potential of a panel of proteasome inhibitors. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], was selected for downstream experiments to investigate the potential mechanism of antiviral action. Bortezomib treatment was found to interfere with a post-entry step in the CHIKV replication cycle. Treatment with bortezomib also resulted in a decrease in structural protein expression. Western blot analysis showed elevated levels of CHIKV nsP4 from early time-points, suggesting the possibility that the CHIKV nsP4 is degraded by the proteasome, similar to the nsP4 of SFV and SINV. In addition, a strong reduction in structural protein levels was also observed. Levels of both positive-sense and negative-sense CHIKV RNA were elevated at later time-points post-infection. This study shows that proteasome inhibitors affect different processes involved in CHIKV replication and may serve as potential antivirals against CHIKV. Further work into their clinical therapeutic use during CHIKV infection is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Proteasome inhibitors suppress CHIKV infection</title><p>In order to explore the anti-CHIKV effects of proteasome inhibitors, we tested the inhibitory potential of bortezomib using CHIKV-infected BHK21 cells in both post-treatment and pre-treatment assays. For post-treatment assays, BHK21 cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 prior to treatment with bortezomib. This was performed to establish the effects of bortezomib on post-entry steps. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, treatment with 0.1 &#x003bc;M bortezomib onwards resulted in significant inhibition of CHIKV infectious titer. A maximal 98.5% (2.2 log<sub>10</sub> units) inhibition was obtained with 10 &#x003bc;M treatment of bortezomib. Cell viability remained above 70% across all concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), indicating minimal toxicity. In fact, treatment with 0.1 &#x003bc;M bortezomib produced 97% (1.5 log<sub>10</sub> units) inhibition with no decrease in cell viability, suggesting that bortezomib-mediated reduction in viral titers were not due to cytotoxicity. A pre-treatment assay was also carried out, where BHK21 cells were treated with bortezomib for 2 hours, washed with PBS and then immediately infected with CHIKV.

These fluctuations suggest that bortezomib may affect structural and ns proteins in different ways, and there may be multiple competing effects on ns proteins, leading to the observed results.

A range of proteasome inhibitors from different compound classes were found to reduce CHIKV infectious titers in a dose-dependent manner. Bortezomib, which has been FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, showed dose-dependent reductions of CHIKV titers in several cell lines (BHK21, HeLa and HSMM). Bortezomib-mediated suppression of CHIKV titers was found to occur at an early, post-entry stage of replication. Western blot analysis showed prominent reductions (50 to 80%) in the levels of structural CHIKV proteins (E2, E1 and capsid) in time-course studies as early as 6 hpi, which was confirmed in dose-dependent studies. Unlike the obvious and consistent reductions in structural proteins, nsP2 and nsP3 levels showed a fluctuating trend over time in western blot assays, with elevations observed from 12 to 20 hpi for nsP2 and at 12 hpi for nsP3. Contrastingly, nsP4 levels showed strong elevations across all time-points. The reductions in structural protein levels and elevated nsP4 levels were also recapitulated upon treatment with MG132, MLN2238, lactacystin and ONX-0914, suggesting a common anti-CHIKV mechanism across proteasome inhibitors with different functional groups. Finally, an increase in CHIKV RNA levels was observed from 12 hpi onwards. This increase was observed for both positive- and negative-sense CHIKV RNA. The major direct antiviral effect of bortezomib is likely to result from its effect on suppressing structural protein levels leading to a decrease in progeny virions and infectious titres. More extensive study would be required to identify the precise mechanisms leading to this effect, especially since the ubiquitin-proteasome system is a major pathway for protein degradation in cells and proteasomal inhibition is likely to modify expression levels of a diverse number of cellular proteins and viral host factors, which may affect CHIKV replication in different ways.</p><p>In previous studies, the antiviral effects of bortezomib has been attributed to a number of different mechanisms. In cells infected with Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), bortezomib reduced the ability of the non-structural S-segment protein (NSs) to form nuclear filaments and decreased its interaction with several host factors by affecting their ubiquitination status. Expression of IFN-&#x003b2; was also increased, suggesting that host antiviral pathways may have further contributed to the inhibition of viral replication [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a phlebovirus related to RVFV, bortezomib treatment reversed the degradation of RIG-I induced by the viral non-structural protein (NS), thereby removing virus-mediated suppression of host innate immunity [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Bortezomib has also been found to inhibit replication of dengue virus, likely by suppressing viral egress [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. While the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been found to be important in the replication of many viruses, the antiviral mechanisms of proteasome inhibition are likely to vary greatly between different viruses [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the increase in nsP4 levels upon bortezomib treatment suggests that the CHIKV nsP4, like that of SFV and SINV, is degraded by the proteasome [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and the elevated levels are a reflection of its stabilization by bortezomib. Importantly, the elevations in nsP4 levels was not found to be dose-dependent, suggesting that increased nsP4 levels may not be the main factor contributing to the anti-CHIKV effects of bortezomib.</p><p>The fluctuating trend observed for nsP2 and nsP3 may be due to multiple competing effects of bortezomib on these proteins. For instance, bortezomib may either increase nsP2/nsP3 expression or reduce their degradation, causing an increase in their levels within infected cells. However, by reducing virion production, bortezomib also restricts viral spread in the monolayer, reducing the overall amounts of protein detected via western blot at other time-points. A similar explanation can be made for the fact that CHIKV RNA levels were observed to be elevated only at 12 hpi, despite increased nsP4 levels from 6 hpi onwards.</p><p>While bortezomib caused some increase in ns protein levels, structural protein levels were consistently and significantly decreased at all time-points. This may suggest that bortezomib may affect SG RNA translation differently from G RNA translation. Indeed, translation of G and SG RNA of alphaviruses are known to have different requirements [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For instance, the G RNA of SINV requires eukaryotic initiation factors and is believed to be translated in a similar manner as host mRNA, while SINV SG RNA translation proceeds in a non-canonical manner, without the requirement of initiation factors like eIF2 and eIF4, despite bearing a cap structure [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These differences in translation requirements for G and SG RNA may explain the different effects of bortezomib on CHIKV ns and structural proteins. A similar phenomenon has been reported for pateamine A, an antiviral compound which was found to block translation of SINV genomic RNA, but not SG RNA [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Apart from translational machinery, the stabilization of host and viral factors involved in CHIKV replication may have also contributed to the antiviral effects of bortezomib. For instance, DExH-box RNA helicase 9 (DHX9) has recently been reported to be recruited to CHIKV replication complexes and may function as a switch regulating RNA replication and translation [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Importantly, DHX9 was shown to be required for translation of CHIKV ns proteins during the early stages of replication while being degraded by the proteasome during later stages of replication. Another example is RpbI, a catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II. Recently, Akhrymuk and colleagues reported that the nsP2 of CHIKV, SINV and SFV induce the shut-off of host transcription by causing the proteasomal degradation of RpbI [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This process occurs very early in infection (within 6 hpi) and is likely to be crucial in blocking the activation of genes involved in the antiviral response [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Prevention of RpbI degradation by proteasomal inhibition may cause an increase in cellular antiviral responses, restricting viral replication. As discussed previously, modulation of antiviral responses has also been reported for bortezomib-mediated inhibition of viruses like RVFV and SFTSV. The alphavirus nsP3 has also shown some involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Varjak and colleagues (2010) reported that the nsP3 of SFV carries a degradation signal at its C-terminus and is degraded by the proteasome [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. While this has not been reported for CHIKV nsP3, our data hints at a similar possibility. In dose-dependent studies, treatment with 0.025 &#x003bc;M of bortezomib caused CHIKV nsP3 levels to increase by about 30% above the vehicle control. At higher concentrations of bortezomib, however, nsP3 levels showed a dose-dependent decrease, which may partly be explained by restriction of virus spread in cell monolayers at these concentrations.</p><p>The alterations in ns and structural protein levels upon bortezomib treatment also reflect a similar phenotype recently described for a SINV mutant with increased nsP1 capping activity [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This mutant over-produced ns proteins and had somewhat elevated levels of viral RNA synthesis. Importantly, it also had slightly reduced synthesis of structural proteins and strongly reduced infectious virion production [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These similarities indicate that disrupting the balance between ns and structural protein levels is detrimental for alphavirus replication, perhaps by altering the cellular environment in a way that is unfavorable for virion formation and/or by directly interfering with virion formation. Indeed, nsP2 has been recently identified as component of alphavirus virions [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and there is genetic evidence that functional linkage of nsP2 and capsid protein is important for alphavirus replication [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that major changes in their ratio, similar to what is observed during bortezomib treatment, would have a negative impact on viral replication.</p><p>Another important consideration is that a number of proteasome inhibitors also inhibit other cellular proteases. For instance, bortezomib exhibits off-target activity against some intracellular proteases, including cathepsins A and G, although the IC<sub>50</sub> (50% inhibitory concentration) for non-proteasomal targets is about 10-fold to 100-fold higher than that required for the inhibition of the proteasome [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In addition, lactacystin also inhibits cathepsin A [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Results from western blot studies showed that proteasome inhibitors apart from bortezomib caused similar changes to CHIKV proteins, suggesting a common antiviral mechanism across proteasome inhibitors with different functional groups. While it is likely that the antiviral effects of the inhibitors used in this study stem from their action on the proteasome rather than non-proteasomal targets, downstream studies confirming this would be essential.</p><p>Given the pleiotropic effects of proteasome inhibitors on host cells, the dissection of antiviral mechanisms requires extensive investigation to determine which pathways are major contributors to their inhibitory effects. Whether the antiviral effects of bortezomib are a result of inhibition of translation of SG RNA, modification of levels of essential host factors, modulation of antiviral pathways, changes to the ratio of ns to structural proteins, or even effects on non-proteasomal targets, it is clear that further evaluation into the potential for these compounds to be used as CHIKV antivirals is warranted.</p><p>A limitation of bortezomib is its narrow therapeutic window [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In cancer patients, the most significant adverse effect reported is peripheral sensory neuropathy, which is reported in 31% to 55% of patients [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It is important to note, however, that bortezomib-induced toxicity is related to accumulated dose, with neuropathy usually surfacing within the first five cycles of treatment, in a treatment plan where each cycle is six weeks long [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, for CHIKV infection, treatment schedules are not expected to last as long, given that the acute phase is resolved within two weeks. Furthermore, altering the route of administration of bortezomib from intravenous to subcutaneous has been found to significantly reduce instances of neuropathy in patients, while retaining similar efficacy [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, our study has shown that proteasome inhibitors with various functional groups are able to inhibit CHIKV and cause similar changes to viral proteins. This indicates that <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of proteasome inhibitors for treatment of CHIKV should not be limited to bortezomib. Rather, the use of newer generation proteasome inhibitors like MLN2238, which has an improved toxicity profile and is administered orally, should also be explored [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Another option is to chemically modify the structure of the proteasome inhibitor such that it is active only upon cleavage by viral proteases in infected cells. Buckley and colleagues (2011) reported the design and synthesis of a proteasome inhibitor with a large chemical moiety that blocks its entry into the proteasome unless it is cleaved by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease [<xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This steric-capped proteasome inhibitor was able to inhibit human proteasome activity in cell-free assays only when pre-treated with HIV protease. Indeed, a similar method could be employed to limit toxicity of bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors in the context of CHIKV infection. Extensive optimisations of the modified proteasome inhibitor structure, together with detailed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> validation would be needed to confirm efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Cell lines and virus</title><p>Cell lines used in this study include BHK21 baby hamster kidney cells (ATCC CCL-10), HeLa cervical cancer epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-2), human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM, Lonza) and C6/36 from <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> embryonic tissue.
