<p>After the 2007 outbreak in Castiglione di Ravenna, the Italian Ministry of Health established a multidisciplinary team for developing national guidelines to implement 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> surveillance as well as guide good practices to prevent and control autochthonous transmission. Following the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidelines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the Italian Public Health authorities developed 3 different epidemiological risk scenarios according to the presence of Invasive Mosquito Species (IMS) and infected cases. The 3 epidemiological scenarios were i) locally established IMS with no arbovirus infection, ii) high abundance of IMS and presence of imported arbovirus cases, and iii) high abundance of IMS with 1 autochthonous or cluster cases. Different surveillance and control procedures according to the identified risk were defined [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]: i) vector surveillance using ovitraps in the locality where the presence of mosquitoes, as well as entry points (e.g., ports, airports) and possible routes of spread, were confirmed and pest control in the municipality using larvicides in manholes; ii) vector surveillance to assess the relative abundance and seasonality of adult mosquitoes, as well as insecticide spraying and the removal of breeding sites by carrying out door-to-door activities around 200 m of imported cases; iii) vector surveillance, screening of pathogens, and removal and treatment of larval breeding sites to target mosquito elimination through an area of 200 m around the infected cases; and iv) assessment of efficacy of control measures.
