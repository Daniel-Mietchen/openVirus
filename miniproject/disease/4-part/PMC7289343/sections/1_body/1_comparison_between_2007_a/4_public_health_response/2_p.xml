Few other regions implemented similar measures (mostly in northeastern areas of the country), and the perception of risk of outbreaks by general practitioners (GPs) remained still low. A questionnaire based survey on knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP), carried out in Rome in summer 2012, found that less than one-third of GP responders correctly identified the CHIKV-endemic countries, ways of transmission, major symptoms, duration of the incubation period, and long-term complications and were aware of specific preventive initiatives led by health authorities [
