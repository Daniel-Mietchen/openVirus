<p>Given the importance in terms of number of cases of the 2 Italian outbreaks, useful insights for public health may arise from a comparative analysis of their epidemiological, clinical, and virologic features. The aim of this paper is to review and compare the 2 outbreaks in terms of available estimates of key epidemiological parameters, patient clinical presentation, viral and immunological characteristics, and public health response. Recommendations and future direction for research are also discussed.</p>
