<p>Here we only present deletion defective genome data. We did investigate the potential for copy-back variants; however we did not observe an effect (data not shown, single experiment for each). We attributed this to the palindromic nature of the copy-back genomes generating “hairpin” type structures that then caused siRNA type effects (where the host cell silences RNA using short templates of invasive RNA). These “hairpin” type structures might be recognized by the Dicer proteins and broken down into short duplexes. This would obviously have to occur prior to the establishment of EBOV VP35 suppression of Dicer co-factors (Fabozzi et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It was our hope that recombinately produced defective EBOV genomes would have potential in reducing wild-type viral replication by reproducing in competition for resources. While an EBOV replication reducing effect was observed, this effect was limited (approximately halving) and we observed no significant release of the defective genomes. Further research into why this phenomenon has occurred might reveal novel aspects of how EBOV protects itself from parasitisation by defective genomes and possibly even the function of the RDRP.
