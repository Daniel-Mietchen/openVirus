<p>Viral release was also measured by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay. The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> data generated was generally confirmatory of the qRT-PCR data; however, we found the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay had inherently more variability (

 <sub>50</sub> titres (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.118, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.054, respectively). The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> broadly data supports the qRT-PCR data; however not to the same level of confidence.
