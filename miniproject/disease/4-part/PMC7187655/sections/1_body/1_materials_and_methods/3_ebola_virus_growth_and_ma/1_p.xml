<p>Ebola virus 
 <italic>H. sapiens</italic>-tc/COD/1976/Yambuku-Ecran, hereafter referred to as EBOV-Ecran was used in all studies. This virus, previously known as EBOV “E718” (Kuhn et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) was supplied by Public Health England. Passage 5 material was used to infect Vero C1008 cells. Virus was harvested on day 5 post-inoculation and titrated to produce a working stock at 1 × 10

 <sub>50</sub>/mL. This strain was selected because it would be able to directly transition into mouse studies should the strategy be found to be sufficiently effective to warrant further study. The disparity between viral strains used to generate the defective genomes was considered bioinformatically and, comparing the EBOV reference sequence from 1976 (NC_002549.1) with KJ660347.2, there was no nucleotide difference in the leader sequence of this virus when you compared with the EBOV Mayinga reference sequence from NCBI: NC_002549.1. However, there were few nucleotide differences in the trailer region when compare both viruses.
