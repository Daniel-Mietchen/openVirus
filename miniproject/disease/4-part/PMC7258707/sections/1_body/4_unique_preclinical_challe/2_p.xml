<p id="p0430">Challenges to developing countermeasures against biothreat agents are many, but some of the unique and key challenges are PK differences in healthy versus infected subjects, mapping the biodistribution of the countermeasure to the biodistribution of the pathogen, and limited opportunities to run randomized, controlled clinical trials. Preclinical studies typically require a PK study in healthy animals to guide dose selection prior to testing a countermeasure in an animal model of infection. In that regard, it is critical to understand what cells and tissues the pathogen is infecting over time so that countermeasures can be properly designed to reach infected tissue. For example, countermeasures against pathogens causing encephalitis require drug to reach the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast, EBOV was found to infect lymph nodes, spleen, and liver in NHPs 2–3 days following viral challenge, and by days 5–6 the virus was detected throughout the body (

To complicate things further, infected animals often have altered metabolizing enzymes (e.g., cytochrome p450s)

Running PK experiments in the presence of infection would eliminate many of these variables, but this is seldom done for countermeasures to biothreat agents, since it requires running these experiments in biocontainment labs.
