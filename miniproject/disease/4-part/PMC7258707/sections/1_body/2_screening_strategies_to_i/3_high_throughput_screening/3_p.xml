<p id="p0310">New approaches to understanding bacterial pathogenesis have enabled researchers to elucidate mechanisms that could be targeted to control and clear infection in lieu of simply targeting in vitro bacterial viability. Targeting the host under in vivo-like conditions (e.g., in cell culture or animal models) will be a key feature of study design to combatting intracellular pathogens that require the host for invasion and replication and will likely identify new host-directed therapeutics. The development of host-directed therapeutic (HDT) strategy relies on an understanding of the interactions between pathogens and their hosts and appropriate tools and HTS assays to screen and identify therapeutics. Technological progress in assay miniaturization has emerged from a combination of advanced robotic systems, high-throughput microscopy, automated image analysis, and data analysis using powerful bioinformatics tools, and this has led to the development of high-content imaging (HCI), allowing for large-scale quantification of multiple cellular phenotypes at the system level. Such phenotypic screening platforms rely on physiologically relevant host cell types that are permissive to pathogen infection and have the potential to identify compounds that modulate relevant biological processes in an unbiased, target, and mechanism-agnostic fashion. This cell-based approach has the added advantage that compounds that have greater mammalian cell membrane permeability, reduced cellular toxicity, and target the host proteins will be readily identified in the context of their desirable function in cells. Pharmacologically active compounds can be selected that inhibit the uptake or intracellular replication of the bacterium or disrupt the host–pathogen interactions. The general workflow for high-throughput, image-based phenotypic screening approach to identify HDTs is outlined in

Using bacterial antigen-specific antibody to detect bacteria, this method can quantitate the number of intracellular or cell-associated bacteria and the effect of the compounds in reducing the bacterial number (% inhibition of bacterial infection), and cellular toxicity (based on loss in cell number). Alternatively, one can use HCI to quantitate the morphological changes of MNGCs based on nuclei number and MNGC size/area and use this phenotype to screen and identify compounds that prevent bacterial spread
