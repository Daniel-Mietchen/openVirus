Pseudotyped virion assays are well suited as safe alternatives for HTS, since BSL3 and BSL4 wild-type pathogens are not required to complete the screens. These assays are based on viral vectors that harbor glycoproteins (GPs) of different enveloped viruses and a reporter gene such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase flanked by packaging signals, are used to generate chimeric replication-deficient viruses, and then used to screen and identify entry inhibitors. This approach has successfully identified entry inhibitors for Lassa, Ebola, and Nipah viruses
