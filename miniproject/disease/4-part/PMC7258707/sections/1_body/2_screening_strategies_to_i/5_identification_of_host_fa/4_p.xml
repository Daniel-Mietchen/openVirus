<p id="p0360">An alternative approach to gain an in-depth understanding of host–pathogen interactions during infection is to construct a protein–protein interaction network between host protein and bacterial virulence factors. Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) library, Memišević et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> identified a molecular network that governs 
 <italic>B. mallei</italic> infection. Similarly, a Y2H study conducted by Yang et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref> showed the involvement of focal adhesion, regulation of cytoskeleton, leukocyte transendoepithelial migration, Toll-like receptor (TLR), and MAPK signaling pathways during 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection. To complement the Y2H study, reverse-phase protein microarray analysis was used to interrogate changes in protein expression and posttranslational modification. This further revealed the roles of AMPK-α1, Src, and GSK3β in regulating 
 <italic>B. mallei</italic> and 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infection 
 <xref rid="bib0445" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, and thus, as viable host targets for countermeasure development.
