 <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. are nonmotile bacteria that cause brucellosis, a world-wide chronic debilitating disease in both humans and animals. Although not typically fatal, 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. are stable and infectious as aerosols and can lead to sterility and abortions 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The nonmotile bacillus 
 <italic>B. mallei</italic> is the causative agent of glanders that usually infects equids but is highly infectious to humans at low doses, producing septicemia, severe pulmonary infection, and chronic inflammation of the skin and eyes. 
 <italic>B. mallei</italic> can be easily aerosolized, and even with antibiotic treatment there are high mortality rates 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The motile bacterium 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a close relative to 
 <italic>B. mallei</italic> and can lead to severe illness in humans, such as pulmonary infection and septic shock. 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> is an environmental saprophyte that is naturally resistant to many antibiotics 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Q-fever is caused by direct contact with the nonmotile bacterium 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> that was previously weaponized because of its ease of aerosolization, its environmental stability, and its ability to infect animals or humans with a single bacterium 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Q-fever is not typically lethal but can be incapacitating, causing fever and difficulty breathing, and antibiotic therapy is not always effective, thus leading to persistent infections. 
 <italic>F. tularensis</italic> is the causative agent of tularemia and is highly infectious, resulting in an acute, rapidly progressing local or systemic infection 
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, the causative agent of plague, is a nonmotile bacterium that can be disseminated by aerosol, transmitted from person-to-person, and is characterized by a severe clinical disease course with potentially high case-fatality rates. There is a limited window for effective treatment against plague, since the resulting respiratory and circulatory collapse from septic shock is usually fatal
