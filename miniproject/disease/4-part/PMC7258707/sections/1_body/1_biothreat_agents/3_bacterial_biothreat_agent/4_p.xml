<p id="p0275">Many of the bacterial agents of biothreat concern are intracellular Gram-negative organisms. Intracellular bacteria are particularly difficult to treat because the intracellular niche protects bacteria from the innate or adaptive immune surveillance. These bacteria can enter host cells through phagocytosis, and to prevent their destruction in the endocytic pathways, intracellular bacteria have adapted to survive in a host lysosome and replicate within the acidic endolysosomal compartment (e.g., 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>). Another intracellular bacteria 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> spp. can traffic from a mature lysosome to endoplasmic reticulum–derived compartments, while bacteria such as 
 <italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic>, 
 <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei, Francisella tularensis</italic>, 
 <italic>and Yersinia pestis</italic> can prevent acidification and maturation of the phagosome and escape to the cytosol, where they can replicate and then disseminate to neighboring cells

 <italic>B. mallei</italic> and 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> intracellular life cycle is the fusion of infected mononuclear cells, forming multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs). Although the role of 
 <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>–induced MNGCs is unclear, it is believed that cell fusion facilitates localized dissemination of the bacteria
