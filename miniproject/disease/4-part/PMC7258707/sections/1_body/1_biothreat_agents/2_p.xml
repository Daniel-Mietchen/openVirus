<p id="p0260">United States (US) government agencies, together with international government and health protection entities, have worked to classify bacteria, viruses, and toxins into Select Agent categories (

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Currently classified as Tier 1 select agents are those pathogens of grave concern, whereas other useful classification categories are in use by US government entities such as National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list, denoting the pathogens as Category A, B, and C agents 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Various biothreat pathogens addressed in this chapter are grouped by general category and disease associated therewith (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">TableÂ 7.1</xref>). There are many organisms on the CDC list; consequently, not all of them are addressed in this chapter 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The authors of this chapter have endeavored to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature and described the development of medical countermeasures against high-priority bacterial and viral biothreat agents where the most progress has been made, and/or the most novel ground has been broken.
