<p id="p0295">Arthropod-transmitted alphaviruses and bunyaviruses are also biothreat concerns. For the alphaviruses specifically, the Venezuelan encephalitis viruses (VEEV), Eastern encephalitis viruses, and Western equine encephalitis viruses belonging to the family Togaviridae are found in the Americas and cause equine disease

 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. These new world alphaviruses cause encephalitis-like symptoms, are stable in the environment, grow to high titers easily in cell culture, are highly infectious by aerosol, and affect humans with incapacitating neurological disease, sometimes with high morbidity rates 
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Bunyaviruses such as Rift Valley fever virus and the related tick-transmitted nairovirus causing Crimeanâ€“Congo hemorrhagic fever also cause human diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates. Some investigational new drug vaccines exist for these agents. These viruses replicate quickly in humans and cause rapid disease; therefore the timing for therapeutic intervention is short, making treatment postinfection very challenging.
