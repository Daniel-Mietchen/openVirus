<p id="p0290">Variola virus (VARV) is the causative agent of smallpox, a human viral disease for which tecovirimat was recently approved as a therapeutic by the FDA, a successful therapeutic development story 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This pathogen has been eradicated since 1979 through successful vaccine campaigns 
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, but because the vaccine is no longer administered in most countries, populations may be susceptible in the event that VARV or an intentionally modified or related poxvirus with similar virulence factors and similar human lethality is resurrected
