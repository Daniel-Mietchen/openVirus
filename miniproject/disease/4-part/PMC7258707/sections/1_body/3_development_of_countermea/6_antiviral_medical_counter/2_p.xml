 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 7.3</xref> lists reported studies in either mice or NHPs that have shown significant benefits to survival in challenge models. The table also includes in vitro potencies, viral strains, specific animal species, dosing regimens, routes of administration, PKs, and benefits to survival—data necessary for the reader to relate in vitro potency to in vivo efficacy, assess/interpret results, and make comparisons. The corresponding chemical structures are provided in

 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 7.4</xref> displays the status/results of clinical trials for therapeutics used for the treatment of infections caused by EBOV and LASV. Noteworthy, most of these clinical trials were underpowered without appropriate controls and hence results may be speculative.
