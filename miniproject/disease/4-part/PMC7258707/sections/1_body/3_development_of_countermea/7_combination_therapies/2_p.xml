<p id="p0425">Combination therapies are an excellent approach to improve treatment outcomes, shorten treatment duration, and overcome microbial resistance mechanisms caused by biothreat pathogens. Combination therapy may incorporate antibiotics or antivirals with HDT or antibody therapy at rationally designed treatment schedule. In this way the usage of multiple treatment modalities can synergize to optimize the mechanism of action of biothreat-targeted therapies. 
 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7.6</xref> includes combination therapies that have been used to treat each biothreat bacteria. In the case of viral infections, while combination therapy has been used for treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (e.g., combination of nucleoside, nonnucleoside, protease, and/or host-targeted inhibitors) or chronic hepatitis C virus infection (e.g., combination of polymerase and RNA-binding protein NS5A inhibitors), to date there are no reported studies for biothreat viral agents. Several β lactam antibiotic drugs have been able to overcome deactivation when delivered in combination with inhibitors that target extended-spectrum β lactamases (enzymes that are overexpressed in the MDR pathogens, inactivate the β lactam antibiotic by cleaving the β lactam ring and thus one of the major contributors of antibiotic resistance). The β lactam/β lactamase inhibitor combination drugs that have been FDA-approved include Augmentin XR (amoxicillin/clavulanate combination), Unasyn (ampicillin/sublbactam combination), and Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam combination). In the case of biothreat bacteria, the combination of Ceftolozone and tazobactam exhibited increased in vitro susceptibility to a variety of clinical, environmental, and animal strains of
