<p id="p0365">Prior to the initiation of medical countermeasure development against specific pathogens, a target product profile (TPP) is needed to define the required features of potential drug candidates (e.g., route of administration, prophylactic vs therapeutic, trigger to treat, and onset of action requirements). Once a TPP is in place, a screening funnel is drafted that sets laboratory criteria and defines clear go/no-go decision points that are needed to progress countermeasures from discovery through preclinical development and into human clinical trials. Irrespective of the types of assays used for countermeasure screening, compounds identified as having significant inhibition in primary screens are validated in subsequent dose–response experiments to determine the half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) and cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>). Potent compounds that have an adequate selectivity index (e.g., &gt;10) that is defined as a ratio of CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>, are then often tested in orthogonal assays in appropriate cells/tissues to better understand or validate the antipathogen activity. Ideally, compounds are further optimized for potency, selectivity, physicochemical, and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and safety prior to in vivo evaluation to assess efficacy in appropriate animal models of infection (
