<p id="p0400">Whereas HDT targets the host directly, antibody therapy is the passive process of activating the immune system to respond to microbial threats. Sources of antibodies can include individuals that survive infection or have received a prophylactic vaccine against a microbe. Alternatively, antibodies can also be generated ex vivo using cell culture. Historically, antibody-based serum or plasma therapy has been widely used to treat a variety of infectious diseases. Limitations for clinical use arise however from the polyclonal nature of serum antibodies, resulting in lot-to-lot variation, approaches for determination of correct dose levels and regimens, and a risk for allergic reactions and transmission of transfusion-borne diseases.</p>
