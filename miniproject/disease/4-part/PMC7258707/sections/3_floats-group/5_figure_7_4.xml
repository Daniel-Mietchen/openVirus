  <p>Screening funnel to identify small molecule therapeutics.</p>
  <p>Primary screening of small molecule chemical libraries in the phenotypic HCI assay will identify compounds that inhibit pathogen infection as well as those that may contribute to cellular toxicity. Generally, hits that show ≥50% infection inhibition and ≤20% loss in cell number are then subjected to hit triage or in silico filtering wherein compounds with optimal physicochemical properties such as solubility, Lipinski’s Rule of 5, metabolism are selected for potency testing in the phenotypic screening assays. Compounds that exhibit an EC
   <sub>50</sub> ≤ 1 μM and SI, which is a ratio of CC
   <sub>50</sub>/EC
   <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10, are then further optimized through iterative cycles of synthesis, testing in cell-based and orthogonal assays and in in vitro ADMET studies to improve potency and physicochemical properties. If the target of the hit molecule is identified then a target-based screen is performed and the hits identified are optimized through the iterative structure–activity relationship cycle. The Lead series candidates are then evaluated in vivo for their pharmacokinetic properties and then for efficacy in appropriate challenge models of infection.
