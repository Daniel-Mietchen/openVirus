<p>Outbreaks varied in magnitude between years, with the largest outbreaks in 2010 and from 2015–2016 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007504.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Between 2010–2013, the mean annual incidence was 13 cases/100,000 and this increased to 32 cases/100,000 between 2014–2016, coinciding with the change in national notification guidelines. The mean state-wide annual incidence rate across the 7 years was 21 cases per 100,000 people (median 18/100,000). For the 6-year period (2011–2016) where locality data were available, state-wide mean annual incidence of dengue in urban localities was 44/100,000 versus 47/100,000 for rural localities. Annual rates of dengue in urban and rural localities often contributed similarly to the overall burden, despite annual variations in incidence (
