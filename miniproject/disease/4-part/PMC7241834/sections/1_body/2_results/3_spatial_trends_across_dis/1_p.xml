<p>District-level incidence rates were highly variable each year, with a mean annual rate of 50 cases/100,000 (range 19-161/100,000) across the 7 years (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007504.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). High annual variability meant that there was no significant difference in mean incidence rates between the districts overall (H = 25.978, p = 0.354); however, the highest mean incidence rates were found in districts in the west of the state with relatively low human population density, including Kuala Penyu, Nabawan, Tenom and Kota Marudu. The relative risks were highest in Kuala Penyu, Kota Marudu and Kudat districts (RR = 3.5, 2.1 and 1.8, respectively) (

Lower, less variable incidence rates were recorded from some of the central and eastern districts including Kinabatangan, Tongod, Kunak and Tawau (annual incidence range of 3–62 cases/100,000 each year). These districts also had some of the lowest relative risks (RR = 0.3, 0.4, 1, and 0.8, respectively) (
