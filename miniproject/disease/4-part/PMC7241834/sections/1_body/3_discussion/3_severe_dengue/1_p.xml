<p>Changing demographic or immunological factors may explain the observed pattern of severe dengue in our study. Incidence of severe dengue was localised to two main regions of the state: the eastern districts of Tawau and Sandakan. These districts include major urbanised cities as well as rural surrounding areas, and comprised relatively low dengue rates compared to the west of the state. The reasons for this spatial concentration of cases in these eastern districts is unknown. It is possible that the increase in severe cases in these areas followed a serotype switch from DENV 4 to DENV 1 reported to have occurred in Sandakan between 2013 and 2016 [

Those with a history of dengue infection with a different serotype may be more vulnerable to severe dengue as a result of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection [

Surveillance information regarding which virus serotypes and genotypes were circulating in Sabah was not available in this study, so we were unable to assess the potential contribution of virus circulation patterns to the trends we observed. However, routine public health monitoring of circulating serotypes, including the importation of new serotypes in particular, should be prioritised. Close monitoring of serological surveillance data alongside detailed epidemiological data could aid predictions of severe disease risk [
