<p>The revised dengue case definition in Malaysia in 2014 will undoubtedly have influenced the incidence rates reported here, in terms of either under- or over-reporting of cases. Less reliance on clinical symptoms for case notification from 2014 onwards might have been expected to reduce notifications but, in fact, a dramatic increase in cases was recorded. Perhaps the influx of diagnostic kits into health facilities across the country encouraged testing of all febrile cases, accompanied by changes in awareness and reporting by clinicians. Prior to 2014, there may have been a lack of resources for testing or notifying dengue, or other socioeconomic factors, that resulted in under-reporting [

It is also possible that increases in diagnostic testing from 2014 were not uniform across all districts, and/or that additional reporting inconsistencies at the sub-district level, or between rural and urban health facilities, may have impacted our observations. However, widespread increases in cases recorded throughout the rest of the country during the same time frame suggest that much of the true dengue burden was not being captured prior to 2014. Longer-term monitoring of notification trends will likely clarify the true burden. Similarly, finer-scale investigation at the sub-district level might enable more detailed analyses of dengue risk factors, as variation in population density and demographic factors within districts could be more accurately assessed. Additional immunological, biological and/or virological factors may also have impacted our findings, but an assessment of these was beyond the scope of this study.
