<p>Our observations are derived from district-level incidence data and we were not able to evaluate finer scale incidence patterns. However, we were able to illustrate marked spatial and temporal heterogeneity across Sabah in all years and noted a distinct shift in the spatial dominance of urban versus rural localities during the large outbreak of 2015, which reversed again in 2016. Our findings suggest that high density, urbanised areas are not necessarily the primary locations of ongoing epidemics in Sabah. Similar observations of rural dominance or equivalence in dengue incidence have also been observed in other areas of Malaysia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These latter countries have all reported epidemics that shift between rural and urban areas via human or mosquito movement. In endemic environments, transmission is mediated by water storage and waste disposal practices, mosquito vector ecology and sociocultural factors including human movement patterns [
