<p>Each observation was completed with data derived from details regarding entomological operations (entomological survey, vector control). Data were obtained from the French mosquito control agency, EID-Méditerranée. The intervention delay was defined as the period of time between EDP and the first intervention focusing on vectors, whether an entomological survey or vector control. Entomological surveys aim to identify the presence of the vector–pre-imaginal stages or adults—while control measures are taken when the vector’s presence is confirmed. Vector control is implemented according to national guidelines and depends on the local entomological, epidemiological and environmental context. The intervention may consist of one or more of the following components: source reduction of breeding sites, application of larvicides, hand-held thermal fogging and vehicle-mounted ultra-low volume fogging.
