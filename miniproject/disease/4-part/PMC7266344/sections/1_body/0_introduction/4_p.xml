<p>Few autochthonous transmission events have occurred in France in recent years [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is still spreading across the country, leading to a greater proportion of the population exposed to DENV and CHIKV transmission risk. Other emerging viruses may also prove to be a challenge for the country’s preparedness and response systems, something already observed with the Zika virus when cases were reported in France in 2016 following the epidemic in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although substantial human and logistical resources are already mobilized every year, the challenges raised by emerging viruses will only lead to further costs and this raises the question of the future sustainability of France’s surveillance and control system [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This imminent situation underlines the need for a better understanding of the factors that favour DENV and CHIKV autochthonous transmission in France.
