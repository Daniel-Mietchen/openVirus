<p>While the presence of an established vector population and virus introduction by infected travellers are necessary conditions for the emergence of these infections, they may not be sufficient for arbovirus transmission. Indeed, effective transmission is multifactorial and results from complex interactions between mosquito vectors, the human population, viral agents, their environment and climate. Genetics play an important role in fostering the transmission of some viral genotypes by locally established vector populations [

Socioeconomic and environmental factors influence the epidemiology of the disease by affecting the introduction of the virus, the contact between vectors and hosts, vector-pathogen interactions, as well as vector population distribution and dynamics [
