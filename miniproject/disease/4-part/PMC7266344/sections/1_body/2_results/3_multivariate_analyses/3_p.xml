<p>Different models were therefore built by combination of uncorrelated variables. For all the different models, the VIF for each predictor was less than 3, which is the value proposed as a threshold below which any effect of multicollinearity can be considered negligible [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Global multivariate models were built as a final step by combining the different type of variables with the reporting delay converted as a categorical variable. Identical global multivariate models were obtained after stepwise selection for scenarios Sc1 and Sc2. However, global multivariate models for scenario Sc1 (scenario for which the transmission location is fixed at the residence of the autochthonous case) exhibits the highest explained deviance. The different models obtained for scenario Sc1 are presented in
