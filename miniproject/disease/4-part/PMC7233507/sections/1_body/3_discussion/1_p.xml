<p>Recent advancements in the detection of influenza make surveillance of the virus feasible, quick, and cost-effective in the clinical setting [

 <xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the role of these methods on end outcomes is still controversial. Our analysis has revealed a significant increase in the rate of discharges due to influenza but no significant changes in the percentage of inpatient mortality over the years between 1993 to 2015. The latter phenomena are intact in the setting of varying mean age of admissions throughout the years analyzed. Advanced influenza virus detection tests are now recommended in both outpatient (including emergency departments) and inpatient admissions, and vaccination against influenza is still encouraged and supported by many organizational bodies, whether it be in education, the private sector, and government, depending on the roles of individuals at these institutions. It is noted that there was a recent increase in the inpatient admission counts from influenza as extrapolated by a marked increase in hospital discharges related to influenza. The interval 2013 to 2015 was comparable to the 2009 influenza pandemic year in the discharge rate for influenza. This increase in discharges may have been due to more efficient detection modalities, resulting in more influenza diagnoses within a population. However, the lack of change in the percentage of the inpatient mortality year-to-year makes the impact of these detection tests on the end-outcome for the respective admission questionable. There were no more than two consecutive negative values in Figure
