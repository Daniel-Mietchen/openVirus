<p id="par0030">Influenza virus infection (IVI) causes annual epidemics that result in estimated 1 billion infections, including 3–5 million severe cases and 250,000–500,000 mortality cases worldwide each year [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. IVI can cause primary viral pneumonia, which may progress to a potentially fatal outcome [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is difficult to distinguish the cause of CAP induced by flu, other respiratory viruses or bacteria based solely on clinical symptoms, and the conventional lab biomarkers of viral and/or bacterial infections do not differ in influenza-positive compared with influenza-negative patients [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Influenza can temporarily suppress host immune defenses, leading to bacterial complications [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a frequent cause of excess mortality during influenza epidemics, but the epidemiology remains unclear [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hospital admissions during the 2009 influenza epidemic season showed a moderate to strong association between influenza and bacterial pneumonia, whereas the interaction is modest or non-existent during non-epidemic periods [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Bacteria including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilia influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, often interact with respiratory viruses (esp. the influenza virus), and shape the outcome of respiratory infection [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies have shown the evidence of bacterial invasion is more than 90% in influenza-infected cases, and the high rates of co-infections exist in these patients, indicating that viral infection may enhance both susceptibility and severity of subsequent bacterial infection [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In vitro studies have shown that influenza infection enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia by about 100-fold in a week, but the interaction between influenza and bacteria is not limited in pneumococcal pneumonia [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the hospital, viral testing among patients with respiratory symptoms is uncommon [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the determination of the microbiological etiology is severely hampered in CAP by the difficulty of obtaining specimens from the infected area (esp. from lower respiratory tract), samples could be easily contaminated by respiratory conditioned pathogens. At present, the epidemiological history of influenza-like illness (ILI) and the incidence and clinical presentation of CAP caused by viruses other than influenza during an influenza epidemic season were limited [

 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>]. In this study, we report on the surveillance of respiratory microorganisms, and its laboratory biomarkers, in CAP patients admitted to a hospital during the January to August 2016. The specific microbiome patterns, their clinical significance, and the antibacterial/antiviral treatment were analyzed in these patients simultaneous.
