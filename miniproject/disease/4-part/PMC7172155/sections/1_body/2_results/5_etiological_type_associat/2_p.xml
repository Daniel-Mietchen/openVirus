<p id="par0085">4 patients with pure non-influenza infection and 4 patients with non-influenza and bacterium / 
 <italic>Yeast</italic> co-infection were admitted to the ICU, and 3 patients died in the non-influenza co-infected with bacterium / 
 <italic>Yeast</italic> group (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). In these patients, pharyngeal discomfort was only found in the pure influenza group. Bacterium / 
 <italic>Yeast</italic> co-infected with non-influenza viruses were more common than bacterium/ 
 <italic>Yeast</italic> and influenza co-infections. WBC counts in the non-influenza groups were significantly higher than in the influenza groups, and the highest WBC counts were observed in the non-influenza and bacterium / 
 <italic>Yeast</italic> co-infected group. The PLT count (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) also had the similar trend.
