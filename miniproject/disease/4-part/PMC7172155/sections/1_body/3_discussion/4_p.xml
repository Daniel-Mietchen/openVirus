 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>H. influenza</italic>, as co-pathogens, often seem to be part of a mixed infection (virus and bacterium) in adults with CAP [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], representing the most common combination with respiratory viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The incidence of mixed infections was significant among patients admitted to the hospital with CAP [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our study, 16.41% of CAP patients had single virus, and the co-infections (virus + bacterium and virus+ 
 <italic>Yeast</italic>) were found in 12.82% CAP patients. The incidence of co-infections was in agreement with a previous study [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The most common bacterium co-detected with a virus was 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, as well as the 
 <italic>Yeast</italic> in our study, indicating that geographical variation exists in the prevalence of bacterium or 
 <italic>Yeast</italic> strains expressing factors that enable efficient disease potentiation during viral epidemics, which should be considered one explanation for regional differences in severity [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The diversity in etiology revealed that understanding the local etiology of CAP is essential to inform clinical management decisions.
