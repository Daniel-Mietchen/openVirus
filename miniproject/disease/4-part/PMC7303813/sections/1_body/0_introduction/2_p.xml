<p>Enteroviruses are among the most common infectious pathogens in infants and children. They are associated various clinical presentations from mild to severe illness, including non-specific febrile illness, mucosa-cutaneous presentation (herpangina, hand-foot-mouth disease, conjunctivitis, and various exanthems), CNS involvement (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, poliomyelitis, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, etc.), heart infection (myopericarditis), neonatal infection, and newly recognized clinical syndrome (asthma exacerbation secondary to EV D68 and Eczema Coxsackium) (

Besides neurological sequelae, enterovirus infection has been shown to have other long-term effects resulting in common health problems, such as allergy diseases, autoimmune diseases, and diseases involving other systems, and for this reason enterovirus infection has become a major public health issue in children (
