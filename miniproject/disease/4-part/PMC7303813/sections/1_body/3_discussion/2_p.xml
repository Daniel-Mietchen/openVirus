<p>According to long-term data gathered by Taiwan's CDC, the number of outpatients and emergency visits due to enterovirus, i.e., herpangina or hand-foot-mouth disease, increases during late March, peaks around mid-June, and then declines gradually. Children under 5 years old are more prone to enterovirus infection with severe complications, resulting in case-fatality rates ranging from 1.3 to 33.3%. A previous study also reported more than 93% of cases with severe enterovirus infection were found in children who were younger than 4 years old, and epidemics of enterovirus occur every 2â€“3 years due to the accumulation of a new population of susceptible individuals (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Besides hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina, this virus can be potentially complicated with severe neurological complications resulting in mortality of young children. In Taiwan, the largest and most severe enterovirus 71 epidemic to date occurred in 1998, and almost all of the patients with cardiopulmonary failure died (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), more patients infected with enterovirus survived; however, the long-term sequelae, particularly neurodevelopment and cognitive function, remain a major concern in the management of this disease (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition to neurological sequelae, enterovirus infection is thought to have a long-term impact on various common health problems, such as allergic diseases, and diseases involving other systems, and thus enterovirus infection is becoming a major public health issue in children (
