<p>Viral CNS infections during childhood have been documented to be associated with later development of long-term neurologic sequelae, such as limb weakness, cranial nerve palsy, cerebral palsy, non-affective psychotic illness, cognitive impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disability, and epilepsy (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Enterovirus has been reported as one of the major causes of viral CNS infection (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Even when CNS manifestations are totally resolved, psychiatric problems may be noted when children enter school (

This implies that early recognition of psychiatric and cognitive problems and early intervention are crucial, especially for children who are infected with enterovirus at a young age. Patients with severe EV infection are of particular concern in this regard. In the present study, severe EV infection identified by hospital admission for EV infection is a major public health issue that needs to be urgently addressed.
