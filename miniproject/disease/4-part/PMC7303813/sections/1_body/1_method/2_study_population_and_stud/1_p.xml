 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Since the cases of EV infection surged due to the endemic outbreak in 1998 in Taiwan, we chose to study since 1999 for clearer disease status definition. This is a claim data study. The basis of diagnosis is physicians' coding. International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) was used by NHI of Taiwan during the study period. Symptomatic enterovirus infection (herpangina, hand-foot-mouth disease, enterovirus infection with CNS diseases) was defined as patients coded as ICD-9-CM 047, 048, 049, or 074. For the period 1999–2003, 49,236 patients with enterovirus (EV) infection (ICD-9-CM 047-049, 074) were identified from the LHID2000. Children aged &lt;18 years were selected. Individuals diagnosed with attention deficit and hyperactive disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, atopic diseases, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) before the diagnosis of enterovirus were excluded. Subjects with missing data related to parental occupation and urbanization were also excluded. Finally, a total of 14,168 subjects were included in the study. EV infection was further categorized according to level of severity based on the admission to hospital with diagnosis of EV infection. Subjects who were not hospitalized for EV infection were categorized as having a non-severe EV infection. Subjects who were hospitalized for EV infection were categorized as having a severe EV infection. The control group comprised individuals who were not diagnosed with EV infection during 1999–2003 matched by age and sex at a ratio of 1:1. Follow-up was terminated in each cohort when: the study subjects withdrew from the NHI program, a major outcome such as ADHD, epilepsy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis occurred, or until December 31, 2013 was reached, as this was the end of the study period.
