<p id="Par42">A prospective study from France et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] that included 556 patients with influenza, of which 30% had pneumonia, showed that the admittance to the ICU, not the virus type, was the main risk factor for death. They further confirmed that prior chronic respiratory disease was associated with ICU admission in multivariate logistic regression models. The proportion of chronic respiratory disease patients was significantly higher in flu A compared to flu B patients. However, the association of virus types with ICU admission were not assessed.
