<p id="Par17">Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that is widespread across the globe. Despite advances in medical technology, influenza causes considerable hospitalizations and mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is estimated that each year, 1 billion cases of symptomatic influenza infection have occurred across the globe, including 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 290 000–650 000 cases of influenza-related respiratory deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. From 2010 to 2018, approximately 4.3–23 million medical visits, 140 000–960 000 hospitalizations, 18 000–96 000 influenza-related intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and 12 000–79 000 deaths were associated with influenza per year in the United States of America [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Influenza infection also poses an economic burden. Recent estimates place the economic burden of a moderately severe to severe pandemic at approximately USD 500 billion, or 0.6% of the global income [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For these reasons, influenza epidemics are regarded as the greatest threat to the public health in the twenty-first century.
