<p id="Par23">Data were analysed for normality using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Measurement data with a normal distribution are shown as the mean ± standard deviation. Those with a non-normal distribution are expressed as the median. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were analyzed using a Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test. 
 <italic>P</italic>-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. All probability tests were two-tailed.
