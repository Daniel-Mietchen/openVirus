<p id="p0280">We agree with the TPP that the vaccine not be abortigenic or teratogenic. However, vertical transmission to the fetus may be acceptable provided it is not abortigenic or teratogenic. We suggest that the statement that “Live attenuated vaccines in any form must be sufficiently weakened not to cause reversion to virulence or creation of reassortments transmissible via mosquitoes” be changed to read “Live attenuated vaccines should contain safeguards against reversion to virulence and transmissibility through mutation or reassortment”. This statement provides guidance for risk-based regulatory assessments without unduly limiting development.</p>
