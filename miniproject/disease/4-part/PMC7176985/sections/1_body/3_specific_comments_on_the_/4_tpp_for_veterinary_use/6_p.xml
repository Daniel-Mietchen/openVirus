 <underline>Efficacy:</underline> We agree with the targets regarding the percent of animals seroconverting. We suggest that the statement of protection through colostrum apply to livestock in general, not only sheep. With respect to Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA), WHO recommendations should be compliant with the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) Terrestrial Manual, which states that “Although DIVA is an important property of any future vaccine, a requirement for DIVA should not hinder or block the development or licensing of an effective RVF vaccine”
