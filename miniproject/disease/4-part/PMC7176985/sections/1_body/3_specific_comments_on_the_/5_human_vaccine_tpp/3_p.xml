 <bold>Safety/reactogenicity.</bold> We disagree with the optimal target description “No live-attenuated virus vaccine to be used unless reassorting is excluded”. Reassortment cannot be categorically “excluded” for LAVs but is unlikely to have untoward consequences, as described above. The TPP should stipulate that LAVs should contain safeguards against reversion and reassortment and should have a favorable benefit:risk ratio when used for RVFV prevention and outbreak control.
