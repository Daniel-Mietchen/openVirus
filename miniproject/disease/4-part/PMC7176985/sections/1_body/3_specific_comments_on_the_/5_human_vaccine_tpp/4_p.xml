<p id="p0310">We disagree with the minimally acceptable target description “Usage of an attenuated live vaccine that may allow reassortment is not indicated in an outbreak setting.” As pointed out above, reassortment cannot be categorically “excluded” for LAVs and is unlikely to have untoward consequences. LAVs in use and under development already contain safeguards against reversion and reassortment. The benefit:risk ratio (cases of RVF illness, retinitis or death prevented per excess illness caused by a theoretical reassortant) will be highly favorable for an LAV used for RVF epidemic control. Moreover, there is no evidence for human-to-human or human-mosquito transmission of wild-type RVFV, and this will likely be true for both LAVs and for a LAV-wild-type reassorted virus as well.</p>
