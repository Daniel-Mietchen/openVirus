 <bold>Efficacy:</bold> The statement “It is advised to broadly characterize the immune response after vaccination including profiles of the humoral and cellular immune response” could be strengthened to advise that a biomarker of protective immunity be defined (critical to assessments of durability of protection and of efficacy in different populations, e.g. children, elderly). It is likely that neutralizing antibody mediates protection, but a biomarker (antibody titer) has not been defined.
