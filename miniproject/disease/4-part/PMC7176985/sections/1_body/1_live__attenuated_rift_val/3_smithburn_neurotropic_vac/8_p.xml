 <bold>MP-12-NSm-del</bold>. Won et al. used reverse genetics to modify MP-12 by deleting a region of the open reading frame encoding the non-structural protein, NSm and observed that the resulting virus replicated in vitro equally well as the parental MP-12 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Deletion of the NSm virulence factor is combined with attenuating mutations on all three segments of MP-12, and would retain an attenuated phenotype even if reassortment with wild-type virus reconstituted the NSm gene. Morrill et al. showed that vaccination of sheep and calves with MP-12-NSm-del resulted in RVFV neutralizing antibodies levels comparable to MP-12

 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The vaccine was then tested in goats, sheep and calves in Tanzania and Morocco and found to induce antibodies that neutralized MP-12 and presumably virulent RVFV as well. The level of response was slightly lower than tests using animals from North America, but still reached what is believed to be protective titers
