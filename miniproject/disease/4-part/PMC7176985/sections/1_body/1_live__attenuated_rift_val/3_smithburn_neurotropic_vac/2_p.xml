<p id="p0100">The first and oldest LAV is the Smithburn Neurotropic Strain (SNS) that has been used for over 50Â years in parts of Africa. While the SNS vaccine is still in use in countries where RVF outbreaks have occurred in the past, concerns remain about safety and efficacy, consistency of manufacture, vaccine stability, inadequate timeliness and coverage of vaccination before and during epizootics. This experience, which is informed by the history of attenuating passages and inability to adequately control the balance of attenuation and virulence, supports development and introduction of improved vaccines and improved policies for their use.</p>
