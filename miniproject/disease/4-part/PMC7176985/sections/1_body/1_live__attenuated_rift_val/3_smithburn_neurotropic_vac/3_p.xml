<p id="p0105">SNS has been used exclusively for immunization of ruminants and has not been tested in humans because it is abortigenic in ruminants and retains neurovirulence for nonhuman primates. The SNS vaccine originated by serial passage of a RVFV strain isolated from mosquitoes in Uganda in 1944 in mouse brains 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It underwent additional serial passages in mouse brain and in embryonated duck eggs by yolk sac inoculation, with initial commercial lots of ‘avianized’ vaccine produced in the early 1950s 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Subsequently, virus at mouse brain passage level 102 followed by 54 passes in duck embryos and a further 16 passages in mouse brains was used to prepare commercial vaccine (10% freeze-dried mouse brain suspension) until 1958 when new lots were prepared in mouse brain tissue directly from mouse passage 102 virus (without duck embryo passage). Since 1971, vaccine has been produced in continuous BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells infected with mouse brain passage 102 and marketed by Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP). It is recommended for use in healthy adult animals only and is not safe for pregnant animals. An inactivated vaccine, based on an adjuvanted, formalin-inactivated virulent strain of RVFV, is also marketed by OBP. This vaccine may be applied to animals during all physiological stages, including pregnancy, but repeated vaccinations are required for optimal efficacy. Although both these classical vaccines have proven valuable in controlling RVF in endemic/enzootic areas, a vaccine that combines the efficacy of the live vaccine with the safety of the inactivated vaccine would be extremely valuable.
