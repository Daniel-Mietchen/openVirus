 <bold>MP-12.</bold> MP-12 is another LAV vaccine for the prevention of RVF that was first developed by the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) for human use by a process of chemical mutagenesis. The vaccine is under development by the Sabin Vaccine Institute, Washington DC. MP-12 vaccine is conditionally licensed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for veterinary use in the U.S. MP-12 is attenuated based on multiple (23) single nucleotide permutations (SNP) on all three RNA segments, L, M and S. For this reason, the potential for reversion to virulence by reassortment with wild-type RVFV is minimized or precluded since acquisition of one or more wild-type segments by the vaccine virus would be attenuated by mutations in the remaining gene(s). There is no evidence at all that a “novel” strain with increased virulence or tropism would emerge from such an event. MP-12 has been clinically tested in over 90 human volunteers and found to rapidly elicit neutralizing antibody titers that lasted over 5 years with minimal or absent viremia, genetic stability in vivo, and no significant adverse effects

Morrill demonstrated that pregnant sheep vaccinated with MP-12 were protected against challenge using virulent RVF virus, and that blood from newborn lambs was free of RVFV neutralizing antibody, indicating that transplacental infection had not occurred. However lambs born to vaccinated ewes gained protective antibody after the first nursing from maternal colostrum

 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. MP-12 can infect mosquitoes experimentally, but transmission is considered to be excluded based on the absent or minimal viremia observed in ruminants and humans
