 <bold>Clone-13</bold>. Live and inactivated SNS vaccines remained the only registered veterinary countermeasures available in some African countries for decades until the introduction of Clone 13 in 2010 by OBP. This attenuated strain, originally described by Muller et al. contains a spontaneous large internal deletion of 549 nucleotides that removes 69% of the open reading frame of NSs that occurred during serial passage of a virulent isolate of RVFV 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. NSs is a non-structural protein of RVFV and has been determined to be the major virulence determinant counteracting host innate immune responses

 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Clone 13 does not induce detectable viremia and has been tested in cattle, sheep and goats in large open field trials in Kenya and the data indicated that it was safe 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A large open field study in pregnant sheep and goats was also performed in Senegal, and no evidence of the vaccine causing abortions was found 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, a subsequent experimental study showed that Clone 13 was associated with fetal malformations and less frequently, stillbirths 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The virus is capable of infecting mosquitoes experimentally, but transmission efficiency is low 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since Clone 13 does not induce detectable viremia in the target species for vaccination, the chance of transmission from vaccinated animals to mosquitoes is considered negligible. Clone-13 has not been evaluated for human vaccination.
