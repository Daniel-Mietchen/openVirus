<p id="p0325">Once LAVs are approved and widely used to vaccinate ruminants and/or humans, it is important to monitor for reassortment and to better define the frequency of such events. Post-marketing studies could sample animals (humans) during the first few days after vaccination (the timing based on the period of viremia or evidence for replication based on biodistribution studies of the vaccine), particularly when vaccinations are performed during periods of concurrent RVFV circulation. Additional surveillance of mosquito vectors for reassortant virus during such periods would also be useful. Full genomic sequencing of suspect reassortant viruses should be performed for verification. If reassortants are found, phenotypic characterization will be important, and could include experimental studies of virulence and host range 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The latter require that the virus is isolated, followed by establishment of a low-passage virus stock, preferably in mosquito cells to avoid phenotypic changes due to laboratory passage. Careful consideration is needed of experimental design for virulence and host range studies, benchmarked against both the parental LAV and wild-type viruses.
