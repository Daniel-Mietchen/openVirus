 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> depicts the range of phenotypic outcomes of reassortment between a LAV and wild-type virus. If an LAV genome segment was acquired by a wild-type virus, the phenotype of the resulting virus would be attenuated or unchanged. If a wild-type virus genome segment was acquired by an LAV, its host range, viremia level, pathogenicity, and transmissibility (shedding, arthropod infection) could be increased, but is unlikely to exceed that of the wild-type virus itself. Experimental observations of reassortment between the MP-12 LAV and wild-type RVFV have illustrated these conclusions 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Since it is impossible to exclude all biological possibilities through empirical, experimental studies of this sort, a risk-based approach to application of LAVs is required.
