 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. provide a comprehensive review of reassortment of RVFV, citing examples from experimental and field studies with LAVs. The review supports the conclusion that, while reassortant wild-type viruses have been identified, this was an uncommon phenomenon. The evidence provided for reassortment between wild-type and attenuated LAVs in natural infection was limited to the SA184/10 strain from the patient with a needle stick injury cited earlier, for which full genomic sequencing indicates that it is not a reassortant virus 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Where reassortment has been demonstrated in experimental studies (by coinfection in vitro or in mosquitoes) no evidence for strains of increased pathogenicity has been found.
