<p id="p0200">The evidence from phylogenetic studies of RVFV strains indicates that reassortment between RVFV strains (but not other viruses) has played a role in the evolution of the virus, but that low levels of diversity have been observed over 67Â years 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Reassortment events, while reported in nature, have been rare compared to sequence variations resulting from mutations 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Reassortment has occurred between RVFV strains, rather than with heterologous phleboviruses, or more distantly related bunyaviruses. It may be inferred that similar limitations would reduce the potential for successful reassortment of an LAV with heterologous viruses, creating a chimera with unknown pathogenicity. Experimental studies have recently borne out this fact; a recent study evaluated the potential of MP-12 LAV to reassort with other related viruses of the family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> including Arumowot virus, a phlebovirus and no viable reassortant viruses were produced
