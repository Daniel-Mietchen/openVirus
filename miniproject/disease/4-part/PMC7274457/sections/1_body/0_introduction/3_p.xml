<p>Although there have been reports of the isolation of JEV GIb from humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], pigs, and mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the results provide evidence for the existence of JEV GIb, to the best of our knowledge, no outbreaks caused by JEV GIb among humans have been reported in Asia. This study acquired JEV GIb from both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from JE cases and mosquito specimens collected from the local environment during the 2018 outbreak of JE in Ningxia (Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) in northern China. Evidence from both laboratory and field data confirmed that JEV GIb was the pathogen that caused this outbreak. This study is the first to confirm that JEV GIb can cause JE outbreak in humans.
