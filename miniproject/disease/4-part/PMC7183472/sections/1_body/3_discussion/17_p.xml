<p>In this study, the nsp4 non-structural protein was amplified because it is the most conserved protein in alphaviruses and encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme is responsible for replicating viral RNA. The choice of this region was due to its high degree of conservation in all alphaviruses. With this chosen, the risk of losing positive samples with possible mutations of the virus in the junction zone of the primers was reduced. On the other hand, it is an area in which numerous previous studies of phylogeny have been carried out and for which the sequences of all the alphaviruses previously described are known. Although no experimental trials were conducted in this study to determine the biological function of the detected mutations, they may likely cause clinical complications in patients; therefore, this type of study would be essential to understand the biological and phylogenetic characteristics of this virus.</p>
