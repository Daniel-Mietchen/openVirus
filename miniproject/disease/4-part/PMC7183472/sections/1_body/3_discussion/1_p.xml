<p>The role of bats in the cycle of transmission of VEEV has not yet been established; in this study, for the first time in the world, evidence of the presence of VEEV-specific antigens in frugivorous batsâ€™ tissues is shown. A fragment of the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> nsP4 protein whose sequences were similar to that of VEEV was amplified. The sequence obtained from the sample registered with an access code to GenBank: MG820274 showed a 97.7% similarity with the sequence of the gene that codes for the precursor of the structural and non-structural protein of strain VEEV registered in GenBank with accession number KR260736.1 (strain COAN5506 equine isolate from Colombia). The obtained sequence had coverage of 100% and an E-value=1.03e-55, position 1 of the sequence is homologous to position 6335 of the sequence KR260736.1, and nucleotide 131 is homologous to position 6465.
