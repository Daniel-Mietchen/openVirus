<p>RNA extraction was performed with Trizol (Invitrogen™) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA synthesis was obtained with the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) (Invitrogen™) using random primers. The reverse transcription reaction was performed in a single cycle at 42°C using the M-MLV RT. A fragment of the nsP4 gene encoding the polymerase of the alphaviruses was amplified by RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-nested, using the primers Alpha1+, Alpha1− and Alpha2+, Alpha2− (Invitrogen™) proposed by Sánchez-Seco
