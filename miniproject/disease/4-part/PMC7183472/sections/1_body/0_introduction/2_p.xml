<p>On the other hand, strains of the VEEV epizootic cycle (Subtype I, varieties AB and C), which are responsible for the main outbreaks in humans and equines, use several species of mosquito vectors and equines, are the highly efficient amplification hosts [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The outbreaks have been registered for decades in countries with enzootic circulation. The implementation of surveillance systems has allowed the detection of additional human cases in countries and areas with previously unknown VEEV activity. The enzootic subtypes of VEEV are frequently detected and isolated in habitats where they circulate in rodent reservoirs and mosquitoes. The main reservoirs are rodents of wild species of

 <italic>Proechimys</italic>. These animals become infected and develop viremia that is sufficient to infect the vectors [

Clinically, VEEV is indistinguishable from dengue and other arboviral diseases, often humans infected with VEEV symptoms appear within 2-5 days, and range from febrile, or flu-like symptoms, such as malaise, fever, chills, and myalgia, to coma and death are registered in ~1% of cases [
