<p>The influenza A and B viruses possess two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is the major antigen, which elicits the production of neutralizing antibodies by the host after infection or vaccination. The accumulation of point mutations in the antigenic sites of HA enables viruses to evade host immune responses induced by prior infections or vaccinations, resulting in the emergence of new antigenic variants with epidemic potential.
