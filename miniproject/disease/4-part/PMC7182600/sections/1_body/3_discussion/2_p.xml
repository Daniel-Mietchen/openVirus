<p>Most of the B/Victoria‐lineage viruses that were detected worldwide during the eight influenza seasons that followed the 2009‐2010 season were antigenically closely related to the vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> In this study, during the 2017‐2018 and/or 2018‐2019 seasons in Japan, we detected B/Victoria‐lineage viruses with a deletion of two or three amino acids at positions 162 and 163 or 162‐164 in HA, respectively, which are antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain. Antigenic variants possessing the two‐amino‐acid deletion were isolated in the United States during the 2016‐2017 season,

 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Our antigenic analyses with post‐infection ferret sera showed that all tested B/Victoria‐lineage viruses with the three‐amino‐acid deletion were inhibited less well by the antiserum raised against B/Colorado/06/2017 than viruses that possess the two‐amino‐acid deletion (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12713-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>), consistent with the WHO report.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> These findings suggest that contemporary B/Victoria‐lineage viruses with the three‐amino‐acid deletion may be antigenically distinguishable from viruses with the two‐amino‐acid deletion. Importantly, an increasing proportion of a variant with the three‐amino‐acid deletion was reported in many countries during the 2018‐2019 season.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Therefore, continued monitoring for the prevalence of B/Victoria‐lineage viruses with the three‐amino‐acid deletion is important.
