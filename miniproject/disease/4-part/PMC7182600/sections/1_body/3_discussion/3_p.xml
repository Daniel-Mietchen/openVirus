<p>Influenza B viruses carrying the G407S mutation in their NA, which confers reduced susceptibility to NA inhibitors, were sporadically detected in Japan during the 2004‐2005 season

 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> In this study, we also detected an influenza B virus with the NA‐G407S mutation during the 2017‐2018 season in Japan (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12713-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This virus (B/Tokyo/UT‐AC032/2018) was isolated from a specimen collected from an adult patient (a 41‐year‐old female) prior to drug treatment. Although it is unclear whether the patient had contact with an influenza patient who was treated with NA inhibitors, it is possible that this variant may be transmissible from person to person. Further investigations are required to determine whether this NA‐G407S mutation affects the transmissibility of influenza B viruses.
