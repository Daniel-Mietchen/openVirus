<p>Real‐time PCR was performed to determine the lineage of the influenza B viruses in the clinical specimens. RNA was extracted from clinical specimens by using the simplyRNA Tissue Kit (Promega) or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Amplification and detection by real‐time PCR were performed with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real‐Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), the StepOnePlus Real‐Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), or the LightCycler 96 System (Roche). RT‐PCR was carried out using the QuantiTect multiplex RT‐PCR kit (Qiagen) or QuantiTect Probe RT‐PCR Kit (Qiagen). The probes were designed to target the HA genes of B/Yamagata‐ or B/Victoria‐lineage viruses. The probes contained oligonucleotides with the 6‐carboxyfluorescein (FAM) or the hexacholoro‐6‐carboxyfluorescein (HEX) reporter dye at the 5′ end and the Black Hole Quencher‐1 (BHQ‐1) or 6‐carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) quencher dye at the 3′ end. A list of the primers and probes used is provided in Table
