<p>MDCK, AX4, or hCK cells grown in 12‐well plates were inoculated with 0.1 mL per well of the clinical samples and incubated at 33°C for at least 30 minutes. One milliliter of MEM containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 µg/mL TPCK‐treated trypsin was then added to cells. The cultures were then incubated for up to 7 days, until cytopathic effects were evident. Cell culture supernatants were harvested, viral RNA was extracted and subjected to RT‐PCR, and the viral genes were sequenced (see below). Influenza B viruses were propagated in MDCK, AX4, or hCK cells in MEM containing 1 µg of L‐1‐Tosylamide
