<p>During the 2017‐2018 and 2018‐2019 seasons, a total of 554 respiratory specimens were collected from patients with an influenza‐like illness in Tokyo, Japan, and 108 were confirmed to be influenza B virus‐positive by real‐time RT‐PCR using lineage‐specific primers/probes. Of 97 influenza B virus‐positive samples collected during the 2017‐2018 season, 95 (97.9%) belonged to the B/Yamagata‐lineage and two (2.1%) to the B/Victoria‐lineage. These results are consistent with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) report that influenza B viruses of the B/Yamagata‐ and B/Victoria‐lineages co‐circulated in Japan during the winter season with the B/Yamagata‐lineage predominating.
 <xref rid="irv12713-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Of 11 influenza B virus‐positive samples collected during the 2018‐2019 season, two were of the B/Yamagata‐linage and nine were of the B/Victoria‐lineage. All 108 influenza B viruses were isolated from the clinical samples by inoculation to MDCK, AX4, or hCK cells. Of the 108 influenza B isolates, 68 (62 from the 2017‐2018 season and 6 from the 2018‐2019 season) were selected for further characterization.
