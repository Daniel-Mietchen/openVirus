<p id="Par39">Six CHIKV strains isolated from human cases were used in infection assays. Five strains belonged to the ECSA genotype: CHIKV_0621 (Accession number AM258992) and CHIKV_05115 (Accession number AM258990) isolated in La Réunion, CHIKV_1909 (Accession number FR846305) from Southeast France, CHIKV_DRC and CHIKV_Congo from Congo

 </sup>. All these ECSA strains were split into two different genotype groups according to the amino acid substitution at 226 position of E1 envelope protein: the group named ‘ECSA’ that contains the substitution E1-226A (Alanine) and the group named ‘ECSA E1-226V’ that contains a Valine at the same position. This mutation allows an increased transmission by more than 50-fold in
