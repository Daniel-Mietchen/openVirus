<p id="Par34">The Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method, as implemented in the software DIYABC v2.1, was used to disentangle the complex invasion patterns of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> at the macro-geographic level. This approach allows comparisons between competing hypotheses regarding the divergence of the populations on a global scale. DIYABC v2.1 implements a standard ABC method (ABC-LDA) which, although being more expensive computationally, was shown to perform comparably (for posterior probability) or slightly better (for prior error rate) than the more recent random forest method (ABC-RF)

Based on our published data, we considered the previously characterized samples from China, Thailand and Japan as representative populations from countries within the Southeast Asian native range.
