<p id="Par25">In conclusion, it is clear from these data that the demographic history of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations is tightly related to CHIKV genotypes in a sort of adaptive coevolution, where genotype-by-genotype interactions influenced the corresponding 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> vector competence phenotypes for this virus. It follows that the knowledge of the vector demographic history dynamics combined with vector competence data can provide an accurate risk map for CHIKV. However, in addition to these genetic interactions, we must consider that the spread of this mosquito occurred across different environmental conditions. Thus, the variation in competence between the eco-geographic populations may be impacted by the interactions between unexplored genomic factors
