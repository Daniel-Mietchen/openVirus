<p id="Par9">The South Atlantic states such as Florida and Virginia and the Midwestern state of Missouri are considered the first states to be invaded by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> according to historical records (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Thus, Manassas (VA) in Virginia, Vero Beach (VRB) in Florida and St Louis (TYS) in Missouri were considered as representative populations of these first invasions. After reconfirming that VA was derived from Japan (JP), the origin of Florida/VRB was determined. The most statistically supported scenario indicated that VRB in Florida was also a derivation of JP (analysis 2a, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). As for St Louis (TYS) in Missouri (analysis 2b), the strongest scenario supported its derivation from an admixture between JP and Florida (VRB) (66% and 34% respectively).
