 </sup>. We assessed whether the colonization of southern and northern parts of the island occurred independently as direct events from external South Asian source areas or via secondary internal derivation events (analyses 1a). The direct derivation of the northern PROV from the south-western RE was the most supported hypothesis. The STD population appeared to have a similar derivation. Manni and colleagues

 </sup> suggested that La Réunion/St Pierre (RE) contributed to the origin of the North Italian IT1 population (Cesena) through an admixture event with another North Italian population IT2, (previously derived from the North American Virginia (VA) population). On this basis, we tested whether La Réunion contributed also to the establishment of another Mediterranean population, Bar-sur-Loup (BL) in southern France. The hypothesis that La Réunion (PROV) in admixture events (74%) with the Italian IT1 (26%) contributed to the French Bar-sur-Loup population was strongly supported.
