<p id="Par15">Transmission efficiency (TE) for CHIKV was evaluated in 1159 mosquitoes of which 58.0% (672) could transmit the virus. CHIKV genotypes were significantly associated with TE, with ECSA E1-226V strains being more efficient (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002) and ECSA (E1-226A) at a lower degree, while no association with TE was detected according to dpi and blood meal titres (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Again, the 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry lineages displayed different TEs (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). In univariate analysis, as compared to populations with major 
 <italic>K</italic>3-ancestry, all other populations presented greater TEs. This remained true after adjusting for CHIKV genotype, as populations with major 
 <italic>K</italic>2-ancestry (La Réunion, PROV and the derived French BL) displayed the greatest TEs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). As for DE, another approach consisted in looking at the level of each six 
 <italic>K</italic>-ancestry when dichotomised. In univariate analysis, the levels of 
 <italic>K</italic>1, 
 <italic>K</italic>2 and 
 <italic>K</italic>3-ancestries were all significantly associated with TE (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). In multivariate analysis, a higher level of 
 <italic>K</italic>3-ancestry was associated with lower TE, whereas higher levels of 
 <italic>K</italic>2 were associated with a greater TE (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Both multivariate models showed a tendency for TE to reduce from 
 <italic>K</italic>2 to 
 <italic>K</italic>1 and finally 
 <italic>K</italic>3.
