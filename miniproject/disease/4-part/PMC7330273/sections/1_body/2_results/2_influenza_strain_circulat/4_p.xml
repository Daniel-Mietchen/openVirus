<p id="Par30">In contrast to the influenza transmission zones in the Northern Hemisphere, two distinct peaks of influenza activity were detected in Southern Africa (South Africa) and Southern Asia (India). In Southern Africa, a first peak, dominated by influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus, occurred between weeks 18 and 28 of 2017, and a second, dominated by influenza A/H3N2 virus, between weeks 30 and 42 of 2017. In Southern Asia, a first peak, dominated by influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus, occurred between week 41 of 2017 and week 1 of 2018 and a second, dominated by influenza A/H3N2 virus, between weeks 3 and 9 of 2018. No discernable peak of influenza circulation was detected in Eastern Africa (Kenya), although influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus dominated.</p>
