<p id="Par33">COPD was associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive admissions aged 50 to &lt; 65 years (OR, 2.94 [95% CI, 1.37–6.31]) and ≥ 65 years (1.69 [95% CI, 1.10–2.60]) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Prescription of antivirals during the current influenza episode was associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive admissions aged 15 to &lt; 50 years (OR, 7.73 [95% CI, 2.68–22.33]) and 50 to &lt; 65 years (OR, 2.78 [95% CI, 1.12–6.92]). Other factors associated with complicated hospitalization included diabetes in influenza-positive admissions aged 15 to &lt; 50 years (OR, 3.90 [95% CI, 1.18–12.92]); male sex (OR, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.27–5.44]) and hospitalization during the last 12 months (OR, 2.90 [95% CI, 1.38–6.06]) in influenza-positive admissions aged 50 to &lt; 65 years; and current smoking in influenza-positive admissions aged ≥65 years (OR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.23–3.87]). No factors were found to be associated with complicated hospitalization among influenza-positive patients aged &lt; 15 years. The frequency of complicated hospitalization did not differ between influenza A and B for any age group. The frequency of complicated hospitalization also did not differ between A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H3N2 for any age group (data not shown).
