<p id="Par36">Influenza A infections are often thought to result in more severe illness than influenza B infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The current study, however, did not find a difference between influenza A and B or between A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H3N2 in the risk for complicated hospitalization. It also did not find a consistent difference between influenza A and B in the risk for individual components of complicated hospitalization or in the length of hospital stay: influenza B was associated with shorter hospital stay in influenza-positive admissions 50 to &lt; 65 years of age but a higher risk for mechanical ventilation in those under 15 years of age. These findings support a systematic literature review concluding that clinical presentation and severity of influenza illness do not appear to differ between influenza strains [
