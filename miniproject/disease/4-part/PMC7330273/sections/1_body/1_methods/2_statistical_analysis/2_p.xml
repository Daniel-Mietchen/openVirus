<p id="Par19">Strain circulation was analyzed by site and grouped by World Health Organization transmission zone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The number of positive patients for each strain (A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, A subtype unknown, B/Yamagata, B/Victoria, and B lineage unknown) was calculated separately; therefore, patients could have been infected with more than one strain.
