<p id="Par20">Mixed effects logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with complicated hospitalization, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated by the Wald method. A linear mixed-effects regression model was used to identify factors associated with length of hospital stay (as a continuous variable), with 95% CIs calculated by profile-likelihood method. These analyses were conducted in four age strata (&lt; 15, 15–&lt; 50, 50–&lt; 65, and ≥65 years). For admissions aged ≥15 years, covariates included cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, obesity, other chronic conditions, sex, current smoking, influenza type (A vs B), antiviral prescription during the current episode, hospitalization during the previous 12 months, site (as random effect), influenza vaccination status, and age. For admissions aged &lt; 15 years, covariates included any chronic condition, sex, age, influenza type (A vs. B), antiviral prescription during the current episode, hospitalization during the previous 12 months, site (as random effect), influenza vaccination status, and age. Factors tested in the mixed effects logistic regression model were considered associated with complications if the 95% CI of the odds ratio (OR) did not cross 1. In the linear mixed-effects regression model, the coefficient indicated the change in length of hospital stay in days when the indicated factor was changed by one unit (i.e. from yes to no), and tested factors were considered associated with a longer hospital stay if the 95% CI of the coefficient did not cross 0.</p>
