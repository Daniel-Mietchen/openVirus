<p>Phylogenetic analysis of worldwide HEV sequences suggests that the point of origin for 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> lies in the western hemisphere from where it was transmitted to Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, while 
 <italic>HEV4</italic> is native to Asia. Additionally, 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> and 
 <italic>HEV4</italic> sequences from humans and animals were well conserved, suggesting a common persistent source or reservoir [
 <xref rid="B46-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It has been shown that 
 <italic>HEV4</italic> infections cause more severe human clinical outcomes, and this may have significant consequences for public health. Although most cases of autochthonous hepatitis E are caused by 
 <italic>HEV3</italic>, a study in France showed the presence of 
 <italic>HEV4</italic> was strongly correlated to swine HEV [
 <xref rid="B47-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It was initially thought that HEV is responsible for exceedingly few cases of hepatitis in the developed countries [
 <xref rid="B18-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In fact, researchers calculated the incidence of HEV infection at 0.7% in the USA [
 <xref rid="B48-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, a large number of symptomatic hepatitis E infection cases are “overlooked” as there are no currently available United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved diagnostic assays in humans [
 <xref rid="B49-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> and 
 <italic>HEV4</italic> are zoonotic, and transmission is food-borne from animals [
