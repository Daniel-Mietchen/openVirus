<p>Genotype 2 sequences of HEV (
 <italic>HEV2</italic>) are grouped into two subtypes, subtype 
 <italic>2a</italic> from Mexico and subtype 
 <italic>2b</italic> found mainly in several African countries such as Nigeria and Chad [
 <xref rid="B22-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The presence of 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> in the United States, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, and Mexico is well documented. Locally acquired infections in Europe and North America are mostly due to 
 <italic>HEV3,</italic> and it is the cause of most autochthonous infections [
 <xref rid="B36-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The subtypes 
 <italic>3a–3j</italic> are found in developed countries [
 <xref rid="B22-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Infected meats of game, swine, and boars are implicated in the zoonotic transmission of 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Swine is a potential animal reservoir of 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> and 
 <italic>HEV4</italic> with HEV prevalence of 7–15% in pigs, according to studies in the Netherlands and Belgium [
 <xref rid="B37-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A study carried out for the detection of HEV RNA in pork liver and meat products in Dutch markets has shown that liver, liverwurst, and liver pate had the highest level of 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> RNA [
 <xref rid="B39-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In Japan, pig liver has been implicated as an important risk factor because 90% of patients who consume inadequately cooked or grilled pig liver two to eight weeks before have an onset of hepatitis symptoms [
 <xref rid="B40-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In France, pig liver sausage displayed the presence of 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> RNA in 59% of the samples bought in supermarkets; significant genetic similarities were observed between these sequences and those isolated from patients who ate the sausages [
 <xref rid="B41-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, HEV RNA was found in swine sera, and swine anti-HEV antibodies were also found in around 81% of the Mexican pigs [
 <xref rid="B42-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In England, indigenous cases were due to 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> strains, which were distinctive and strongly linked to 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> strains from British pigs [
 <xref rid="B36-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another study in England showed HEV RNA detection in 3% of pig liver samples and 10% of sausage samples [
 <xref rid="B43-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the United States, among the pig samples collected from different slaughterhouses, 6.3% of the samples were viremic for HEV RNA, with less than 100 to 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mL range of viral loads [
 <xref rid="B44-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In Korea, HEV RNA was extracted from human sera gathered from various regions, and it was found to be closely related to three Korean swine isolates, with 92.9–99.2% nucleotide sequence homology [
