<p>A study in France estimated HEV seroprevalence in kidney transplant recipients to be 14.5% [
 <xref rid="B17-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar studies from different parts showed prevalences of 30.8% (Iran) [
 <xref rid="B102-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] and 20.5% (India) [
 <xref rid="B103-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Researchers believe that the HEV prevalence rate in transplant recipients is not dependent on its prevalence in the general population [
 <xref rid="B102-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Interestingly, the sera from 205 renal transplant recipients from India, known to be hyperendemic to HEV, tested negative for HEV RNA. Though 20.5% patients did show anti-HEV IgG and 22.4% showed abnormal ALT levels, not a single case of HEV RNA was detected [
 <xref rid="B103-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Previous studies from India have highlighted considerably high rates of HEV infection, as evidenced by reports of seroprevalence [
 <xref rid="B24-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It can thus be reasoned that if 
 <italic>HEV1</italic> infection persists among immunosuppressed persons, at least a few patients with renal transplants would have detectable HEV RNA. Furthermore, the absence of detectable HEV RNA in sera from a large unselected group indicates that risk of chronicity with 
 <italic>HEV1</italic> infection among the immunosuppressed may be low.
