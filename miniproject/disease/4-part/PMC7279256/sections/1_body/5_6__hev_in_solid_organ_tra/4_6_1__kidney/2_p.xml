<p>HEV infection is reported to cause chronic hepatitis in 14.1% of solid organ transplant recipients in France [
 <xref rid="B104-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> was the predominantly genotype reported in HEV infection in HEV-infected solid-organ transplant recipients in France [
 <xref rid="B105-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], Portugal [
 <xref rid="B106-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], and Germany [
 <xref rid="B107-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> is not prevalent in South Africa, a case of 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> infection in a renal transplant recipient was reported [
 <xref rid="B108-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the risk of chronicity with 
 <italic>HEV3</italic> infection among immunosuppressed individuals will be high.
