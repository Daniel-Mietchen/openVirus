<p>Industrialized countries have an HEV seroprevalences of 0.3â€“53% but these differences can be in part be attributed to detection assays dissimilarities [
 <xref rid="B70-medicina-56-00206" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Comparisons between studies face a fundamental challenge due to differences in the investigated populations and in the accuracy of the detection assays. Researchers in the United Kingdom found that two commercial assays showed dramatically different results of 3.6% and 16.2% while estimating the anti-HEV seroprevalence from 500 blood donors; it is believed that HEV prevalences lower than 5% in developed countries are typically obtained by the use of insensitive assays [
