<p>Several studies have shown possible associations of parenteral route of HEV infection in patients with chronic hemodialysis (CHD). It is has been shown that patients undergoing CHD are at higher risk for contracting parenterally transmitted microorganisms [

CHD patients showed a higher incidence of HEV infection, further corroborating evidence towards a blood-borne spread of the infection; hence, the probability of HEV transmission through the parenteral path in endemic areas was suggested [
