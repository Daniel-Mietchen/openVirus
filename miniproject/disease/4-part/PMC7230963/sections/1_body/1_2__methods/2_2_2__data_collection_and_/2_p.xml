<p>Acute respiratory failure was defined as arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>) &lt;60 mmHg in ambient air, or tachypnea &gt;30/min. ARDS was defined as acute respiratory distress characterized by bilateral pulmonary consolidation and severe hypoxemia (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>/Fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt;300 mmHg) in the absence of evidence for cardiogenic pulmonary edema [

Acute kidney injury was defined as a rapid increase in the serum creatinine level to &gt;44.2 µmol/L compared with that at presentation. Rhabdomyolysis was defined as a five-fold increase in the serum concentrations of creatine phosphokinase above the upper limit of the normal range (reference value, 0.2–2.2 µkat/L), with &gt;95% creatine phosphokinase-muscle fraction. Meningoencephalitis was defined as an altered mental status, fulfilling at least 2 of the following criteria: (1) fever, (2) seizure, (3) focal neurologic signs, (4) abnormality of cerebrospinal fluid, (5) neuroimaging suggestive of encephalitis, and (6) abnormal findings on electroencephalography consistent with encephalitis [
