<p>Our series here showed gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in one-third of included patients and more than half of them with fatal outcome. Stress ulcer prophylaxis for critically ill patients is not universally practiced in our series. The causes of gastrointestinal bleeding in these patients are multifactorial. Our study underlines that clinicians should be alert to possible gastrointestinal bleeding when caring for a critically ill influenza patient because this complication potentially leads to death if it is not recognized early and treated accordingly.</p>
