<p>This study has several potential limitations. First, given the retrospective nature of the study, information on vaccination status, including pneumococcus and influenza, and some missing laboratory data such as pneumonia severity index and coagulation profile, were not collected. Second, the study population comprised adult patients; therefore, the results cannot be generalized to pediatric patients. However, the strengths of this study include a detailed description of clinical and laboratory information at presentation and the entire hospitalization course of critically ill patients with influenza. We highlighted the key factors associated with poor outcomes for critically ill influenza patients and established a decision-making algorithm that can take advantage of simple clinical and laboratory evaluations. </p>
