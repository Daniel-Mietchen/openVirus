 <xref rid="jcm-09-01073-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the in-hospital complications of the patients during the entire clinical course. The five common complications were respiratory failure (97%), pneumonia (94.1%), acute kidney injury (65.7%), ARDS (51%), and gastrointestinal bleeding (35.3%). Of 59 patients with data available, the median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 6 (range, 2–16). All of the 102 patients were required to be mechanically ventilated, and among them, 90 (88.2%) were ventilated invasively and 12 (11.7%) noninvasively. The median time from illness onset to acute respiratory failure was four days (range, 1–27). Inotropes or vasopressors were used in 44 (43.1%) patients. Ninety-eight (96.1%) patients were admitted to the ICU. Four patients did not admit to ICU; of these, three patients died before ICU admission and the other one improved tachypnea after managed by noninvasive ventilation.
