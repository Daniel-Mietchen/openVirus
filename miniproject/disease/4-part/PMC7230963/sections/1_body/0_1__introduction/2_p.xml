<p>Severe complicated influenza has a significantly high mortality and morbidity [

 <xref rid="B16-jcm-09-01073" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the majority of patients tend to delay seeking medical care and timely diagnosis, leading to the subsequent development of influenza-associated complications, particularly in the elderly and those with comorbid illnesses. Hence, key clinical data are crucial pieces of information that can help clinicians deliver the necessary management to critically ill influenza patients in a timely manner. In the present study, we reviewed the entire clinical course and laboratory data of critically ill patients with influenza and then explored the risk factors independently associated with death as well as constructed a valuable event associated algorithm to help in the assessment of risk of death.
