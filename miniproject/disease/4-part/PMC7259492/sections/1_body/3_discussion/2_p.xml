<p>The reported results of vector competence studies of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> after oral challenge with a Zika virus-infectious blood meals have yielded mixed results regarding the magnitude of competency. Roundy 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) found that Cambodian and Mexican strains of Zika virus were less infectious in mosquitoes than a Senegalese strain [

 <italic>et al</italic>. (2018) found there is a significant correlation between viral titer of the blood-meal and temperature as well as EIP [
