<p id="Par31">The three combined high-risk exposure groups in Ibanda and Kamwenge district in Western Uganda had higher filovirus positivity at 3.7% (16/433) compared to low-risk exposure group in Central Uganda at 1.1% (3/291). Specifically, artisanal gold miners who enter bat-inhabited caves had a higher seroprevalence of 5.6% (9/161) compared to non-miners in central Uganda at 1% (3/291) and had 5.4 times the risk of being seropositive for filoviruses compared to the unexposed group in central Uganda (RR = 5.4, 95% CI 1.5–19.7). Miner family/household members and non-miners living within 50 km of the mines were not significantly more likely to be filovirus seropositive than the non-exposed participants in Luweero district (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Also, miners and miner family/household members were not more likely to be filovirus seropositive when compared to non-miners living within 50 km of the mines (Table
