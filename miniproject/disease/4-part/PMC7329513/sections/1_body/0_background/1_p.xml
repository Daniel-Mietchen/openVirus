<p id="Par23">Viruses in the genera 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> belong to the family 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic> and cause classical viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in humans, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality and pose a serious threat to human and animal populations in endemic countries. Uganda reported 11 filovirus outbreaks from 2000 to 2019. These include seven EVD outbreaks caused by Sudan virus (6 outbreaks) and Bundibugyo virus (one outbreak) and four Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreaks caused by Marburg virus and Ravn virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Ibanda and neighbouring Kamwenge districts of western Uganda, there were two documented outbreaks of MVD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] including one in which cases were gold miners in Kitaka cave [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Previous studies of bats sampled from Kitaka and python caves have shown 
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> bats to be the known reservoir for Marburg virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In 2012, the MVD outbreak investigations in Ibanda district traced the outbreak’s origin to villages near Kitaka mines where artisanal gold mining is practised [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We designed an investigation to better understand the possible link between artisanal gold mining activities in Kitaka and the transmission of Marburg virus and ebolaviruses in Ibanda and Kamwenge districts. We compared these communities with those in Luweero district where there are no mining operations or bat-inhabited caves, no previously identified human cases of MVD, and there is a different ecological zone. Although there have been outbreaks of EVD in Luweero in 2010 and 2012, investigations did not reveal any potential sources of spillovers in the Luweero area in terms of bat-inhabited caves and forested areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and we hypothesise that these cases could have been imported from other hotspots in Uganda.
