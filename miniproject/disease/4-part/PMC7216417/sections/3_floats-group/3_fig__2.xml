  <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) antibody seroprevalence in the survey districts, Dak Lak Province, Central Vietnam. Zika virus seroprevalence was determined by testing serum samples of residents for ZIKV anti-NS1 IgG antibodies by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The dark gray shading indicates villages (local administrative units) in which anti-ZIKV antibodies were found in one or more residents. The light gray shading indicates villages in which all study participants tested negative for ZIKV antibodies. N indicates the number of residents who were tested for ZIKV antibodies, and percentage of confirmed cases were indicated in brackets. Star (â˜…) indicates Cu Pong commune, in which a ZIKV-associated microencephaly case has been detected in 2016. Image was created by using QGIS 3.8.2 and shapefile was obtained from
