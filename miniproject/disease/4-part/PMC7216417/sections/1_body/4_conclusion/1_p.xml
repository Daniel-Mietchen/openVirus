<p id="Par35">This study confirms ZIKV infection in the Central Highlands of Vietnam and suggests that ZIKV has been present in the province since at least 2016. The prevalence of ZIKV-specific antibodies was 1.1% at the start of the study period, suggesting a limited outbreak within the area. Economic factors including migrant workers may play a role in introducing emerging pathogens such as ZIKV to rural areas. While DENV seroprevalence remains high in the region, the overall low ZIKV seroprevalence indicate limited Zika disease protection in the population. Further studies of seroprevalence in the general population and continuous surveillance are needed to better understand the extent of the outbreak in the general population and to define the potential risk of ZIKV transmission in the region.</p>
