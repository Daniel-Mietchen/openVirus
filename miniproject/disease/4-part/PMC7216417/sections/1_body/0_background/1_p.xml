 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which is spread from person to person mainly through the bite of infected

 <italic>.</italic> ZIKV can also be transmitted through sexual intercourse or body fluids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Common symptoms are rash, fever, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis [
