<p id="Par17">The samples were screened for ZIKV IgM using an in-house ZIKV IgM ELISA kit. This method was adapted from Dengue Virus IgM Capture DxSelect (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] by replacing DENV antigen with ZIKV antigen. The modified in-house ZIKV IgM ELISA has been utilized in other studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Samples were first diluted 1:100 using sample diluent solution. The 96-well IgM Capture plate (Dengue Virus IgM Capture DxSelect, Focus Diagnostics) were soaked with 1X wash buffer solution for 5 min, and wells were decanted. A total of 100 μL of diluted serum sample was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were then washed 3 times with 1X wash buffer solution. Next, 100 μL of ZIKV antigen (MR-766, 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL) was added and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. The wells were then washed with 1X wash buffer solution for a total of 3 times to remove excess antigen. Next, 100 μL of affinity-purified and peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-flavivirus antibodies was added to all wells and the plate was incubated at RT for 30 min. The plates were washed 3 times to remove residual conjugate. Next, 100 μL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution and horseradish peroxide was added to each well and the plate was then incubated at RT for 10 mins in the dark. A total of 100 μL of stop solution (1 M sulfuric acid) was added to each well to stop the reaction. Finally, the plates were read at 450 nm of the optical density (OD) using an ELISA plate reader (Multiscan ELISA reader, Thermolab System, Tokyo, Japan). OD values which were ≥ 2 times that of the negative control (N) is regarded as positive (P).
