<p>Improving health knowledge and ultimately, public uptake of preventive measures like vaccination remain among the most significant public health challenges in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century. In developed countries like Singapore, issues of access to preventive healthcare like the influenza vaccine are minorâ€”older adults can easily obtain and afford the influenza vaccine. What remains is a deficiency of public awareness, adequate knowledge, motivation, and execution in proactive health behaviors including taking the seasonal influenza vaccine. Reinvigorated efforts of targeted health communication can bridge this gap and move us forward in protecting our older communities from disease.
