 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Many countries focus vaccine efforts in preparation for a specific “flu season” but in Singapore viral circulation occurs throughout the year with most cases falling between April to July and November to January, respectively. More than 2,800 daily cases of acute respiratory infections were reported to medical centers island wide in January 2017 and 2018 [

More recent figures from the 2013 National Health Surveillance Survey also revealed that influenza vaccination coverage among Singaporeans aged 50 and above ranged from 14% to 20% [
