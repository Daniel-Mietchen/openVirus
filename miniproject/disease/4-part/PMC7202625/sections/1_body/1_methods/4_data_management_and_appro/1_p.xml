<p>In order to facilitate data analysis across this large set of interviews we followed the data management and analytic approach used by Halcomb and Davidson [
 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this approach, following the completion of each interview, the researchers reflected on their field notes expanding on their initial impressions and documented the major concepts and issues raised by the participants into summarizing field notes using Microsoft Word in order to avoid difficulties inherent to relying solely on audio recording transcriptions [

 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interviewers were trained to reflect upon the interviews and provided insights on participantsâ€™ health misperceptions, personal background, health information seeking, vaccine information access, influenza perceptions, vaccination intentions, vaccine perceptions, social norms, nonverbal behaviors, and any other issues or outcomes from the interview. During this post-interview reflection, the researchers turned back to the audio recording as needed to amend and revise their observations. They also identified and transcribed any direct illustrative quotes from the participants and included them in their field notes while using the raw audio files to corroborate and identify any discrepancies. This approach has been noted to help minimize interviewer bias and improve cross-case comparisons following the documentation of findings [
