<p>Concepts were developed mainly with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> coding that reflects the “vernacularity” of responses [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> approach typifies and labels concepts with the verbiage used by participants. This coding process differs from other coding practices such that it uniquely captures participants’ choice of language and nuanced meanings [
 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and is particularly relevant to the Singapore context of this study where hybridized dialects have culminated into a version of English known colloquially as “Singlish” that is mixing words from other languages. In our study, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> codes provided an understanding of how our participants perceived influenza and vaccination (e.g., “influenza comes from wearing wet clothes” and “influenza vaccine kills the good cells in body”). Subcodes were also identified for some primary-cycle codes to furnish more details (e.g., subcodes for “influenza vaccine can cause side effects” listed examples of vaccine side-effects identified by participants). We involved comparisons of codes first within interviews and subsequently between interviews in order to ensure that all relevant themes were exhaustively catalogued and clustered.
