 <italic>Misperceptions about influenza vaccine risks</italic>. Apart from safety concerns over vaccine content, participants reported misperceptions that the influenza vaccine (a) weakens the body’s immune system, and (b) causes the disease: 
 <italic>“People don’t have the sickness and then get vaccinated and then they get the sickness</italic>. 
 <italic>Some of them who got vaccinated got the illness through the vaccination”</italic> (Male, interview 5). These perceptions were commonly drawn from second-hand experiences where participants noted hearing about side effects from other vaccine users. One participant was also apprehensive about taking the seasonal influenza vaccine as it is newly formulated each year. As one participant noted, “
 <italic>I’m not comfortable with that kind</italic>, 
 <italic>keep on testing and testing</italic>, 
 <italic>they also didn’t have enough long-time research… too new</italic>” (Male, interview 74).
