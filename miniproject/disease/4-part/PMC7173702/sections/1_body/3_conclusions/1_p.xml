<p>Here, we have developed a multivalent nanoparticle approach to investigate the affinity of sialic acid isomers against a panel of influenza A HAs to map their affinity. This allows for the probing of specificity and affinity trends while benefitting from signal amplification due to particle size. The multivalent nanoparticles were synthesized using polymeric ligands bearing a glycan capture (pentafluorophenyl ester) and a gold immobilization (thiol) termini. Initial screening of a library of 27 nanoparticles, varying in ligand length and core diameter, enabled identification of the optimum multivalent probe, using a model lectin and complementary UVâ€“vis, DLS, and BLI analysis. 2,3- and 2,6-sialyllactosamine were conjugated to these particles

As expected, 2,3-sialyllactosamine had strong affinity toward avian strains and 2,6-sialyllactosamine against mammalian. However, the analysis also revealed that in multivalent format, there was significant crossover in affinities. All avian influenzas showed affinity toward the multivalent 2,6-sialyllactosamine particles suggesting the potential for crossover due to multivalency. It is important to note that this study does not predict zoonosis potential, but rather highlights that multivalent nanoparticle presentation affects the affinity/selectivity trends compared to monovalent compounds. The identification of off-specific binding profiles is crucial to help develop nanomaterials for biosensing and monitoring of emerging infectious diseases.
