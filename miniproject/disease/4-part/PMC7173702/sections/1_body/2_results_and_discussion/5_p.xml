<p>Guided by the above data, using galactose functional nanoparticles, the primary aim of studying multivalent sialic acid particles could be investigated on the optimized scaffold. 1-Deoxy, 1-amino, 2,3- and 2,6-sialyllactose were synthesized by the single-step Kochetkov amination method

 </xref>A, with the amination confirmed by mass spectrometry). Using the same procedure as GalNH
 <sub>2</sub>, the sialyllactosamines (SLs) were conjugated to DP25 PHEA and subsequently used to coat 70 nm AuNPs. This single polymer/particle combination was chosen based on the above screening (
