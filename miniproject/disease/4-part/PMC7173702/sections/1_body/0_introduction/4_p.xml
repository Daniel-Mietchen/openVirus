<p>Gibson and co-workers have previously developed multivalent gold/polymer hybrids to dissect glycan binding interactions.

 </sup> Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was used to produce telechelic polymers that have a gold immobilization site at one end (masked thiol) and a glycan installation site (an amine reactive pentafluorophenyl group) at the other end. The polymer linker was found to be important, ensuring a stable formulation and fast response readout.

 </sup> The use of gold nanoparticle cores, exploiting their unique aggregation-induced red-blue color shift, provides label-free readouts. This has been used for the discrimination of human (H3N2) and avian (H5N1) influenza using PEGylated gold particles presenting trivalent α2,6 sialic acid ligands.

 </sup> Fairbanks and co-workers investigated the interaction of HAs and whole viruses with gold nanoparticles decorated with biantennary sialyloligosaccharides (α2,6 linked) extracted from egg yolk. Selectivity was observed between two H1N1 strains, A/New Caledonia/20/1999 and A/Puerto Rico/8/34, which have specificity toward α2,6 sialic acid and α2,3 sialic acid, respectively.

 </sup> De Geest and co-workers immobilized α2,6 sialic acid pendant glycopolymers on AuNPs and observed an interaction with inactivated H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) viruses as determined by DLS; however, the selectivity compared with other strains was not investigated.

 </sup> Furthermore, Papp 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed the importance of gold core size on the efficiency of virus inhibitions with 14 nm particles having higher binding affinity than 2 nm particles.

 </sup> The gold particle size enables the generation of large signal responses as well as multivalency; therefore, it is essential to optimize the core size, linker, and glycan.

 </sup> Lipid bilayers and dendrimer scaffolds have also been employed to probe or inhibit hemagglutinin binding.
