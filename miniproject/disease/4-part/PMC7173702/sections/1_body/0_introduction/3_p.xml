<p>Whitesides and co-workers synthesized sialic acid containing glycopolymeric inhibitors of influenza virus X-31 
 <italic>via</italic> a poly(
 <italic>N</italic>-acrylyloxy succinimide) reactive scaffold. Using hemagglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the inhibitory activity of these polymers were found to be between 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>6</sup> times greater than the free glycan.

 </sup> However, the effect of the linkage was not examined. Miura and co-workers synthesized 2,3- and 2,6-sialyllactose-functional glycopolymers that were able to recognize two different influenza strains. They found that 2,6-sialyllactose-functional glycopolymers inhibited hemagglutination caused by H3N2 (A/Aichi/2/68) but not H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34); conversely, 2,3-sialyllactose-functional glycopolymers inhibited aggregation caused by the H1N1 strain but not the H3N2.

 </sup> The density and polymer length were found to affect the interaction with the virus. Trivalent presentation of 2,3 sialic acids was sufficient to give &gt;400 fold increase in inhibitory activity against H3 influenzas.

 </sup> Godula and co-workers developed a microarray platform for the evaluation of virus binding based on 2,6- and 2,3-sialyllactose glycopolymers, which showed discrimination between different strains, with H3N2 (A/Aichi/2/68) binding exclusively to 2,6-siallylactose glycopolymers, whereas H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) bound to both 2,3- and 2,6-sialyllactose polymers.

 </sup> In addition to the nature of the sialic acid, the 3-D presentation is a crucial determinant with bivalent ligands showing wide affinity trends based only on separation,

 </sup> for example, H3N2 strains have evolved specificity related to the length of the sialosides linker.

 </sup> Furthermore, linear sialic acid polymers were found to be more potent inhibitors than dendritic.
