<p>A stock solution of lectin was made (0.1 mg·mL
 <sup>–1</sup> for SBA and 1 mg·mL
 <sup>–1</sup> for WGA) in 10 mM HEPES buffer with 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 0.01 mM MnCl
 <sub>2</sub>. A serial dilution (25 μL) was made up in the same buffer in a clear, flat bottom, half area 96-well microtiter plate. GlycoAuNPs (250 μL) were added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After 30 min, an absorbance spectrum was recorded from 450 to 700 nm with 10 nm intervals.
