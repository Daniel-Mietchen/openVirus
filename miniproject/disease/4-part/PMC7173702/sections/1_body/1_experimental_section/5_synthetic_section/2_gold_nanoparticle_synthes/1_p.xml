 </sup> A solution of 2.2 mM sodium citrate in Milli-Q water (150 mL) was heated under reflux for 15 min under vigorous stirring. After boiling had commenced, 1 mL of HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub> (25 mM) was injected. The color of the solution changed from yellow to bluish gray and then to soft pink in 10 min. Immediately after the synthesis of the Au seeds and in the same reaction vessel, the reaction was cooled until the temperature of the solution reached 90 °C. Then, 1 mL of HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub> solution (25 mM) was injected. After 30 min, the reaction was finished. This process was repeated twice. After that, the sample was diluted by extracting 55 mL of the sample and adding 53 mL of MilliQ water and 2 mL of 60 mM sodium citrate. This solution was then used as a seed solution, and the process was repeated a further 7 times. Generations 2, 5, and 8 were used for this study (
