<p>Figure

 <math id="nlm-math-39">
  <mi>ρ</mi>
 </math>) shows that the index P is highly and positively correlated with dengue notifications across several Brazilian cities (for more cities see Figure S5 in S1 Text). Interestingly, the correlations of the index with data are lower for São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro–the two most southern cities and the ones within areas estimated to have lower yearly index P (blue colours, Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). It is possible that in such regions, other demographic and/or entomological factors not considered in the estimation of the index P may become more relevant, or that stochastic effects are stronger in effective transmission. In general, these results are similar to results we have previously obtained for Myanmar at the country and city levels (Perez‐Guzman et al.,
