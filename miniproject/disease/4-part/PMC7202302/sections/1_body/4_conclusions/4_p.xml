<p>With its aforementioned mathematical simplicity, dependency on only two climatic variables at any possible time‐scale (hours, days, weeks, months) and freely available R‐package MVSE, we foresee the potential of the index P not only for direct research purposes, but also for education (e.g. epidemiological courses on arboviruses) and field ento‐epidemiology (e.g. for entomologists and epidemiologists collecting real‐time data). New ideas and methodological updates will be implemented in future versions of MVSE as the user base will keep growing and our own research projects on mosquito‐borne viruses’ progress. Any future updates to the R‐package will be made available in the package's online repository (see
