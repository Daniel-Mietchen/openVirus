<p>In this article, we translate our experience with this modelling framework and index P into a novel R‐package named the 
 <bold>M</bold>osquito‐borne 
 <bold>V</bold>iral 
 <bold>S</bold>uitability 
 <bold>E</bold>stimator (MVSE). The main goals of MVSE are to serve as a free software tool for estimation of transmission potential, while sparing the user from the mathematical complexity of epidemiological models, free of the need for incidence time series and independent of variables and data sources that are difficult to access. We describe in detail the theoretical and empirical rationales behind the index P as well as MVSE's functionalities using real‐world examples spanning multiple epidemiological contexts.
