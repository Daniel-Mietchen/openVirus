<p>Finally, we note that contrary to other suitability measures such as AaS (Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), the index P cannot assess the likelihood of the presence or absence of a mosquito species. This is because P ignores the number of adult female mosquitoes per human (M). In fact, the index P can have a non‐zero value for a region in which a mosquito of interest is not present. In this case, the index P can be interpreted as the natural potential of a single female mosquito to transmit a particular virus once introduced into the region. One potential line for future research is to integrate the index P with mosquito suitability measures such as AaS to assess the likelihood of both the presence of the mosquito and its capacity for transmission of a particular virus in the presence of a specific host.
