PB1-F2 protein is a critical virulence factor that suppresses early type I interferon response, but the mechanism of its action in relation to high pathogenicity is not well understood. Here we show that PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus is a particularly potent suppressor of antiviral signaling through formation of protein aggregates on mitochondria and inhibition of TRIM31-MAVS interaction, leading to prevention of K63-polyubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS. Unaggregated MAVS accumulated on fragmented mitochondria is prone to degradation by both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. These properties are proprietary to PB1-F2 of H7N9 virus but not shared by its counterpart in WSN virus. A recombinant virus deficient of PB1-F2 of H7N9 induces more interferon &#x003b2; in infected cells. Our findings reveal a subtype-specific mechanism for destabilization of MAVS and suppression of interferon response by PB1-F2 of H7N9 virus.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Exactly why avian influenza A (H5N1) and (H7N9) viruses cause severe diseases in humans remains unclear. PB1-F2 protein encoded by influenza A virus is one virulence factor that might make a difference. In this study we show that PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus is particularly strong in the suppression of host antiviral defense. This was achieved by inhibiting a key protein in cell signaling named MAVS. PB1-F2 directs MAVS for degradation and prevents MAVS from forming protein aggregates required for full activation. A recombinant virus in which PB1-F2 of H7N9 has been deleted can activate host antiviral response robustly. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which PB1-F2 protein of H7N9 virus prevents MAVS aggregation and promotes MAVS degradation, leading to the suppression of host antiviral defense.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15140662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2778-3530</contrib-id><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Dong-Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HKM-15-M01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2778-3530</contrib-id><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Dong-Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19180812</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3682-7571</contrib-id><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Pak-Hin Hinson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19181002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6876-0864</contrib-id><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Chi-Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Hong Kong Health and Medical Research Fund (15140662, HKM-15-M01, 19180812 and 19181002).

In 1997, human infection with H5N1 virus in Hong Kong caused 6 deaths out of 18 infected individuals presented with viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since then, H5N1 has become a global epidemic with a case mortality of 55%, although the transmission route is restricted to avian-to-human contact [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2013, another novel avian subtype H7N9 emerged in humans in mainland China, presented with similar severe disease with 40% case mortality [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At least four later H7N9 epidemics following the first wave in 2013 were recorded in mainland China from 2014 to 2017 with expanded geographical distribution and genetic diversity [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although no evidence supports human-to-human transmission [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], studies using ferret model suggested H7N9 transmissibility between ferrets through respiratory droplets [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is alarming and the pandemic potential of H7N9 and similar avian viruses in humans should not be underestimated. It remains elusive as to why H5N1 and H7N9 viruses are highly pathogenic in humans, but a robust innate immune response including a cytokine storm [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in which proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1; are induced to very high levels for a long period of time [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], is thought to play an important role. Understanding the virulence factors of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses and how they dysregulate innate immunity might hold the key to the development of specific and effective therapeutics.</p><p>A small non-structural protein named PB1-F2 is one of the virulence factors of influenza A virus [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is expressed from the largest +1 open reading frame of the PB1 segment of the viral genome, with a full length of 90 amino acids, but truncations and high sequence variability in this region have been found [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PB1-F2 was initially identified as a mitochondrial protein that induces apoptosis of immune cells [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. PB1-F2 deficiency results in attenuation of the virus in mammals, but host species- and virus subtype-specific effects of the loss of PB1-F2 have also been described [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PB1-F2 is also known to interact and compete with HAX-1, an inhibitor of PA subunit of influenza A virus RNA polymerase [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More importantly, PB1-F2 suppresses innate immunity and this suppression correlates with viral pathogenicity. PB1-F2 with an S66 residue has been found to be more pathogenic in mouse model than its mild counterpart with an N66 [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mechanistically, S66 version of PB1-F2 suppresses RIG-I-MAVS signaling and early type I interferon (IFN) production [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] through dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m) and sequestration of MAVS adaptor protein [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. More recently, PB1-F2 protein with an S66 pathogenic marker of the H1N1 subtype of the 1918 pandemic, which is also known to be highly pathogenic and probably derived from an avian virus, was found to specifically suppress TBK1-mediated type I IFN production by co-degradation with DDX3X [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. H5N1 and H7N9 are highly pathogenic viruses that express full-length PB1-F2 without the S66 pathogenic marker [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since PB1-F2 sequences are known to be under a strong selection pressure [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], PB1-F2 proteins might have evolved to confer new features to enhance the pathogenicity of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. This small protein can make a big difference as in the 1918 pandemic strain [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Whether and how type I IFN antagonism of PB1-F2 might contribute to high pathogenicity of H5N1 and H7N9 remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of H7N9 PB1-F2 on innate IFN production. H7N9 PB1-F2 was found to form extensive protein aggregates on mitochondria to perturb innate immune signal propagation through MAVS. Generally consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], H5N1 PB1-F2, but not WSN PB1-F2, had similar aggregation propensity. H7N9 PB1-F2 exerted an inhibitory effect on MAVS aggregation by preventing TRIM31 ubiquitin ligase from interacting with MAVS and thus reducing K63-polyubiquitination of MAVS. This accelerated proteasomal and lysosomal degradation of MAVS leading to inhibition of host antiviral response against H7N9 virus. This virus subtype-specific suppression of MAVS aggregation and type I IFN production by H7N9 PB1-F2 has implications in H7N9 pathogenesis and disease intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Unique features of H7N9 PB1-F2 protein</title><p>H7N9 and H5N1 viruses are known to be more virulent than human influenza viruses including the WSN laboratory strain [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

In keeping with this, when it was expressed in mammalian HEK293T cells, Flag-tagged PB1-F2 (PB1-F2-Flag) of WSN strain was barely detected but its steady-state level was much increased upon treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, upper panel, lane 2 vs 1).

To explore whether H7N9 PB1-F2 might form similar conformation seen in WSN PB1-F2, the PASTA 2.0 program was used to predict cross-&#x003b2; sheet structure of PB1-F2 sequences [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

To check for this possibility, SDD-AGE and protein solubility assays were performed to compare the aggregation propensity of PB1-F2 proteins from WSN, H5N1 and H7N9. SDD-AGE is a non-denaturing method to identify high-molecular-mass protein complex such as prion or amyloid aggregates [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Generally consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, WSN PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2 were much stabilized by MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 2 and 6).

WSN PB1-F2 remained to be low-molecular-mass species with and without MG132 treatment on the SDD-AGE blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Notably, high-molecular-mass species of H7N9 PB1-F2 appeared on the SDD-AGE blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8). Although H5N1 PB1-F2 was less abundant than H7N9 PB1-F2, high-molecular-mass species of H5N1 PB1-F2 were also seen upon MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lane 6). In contrast, high-molecular-mass species of H7N9 PB1-F2 were visible in the absence of MG132 and the potentiating effect of MG132 on them was less evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 4 and 8). These results were consistent with the prediction that PB1-F2 of H5N1 and H7N9 had higher aggregation propensity than the counterpart in WSN. To verify this, protein solubility assay was performed in RIPA lysis buffer with 0.1% SDS to assess the aggregation propensity of PB1-F2 proteins. Whereas WSN PB1-F2 was highly soluble in RIPA lysis buffer no matter cells were treated with MG132 or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), H7N9 PB1-F2 was sufficiently insoluble (lanes 5 and 6).

Notably, the fluorescent intensity of this dye is proportional to &#x00394;&#x003a8;m [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A significant reduction of MitoTracker staining was only observed when PR8 PB1-F2 was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Mitotracker staining remained unchanged in cells expressing PB1-F2 of any of the other three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To confirm this result, JC-1 dye, which can distinguish polarized mitochondria by a high red-to-green emission ratio [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], was used to measure &#x00394;&#x003a8;m of PB1-F2-expressing cells. We found that the red-to-green ratio of JC-1 was reduced only when cells were treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, or when PR8 PB1-F2 was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, bars 2 and 3 vs 1). Expression of PB1-F2 from WSN, H5N1 and H7N9 did not affect JC-1 dye staining. In addition, we observed that H7N9 PB1-F2 was concentrated to mitochondrial clusters as indicated by arrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

To shed light on the mechanism of action of PB1-F2, IFN&#x003b2; promoter was activated by three downstream effector proteins of RIG-I signaling, namely MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) and a constitutively active form of IRF3 known as IRF3-5D [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). All three PB1-F2 proteins suppressed the activity of MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, bars 3&#x02013;5) but had no influence on TBK1 or IRF3-5D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>), consistent with an action point upstream of TBK1. The suppressive activity of H7N9 PB1-F2 on MAVS was most prominent followed by that of H5N1 PB1-F2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, bars 4 and 5 vs 2). The effect of WSN PB1-F2 was milder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, bar 3 vs 2). A similar suppressive pattern on MAVS activity was also observed when luciferase reporter expression was driven by other three types of enhancer elements, namely &#x003ba;B elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), IRF3 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3I</xref>) and IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3J</xref>). These results indicated that H7N9 PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2 had a potent suppressive effect on MAVS.

These reassortant viruses contain all segments of H7N9 except that the segments expressing HA and NA are from WSN. They can therefore be handled in the regular Biosafety Level 2 facility.

We also showed that H7N9 PB1-F2 primarily affects aggregation of MAVS, which was consistently supported by several lines of evidence. First, MAVS aggregation was severely compromised when H7N9 PB1-F2 was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Second, MAVS aggregates on mitochondria seen in confocal images disappeared when H7N9 PB1-F2 was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).

Here we showed that viral protein PB1-F2 of avian influenza virus H7N9 formed protein aggregates on mitochondria, perturbed TRIM31-MAVS interaction and directed unaggregated MAVS for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. H7N9 PB1-F2 shares some functional similarities with cellular protein FAF1 [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Both localize primarily to mitochondria and are aggregation-prone. However, FAF1 does not enhance MAVS degradation. Since FAF1 interacts tightly with MAVS, they likely co-aggregate to form a stable FAF1-MAVS complex. In contrast, no interaction between H7N9 PB1-F2 and MAVS was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Instead, H7N9 PB1-F2 aggregated and localized to distinct sub-compartment of clustered mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), adjacent to the sub-compartment harboring unaggregated MAVS on fissioned or fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), where MAVS was prone to degradation.</p><p>It is still an open question as to how H7N9 PB1-F2 abolishes MAVS-TRIM31 interaction. TRIM31 is not a mitochondrial membrane protein but attached to mitochondria through an unknown factor [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Sendai virus infection enhances MAVS-TRIM31 complex formation [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], suggesting that MAVS aggregation favors TRIM31 mitochondrial localization and MAVS-TRIM31 interaction. However, H7N9 PB1-F2 formed amyloid aggregates on mitochondria leading to alteration of mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), which might pose steric hindrance to aggregation of MAVS, which did not interact with H7N9 PB1-F2 directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Plausibly, MAVS aggregation was hindered but its multimeric structure remained intact, enabling it to interact with TRAF3 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) but not TRAF6, TBK1, IKK&#x003b5; or TRIM31 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">8B&#x02013;8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">9D and 9E</xref>). Like a negative feedback loop, weakening of TRIM31-MAVS interaction by H7N9 PB1-F2 suppressed K63-polyubiquitintion, aggregation and activation of MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>). It will be of great interest to determine whether H7N9 PB1-F2 might directly target TRIM31 or other essential components that mediate MAVS-TRIM31 complex formation, including YOD1, SIRT5 and SNX8. Particularly, whether and how H7N9 PB1-F2 might affect phospholipids in mitochondrial membrane merit further investigations. Since the ubiquitination of H7N9 PB1-F2 is known to be required for its biological function [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the role of TRIM31 in this process might also be worthy of experimental validation.</p><p>The suppressive effect of PB1-F2 on MAVS aggregation and stability is virus subtype-specific. H7N9 PB1-F2 but not WSN PB1-F2 was capable of destabilizing MAVS and preventing its aggregation. Although the activity profiles of H7N9 PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2 were distinct, both proteins were competent to form aggregates on mitochondria (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">2</xref>) and to destabilize MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5G and 5I</xref>). Thus, the two pathogenic avian influenza viruses share a similar MAVS-destabilizing property. It will be of interest to determine the residues and regions in PB1-F2 proteins of H7N9 and H5N1 viruses required for aggregation. As predicted by PASTA 2.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008611.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), however, anti-parallel pairing that promotes protein aggregation spans over a wide C-terminal region of both proteins, probably involving multiple residues. Structural analysis of PB1-F2 is required to clarify their exact roles. Other subtype-specific properties of PB1-F2 have been well documented [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Although originally thought to be properties of all PB1-F2 proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], abilities to sequester MAVS and to decrease &#x00394;&#x003a8;m are obligatory to PR8 or WSN virus (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">7</xref>). PB1-F2 of the 1918 pandemic strain is known to co-degrade with DDX3X, leading to inhibition of TBK1 [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Whereas PB1-F2 of the 1918 strain is a fast-turnover protein similar to WSN PB1-F2, H7N9 PB1-F2 is much stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Whether PB1-F2 of the 1918 strain might also be aggregation-prone and whether H7N9 PB1-F2 could also target DDX3X for degradation merit further comparison and analysis. Under a strong selection pressure [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], PB1-F2 proteins of different subtypes might have been evolved to target MAVS and other adaptor proteins in the RIG-I signaling pathway using different strategies. Instead of binding with and sequestering MAVS, H7N9 PB1-F2 suppressed its aggregation and destabilized it. Notably, the suppressive effect of H7N9 PB1-F2 was only seen when MAVS was activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In other words, H7N9 PB1-F2 had no influence on basal activity of MAVS in the absence of immune stimulation. Plausibly, H7N9 PB1-F2 functions to prevent excessive activation of MAVS signaling.</p><p>PB1-F2 amyloid formation occurs as early as at 8 hpi as demonstrated with WSN virus at an MOI of 0.1 [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As it had higher aggregation propensity than WSN PB1-F2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1</xref>), H7N9 PB1-F2 might aggregate more rapidly. In our setting, H7-2 WT infection at an MOI of 1 strikingly reduced MAVS protein level as early as at 6 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), leading to an inhibition of type I IFN production at 12 and 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). H7N9 PB1-F2 was abundantly expressed at 6 hpi but started to decline from 12 to 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The expression of H7N9 PB1-F2 likely plateaued at around 6 hpi, before which H7N9 PB1-F2 was already aggregating on mitochondria to dampen MAVS aggregation, thereby blocking propagation of antiviral signal. Electrochemical study as described [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] can be performed to investigate further as to how H7N9 PB1-F2 aggregates in infected cells.</p><p>Lethal H5N1 and H7N9 infection arises from cytokine storm [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Here we found that H7N9 PB1-F2 potently suppressed type I IFN expression but might not affect production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). This suggests that suppression of MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling by H7N9 PB1-F2 might exert a specific effect on type I IFN production but minimally affect the overall proinflammatory response. This is compatible with the pattern of IFN and cytokine expression during pathologic cytokine storm of H7N9 infection, with profound proinflammatory cytokine production but attenuated type I IFN production and signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This is also in keeping with our recent finding that WSN PB1-F2 is capable of suppressing inflammasome activation induced by various stimuli, whereas H7N9 PB1-F2 exerts a more restricted inhibitory effect on RNA-induced interleukin 1&#x003b2; maturation and secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p><p>Recombinant influenza A viruses deficient of another IFN antagonist NS1 have been evaluated for use as the backbone for construction of candidate attenuated vaccines due to its potent type I IFN-inducing property [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. However, severely attenuated replication of the NS1-deleted viruses poses a challenge to the preparation of seed virus [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. A DelNS1 system with adaptive mutations to support virus replication in eggs and MDCK cells has recently been reported for making optimal live attenuated influenza vaccines [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Although the elevation of the type I IFN-inducing activity of the recombinant H7N9 PB1-F2-deficient virus was mild (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), its replication was not affected in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and modestly attenuated in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). It will be of great interest to test whether PB1-F2 knockout could serve as another strategy for construction of attenuated vaccines. Particularly, whether double knockout of NS1 and PB1-F2 might have any advantages in boosting innate immunity warrants experimental validation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Plasmids</title><p>For PB1-F2 expression constructs, PB1-F2-coding sequences of A/PR/8/1934 (PR8), A/WSN/1933 TS61 (WSN), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013 (H7N9) were subcloned into pCAGEN vector to express PB1-F2 with three Flag tags at the C terminus (PB1-F2-Flag). pEF-Bos-Flag-MAVS was generated as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

The authors provide experimental evidence to show a strain specific inhibition of MAVS function in H5 and H7 strain derived PB1-F2s. Mechanistically, the authors propose that especially H7 PB1-F2s support degradation of MAVS and disturb additionally the interaction with important downstream signaling molecules such as TRAF6. The hypothesis that PB1-F2 elicits a more potent phenotype in highly pathogenic influenza viruses is generally tempting and from a mechanistic point of view novel. It would fall in line with previous observations that pandemic viruses and highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses require PB1-F2 as a pathogenicity factor.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Submitted MS focuses on the fine molecular mechanism by which PB1-F2 (with special focus on avian H5/H7) modulates type I interferon response. PB1-F2 is widely accepted as a molecular pathogenicity determinant, with multifunctional properties in strain and host cell-dependent manner. Its mitochondrial localization 2003 by Gibbs (10.1128/JVI.77.13.7214-7224.2003) pointed attention towards innate immune response as mitochondria are well known to be involved. Early evidence (Le Gofic 2010) showed that PB1-F2 surpasses IFN in RIG-i dependent manner. Molecular mechanism remained elusive till ~2010 when Varga et al described mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS as RIG-I downstream effector of PB1F2 IFN suppression. As with any other PB1-f2 function, the extend of the IFN inhibition seems to be strain specific. The authors observed that Avian PB1F2 is a more potent IFN suppressor.</p><p>The MS confirmed 2011-2012 discoveries related to MAVS.</p><p>Importantly, several original observations in this MS deepen our understanding at the molecular level.</p><p>1. H7- and H5-PB1F2 but not H1- PB1F2 decreases aggregation and</p><p>2. destabilize MAVS at protein level via proteasomal and lysosomal degradation.</p><p>3. They also showed that this effect is more pronounced on aggregated MAVS (IFN response triggering form) by selectively hinder the ubiquitination of MAVS at K63. This residue ubiquitination promotes aggregation of MAVS.</p><p>4. H7N9 PB1F2 hinders interaction of the MAVS with TRIM31, ubiquitin ligase responsible for MAVS K63 ubiquitination. The authors correlated the level of PB1F2 amyloid fiber formation for H7 H5 H1 PB1f2 with its ability to destabilize MAVS.</p><p>The experimental design is of high quality, with appropriate controls (for vast majority experiments) and the results support claims and conclusions.</p><p>One drawback represents an inability to demonstrate that H7 PB1F2 to interact with MAVS, either I am missing something or it does not make much sense, authors need to clarify how is PB1F2 effect mediated?</p><p>In addition to plasmid co-transfection experiments, authors demonstrated MVAS mediated IFN inhibition in virus expressed PB1F2 context as well (that is super-significant as most works only focus on somewhat artificial co-transfection models as it is easier to control PB1-F2 expression).</p><p>It would be of great importance if authors could reproduce as many experiments as possible in the virus context. While PB1F2 with a taq expressed from the plasmid is of great convenience, antibodies are available</p><p>for Pb1-F2 (doi:10.1007/s00705-009-0479-5.).</p><p>This MS is of substantial readership interest as it revealed at a very fine molecular level how PB1F2 modulates IFN response and that avian Pb1F2 is a more potent IFN inhibitor.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold></p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1: The study is largely based on over-expression experiments in 293T cells and a clear correlation between the protein amount of the three PB1-F2s and the respective phenotype investigated is obvious (e.g. Fig 6C and g, 7A/B). Interestingly, somewhat similar expression was achieved in Fig. 8C.</p><p>Luciferase reporter assays require transfection controls to assure comparable protein levels (e.g. Fig. 4a-l)</p><p>In several panels only H7 PB1-F2 is tested and the matching WSN PB1-F2 controls are missing. This needs to be included to point out the strain specific effects the authors are claiming (Fig 5, Fig. 10b d and e)</p><p>The quantification of Western blots in Fig. 7a does not appear to match with the actual bands.</p><p>All experiments require indication of independent repeats, biological and technical replicates and statistical methods applied in the respective figure legends.</p><p>The quality of western blots needs to be improved (some blots are clearly to faint (Fig 6g aMAVS, 7a GAPDH and numerous are plain overexposed 7a flag, 6a GAPDH, 6c flag, 9BC and D V5) . Often it is unclear if the signal is within the linear range. Additionally it remains elusive if the absolute amounts of PB1-F2 and MAVS are comparable to infection/cellular expression conditions.</p><p>How was aggregation of MAVS distinguished from overexpression in Fig 8C?</p><p>Reviewer #2: For the IF confocal microscopy Z stacking is essential to address the distribution of the PB1F2 at mitochondria/mitochondrial aggregates, the same slides could be used to rescan over several vertical planes to allow relevant co-localization distribution</p><p>line 287-289: how do authors explain that H7 PB1-f2 does not precipitate MAVS and has the most pronounced effect on it?</p><p>This Must be addressed, is there some third independent factor which promotes aggregation and H7 PB1-F2 sequestrate it??? Or...</p><p>line 314-317</p><p>If H7Pb1f2 does not interact with MAVS, why would it suppress signalosome recruitment?</p><p>line 338-344: PB1F2 was shown to be heavily ubiquitinated, H7PB1f2 also contains the C-terminal lysine cluster shown to be responsible for H5 and H1 PB1f2 expression level <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118477">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118477</ext-link>. If H7PB1f2 does not interact with MAVS, authors should investigate if PB1f2 ubiquitination could contribute to MAVS ubiquitination by TRIM31</p><p>figure1. please comment on molecular size differences between wsn H5 and H5 PB1f2, analyze at least at the sequence level. The potential sites for posttranslational modifications like sumoylation, neddylation etc, those could be responsible for altered migration patterns as well as stability.</p><p>Fig.2b: in figure 1b presented data show no substantial difference between H7 PB1f2 regardless of MG132 presence while here fig2b difference is substantial.
