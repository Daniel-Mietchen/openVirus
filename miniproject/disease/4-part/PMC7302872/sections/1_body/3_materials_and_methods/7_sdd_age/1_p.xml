<p>SDD-AGE was performed as previously described [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Briefly, HEK293T cells were lysed with cold SDD-AGE lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2 mM EDTA and 1× protease inhibitor) for 30 min. Appropriate amount of 5× SDD-AGE sample buffer (2.5× TBE, 2.5% SDS, 25% glycerol and 0.25% bromophenol blue) was then added to SDD-AGE lysate to reach 1×. The crude sample was passed through 25G needle 10 times at 4°C to break viscosity. The SDD-AGE protein sample was then separated by 2% agarose gel and transferred onto Immune-Blot
 <sup>®</sup> PVDF Membrane (BioRad). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk and then incubated with primary antibody. The blot was probed with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Protein aggregate ladder was detected with WesternBright ECL (Advansta).
