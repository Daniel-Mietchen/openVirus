<p>Cells were lysed with cold RIPA lysis buffer for 30 min. A small portion of crude lysate was isolated out for total protein sample extraction as described. The crude lysate was then subjected for centrifugation at 21,500×g for 10 min at 4°C. RIPA supernatant was denatured in protein sample buffer in boiling water for 10 min. RIPA pellet was washed once with RIPA lysis buffer. 1× protein sample buffer was then added to RIPA pellet and boiled for 10 min. Undissolved debris was removed by further centrifugation at 21,500×g for 10 min. Protein samples of total protein, RIPA-soluble and RIPA pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.</p>
