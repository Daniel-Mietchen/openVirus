<p>Interestingly, H7N9 PB1-F2 was not influential on the steady-state level of endogenous MAVS protein under mock-stimulated conditions (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5H and 5J</xref>). We also observed that the destabilizing effect of H5N1 PB1-F2 on MAVS was similar to that of H7N9 PB1-F2 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">5I</xref>). In short, PB1-F2 proteins of H7N9 and H5N1 but not the counterpart in WSN enhanced MAVS degradation in immune-stimulated cells.
