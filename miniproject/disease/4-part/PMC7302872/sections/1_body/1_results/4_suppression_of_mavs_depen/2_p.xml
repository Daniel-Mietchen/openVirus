<p>PB1-F2 proteins of PR8 and H5N1 carrying the S66 pathogenic marker were found to suppress type I IFN production through MAVS [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To test if S66 might be influential on the suppressive effect on MAVS, an N66S mutation was introduced to H7N9 PB1-F2. Surprisingly, the suppression of Sendai virus- or MAVS-induced activation of IFNβ promoter activity by H7N9 PB1-F2 N66 was more pronounced than that mediated by H7N9 PB1-F2 S66 (

The steady-state levels of PB1-F2 proteins of PR8 and H5N1 with S66 were lower in Sendai virus-infected cells, but much more pronounced IFN suppressive and pathogenic effects of PB1-F2 S66 were observed compared to those of PB1-F2 N66 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In contrast, H7N9 PB1-F2 S66 did not show an enhanced IFN suppressive effect. These results suggested that H7N9 PB1-F2 likely suppressed MAVS through another S66-independent mechanism.
