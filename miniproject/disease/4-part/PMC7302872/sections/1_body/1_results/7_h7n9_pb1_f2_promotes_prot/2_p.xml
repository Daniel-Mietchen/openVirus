<p>To test if MAVS aggregation might be important for H7N9 PB1-F2-induced degradation, aggregation-defective mutants of MAVS [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], including E26A, W56R and R64, 65A, were generated. Whereas H7N9 PB1-F2 was fully competent in destabilizing wild-type MAVS, its influence on all aggregation-defective mutants of MAVS was much less pronounced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, lanes 6, 9 and 12 vs 3). Collectively, the above results suggested that H7N9 PB1-F2 might target MAVS for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation in an aggregation-dependent manner. In other words, H7N9 PB1-F2 could specifically destabilize the aggregated and activated form of MAVS.
