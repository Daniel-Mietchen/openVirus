<p>PB1-F2 protein is prone to proteasomal degradation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In keeping with this, when it was expressed in mammalian HEK293T cells, Flag-tagged PB1-F2 (PB1-F2-Flag) of WSN strain was barely detected but its steady-state level was much increased upon treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, upper panel, lane 2 vs 1). In contrast, H7N9 PB1-F2 was most abundant in HEK293T cells in the absence of MG132 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, upper panel, lane 5 vs 1 and 3) and its protein level was minimally affected by MG132 treatment (lane 6 vs 5). Interestingly, the expression level of H5N1 PB1-F2 in HEK293T cells in the absence of MG132 was between those of its counterparts in WSN and H7N9 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, upper panel, lane 3 vs 1 and 5), and it was slightly elevated when cells were treated with MG132 (lane 4 vs 3). Similar results were also observed in chicken DF-1 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, lower panel). These results might indicate the unique features of H7N9 PB1-F2 in protein expression, abundance, stability and susceptibility to proteasomal degradation.
