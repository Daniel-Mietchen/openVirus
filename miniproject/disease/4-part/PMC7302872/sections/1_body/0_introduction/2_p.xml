<p>A small non-structural protein named PB1-F2 is one of the virulence factors of influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is expressed from the largest +1 open reading frame of the PB1 segment of the viral genome, with a full length of 90 amino acids, but truncations and high sequence variability in this region have been found [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PB1-F2 was initially identified as a mitochondrial protein that induces apoptosis of immune cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. PB1-F2 deficiency results in attenuation of the virus in mammals, but host species- and virus subtype-specific effects of the loss of PB1-F2 have also been described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PB1-F2 is also known to interact and compete with HAX-1, an inhibitor of PA subunit of influenza A virus RNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More importantly, PB1-F2 suppresses innate immunity and this suppression correlates with viral pathogenicity. PB1-F2 with an S66 residue has been found to be more pathogenic in mouse model than its mild counterpart with an N66 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mechanistically, S66 version of PB1-F2 suppresses RIG-I-MAVS signaling and early type I interferon (IFN) production [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] through dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and sequestration of MAVS adaptor protein [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. More recently, PB1-F2 protein with an S66 pathogenic marker of the H1N1 subtype of the 1918 pandemic, which is also known to be highly pathogenic and probably derived from an avian virus, was found to specifically suppress TBK1-mediated type I IFN production by co-degradation with DDX3X [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. H5N1 and H7N9 are highly pathogenic viruses that express full-length PB1-F2 without the S66 pathogenic marker [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since PB1-F2 sequences are known to be under a strong selection pressure [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], PB1-F2 proteins might have evolved to confer new features to enhance the pathogenicity of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. This small protein can make a big difference as in the 1918 pandemic strain [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Whether and how type I IFN antagonism of PB1-F2 might contribute to high pathogenicity of H5N1 and H7N9 remain to be elucidated.
