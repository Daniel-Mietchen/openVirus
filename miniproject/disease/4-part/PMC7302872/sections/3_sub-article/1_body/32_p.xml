<p>Reviewer #2: Submitted MS focuses on the fine molecular mechanism by which PB1-F2 (with special focus on avian H5/H7) modulates type I interferon response. PB1-F2 is widely accepted as a molecular pathogenicity determinant, with multifunctional properties in strain and host cell-dependent manner. Its mitochondrial localization 2003 by Gibbs (10.1128/JVI.77.13.7214-7224.2003) pointed attention towards innate immune response as mitochondria are well known to be involved. Early evidence (Le Gofic 2010) showed that PB1-F2 surpasses IFN in RIG-i dependent manner. Molecular mechanism remained elusive till ~2010 when Varga et al described mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS as RIG-I downstream effector of PB1F2 IFN suppression. As with any other PB1-f2 function, the extend of the IFN inhibition seems to be strain specific. The authors observed that Avian PB1F2 is a more potent IFN suppressor.</p>
