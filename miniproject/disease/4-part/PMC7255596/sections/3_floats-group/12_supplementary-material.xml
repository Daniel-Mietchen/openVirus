  <title>Neutralizing response to heterologous DENV serotypes and two different ZIKV strains.</title>
  <p>PRNT and FRNT assays were performed to determine the effect of previous DENV immunity in a subsequent ZIKV infection, and the neutralizing antibody response against different dengue serotypes and zika strains. In all panels, animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection are in blue, while animals exposed to DENV 3 months before are in orange. Na√Øve animals are in black. (A) Neutralization against two different ZIKV strains was performed. Dotted lines indicate the limit of detection for the assay. (B) Neutralizing response against heterologous DENV serotypes before and after ZIKV infection.</p>
