  <title>Serological profile of the three cohorts of macaques before and after ZIKV infection.</title>
  <p>Humoral response was assessed using different commercial and in-house ELISA tests. (A-F) Binding capacity of antibodies from animals with different immune background are shown. Animals from cohort 1 are shown in blue, animals from cohort 2 are shown in orange and naïve animals from cohort 3 are shown in black in all panels. Dotted lines indicate the limit of detection for each test. Statistically significant differences among and within groups were calculated by two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.005 and ****P&lt;0.0001). Colored stars represent a significantly different group, while colored lines represent the group that it is compared to.</p>
