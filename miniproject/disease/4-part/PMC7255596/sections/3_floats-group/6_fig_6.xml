  <title>Changes in percentage of plasmacytoid dendritic cells.</title>
  <p>Percentage of plasmacytoid lineage dendritic cells out of total gated PBMCs. Naïve animals are depicted in black. Animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection are in blue, while animals exposed to DENV 3 months before are in orange. Naïve animals are in black. Differences amongst cohorts in respect with their baseline values were computed by two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (**P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001 and ****P&lt;0.0001). Colored stars represent a significantly different group, while colored lines represent the group that it is compared to. Same colored lines and stars represent a significant difference compared to their baseline.</p>
