<p>By using rhesus macaques with primary DENV infections at two different points of time, followed by a secondary ZIKV infection, we found that the length of time separating the infections has a qualitative impact on controlling ZIKV replication. It is known that ZIKV-specific Abs appear in circulation a few days after symptom onset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and are responsible for most of the neutralizing ZIKV activity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the extent of the contribution of DENV-Abs early after ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> remains uncertain. For this reason, we looked at the contribution of the humoral immune response during early ZIKV replication. Although cross-binding Abs were detected, previous exposure to DENV has no impact on ZIKV neutralization. That fact was confirmed by depleting DENV2-specific Abs in sera. Lastly, no evidence of ZIKV enhancement associated with prior DENV exposure was observed in this study.
