<p>It is known that NS1, along with structural protein E, is one of the main immunodominant targets for B cell response [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Here we show that after ZIKV infection, the levels of binding Abs to ZIKV NS1 protein were significantly higher in the group with a middle convalescent period to DENV compared to the other two groups which is in agreement with a trend to higher magnitude of DENV2-neutralizing Abs in that group. Also, in same group we found a significant early expansion in the magnitude of ZIKV neutralization by days 6 and 7 after the infection. These results suggest the presence of more mature memory B cells in that group. Previous studies carried out in human cohorts have suggested that prior DENV exposure could modulate the humoral response to ZIKV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] while others have inferred that the effect is only modest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is known that memory B cells are implicated during a secondary infection in a DENV-ZIKV scenario, still it is unknown how or when their maturation takes place in order to modify the response during ZIKV infection. Lastly, earlier works suggested that the magnitude of the humoral response driven by memory B cells may depend on the length of time passed between infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here, using an accurate depiction of time elapsed in a NHP model, we show that the length of time between infections does impact the quality of this memory recall.
