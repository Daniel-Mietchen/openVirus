<p>Confirmation of DENV-2 Abs depletion was performed by ELISA by coating plate with capture Ab (4G2/2H2 100 ng/well), followed by blocking with 3% nonfat dairy milk and incubating with purified DENV-2 virus. Depleted or control (undepleted) sera was added (1:40 100 ul/well) and IgG-binding Abs were detected using AP-conjugated secondary anti-goat Ab (1:2500). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm.</p>
