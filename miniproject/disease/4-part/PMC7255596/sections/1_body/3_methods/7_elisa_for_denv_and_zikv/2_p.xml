<p>For the measurement of IgM levels against ZIKV, samples were tested using a ZIKV IgM MAC-ELISA assay developed by Aravinda de Silvaâ€™s laboratory. Briefly, a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with anti-human IgM (1:50). Following incubation and blocking with 3% non-fat milk, sample dilutions (1:40) were added. Positive and negative controls for ZIKV and DENV were also prepared. Stock C6/36 ZIKV and DENV antigens were diluted (1:2 and 1:3, respectively), and added to the plate. IgM-binding Abs were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mAb (6B6C-1) and TMB substrate. Optical density at 450 nm (OD) values were measured in three separate readings at 5-minute intervals. Results were expressed as mean OD of sample reacted with viral antigen (P)/mean OD of normal human serum reacted with viral antigen (N) and reported as negative (P/N value of &lt;2), presumptive positive (P/N value of &gt;3) or equivocal (2&lt; P/N &lt;3).</p>
