<p>Young adult rhesus macaques (4–7 years of age) seronegative for DENV and ZIKV were housed in the CPRC facilities, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico. For the ZIKV challenge, macaques previously infected with DENV-2 in September 2016 (Cohort 1, n = 6) and June 2017 (Cohort 2, n = 4), and DENV/ZIKV-naïve macaques (Cohort 3, n = 6) were infected subcutaneously in the deltoid area with 500uL of virus diluted in PBS, using a dose of 1 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu. All macaques were male. The average age for cohort 1 was 5.1 years (5.6, 4.9, 5.1, 4.9, 5.0 and 5.0 years), 6.8 years for cohort 2 (5.5, 7.75, 7.6 and 6.7 years), and 5.7 years for cohort 3 (6.3, 6.5, 5.8, 4.75, 5.4 and 5.6 years). Weights were taken on Day 0 and every other day during the acute infection period (days 1–6, then at day 30 p.i.). Rectal temperature was taken daily during the acute infection period (days 1–6 and on day 30 p.i.).
