<p>To assess the impact of previous exposure to DENV at different times in a humoral response against a subsequent ZIKV infection, all sixteen animals were tested for binding Abs against ZIKV and DENV serotypes following ZIKV infection. All three groups had levels of anti-DENV IgM below the cutoff value during the three collection periods, suggesting ZIKV infection did not induce DENV-specific IgM response (

Anti-DENV IgG levels were confirmed in both DENV-pre-exposed groups and by day 30 experimented a significant expansion compared to their basal levels (P&lt;0.05; mean diff: -0.27, CI95% -0.5145 to -0.02546 P&lt; 0.005; mean diff: -0.3, CI95% -0.4997 to -0.1003 for the DENV 3M and DENV 12M groups respectively). Those cross-reacting Abs were also significantly higher compared to the naïve animals on day 30 (P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: 0.96, CI95%: 0.61 to 1.30 for DENV 12M vs naïve at 30 days p.i,; P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: 0.75, CI95%: 0.37 to 1.14 for DENV 3M vs naïve at 30 days p.i.; P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: 0.88, CI95%: 0.54 to 1.23 for DENV 12M vs naïve at 60 days p.i.; P&lt;0.001; mean diff.: 0.68, CI95%: 0.29 to 1.07 for DENV 3M vs naïve at 60 days p.i.), slowly decreasing by day 60 p.i. (

After a limited increase of the anti-DENV IgG levels on day 30 p.i. the levels rapidly decrease by day 60 in the naïve group. Moreover, by day 30 p.i., DENV-middle convalescent animals showed a strong trend of having higher levels of anti-DENV IgG compared to the DENV-early convalescent animals, although no statistical significance was reached.
