<p>Myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) frequency could not be measured on baseline and days 1 and 2 p.i. due to sample quality. Nonetheless, day 3 p.i. data presents no detectable differences in the frequency of dendritic cells of mDC lineage between groups (

In contrast, dendritic cells of plasmacytoid lineage (pDCs) show a significant increase in frequency at days 1 and 2 p.i. in DENV 12M animals in comparison with DENV 3M and naïve animals (P&lt;0.01; mean diff.: 10.54, CI95%: -2.65 to 18.43 for DENV 12M versus naïve animals on day 1 p.i.; for day 2 p.i., P&lt;0.01; mean diff.: 13.68, CI95%: 4.87 to 22.50 for DENV 12M versus DENV 3M and, P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: 15.57, CI95%: 7.68 to 23.45 for DENV 12M versus naïve animals) (
