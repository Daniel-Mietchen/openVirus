<p>To determine if previous immunity to DENV enhances or reduces ZIKV replication, and how it changes depending on the convalescence period, ZIKV RNAemia was measured in serum and urine using qRT-PCR. During the first 3 days p.i., viral RNA detection increased similarly in all groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Of note, DENV-middle convalescent animals had significantly lower peak viremia on day 4 p.i. compared with the rest of the animals (P = 0.042 vs. naïve and P = 0.019 vs. DENV 3M group). By day 5 p.i. all three groups had two animals with undetectable viremia. However, the set-point viremia in the four animals from DENV 12M group was significantly lower compared to the four animals having viremia in the naïve group (P = 0.039) (

By days 6 and 7 p.i., there was no viral RNA detection in the DENV-middle convalescent group, while DENV 3M animals showed a trend towards an intermittent viremia and most of the naïve animals still had detectable viral RNA. By days 30 and 60 p.i. all animals tested negative for ZIKV (
