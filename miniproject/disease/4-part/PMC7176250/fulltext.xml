</p><p id="Par5"><disp-quote><p id="Par6">In recent decades our views of acute encephalitis in children have undergone some changes. In particular, the numerous cases of epidemic encephalitis seen everywhere since 1915 have influenced our understanding of acute inflammation of the brain to such an extent that we can validly speak of encephalitis periods prior to, during, and after these epidemics. The fact that during these three eras not only our experiences of childhood encephalitis have changed, but apparently also the clinical diseases themselves, is one of the most interesting findings in the context of the encephalitis problem.</p><p id="Par7"><italic>Julius Zappert,</italic> 1932</p></disp-quote> The end of the EL period was as unexpected &#x02014; and as uncertain &#x02014; as its beginning. It appeared by 1924 that EL had had become a permanent feature on the epidemic calendar in Europe and North America. But the 1924 British outbreak not only proved to be the largest single event in its history, it was also the last: although significant numbers of acute cases would continue to be reported in some countries until the early 1930s, there were to be no further eruptions of either somnolent or hyperkinetic EL. Just as Europe moved from post-Great War depression to the fragile optimism of the later 1920s, EL had also apparently withdrawn.</p><p id="Par9">The possibility of prior sporadic cases notwithstanding, the onset of the EL epidemic could be fairly confidently dated to 1915&#x02013;16. The crest in most of continental Europe was clearly reached in 1920/21 (or 1921/22 in Scandinavia), while in the USSR there was no clear watershed year, and EL appeared to both persist and move further east. The puzzling British epidemic of 1924 was more intense than the 1920/21 European wave (which had not spared the United Kingdom) and also caused surprise and alarm by lingering into the summer, but was otherwise regarded as representing the delayed denouement of the EL plague across the Channel &#x02014; even if only after the expected return visitations in 1925 and 1926 did not eventuate. By 1925 acute EL was, in the same way, no longer of major concern in the USA.</p><p id="Par10">From the early 1930s it seemed that EL was to join the &#x02018;febris comatosa&#x02019; of Sydenham and the 15th/16th century &#x02018;sweating sickness&#x02019;, as well as 19th century Gerlier disease and <italic>nona</italic>
, as historical curiosities, its origins destined to remain hidden. EL, however, was a modern disease, its pathology mapped in exquisite microscopic detail by some of the most astute neuropathologists in history, and its clinical features had been the subject of a profuse literature, making the mystery of its etiology, which had proved impervious to the investigative tools that had unlocked the nature of other grey matter disorders, all the more irritating &#x02014; EL was soon rarely even mentioned in textbooks and reviews that documented the rapid advances being achieved in every other area of virology.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Encephalitis lethargica at the end of the 1920s</title><p id="Par11"><disp-quote><p id="Par12">In the wake of the war epidemic encephalitis, or encephalitis lethargica, stalked across Europe and America, stopped awhile, and stalked again a few years later and left behind it an army of broken men, tremulous, emotional and crippled, but the disease itself apparently vanished, and in this country at least its acute phases are no longer seen, but, strangely enough, other types of encephalitis crop up from time to time, reminding one of the gibe of Bernard Shaw at doctors, when he said that after the employment of antityphoid vaccine in the army, typhoid was said to have disappeared, but a strange new disease called para-typhoid suddenly became common.</p><p id="Par13"><italic>A. H. Gordon,</italic> 1933</p></disp-quote> Typical EL cases continued to be diagnosed after 1924, particularly in Germany and England , but the decline of the disorder was clear. There was a general shift away from the hyperkinetic acute form to an emphasis on &#x02018;classic&#x02019; phenomena, particularly somnolence, diplopia, and headache . Silbermann and Zappert found that only six of 185 post-encephalitic parkinsonism (PEP) cases they had seen in Vienna between 1925 and 1934 included acute EL phases dated between 1926 and 1928, and none after this point; four patients had been diagnosed with acute EL between 1925 and 1934, compared with 53 non-EL encephalitides.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>1</sup></xref> In the Netherlands , Sillevis Smitt similarly noted the decline of EL in favor of white matter encephalitides after 1925 &#x02014; post-vaccination (PVE) and post-infection encephalitis (PIE)
, disseminated encephalomyelitis (without apparent foregoing infection, and including a number of subforms, such as neuromyelitis optica and tonic cramps), and mixed central&#x02013;peripheral forms (such as neuromyelitis and neuro-encephalitis = unilateral pontine /medullary lesions); these, however, did not occur in epidemic form.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>2</sup></xref> No EL cases came to autopsy in Switzerland after 1937.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p id="Par18">By the mid-1930s, very few acute EL cases were being seen, but chronic phase patients continued to require attention. An indisputable acute phase could not even be retrospectively established for many, and the unmistakable combination of &#x02018;post-EL&#x02019; symptoms still provided the most cogent evidence for diagnosis . While neurosyphilis and hysteria might be considered in the differential diagnosis, neurologists now recognized the post-EL syndrome as the most characteristic and invariable aspect of the disorder, unprecedented in both form and frequency. Caution was nevertheless still required, and diagnosis was only possible after evaluation of the complete patient history. The Viennese pediatrician Georg Frankl (1897&#x02013;?) reported in 1937, for instance, that EL could be diagnosed with security in only one of the nine parkinsonian children received by the Special Needs Education department of the Pediatric Clinic during the previous five years, while it could be definitely excluded in seven; apart from single cases of multiple sclerosis and Wilson disease, extrapyramidal symptoms had existed in five children, unchanged, since early childhood.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>4</sup></xref> Felix Stern also noted that early stage multiple sclerosis could include features that might suggest EL, including somnolence, character change in children, and parkinsonism.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>5</sup></xref> On the other hand, the absence of parkinsonism need not exclude an EL diagnosis entirely, as chronic phase syndromes dominated by epilepsy and psychosis occurred, if much less frequently.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p id="Par22">The withdrawal of EL from Europe was also obscured by marked increases in the incidence of other apparently infectious neurologic conditions, including the PVE and PIE discussed in the previous chapter: although initially linked with the &#x02018;EL virus&#x02019;, these conditions were relatively quickly distinguished as being &#x02018;myelinoclastic&#x02019; (causing degeneration of the white matter), in contrast to the &#x02018;polioclastic&#x02019; picture of EL.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>7</sup></xref> The situation was further complicated as new primary encephalitides were recognized, but in most instances this confusion was short-lived: Japanese encephalitis (1924), Russian Far East tick-borne encephalitis (1932), mosquito-borne encephalitis in the USA (1933), and European tick-borne encephalitis from the late 1930s: in each instance clinical, epidemiologic and pathologic differences from EL were rapidly recognized and used to demarcate the &#x02018;new arrival&#x02019; from the old foe. There is no evidence that any provided a major source of confusion during the EL period.</p><p id="Par24">More problematic were clusters of cases that appeared to represent &#x02018;partial&#x02019; or &#x02018;atypical &#x02019; EL syndromes. As early as 1923, Jean-Athanase Sicard (Paris) had spoken of &#x02018;para-encephalitides&#x02019; that included some features of EL, but were generally benign, the classic example being epidemic hiccup ; he compared their relationship with that between typhoid and paratyphoid fevers.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>8</sup></xref> Sicard&#x02019;s term was generally regarded as superfluous, many arguing that it distinguished only between degrees and not types of disease,<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>9</sup></xref> and its use was further complicated by its variable meaning: post-encephalitis (PEP) , for example, was sometimes described as a &#x02018;para-encephalitic phenomenon&#x02019;,<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>10</sup></xref> while for Economo &#x02018;para-encephalitis&#x02019; encompassed all encephalitides apart from EL.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="Par29">Whether &#x02018;para-encephalitides&#x02019; or &#x02018;atypical&#x02019;, &#x02018;oligosymptomatic&#x02019; or &#x02018;rudimentary EL &#x02019; &#x02014; the frequent reporting of such conditions during the second half of the 1920s was in no small part facilitated by the latitude of recognized EL symptomatology during the period 1916&#x02013;1924. Various combinations of somnolence , vestibular symptoms, vegetative complaints, obscure myalgias, and other phenomena were interpreted as evidence of subtle EL; prior to 1917 they might have been seen as neurasthenia or hysteria . This was assisted by the fact that standard post-epidemic EL cases also tended to be more somnolent or neurasthenic in character than hyperkinetic , although partial hyperkinetic EL forms were not unknown; for example, one 36-year-old French woman suffered a condition including diplopia, insomnia, and painful hyperkinesias that ending fatally after only nine days; on autopsy the substantia nigra was bleached.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p id="Par31">Stern recognized two atypical types as relevant: oligosymptomatic forms, with a few transient symptoms and generally benign; and &#x02018;flu-like&#x02019; forms, succeeded by neurasthenia and, possibly, personality changes.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>13</sup></xref> Without his experience, however, diagnosis of odd forms was more tenuous. In 1933, for example, Ernst Heinrich Romberg (1906&#x02013;1981; Munich) treated a 24-year-old woman with diplopia , nystagmus , insomnia , vertigo , headache, and excessive sweating ; she also presented bilateral abducens pareses, upper limb ataxia, and mild fever, with mild increases in CSF protein and lymphocytosis . She was released from hospital after ten weeks without major neurological symptoms &#x02014; Romberg noted that no specific therapy had been employed! &#x02014; but nearly a year later she still complained of headache, ennui and inability to work. After careful consideration of alternative diagnoses &#x02014; polio , multiple sclerosis , myelitis &#x02014; the author concluded that the woman suffered a &#x02018;<italic>borderline EL condition</italic>&#x02019;.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>14</sup></xref> Kreuser and Weidner (Merzig, Saar) had also noted a number of cases during the winter of 1926/27 that commenced with neurasthenic and vegetative symptoms (vertigo, circulatory abnormalities , increased salivation , sweating and sebum secretion ), some with intimations of character change, that they interpreted as atypical EL; other commentators were less decided.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p id="Par35">The question of whether EL in attenuated or otherwise altered form could be recognized had commenced with discussion of oligosymptomatic forms during the epidemic period, but allocation of such cases to &#x02018;mild EL&#x02019; outside major epidemics naturally required a high degree of diagnostic acumen, and could never be as secure as in a fully developed case. When August Scharnke (1885&#x02013;1931; Marburg) described the shifting symptomatology of EL to a German neurology conference in 1926, with a greater emphasis upon neuritic and myalgic symptoms, Heinrich Pette was openly skeptical about the relevance to EL of many of his cases.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>16</sup></xref> Five years later, Czech internist Josef Peln&#x000e1;&#x00159; (1872&#x02013;1964) more cautiously described a similar collection of difficult to classify neurological cases less decisively as <italic>&#x0201c;Epidemic meningism.

<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>17</sup></xref> Heinrich Weil (Saarbr&#x000fc;cken) reported fourteen encephalitis cases observed during the summer and autumn of 1937 that he regarded as atypical &#x02018;encephalitis epidemica&#x02019; because each presented one or more EL symptoms (facial paralysis, vertigo , increased CSF sugar), none of which alone could sustain a diagnosis of EL, especially given their combination with symptoms such as complete bulbar paralyses and blood in the CSF. The neuropathology of three deceased patients provided some support for his otherwise bold conclusion that his cases exemplified the rare apoplectiform of EL, but commentators remained skeptical.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p id="Par39">Margulis and Model (Moscow) similarly noted in 1927 that atypical , rudimentary forms of EL seemed to have persisted and even increased in numbers with the decline of the EL epidemic in the USSR, suggesting that its virus had decreased in virulence but had not vanished altogether. The examples of eight aberrant EL forms they delineated were, however, more consistent with EL than many other reports: CN III , V and VII pareses, for example, were more common than those of other cranial nerves.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>19</sup></xref></p><p id="Par41">The difficulties involved in the diagnosis of EL are exemplified by one of the most famous &#x02018;EL&#x02019; cases, that of Patricia Maguire , the <italic>&#x0201c;sleeping beauty of Oak Park&#x0201d;</italic> (Illinois). Maguire , 26 years old and otherwise healthy, had fallen ill in early 1932, initially complaining of irresistible drowsiness. In the course of a month she developed ptosis and diplopia , her behavior became irrational, and this was followed by high fever, projectile vomiting, and extrapyramidal rigidity ; she was finally so stuporous that tube feeding was required. The fever subsided after three weeks, but it was nearly a year before a definite response could be elicited from the still sleepy patient; she would probably have died of pneumonia in February 1933 had intensive medical intervention (oxygen tent, adrenaline, anti-pneumococcus serum) not been available. A variety of therapeutic experiments failed to restore the woman to full consciousness, and three years after the beginning of her travails, Maguire was soporous for around 80% of the time between 5am and 8&#x000a0;pm, with <italic>&#x0201c;twitching of the mouth at intervals &#x02026; the only outward sign that</italic> [she was] <italic>not just sleeping&#x0201d;</italic> and lying <italic>&#x0201c;so quietly that hardly a wrinkle can be seen in the white covers&#x0201d;</italic>;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>20</sup></xref> she slept peacefully throughout the night.

Further, the white matter throughout brainstem and cerebrum was more affected than was usual in EL, with diffuse demyelination as well as seemingly still active inflammatory foci. The authors recognized that the localization and degree of destruction was quite different from that of EL, but nonetheless retained their diagnosis without further comment; they preferred to discuss how their case might contribute to the localization of the sleep centre , a somewhat optimistic undertaking given the extent and degree of the damage .<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>25</sup></xref></p><p id="Par49">A similarly moving case was recently described in a small biography: A 33-year-old American woman contracted a febrile illness while studying at Oxford in 1926 and fell into a 13-year sleep. After waking she gradually improved, and in 1943 was fully recovered, allowing her to enjoy a career as a respected teacher until she was 70; she was healthy for her age until her death at the age of 98 years. She had been initially diagnosed with EL by psychiatrist Thomas Saxty Good, who had some experience with EL (he was director of the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford), but it was more likely that her acute psychiatric disorder and subsequent problems were attributable to the severe kidney disease and septicemia she had also suffered at this point; the course of her condition, including total recovery, did not at all suggest EL, and this diagnosis was not subsequently adopted by her physicians in the United States.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>26</sup></xref></p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Polio and encephalitis lethargica: one last time</title><p id="Par51">Polio had been a regular visitor in England and Wales since the early 20th century, but the most massive outbreaks did not occur until after the Second World War, between 1947 and 1958. The clinical presentation initially deviated somewhat from that of the 1920s: older children and young adults were also attacked, cases tended to be either very mild or very severe, and the gap between acute illness and paralysis (where it ensued) was greater, although no longer than fourteen days. Other peculiarities, including an increased proportion of atypical, &#x02018;polio-encephalitic&#x02019; cases and an increase in vague nervous disorders prior to the 1947 outbreak, suggested to some observers that a virus other than the polio virus was sometimes involved, perhaps the EL virus, particularly as <italic>&#x0201c;the continuous presence of fresh cases of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism</italic>

Viral brain infections might, the authors concluded, occasionally elicit parkinsonian symptoms, but not the full clinical picture of PEP.

Particularly curious was the case of a 63-year-old woman who had suffered PEP since the age of 18: <sc>l</sc>-DOPA not only released her from her parkinsonism (and incited motor hyperactivity and increased libido), she was surprised by the vivid recollection of the time around her acute illness, and was touched by intense nostalgia, joyful identification with her youthful self, and an uncontrolled resurgence of remote sexual memories and emotions.

The precise mechanisms by which <sc>l</sc>-DOPA exerts its effects, intended and untoward, have still not been completely clarified, with practical consequences: the instability of effect experienced by PEP patients ultimately affects all parkinsonian patients, so that questions have arisen as to how early in the course of the illness <sc>l</sc>-DOPA therapy should commence (particularly in light of the fact that it has been suggested that <sc>l</sc>-DOPA might itself be neurotoxic), and how tardive dyskinesias , dystonias and other side-effects can be managed without abandoning treatment altogether.</p><p id="Par465">It was an almost universal finding that PEP patients treated with <sc>l</sc>-DOPA developed motor side-effects more rapidly than did PD patients, and with greater severity, and the psychiatric problems they experienced were of a magnitude not normally encountered in PD patients. This presumably reflected the different states of the basal ganglia , particularly the substantia nigra, in PD and PEP (see pp.&#x000a0;656ff.): the destruction of the nigra was all but complete in PEP patients. The heightened sensitivity of PEP patients to the effects of amphetamine had been noted as early as 1936 (without knowledge of the role of dopamine in its effects).<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>243</sup></xref> This is not to overlook the effects of decades-long experience of disability and institutionalization upon the psyche, but the neurophysiological conditions had long before been catastrophically altered in the EL brain.</p><p id="Par467">One possibility, expressed in simplified form, is that the heightened response to <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in PEP patients reflected an increased sensitivity to dopamine. In this respect it is interesting to note that many of these &#x02018;side-effects&#x02019; had been described in acute EL:</p><p id="Par468"><disp-quote><p id="Par469">Mme L&#x000e9;vy has grouped the involuntary movements of encephalitis lethargica as follows: (1) choreiform movements, (2) bradykinesia , (3) myoclonic movements, and (4) tremors. But, in addition, there are many others; for example, innumerable tics, shuffling and stamping movements of the feet, ocular or glossal spasm, complex automatic actions of the whole body, and the &#x02018;imitative&#x02019; movements described by Babinski and Klebs.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>244</sup></xref></p></disp-quote> The similarities are all the more striking when one considers early reports of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA -related involuntary movements in PD, at a point when large doses were still employed, as by the Canadian Andr&#x000e9; Barbeau :</p><p id="Par472"><disp-quote><p id="Par473">At first these movements, particularly if they are limited to the face, are not noticed by the patient himself. They become bothersome mainly when they affect the limbs or when the peculiar wave-like nodding of the head becomes severe. Although most authors talk about chorea , dystonia or tics, it is our opinion that these dyskinesias differ markedly from what occurs in natural diseases of the basal ganglia . In some ways they resemble the dyskinesias seen during the acute phase of von Economo&#x02019;s encephalitis or with some phenothiazines.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>245</sup></xref></p></disp-quote> Barbeau emphasized that these dyskinesias were seen only in parkinsonian patients receiving <sc>l</sc>-DOPA ; multiple sclerosis and manganese intoxication patients, for instance, tolerated similar <sc>l</sc>-DOPA doses without manifesting involuntary movements .</p><p id="Par476">There were also other aspects of acute and interval period EL that were consistent with elevated dopaminergic tone, including the psychotic, schizophrenia -like symptoms seen in some adult patients. The same applies to the compulsive behaviors and hyperkinetic deportment of younger EL patients that can be compared with the impulsive&#x02013;compulsive behaviors in <sc>l</sc>-DOPA -treated PD patients that have recently attracted attention, or the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders that are also associated with elevated dopaminergic tone. Further, the behavioral features described in <sc>l</sc>-DOPA-treated PEP patients, both the playful, cheeky attitude and the less savory aggressive sexuality experienced and exhibited, for example, by Sacks &#x02019; Leonard L., were reminiscent of the &#x02018;character changes&#x02019; of post-acute EL children, suggesting that enhanced dopaminergic tone may have also played a role here.</p><p id="Par477">In short, careful examination of the course of EL suggests that it was initially marked by massively elevated dopaminergic tone, but that this then declined to normal levels, at least in the nigro-striatal pathway, before at some point dropping precipitously, indicating that a critical point in the degeneration of the nigra had been reached. The dopaminergic tone in other pathways, however, may have undergone different patterns of change, as the impishness of the younger EL patient could be preserved despite the limitations imposed by PEP, as in the case of Y (see pp.&#x000a0;474ff.) and in patients seen by Sacks, or, indeed, as shown by the hypersensitivity of PEP patients to <sc>l</sc>-DOPA therapy . It was also evident to Sacks when he encountered the chronic EL patients accommodated at the Highlands Hospital in London, who tended,
<italic>&#x0201c;by and large, to be mercurial, sprightly, impetuous, and hyper-active &#x02014; with vivid and ardent emotional reactions. This is in the greatest contrast to the deeply Parkinsonian, entranced, grave, or withdrawn appearance of so many patients at Mount Carmel.&#x0201d;</italic> Fleck had noted as early as 1930 in G&#x000f6;ttingen that even many older PEP patients &#x02014; <italic>without</italic> major psychiatric problems &#x02014; retained an element of childishness or silliness, as well as of suggestibility , so that they responded even to objectively ineffective treatment.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>246</sup></xref></p><p id="Par479">Increased dopaminergic tone might result from an actual increase in dopamine -mediated neurotransmission (increased neural activity, slowed metabolism of released dopamine), or from increased sensitivity of dopamine receptors subsequent to loss of stimulation by dopamine. The view that denervation supersensitivity &#x02014; the abnormal sensitivity of a signal transmission system to stimulation following loss or reduction of normal stimulation, as would apply in the striatum after the loss of nigro-striatal transmission &#x02014; underlies this phenomenon supposes that such sensitivity could persist for decades, at least in some cases. The situation is also complicated by the fact that the pattern of change in drug response in PEP patients &#x02014; the development of on/off phenomena, dyskinesias , dystonias , psychiatric changes (such as compulsive behavior ) &#x02014; resembles an accelerated form of what is also seen in PD patients, where complex changes in the balance between various receptor systems are believed to be involved. This may, however, also provide an explanation for the course of EL: changes in wider CNS organization secondary to the initial denervation supersensitivity could conceivably have longer term effects that were not undone by further changes in dopaminergic transmission.</p><p id="Par480">Increased transmission could result, on the other hand, from direct activation of dopamine receptors or by net enhancement of dopamine release. It has been hypothesized in the past that dopamine receptor -stimulating auto-antibodies might account for increased transmission in schizophrenia ,<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>247</sup></xref> but there has been nothing reported that would support a role for such a mechanism in EL.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>248</sup></xref></p><p id="Par483">In the mid-1970s, Lykke and Roos (G&#x000f6;teborg) reported that infection of young mice with herpes simplex virus altered brain monoamine metabolism, including elevated catecholamine release, and was associated with behavioral changes, such as hypermotility, that were exacerbated by <sc>l</sc>-DOPA administration.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>249</sup></xref> The authors attributed these effects to increased noradrenaline release, but they are entirely consistent with increased dopaminergic activity.

Both the striatal dopamine and nigral tyrosine hydroxylase changes, however, recovered from day 10, and had returned to normal by day 90. On the other hand, inflammation, as indicated by activated (300% increase) and resting microglia numbers (33% increase), was still evident in the compacta at day 90; shorter term but massive increases in the levels of several cytokines were also measured in subcortical areas, but their origin (local microglia or peripheral) was unclear.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>252</sup></xref> This effect was also achieved by other viruses, but to a lesser degree.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>253</sup></xref></p><p id="Par490">It is thus possible that viral infection can rapidly induce increased dopaminergic transmission in the nigro-striatal system, followed by a decline in activity with chronification of the infection.

Further, for reasons already advanced, neither influenza nor herpes viruses are likely to have caused EL, and there have been no further detailed reports of a similar effect upon the dopaminergic system being elicited by another virus. This model therefore remains another tantalizing but ultimately speculative possibility for explaining changes in dopaminergic tone in EL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Relevance to idiopathic Parkinson disease</title><p id="Par491">Infectious etiologies for PD have been sporadically discussed since the late 19th century, and interest in this possibility was only intensified by EL, particularly as infectious etiologies for brain disorders as diverse as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia were also explored during the 1920s.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>254</sup></xref> The most detailed recent model has been the &#x02018;dual hit hypothesis&#x02019; advanced by German neuropathologist Heiko Braak (b. 1937) and colleagues, partly on the basis of Braak &#x02019;s &#x02018;staging model&#x02019; of the temporal sequence of Lewy body neuropathology evolution in PD, and partly upon the olfactory , autonomic and sleep symptoms associated with the prodromal period of PD. These authors propose that a viral pathogen enters the brain both via the nasal mucosa and from the gastro-intestinal epithelium, possibly after swallowing nasal secretions, whence it travels to the brainstem via the vagus (both of which routes have been found suitable in experimental animals for the transport of influenza virus). The Braak model envisages a 20-year prodromal period prior to the diagnosis of parkinsonism, followed by 20 years of clinical disease progression.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>255</sup></xref></p><p id="Par494">The timetable of neuropathology and clinical symptoms proposed by the Braak model, however, is quite dissimilar to that of EL. The most obvious differences are the absence of encephalitis or similar event at the beginning of the CNS process in PD, the fact that there was no evidence for the anterior spread of neuropathology in EL, and the gradual onset of parkinsonian symptoms in PD. While it is true that there was no recognizable encephalitic period in a large proportion of EL cases, the entire Braak process is gradual, with neuropathology advancing from the olfactory bulb and brainstem to more anterior regions, ultimately reaching the cerebral cortex, resulting in clinical dementia over a period of years to decades . Even in its &#x02018;gradual onset&#x02019; forms, acute EL was a more abrupt process, and the evolution of parkinsonian symptoms more rapid once they had appeared. Further, despite exceptions that test the rule, the EL process was almost exclusively limited to the mesencephalon, as far as can be determined . Braak and colleagues have themselves always emphasized that their model applied to idiopathic PD, not to PEP.</p><p id="Par495">These objections might be overcome by objecting that the &#x02018;PD pathogen&#x02019; was much more virulent during the 1920s, and that it is now a more subtle, slow-moving aggressor. It should, however, be remembered that those who had the opportunity to observe PD and PEP cases side by side were generally convinced that they were distinct disorders, and this impression was confirmed by their neuropathology. Parkinsonism is, after all, no more a nosological entity than encephalitis, but rather a syndrome with a multiplicity of potential causes: when PEP was first encountered, PD was the major recognized form of parkinsonism, so that to suspect an association between the two was as natural as the suspicion that the &#x02018;encephalitis (lethargica) virus&#x02019; was also responsible for PVE and PIE . Today, however, multiple parkinsonian syndromes are recognized &#x02014; primary forms, including sporadic and genetic PD, progressive supranuclear palsy , cortico-basal degeneration, Lewy body disease, as well as acquired types, including parkinsonism secondary to CNS damage caused by infection, toxins, drugs, or physical trauma &#x02014; and it is no longer assumed that all share a common pathogenesis: it is, in fact, presumed that they do not.</p><p id="Par496">At the same time, attention has turned to the role of microglia in neuroinflammation, as well as their significance in the etiology of PD. This has included revival of Spatz&#x02019; idea that the microglia, not the nerve cells, might be the primary site of action for CNS-invasive pathogens, and that neuronal degeneration is <italic>secondary</italic> to microglial activation, possibly by a &#x02018;hit and run&#x02019; mechanism: the virus might stimulate glial activity but vacates the infected area long before symptoms of nervous dysfunction are manifest. It was formerly thought that microglia existed in one of two states, resting and activated, but it is now clear that the &#x02018;resting state&#x02019; is actually one of continuous monitoring of the local environment. Microglial activity is modulated or altered by a vast number of factors, including pathogens, in response to which the glia secrete a variety of chemical messengers and active metabolites, with the ultimate aim of protecting the integrity of local neural infrastructure and function. It is possible, however, that stimulation of microglia by pathogens or toxins can elicit inappropriate responses that are deleterious to nerve cells, particularly in those regions where microglia occur in particularly high numbers &#x02014; such as the substantia nigra. It is thus clear that they play a critical role in both the positive and negative effects of local CNS inflammation.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>256</sup></xref></p><p id="Par498">It is not surprising that the CNS bodyguards should be responsible for the earliest responses to invasion of the CNS, but the question of whether this response commences prior to or as a result of neuronal injury remains open. Early, microglial changes suggesting active involvement in tissue remodeling and degeneration have been reported to occur early in PD , possibly as the result of stimulation by members of the synapse protein family, the synucleins.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>257</sup></xref> Further, a number of viruses are now known to exhibit a degree of gliotropism &#x02014; including the Borna disease, human herpes 6 , JC and human immunodeficiency viruses<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>258</sup></xref> &#x02014; which would allow an infection mechanism centred upon the microglia rather than the nerve cells themselves, a mechanism that the neuropathology of EL suggested to Spatz in the mid-1920s. Alternatively, an attack upon the astrocyte population could result in the withdrawal of support for dopaminergic neurons or to microglial activation, as described for Borna disease virus ,<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>259</sup></xref> also leading to neurodegeneration.</p><p id="Par502">In short, PEP and PD share many features, but the two remain distinct disorders linked primarily by the fact that the substantia nigra is central to both: a relationship of place rather than of process. This is not to exclude the possibility of common elements in the pathophysiology of PD and PEP (and, indeed, of other &#x02018;atypical &#x02019; parkinsonian forms). The &#x02018;EL virus&#x02019; may have availed itself of the neural pathways implicated by the Braak model, for example, but this does not imply that the same pathogen was involved. Just as importantly, the presentation of parkinsonism during acute neuroinflammation cannot be interpreted, without further evidence, as EL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par503">There have been no reported cases that can be confidently ascertained as genuine EL since the 1970s, and before that it had been quite rare since the early 1930s (with the possible exception of the USSR ). Nor have any other disorders been identified that can be regarded as genuine &#x02018;successor disorders&#x02019;. For all intents and purposes, EL was an infectious disorder that flared into life for the first and only time during the First World War, and burned in Europe and North America for ten to fifteen years before being extinguished, a few sporadic cases in the decade before and a few decades after the epidemic notwithstanding.</p><p id="Par504">During its ascendancy, EL was the major encephalitis type, the only one that occurred in epidemic form, so that many of its features were new to clinical and laboratory neuroscience. Encephalitis of various etiologies and types have since been identified, although epidemics of human encephalitis remain rare, particularly in developed countries, and none presents a picture that can be completely reconciled with that of EL. There are brainstem encephalitides , encephalitides that elicit transitory extrapyramidal symptoms , others in which the neuropathology includes some of the features described in EL &#x02014; but none that reproduce the complete compilation of characteristics that facilitated the recognition of EL as a distinct nosological entity during the 1920s. It is not impossible that a shift from epidemic to sporadic disease would involve other changes in the behavior of the disorder that obfuscate the relationship with the historical disorder, but this would be scarcely useful speculation.</p><p id="Par505">A second problem could be that EL was defined to a large extent by its three-phase pattern, particularly by the emergence of chronic symptoms at variable intervals after the end of the acute disease. The diagnosis of acute EL outside an epidemic will always be fraught with risk, simply because similar symptoms can be elicited by any of number of pathologic processes that involve the brainstem. Verification of a diagnosis of <italic>chronic</italic> EL, while not entirely uncomplicated, was always easier, and this phase of EL is no longer seen.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>260</sup></xref> The emergence of chronic EL might be blocked by more recent medical interventions &#x02014; provided one does not succumb to the temptation to interpret, for example, chronic fatigue syndromes as post-EL neurasthenia , or attention deficit disorders as post-EL behavioral change. EL was, however, recognized as a new disorder before the regularity of its chronic evolution had been recognized, and more recent &#x02018;EL&#x02019; cases simply do not conform with the recognized patterns of historical EL. It could once again be argued that the pathogen has changed since the 1920s, but this simply begs the question and contributes nothing to the solution of the EL enigma.</p><p id="Par507">Finally, the finding that different pathogens and toxins can elicit <italic>some</italic> symptoms or phenomena observed in EL might suggest that EL was not a <italic>single</italic> disorder, but a conglomeration of different conditions. Vilensky and colleagues, in particular, have suggested that PEP did not have a unitary etiology.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>261</sup></xref> This position, however, is undermined by two key features of EL. Firstly, as discussed in chapter&#x000a0;10.1007/978-1-4939-0384-9_7, the neuropathology provided a reliable unifying framework, both by the remarkable consistency of <italic>post mortem</italic> findings throughout the EL period, across different outbreaks and EL forms, and by providing a contrast with the CNS picture seen in other encephalitides. Further, EL occurred as a series of more or less sharply defined outbreaks in different countries and on different continents; clinical reports described a variety of manifestations that were nonetheless restricted in their variety. It would seem a remarkable coincidence that thousands of cases presenting the same neuropathological features &#x02014; a constellation of features not described in more than a handful of cases either prior to the EL period or afterwards &#x02014; should be elicited by a variety of pathogens rather than by a single invader.</p><p id="Par509">Kenton Kroker (Toronto, Canada) took an even more radical position in his discussion of American EL research, arguing that the disorder had been &#x02018;constructed&#x02019; by investigators during the 1920s: the transmogrification of a mere syndrome into a disease. In support of this interpretation, the pioneer virologist Thomas Milton Rivers (1888&#x02013;1962) is cited as writing in his review of Neal &#x02019;s 1942 encephalitis monograph that <italic>&#x0201c;Epidemic encephalitis &#x02026; had simply been re-written as a more precise series of diagnostic categories&#x0201d;</italic>.

<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>262</sup></xref> Rivers had asserted nothing more than was common knowledge by 1942: the outbreak of EL, followed by the emergence of further viral encephalitides, had advanced refinement of the concept of &#x02018;encephalitis&#x02019; as a phenomenon, had revealed that different types of encephalitis could be distinguished at the neuropathologic level, and also that encephalitis could be elicited by several different pathogens by different means. That is, EL was no longer <italic>the</italic> epidemic encephalitis, but this by no means discredited its existence as a genuine infectious disease, as Rivers &#x02019; publications throughout this period indicate. EL was all too real for those who experienced it, whether as patients, family and friends, physicians or investigators: <italic>&#x0201c;when an abstraction starts to kill you, you have to get to work on it.&#x0201d;</italic>
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>263</sup></xref></p><p id="Par512">There is no longer any shortage of both viral and non-viral pathogens that <italic>can</italic> induce encephalitis<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>264</sup></xref> or extrapyramidal motor symptoms ,<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>265</sup></xref> but none that are suitable as candidates for the &#x02018;EL virus&#x02019;. If EL was caused by a pathogen known to contemporary medicine, its pathogenicity or virulence have altered so radically that it is now unrecognizable. Whether it exerted its deleterious effects by direct attack upon an element of the CNS, triggering of an auto-immune cascade, or opening the door for another virus (for example, by disrupting the blood&#x02013;brain barrier) also remains unknown, further complicating the search for the &#x02018;EL virus&#x02019;; the neuropathology it left in its wake provides, in any case, the most reliable material for the further consideration of the question.</p><p id="Par515">In the end, it should not be entirely surprising that the EL virus proved (and proves) to be so difficult to apprehend. Even today, the pathogen cannot be identified in a large proportion of suspected acute encephalitis cases (between 25 and 100%, depending upon the study), despite the application of technology of unprecedented sensitivity, and it is probable that a large number of encephalitis cases are missed altogether.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>266</sup></xref> The concept of &#x02018;mild encephalitis&#x02019; as the basis of psychiatric disease &#x02014; including infection of humans with the Borna disease virus 
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>267</sup></xref> &#x02014; is now joined by thoughts that the etiopathogenesis of a range of neurological disorders may also involve infections, either as a direct result of invasion of the CNS or via their triggering of an auto-immune chain of events. The problem with such hypotheses is the difficulty in testing them: infectious disease medicine has moved well beyond the world that Koch knew, where a given pathogen could be expected to elicit a fairly consistent set of responses in most people. Most of the recognized CNS conditions elicited by viruses are in themselves exceptional: herpes encephalitis is, for example, suffered by only a vanishingly small proportion of those who are infected by the virus. Exploration of the complex roles played not only by genetic and acquired immunologic predisposition, but also lifestyle and social factors in the interactions between an individual and a pathogen that determine whether that person will be infected and, if so, with what consequences, had commenced during the EL period, and advances in the technology available for such exploration have only complicated matters further. The &#x02018;EL virus&#x02019; is consequently all the more elusive because it was not the virus that caused EL, but rather the virus that caused EL <italic>under certain conditions in certain persons</italic>. Authors wondered before the arrival of EL why encephalitis was not more common, given the frequency of inflammation elsewhere in the body. The EL period included the discovery of many of the features that protect the brain from invasion, including the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and the activities of neuroglia, but in the meantime we also know that not all invaders are held at bay, and that the evidence of their successful access can be more subtle than flagrant inflammation and obvious illness.</p><p id="Par518">The epidemiology of EL most closely resembled that of epidemic polio, another grey matter inflammation. This similarity is also instructive: although the polio virus was identified before the emergence of EL, and despite the fact that it was also the subject of intensive investigation, ultimately leading to its eradication in most part of the world, a great deal remains unknown about its epidemiology, particularly with regard to its seemingly selective attack upon the motor systems of a very small minority of those it infects. If these mysteries could not be solved for a known virus that troubled the Western world for two or three 20th century generations, the failure to explain another that persisted for less than two decades during the childhood of clinical virology seems less improbable.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>268</sup></xref></p><p id="Par520">On the basis of the evidence discussed in this book it may be concluded that there once existed a specific &#x02018;EL virus&#x02019; that accounted for the majority of EL cases during the epidemic period. It can also be concluded that the inter-World War epidemic was the <italic>only</italic> epidemic of this disorder, and that even sporadic cases have not been described for more than a generation. Whether this means that the pathogen has since assumed a more benign form that we do not recognize, or that a known pathogen changed in virulence during in the first quarter of the 20th century before again resuming a more placid existence, cannot be determined with historical methods alone. The absence of viral nucleic acids in archived tissue and of antibodies in the CSF and blood of EL patients does not exclude the possibility that a known pathogen was involved, but it is also clear that none even occasionally replicates the clinical and neuropathologic picture of EL. Finally, the &#x02018;specificity&#x02019; of the &#x02018;EL virus&#x02019; for the substantia nigra should not be overly accentuated: it is possible that the black substance was doomed not by a specific predilection of the mesencephalic invader for its cells, but by their inherent susceptibility to effects, direct and indirect, elicited by the virus locally or at a distance.<xref ref-type="sec" rid="FPar1"><sup>269</sup></xref></p><p id="Par522">It is appropriate here to reiterate the Davenport maxim I included at the end of my first chapter: when discussing the epidemiology and etiology of a disorder, <italic>&#x0201c;hypotheses must provide satisfactory explanations for all the known findings &#x02014; not just for a convenient subset of them.&#x0201d;</italic>
