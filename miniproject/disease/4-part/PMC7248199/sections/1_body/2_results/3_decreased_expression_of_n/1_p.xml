<p>To understand the role of NLRC5 in the innate immune response to AIV in chicken macrophages, we compared the transcriptional profiles of NLRC5 KD and mock-transfected cells infected with LPAIV H5N2 using a chicken RT
 <sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR array which allows simultaneous screening of expression levels of 84 pre-selected immune genes. From the full data set (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Overall, pattern recognition receptor genes, genes relating to the inflammatory response, and genes involved in viral defense showed increased expression in the AIV-infected NLRC5 KD cells compared to control cells, suggesting that NLRC5 plays a role in the regulation of genes in these categories. Conversely, expression of innate cytokines such as IFN-β, IL-15, IL-18, IL-1β, and IL-8, were decreased. This result was further confirmed by evaluating the mRNA expression of two innate cytokines in the NLRC5 KD cells. Both IL-1β and IL-18 transcripts were lower in the NLRC5 KD cells as compared to the mock-transfected controls (
