<p>Viruses used in this study include: Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) A/mallard/duck/England/7277/06 (H2N3), A/chicken/Pennsylvania/7659/1985 (H5N2) and A/chicken/Pennsylvania/3779-2/1997 (H7N2) and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) A/turkey/England/50-92/91 (H5N1) of classical lineage, A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (H5N1) of contemporary Eurasian lineage, and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). All viruses were propagated in 9- to 11-day old embryonated chicken eggs as described elsewhere (Brauer and Chen, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Briefly, the chicken eggs were candled to aid in marking the air sac and relatively low vascular region. The eggshell was pierced at the marked location and 100 μl of virus inoculum was delivered to the allantoic cavity using a tuberculin syringe with a 26-gauge needle. The eggshell was sealed with glue, and the eggs were placed in an egg incubator at 37°C. At 72 h post infection (hpi), the allantoic fluid was harvested and centrifuged at 330 g for 15 min. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80°C. All experiments involving HPAIV were performed under biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) conditions. All LPAIV experimentation was performed in BSL-2.
