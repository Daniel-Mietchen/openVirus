<p>Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) have gained increased attention in recent years for their role in the modulation of innate immune responses, modulating a wide array of pathways in response to viral infection. The CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5) protein is the largest NLR member and is highly expressed in the myeloid and lymphoid immune cell lineages (Kuenzel et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While NLRC5 has been well-described as an inducer of MHC I genes in many cell types (Kobayashi and Van Den Elsen, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), various roles have been demonstrated in recent years, sometimes showing contradicting effects to innate immune processes. For example, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of NLRC5 expression in various cell types has shown both enhancement (Cui et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) as well as the decrease of interferon (IFN) response (Kuenzel et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), suggesting NLRC5 can act as a positive and negative regulator of IFN response during viral infection. These contradictory reports also suggest that the role of NLRC5 could be cell type and/or stimulus specific (Ranjan et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
