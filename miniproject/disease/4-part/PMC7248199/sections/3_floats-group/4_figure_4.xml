  <p>Reduced virus titers of LPAIV and HPAIV in NLRC5 KD chicken macrophages. MQ-NCSU cells were transfected with NLRC5 siRNA or non-specific control siRNA (scramble) and infected with H5N2, H7N2 or H5N1 at 32 hpt. NLRC5 mRNA and viral RNA were quantified by qRT-PCR. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> NLRC5 mRNA levels were measured at 32 hpt and compared to control. Viral RNA levels were measured by M-gene amplification at 8 and 24 hpi with 
   <bold>(B)</bold> H5N2 and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> H5N1. Supernatant infectious virus production was measured using relative equivalence units (REUs) at 8 and 24 hpi with 
   <bold>(D)</bold> H5N2 or 
   <bold>(E)</bold> H7N2. Data represents average of three biological replicates with error bars showing standard deviation.
