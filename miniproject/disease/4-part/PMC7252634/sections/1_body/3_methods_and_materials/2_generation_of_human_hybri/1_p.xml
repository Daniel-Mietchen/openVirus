<p>Approximately 10 million cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and transformed with Epstein-Barr virus obtained from the supernatant of B95.8 cells in a suspension also containing a Chk2 inhibitor, cyclosporin A, and CpG, and the mixture was plated in a 384-well cell culture plate. After 7 days, transformed cells in each well were transferred to a well in 96-well plates containing a feeder layer of irradiated cells that were PBMCs obtained from discarded leukofiltration devices (Nashville Red Cross). After an additional 5 days, the supernatants of expanded cells were screened for the presence of RRV-reactive antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), described below. Transformed B cells from wells containing supernatant with antibodies reactive to RRV were fused to the HMMA2.5 non-secreting myeloma cell line using an established electrofusion technique [
