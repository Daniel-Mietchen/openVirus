<p>In Brazil, CHIKV was first detected in September 2014, almost simultaneously in the cities of Oiapoque, in the northern state of Amapá, where the Asian genotype was implicated (

 </xref>,
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). The virus spread rapidly throughout the country, reaching all states by 2015 (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>9</italic>
 </xref>), and peaked in 2016, when ≈280,000 probable cases were recorded (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>10</italic>
 </xref>). The northeast region was the most affected by CHIKV (

 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>10</italic>

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">
