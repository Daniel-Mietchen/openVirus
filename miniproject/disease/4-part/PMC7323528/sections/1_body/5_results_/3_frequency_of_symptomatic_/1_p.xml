<p>Of the 209 participants with detected CHIKV IgG, 32 (15.3%) recalled an episode of fever and arthralgia after January 2015. The median duration of arthralgia for these 32 positive participants was 5 (IQR 3â€“9) days; the longest duration was 60 days for 1 person. Participants with symptomatic infection tended to be older (p = 0.07); more frequently reported other clinical manifestations compatible with CHIKV infection, such as myalgia, rash, and pruritus (p&lt;0.01 for each symptom); and more commonly received a presumptive clinical diagnosis of chikungunya or Zika (p&lt;0.01 for both) but not of dengue (p = 0.62) (
