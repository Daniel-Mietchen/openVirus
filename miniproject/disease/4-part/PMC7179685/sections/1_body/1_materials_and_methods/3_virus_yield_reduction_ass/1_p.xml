<p>Zika virus yield reduction following treatment with iminosugars was assessed by measuring the NS1 gene by a previously described quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and infectious virus titration in Vero cells (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Goebel et al., 2016</xref>). Vero and CHME3 cells pre-treated 1 μM of castanospermine, celgosivir or DNJ for 2 h and then were infected with PRVABC59 either at MOI 0.5 or 5 in infection medium. After 2 h of incubation with the virus, medium from cells was removed, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline, and fresh infection medium containing 1 μM of castanospermine, celgosivir or DNJ was added to the wells. At 48 and 72 hpi, culture supernatants were harvested and stored at −80°C until use for viral RNA extraction. Viral RNA was extracted from 50 μl of sample using the MagMAX-96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States) on a MagMAX Express-96 Deep Well Magnetic Particle Processor (Applied Biosystems). The amount of ZIKV genomic RNA was measured by qRT-PCR using SuperScript
 <sup>®</sup> III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The primers (F: 5′-ATATCGGACATGGCTTCGGA-3′, R: 5′-GTTCTTTTACAGACATATTGAGTGTC-3′) and probe sequence (5′- FAM-TGCCCAACA/ZEN/CAAGGTGAAGCC TACCT-BHQ) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT; Coralville, IA, United States), and the qRT-PCR cycling conditions included an initial cDNA synthesis for 30 min at 50°C, followed by 2 min at 95°C and 45 cycles of 2-step cycling at 95°C for 15 s, then 55°C for 30 s (

 <sub>50</sub> value. Cell culture supernatants were titrated for the infectious virus in Vero cells, and titer was expressed as TCID
 <sub>50</sub> calculated using the Reed-Muench method (
