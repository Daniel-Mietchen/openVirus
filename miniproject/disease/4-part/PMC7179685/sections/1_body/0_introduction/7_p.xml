<p>Although iminosugars seem to be effective antivirals against many flaviviruses, only one recent report has examined the role of these compounds in ZIKV infection (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). In these studies, hepatocellular carcinoma cells with the knockout of α-glucosidases I or II supported a reduced level of ZIKV viral replication compared with wild-type cells (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). ER α-glucosidases I was more critical in reducing virus replication in comparison to ER α-glucosidase II (

To date, no investigations of the use of iminosugars against ZIKV in clinically relevant cell types, such as human brain cells, have been reported. There is no information about potential differential sensitivity to iminosugars between African or Asian lineage ZIKVs.
