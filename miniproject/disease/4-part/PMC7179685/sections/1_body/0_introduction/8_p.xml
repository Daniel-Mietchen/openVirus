<p>Here, we report the ability of iminosugars comprising a monocyclic amine deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and bicyclic amines castanospermine and celgosivir that possess ER-AGI activity to inhibit replication of multiple strains of ZIKVs from different lineages 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in both Vero cells and human microglia CHME3 cells. Iminosugar treatment resulted in a significant reduction in ZIKV replication and cell necrosis. Notably, iminosugar treatment did not alter apoptosis and antiviral response of ZIKV infected cells.
