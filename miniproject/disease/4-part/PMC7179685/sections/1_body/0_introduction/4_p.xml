<p>Current strategies for the prevention and control of ZIKV involves vector control and symptomatic therapy. Despite the considerable need for novel antiviral therapies, currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs to prevent and treat ZIKV infection. A primary focus of current ZIKV antiviral research is directed at targeting virus entry and the virus replication pathways. ZIKV entry is mediated by a set of proposed receptors such as T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) and TYRO-3, AXL, and MERTK (TAM) families (

A significant downside of virus-directed antiviral agents in the development of resistance, especially in the case of RNA viruses that have a high mutation rate. Hence, a combination of virus-directed and host-directed antivirals could be a more practical approach for ZIKV antiviral therapy.
