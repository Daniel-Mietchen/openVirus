<p>Zika virus has been shown to induce apoptosis in different sets of cells, such as fetal neural progenitor cells, cranial neural crest cells, peripheral neurons, dendritic cells and microglia (

Levels of activated caspases 3 and 7 were measured to investigate the if iminosugar treatment could affect the apoptosis response in PRVABC59 ZIKV-infected cells. CHME3 infection with ZIKV strain PRVABC59 at MOI 1 substantially increased activated caspases 3 and 7 levels at 48 and 72 hpi (
