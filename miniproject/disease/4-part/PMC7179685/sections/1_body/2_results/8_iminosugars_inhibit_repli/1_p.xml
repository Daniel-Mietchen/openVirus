<p>Iminosugars were further evaluated for antiviral activity against two other ZIKV isolates in Vero cells by measuring reduction of cytopathic effect (cell death) after ZIKV infection. An African lineage strain isolated from a human patient in Nigeria in 1968, IBH30656, and an Asian lineage strain isolated from an 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito in Mexico in 2016, MEX 2-81, were used to infect cells Vero cells. When cells were treated with iminosugar, ZIKV-induced cell death was reduced regardless of the ZIKV strain or cell type used (
