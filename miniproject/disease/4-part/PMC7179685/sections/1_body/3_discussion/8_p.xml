<p>We have shown here three iminosugars that are active against ZIKV in a dose-dependent manner 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results are encouraging and are essential as a starting point for further validation of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models. In conclusion, the results of this study increase the possibility that iminosugars may be a promising therapeutic against ZIKV infections.
