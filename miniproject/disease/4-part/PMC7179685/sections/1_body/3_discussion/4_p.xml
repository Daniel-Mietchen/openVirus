<p>Iminosugars are known to interfere with viral protein synthesis as well as the maturation of viral particles (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). ER α-glucosidase I removes the terminal α1,2-linked glucose from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, and α-glucosidase II removes the second and third glucose before further processing to become a mature virion (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). We found that iminosugar treatment resulted both in reduced viral RNA and lower infectious virus in cell culture supernatant compared with vehicle-treated cells, indicating impaired virus replication leading to production of fewer virus particles. Notably, the reduction in infectious virus titer was much higher than the reduction in viral RNA. This observation suggests that there are also defective particles suggesting inefficient virus maturation in iminosugar-treated cells. Viral RNA measured by qRT-PCR that is not accounted for by infectious virus particles likely represents viral RNA encapsulated in non-infectious virions (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Sayce et al., 2016</xref>). While our experiments did not investigate the mechanism underlying the ability of iminosugars to inhibit ZIKV replication, our results suggest that the reduction in ZIKV-induced cell death by iminosugars occurs through reducing the secretion of infectious virus particles or by secreting particles that are less infectious.
