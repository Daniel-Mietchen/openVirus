<p id="Par61">On the other hand, it is not a trivial task to predict the 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site occupancy from the protein sequences inferred from protein sequences. In past decades, a number of computational methods have been developed for predicting 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites given a protein sequence. Most of these methods were based on machine learning approaches, such as neural network [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], support vector machine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], and random forest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. These methods consider neighboring sequences and protein structure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] and assign a probability for a 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site for each position. To be the best of our knowledge, little is known the specific mutation patterns (in addition to sequon) are associated with acquisition or loss of a 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site in influenza viruses.
