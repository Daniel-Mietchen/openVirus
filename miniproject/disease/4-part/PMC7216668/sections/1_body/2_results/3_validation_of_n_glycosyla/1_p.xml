<p id="Par52">During antigenic drift event from RU77 to SG86, the H1N1 virus gained two potential 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites at 54 and 125, both of which were predicted to play an important role in determining antigenic variations between RU77 and SG86. To determine whether 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites 54 and 125 are expressed 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans, we performed glycoproteomics analyses for HA proteins of A/Texas/36/1991(H1N1), which was clustered into SG86. Sequence analyses showed that 11 potential 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, including 10 (NNST), 11(NSTD), 23(NVTV), 54(NCSV), 87(NGTC), 125(NHTV), 160(NLSK), 269(NASM), 287 (NSSL), 481(NGTY), and 540(NGSL), of which 54(NCSV) and 125(NHTV) are unique to the viruses in SG86 from RU77. In the mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomics analyses, eight of these 11 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites except 10 (NNST), 11(NSTD), and 540(NGSL) were identified in the glycopeptides, and four sites were identified with 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycan occupancy. Site 54(NCSV) has three types of complex 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycans: HexNAc:2 Hex:5, HexNAc:2 Hex:6, HexNAc:2 Hex:7; site 125(NHTV) has HexNAc:5, Hex:5, Fuc:1; site 160 (NLSK) has HexNAc:2 Hex:7 or HexNAc:2; Hex:8; and site 269 (NASM) has HexNAc:2 Hex:7 or HexNAc:3 Hex:6 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Of note, the 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites 54 (NCSV) and 125 (NHTV) were predicted to drive antigenic drift from RU77 to SG86; and 54 (NCSV), 125 (NHTV), 160 (NLSK) were predicted cause antigenic variations among swine IAVs. In summary, all three predicted 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylating sites (i.e., 54, 125, and 160) affecting antigenic variations were validated to be with 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycan complex occupancy.
