<p id="Par19">We formulated the study of antigenicity as a multi-task sparse learning problem with the aim to identify gene sequence, proteome, and site-specific 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation as antigenicity determinants. We developed a multi-task learning sparse group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (MTL-SGL) machine-learning model to assess antigenic changes in human, swine, and avian H1N1 IAVs. All of three 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites identified by MTL-SGL to determine antigenic changes were experimentally validated using glycoproteomics. Based on these three features, we developed a sequence-based model and used it to illustrate the antigenic evolution of H1N1 IAVs.
