<p id="Par16">The subtype of an influenza A virus (IAV) is determined based on the subtypes of its virus surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). A total of 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been reported for IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among hundreds of combinations of HA and NA subtypes, H1N1 is one of only a few causing significant burdens to public health. Two of four documented influenza pandemics (in 1918 and 2009) were caused by subtype H1N1 IAVs, and the 1918 resulting in &gt; 40 million human deaths worldwide [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, H1N1 IAVs have been a predominant cause of seasonal influenza outbreaks between 1918 to 1957 and since 1977. Strains of the 1977 influenza A(H1N1) virus were responsible for outbreaks during the 1977–78 to 2008–09 seasons, but in 2009, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus took over as the new seasonal influenza virus. Genetic characterization suggested that the 1918 A(H1N1) pandemic [hereafter referred to as A(H1N1)pdm1918] virus was the precursor to the seasonal 1977 A(H1N1) [hereafter referred to as A(H1N1)season1977] virus and the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Sequence analyses showed numerous mutations in the HA of these A(H1N1)season1977 and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, including mutations in antibody binding sites and glycosylation sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Serologic characterization suggested that A(H1N1)pdm1918 has a low level of cross-reactivity with A(H1N1)pdm09 and that A(H1N1)season1977 and A(H1N1)pdm09 do not cross-react with each other [
