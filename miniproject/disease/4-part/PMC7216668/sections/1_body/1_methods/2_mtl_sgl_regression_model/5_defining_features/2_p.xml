<p id="Par37">where {N
 <sub>1</sub>, N
 <sub>2</sub>, …, N
 <sub>p</sub>} denotes changes associated with 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation and {M
 <sub>1</sub>, M
 <sub>2</sub>, …, M
 <sub>q</sub>} is the set of mutations being associated without 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation. These two groups of features were assumed to be non-redundant. To consider the biochemical properties of amino acids, we adopted the score of pattern-induced multi-sequence alignment (PIMA) into the regularization function for M, as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; PIMA assigned 20 amino acids into 9 groups, and gave a different numerical coding for different mutations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. For 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation, the binary scoring schema was used as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. PIMA coding and binary coding achieved similar performance on our dataset (data not shown); thus, for consistency, a binary coding schema was used for all features.
