<p id="Par21">The overall objective of this study is to identify mutations and changes in 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites in HA proteins being associated with antigenic changes of subtype H1N1 IAVs and further to develop a quantitative function for quantifying antigenic distances giving protein sequences of HA proteins. In this study, we formulated this problem into a multi-task sparse learning problem (see the details in problem formulation) by the facts that previous studies suggested that sparse learning algorithm was effective in identifying antigenicity associated features in protein sequences from multiple subtypes of IAVs, including H5N1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], H3N2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and H1N1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and that multi-task formulation can overcome the challenges in data integration for influenza serological data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To make our model be flexible to integrate multiple types of features, group Lasso is further introduced into MTL-SPG so that the model can learning simultaneously two types of features affecting influenza virus antigenicity (i.e. sequence and 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation).
