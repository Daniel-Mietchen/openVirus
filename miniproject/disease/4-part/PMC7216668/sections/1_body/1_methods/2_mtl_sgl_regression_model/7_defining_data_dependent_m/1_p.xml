<p id="Par41">In this study, a total of five individual tasks were designed from three datasets. Specifically, datasets 2 and 3 were each designed as individual tasks, and the data for A(H1N1)season1977 viruses from 1977 to 2009 (i.e., dataset 1) had a banded structure similar to that for the data for H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. If we arrange antigens and antibodies in an HI matrix according to time, most of the high reactors appear very close to the diagonal zone, whereas the low reactors and the missing values appear far away from the diagonal zone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A low-rank matrix completion method successfully overcame this band structure specific challenge by giving an approximate estimation to the low reactors and missing values. Our prior studies suggested that multi-task matrix completion further simplified the data analyses and improved prediction performance, as described in Han et al. from whom we adapted a multi-task low-rank matrix completion platform by dividing dataset 1 into multiple tasks. Specifically, the following protocol was implemented: 1) construct an antigenic map based on the HI matrix derived from low rank matrix completion; 2) identify antigenic clusters by using the spectral clustering method; 3) define antigenic drift for neighboring antigenic clusters; 4) define each antigenic drift event as an individual task; and 5) perform matrix completion for each task individually and then generate antigenic distances.
