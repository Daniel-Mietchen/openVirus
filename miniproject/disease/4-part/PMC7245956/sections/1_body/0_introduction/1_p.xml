<p> The emergence and development of vaccinology was primarily associated with the search for ways to protect against diseases such as smallpox (Latin 
 <italic>variola</italic>), a particularly dangerous infection that causes epidemics with a mortality rate of up to 40% or more in infected patients. Smallpox survivors were easily identified by the characteristic scars on their face skin (the so-called “pitted face”), which were left on the sites of pustules after the loss of dry crusts; these people became immune to smallpox whenever a new outbreak of the disease occurred. Apparently, these observations formed the basis for the inoculation of infectious material obtained by collecting skin crusts from smallpox patients into skin incisions (usually in the forearm), or intranasally, made on healthy people in India and China. This procedure, called 
 <italic>variolation</italic> (from variola inoculation), caused a moderately severe disease and provided further reliable protection against smallpox. However, 0.5 to 2% of variolated patients would die, which prevented widespread use of this procedure [
