<p> It should be noted that, because of lack of knowledge as to the infectious agent nature and mechanisms for protecting a person from smallpox after vaccine inoculation, E. Jenner, in his study published in 1801, predicted that “the annihilation of the smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final result of this practice” [

 <italic> Orthopoxvirus </italic>of the 
 <italic>Poxviridae </italic>family. Orthopoxviruses are antigenically close to each other, yield cross serological reactions, and provide an immune defense. The variola virus (VARV) reproduces only in humans, while CPXV, HSPV, and VACV are zoonotic viruses with a wide range of susceptible animals, including humans [

Thanks to the international campaign for strict epidemiological surveillance of smallpox, as well as smallpox vaccination carried out under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO) since 1958, smallpox was completely eradicated and the last natural case of the disease was encountered in October 1977 [
