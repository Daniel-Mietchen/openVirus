<p> The eradication of smallpox occurred before the advent of modern practices in virology, immunology, and molecular biology; since there are no animals susceptible to VARV, the development of a protective immune response to smallpox has had to be studied indirectly in surrogate models of smallpox infection. These models include the infection of mice with the mousepox virus (ectromelia, ECTV) or VACV; rabbits with the rabbitpox virus (RPXV) or VACV; monkeys with the monkeypox virus (MPXV), etc. Common patterns of a specific immune response have also been studied using smallpox vaccination of volunteers with VACV [
