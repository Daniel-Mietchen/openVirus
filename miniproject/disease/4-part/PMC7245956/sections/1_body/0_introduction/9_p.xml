<p> Both live and inactivated VACV vaccines contain mainly IMV particles obtained after the destruction of infected cells and purification of viral preparations. It should be noted that antibodies to both IMV and EEV antigens are induced only when VACV reproduces in the body of an animal. Furthermore, only a live virus in the body of the animal induces the synthesis of protective antibodies to non-virion proteins and stimulates a cellular immune response. That is why inactivated VACV vaccines do not provide complete antiviral protection [
