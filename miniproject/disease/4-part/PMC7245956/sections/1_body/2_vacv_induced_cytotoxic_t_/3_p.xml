<p> In early studies of the CTL response to orthopoxvirus infection/vaccination, researchers focused only on a limited number of antigens. Oseroff et al. [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] performed a bioinformatic sequence analysis of all VACV proteins and pinpointed 6,055 potential peptide T-cell epitopes that were synthesized and used in the analysis of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 31 vaccinated volunteers. They identified 48 epitopes from 35 different VACV proteins which effectively interacted with CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells of vaccinees. Subsequent studies identified additional orthopoxvirus T antigens [
