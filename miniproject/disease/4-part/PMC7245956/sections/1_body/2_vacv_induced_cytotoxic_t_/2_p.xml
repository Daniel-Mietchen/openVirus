<p> As demonstrated in a model of mice pre-infected with an avirulent ECTV strain, antiviral antibodies are necessary and sufficient to prevent the death of animals re-infected with a highly virulent ECTV and the absence of a T-cell immune response does not affect the survival of mice [
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In mice with B-cell deficiency (antibody synthesis), VACV infection of pre-vaccinated animals was shown to be accompanied by a decrease in body weight, as in unvaccinated mice, but an induction of virus-specific CTLs prevented death and led to a late recovery [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This response to re-infection may be explained by the fact that the pre-existing antibodies induced by vaccination can quickly neutralize the infecting virus, while reactivation of the virus-specific T cells generated after vaccination takes several days. Although CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are important for circumscribing a primary orthopoxvirus infection, antibodies play a dominant role in the protection against re-infection (infection after vaccination).
