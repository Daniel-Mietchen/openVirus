<p> Antibody biosynthesis is induced primarily in response to virion proteins whose genes are expressed at the late stage of the VACV development cycle (

This indicates the incompleteness of our knowledge about the development of a humoral immune response to a smallpox immunization/orthopoxvirus infection.
