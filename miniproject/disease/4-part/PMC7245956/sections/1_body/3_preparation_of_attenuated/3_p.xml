<p> The modern approach to virus attenuation involves directed inactivation of virulence genes without affecting the vital virus genes [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The virulence genes primarily include genes whose products modulate or suppress the numerous mechanisms of innate and/or adaptive immunity in a virus-infected organism [
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Orthopoxviruses are characterized by a uniquely large set of such genes. In recent years, many of these genes have been identified, and the properties of the proteins encoded by them have been studied [
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This diversity of virulence genes, on the one hand, enables the development of different variants of attenuated VACVs and, on the other hand, increases uncertainty in generating the most effective and safe vaccine. Each newly developed VACV variant requires numerous experiments in laboratory animals [
