<p> VACV attenuation can often lead to a reduced production of the virus 
 <italic>in vivo </italic>and, as a consequence, to a reduction in the induced immune defense of the body. Therefore, an effective antiviral immune response is achieved by introducing significantly higher doses of the newly created virus, compared to the original VACV strains, as well as by revaccination [
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The absence of knowledge about the functions of and interactions between orthopoxvirus immunomodulatory proteins and the multifactorial mammal immune system results in to a need to use experimenter intuitive assumptions when choosing mutable genes and combinations of them to create new, attenuated VACV strains. The immunogenicity/protectiveness and safety of these strains are tested in various biological systems. Of greatest interest is genomic editing of VACV, which, along with attenuation, can enhance the immunogenicity of the generated virus.
