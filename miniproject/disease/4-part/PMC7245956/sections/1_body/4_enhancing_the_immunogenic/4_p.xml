<p> Orthopoxviruses, in the course of co-evolution with sensitive animals, have developed various molecular mechanisms to suppress different stages of innate and adaptive immune response to infection. They encode numerous intracellular proteins that inhibit the development of apoptosis and different stages of molecular signaling pathways that induce the production of interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and extracellularly secreted proteins that interact and neutralize the activity of interferons, complement, and various cytokines and chemokines [
