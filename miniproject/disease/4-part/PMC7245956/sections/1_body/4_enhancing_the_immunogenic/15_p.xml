<p> The VACV LIVP strain was used to create a recombinant variant with five impaired virulence genes encoding hemagglutinin (
 <italic>A56R</italic>), a gamma-interferon- binding protein (
 <italic>B8R</italic>), thymidine kinase (
 <italic>J2R</italic>), a complement-binding protein (
 <italic>C3L</italic>), and a Bcl-2-like apoptosis inhibitor (
 <italic>N1L</italic>). Inactivation of these virulence genes was shown not to affect the reproductive properties of VACV in mammalian cell cultures. The produced VACV strain was characterized by significantly lower reactogenicity and neurovirulence compared to those of the original LIVP. Upon subcutaneous administration to mice, the recombinant VACV variant induced the production of VACV-neutralizing antibodies at a level comparable to that of the parental LIVP strain [

 <italic>A35R </italic>gene was additionally inactivated (
