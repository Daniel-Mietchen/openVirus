<p>The secondary outbreak did not occur while incrementing each parameter until the scenario arrived at β of 0.1–0.2, δ of 1/4–1/2, and ν of 1/10–1/7, when the total number of the recovered or removed patients was 46 (95% CrI 2–252) at day 100 and maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day was 13 (95% CrI 1–79) (

 <sub>0</sub> was 1.1 (IQR 0.8–1.4). However, when we increased β to 0.4–0.6, while keeping δ and ν the same, the secondary outbreak did not occur. With the same β of 0.4-0.6, increasing the duration until medical visit from 2 to 7 days, and 7 to 10 days (ν 1/7–1/2, 1/10–1/7 respectively), the total number of recovered or removed patients increased to 304 (95% CrI 2–919) and 874 (95% CrI 247–994) respectively, with R
 <sub>0</sub> of 1.4 (IQR 0.9–1.7) and 3.4 (IQH3.4 (IQR 2.5–4.2) respectively. Increasing β to 0.8–1.0 with δ of 1/4–1/2, and ν of 1/2–1 led to a total of 187 patients recovered or removed at day 100 (CrI 3–740) with R
