<p>Our results suggest that hundreds of newly diagnosed 2019-nCoV infections could occur within a bad scenario when a person with the infection enters into a community of a thousand. This means we need to be alert to the possibility that secondary transmission and spread of this virus is a very realistic possibility and be prepared for this future possibility. On the other hand, we also demonstrated that, with a good scenario, a secondary outbreak might not occur, as seen in most countries which have had 2019-nCoV imported cases as of this writing. Improving the alert system with early recognition of the infected persons could decrease or hold a secondary outbreak.</p>
