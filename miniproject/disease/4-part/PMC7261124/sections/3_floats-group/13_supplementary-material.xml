  <p>All percentages are shown to the nearest whole number. 
   <sup>
    <italic>a</italic>
   </sup> Amino acid number at the start and end of the nonamer position in the protein alignment. The symbol # denotes a highly conserved nonamer position (index incidence ≥90%), &amp; denotes a mixed-variable position (index incidence between 90% &amp; 20%), and + denotes a highly diverse nonamer position (index incidence ≤20%). See 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref> for the definition of diversity motifs. 
   <sup>∗</sup> Positions with total number of sequences less than 100 
   <sup>
    <italic>b</italic>
   </sup> Total number of protein sequences analysed at the aligned nonamer position; the difference in number between the nonamer positions was due to the inclusion of both partial and full-length sequences in the alignments. 
   <sup>
    <italic>c</italic>
   </sup> Shannon nonamer entropy, which indicates the level of diversity of the nonamer sequences at the position (
   <italic>H</italic>(
   <italic>x</italic>); see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref> for details). 
   <sup>
    <italic>d</italic>
   </sup> The index nonamer is the most prevalent sequence at the position. 
   <sup>
    <italic>e</italic>
   </sup> Variants are nonamer sequences that differ by one or more amino acids from the index sequence. 
   <sup>
    <italic>f</italic>
   </sup> The major variant is the second most common variant sequence at the position. 
   <sup>
    <italic>g</italic>
   </sup> Minor variants are multiple different repeated nonamer sequences, each occurring more than once and with an incidence of less than or occasionally equal to the major variant. 
   <sup>
    <italic>h</italic>
   </sup> Unique variants are nonamer sequences that are observed only once at the position. 
   <sup>
    <italic>i</italic>
   </sup> Nonatypes are distinct sequences among the variants for a given position.
