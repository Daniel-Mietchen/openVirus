<p>Avian and human H5N1 IAV protein sequences, both partial and full-length, and the corresponding metadata were retrieved from the publicly available Influenza Research Database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fludb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.fludb.org</ext-link>; as of January 2013) (
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Squires et al., 2012</xref>). Partial sequences were included for a comprehensive collection of the virus sequence data. The collected data were classified according to the 12 influenza A proteins (PB2, PB1, PB1-F2, PA, PA-X, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, NS2, NS1) for each host, avian and human. These hosts were chosen because they cover the majority of the reported influenza A virus sequences. The classified data were manually checked and cleaned of any irrelevant sequences.
