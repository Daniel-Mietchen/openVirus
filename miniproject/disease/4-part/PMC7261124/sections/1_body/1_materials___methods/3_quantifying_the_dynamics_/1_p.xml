<p>All sequences at each of the nonamer positions in the protein alignments were quantified and ranked based on the incidences of distinct sequences (as part of diversity motifs) present at the position, as described in 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2013)</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>) by use of an in-house Perl program. The patterns of the dynamics of sequence change and the frequency distribution of each of the diversity motifs for the avian and the human viruses were plotted using the Ggplot2 package (
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Wickham, 2016</xref>) or R (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2017</xref>) and studied in relation to increased total variants. The occurrence of motif switching as previously indicated by 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2013)</xref>, where fitness change of amino acids resulted in a motif change, was evaluated for both the human and avian viral proteomes.
