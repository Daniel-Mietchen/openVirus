<p>Based on the definitions of the diversity motifs, each individual variant motif had a distinctive pattern of incidence in relation to increased total variants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). These patterns were generally similar between the avian and human viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs. 3A</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3F</xref>). The major variant, the second most prevalent sequence of the aligned population, was transient with a pyramidal peak incidence of ∼46% for avian viruses and ∼49% for human viruses. The multiple different minor variants, each with an incidence lower or occasionally equal to that of the major variant, represented the principal variant motif, particularly for positions with total mutations (variants) of ≥ 50%. The unique variants were enigmatic as they were present for nearly all of the positions with non-zero total variants, albeit with a low proteome-wide average incidence of ∼1% for viruses of both avian and human hosts (maximum incidence of ∼11% and ∼14%, respectively). Nonatypes, a measure of multiple distinct variant sequences, occurred at nearly all of the positions (∼99% and ∼93% for viruses of avian and human, respectively), with a proteome-wide average incidence of ∼2% for distinct variants amongst avian viruses and ∼3% amongst human viruses. Notably, highly diverse nonamer positions (total variants of ≥ 80%) were almost non-existent in the H5N1 IAV proteomes of both avian and human viruses (one position and none, respectively).
