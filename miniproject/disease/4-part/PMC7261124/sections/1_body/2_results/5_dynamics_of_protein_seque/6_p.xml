<p>Collectively, the dynamics of the diversity motifs for the individual proteins were generally in agreement with the proteome patterns for both the avian and human viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figs. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5</xref>). This was particularly so for avian viral proteins, HA, NA, PA-X, and NS1, and human viral proteins, HA, NA and NS1; all of which are generally diverse and exhibited at least one position with a total variants incidence of ≥ 70%. However, a number of the avian viral proteins, such as M1 and PB1 did not have any data points for some ranges of total variants, starting from as low as ∼40%. In contrast, the relatively diverse protein, avian PB1-F2 did not have any data points for total variants below ∼18%. Additionally, there was a distinction in the dynamics of the diversity motifs for majority of the individual proteins between avian and human viruses, such as, in particular PA, PB1-F2, and M1.
