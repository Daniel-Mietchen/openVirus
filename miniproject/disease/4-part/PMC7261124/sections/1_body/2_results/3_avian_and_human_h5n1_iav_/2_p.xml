<p>The viral proteome in the human host also exhibited a low average individual protein entropy, with values ranging from ∼0.4 (PB1) to ∼1.5 (PB1-F2), and a proteome-wide average of ∼0.7. Correspondingly, akin to the avian viral proteome, the percentage of conservation was generally high, with average individual protein total variants ranging from as low as ∼6% (PB1) to ∼31% (PB1-F2), and a proteome-wide average of ∼14%. However, compared to the avian viral proteome, more than half (∼67%) of the proteins had an average entropy value of less than one. Even in the human viral proteome, PB1 was the most conserved viral protein, with an average entropy of ∼0.4 and an average total variants incidence of ∼6%. There were as many as 320 nonamer positions that were completely conserved amongst the human viruses, versus three for the avian viruses, all of which were in PB1. The maximum absolute entropy for viruses of the human host was ∼4.1 in the NA protein at position 38-46, which also happened to exhibit the highest absolute total variants (∼79%).</p>
