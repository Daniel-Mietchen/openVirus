<p>In this study, we applied a bioinformatics approach to characterize the diversity of avian and human H5N1 IAV protein sequences as different viral variant motif populations and illustrate the dynamic interplay between them. The publicly available protein sequence data, with reported viral isolate date range of at least 53 years (1959-2012), provides a compendium of the known sequence variants of H5N1 IAV. A similar study for HIV-1 clade B viruses, evaluating the amino acid make-up and incidence of the distinct sequence changes, in the context of antigenic diversity, had been reported by
