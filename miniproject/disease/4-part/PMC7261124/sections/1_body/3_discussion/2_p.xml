<p>Mutations of influenza and other viruses are manifsted in the interrelated dynamics of the proteome-wide distribution and the population-wide incidence of the sequence change. The index sequence, with an incidence range of 100% to ∼18%, had an inverse, linear relationship to the total concentration of mutations (total variants: 0% to ∼82%). Notably, highly diverse (index incidence ≤ 20%) positions were non-existent, except for the single nonamer position HA 170-178 of the avian viruses. This suggests a functional constraint (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Saakian et al., 2006</xref>) preventing the virus population from exploring a hypothetical peak fitness in the highly diverse region. This is in contrast to HIV-1 clade B viruses, which exhibited a large fraction of positions within the highly diverse range; such positions are thought to contribute to the general collapse of the early immunity to the virus (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). In keeping with the quasispecies model, the progeny viruses of H5N1, thus, do not seem to be capable of sequence plasticity as observed for certain positions of the HIV-1 genome (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>); perhaps this restriction for H5N1 is imposed by the need for the virus to survive in a diverse range of host species. Nonetheless, the observed patterns of H5N1 IAV sequence change seem sufficient in providing a spectrum of viral variants that enable the virus population to utilize changes in selection pressure and aid in the long-term evolutionary stability and versatility of the virus within the repertoire of the hosts. This pattern of sequence change supports the notion of a Darwinian dominant replicator (index) and a “clan” of variant molecules that can also have maximum reproductive fitness (
