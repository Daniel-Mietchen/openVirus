<p>The consequence of index switching to the immune-relevance of the affected nonamers was evaluated. The index and the major variants of the affected positions, generally, did not appear to be immune relevant, for both humoral and cellular responses; only one position demonstrated epitope loss due to index switching. Also, index switching positions (or the preceding positions) appeared unlikely important for preservation of viral function because they were generally of low intra-subtype (H5N1) incidence, below 55%. This suggests that the index switching positions may be of structural in nature, providing fitness benefit to the virus.</p>
