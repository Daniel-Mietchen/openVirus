<p>Microbiologic investigations were performed as described with modifications [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Blood culture (BacT/Alert; bioMerieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) was obtained and expectorated sputum showing &gt;25 white blood cells on high-power field with heavy/predominant bacterial growth was included in the analysis. Acid-fast smear with culture of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> was performed if pulmonary tuberculosis was suspected. In-house multiplex real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed on nasopharyngeal aspirate for the detection of respiratory viruses (influenza A, B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and enterovirus/rhinovirus), 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> using primers and conditions as described [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus were further genotyped using nested PCR of VP4/2 region (nucleotides 616–1004 numbered according to GenBank accession no. 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EF582385" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EF582385</ext-link> for RV-C4) followed by Sanger sequencing. Genotype was determined by similarity &gt;89.5%, 90.0%, and 89.5% in RV-A, -B and -C, respectively, with the alignment length of ≥355 base pairs, which covered ≥90% of the prototype [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Urine samples were tested for 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> serogroup 1 using urinary antigen tests (Alere BinaxNOW; Abbott, Chicago, IL).
