<p>Second, adherence to treatment guidelines was associated with better short- and long-term outcomes. This finding is reassuring, because no pathogens were identified in more than 50% of patients hospitalized with CAP in most studies using contemporary methods of pathogen identification [

In the absence of pathogen-guided therapy, good clinical outcomes would heavily rely on appropriate guideline-based recommendation in antibiotic treatment. In both the United States and Europe, adherence to local guidelines for patients hospitalized with CAP was associated with decreased time to clinical stability, shorter duration of hospitalization, lower in-hospital mortality, lower costs, and improved quality of life compared with over- and undertreatment [

Possible mechanisms include the impact of antibiotics on the risk of recurrent infections due to resistant pathogens and level of persistent inflammation [
