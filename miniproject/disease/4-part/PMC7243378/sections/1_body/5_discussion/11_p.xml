<p>There are some limitations of our study. The inability to obtain informed consent was one of the major reasons for exclusion in our screening process. Therefore, some of the critically ill patients would have been excluded from our analyses. We did not perform PCR testing for some atypical pathogens, including 
 <italic>Legionella</italic> species and 
 <italic>C burnetii</italic>; thus, we may have underestimated the proportions of patients with atypical pathogens. This study was conducted over an 18-month period, and it might not be representative of some pathogens, such as influenza, which varies in activity from year to year, and 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic>, which typically causes epidemics every 3 to 7 years [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The relatively short duration did not allow us to evaluate seasonality of various pathogens in our locality, which might have a bearing on the choice of empirical antibiotic treatment when patients present at different times of the year. Because this was an observational study, we might not have been able to adjust for potential confounders that might have affected physiciansâ€™ choice of empirical antibiotics as well as mortality.
