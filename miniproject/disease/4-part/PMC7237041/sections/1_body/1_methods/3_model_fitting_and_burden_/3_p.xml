<p>We further calculated vaccine impact of past vaccination activities by estimating the burden expected had these activities not taken place (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s002">S1 Appendix</xref>). We defined the lifetime impact of vaccination as the cumulative burden difference over the 2000–2100 time period between the baseline scenario, ie the burden calculated using the best estimates of vaccination coverage, and a counterfactual scenario of no vaccination. For each scenario, we summed the burden across each year between 2000–2100 and across all ages, before calculating the difference between the no-vaccination and the baseline scenario. Considering such a time horizon ensures we capture vaccine impact over most of the lifetime of people vaccinated and those benefitting from the resulting herd immunity.
