<p>The GLM quantifies geographic variation of the relative risk of YF report across the continent while each serological survey yields an estimate of the absolute transmission intensity in its specific location. For each of the 31 survey locations we can therefore estimate the local level of under-ascertainment by tying GLM predictions to estimated values of
