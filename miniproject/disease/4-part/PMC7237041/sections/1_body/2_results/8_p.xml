 </sub> in 2018, that is the transmission potential in a partially immune population, together with the categorisation (arbitrarily defined based on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>eff</italic>
 </sub>) of provinces for several PMVCs strategies. Due to low &gt;1 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> values (by assumption) and non-existent vaccination coverage, large regions of Eastern Africa had estimates of 1.00&lt;
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>eff</italic>
 </sub>&lt;1.01. Assuming an optimal sequence for PMVC implementation (i.e. vaccinating first the provinces with the highest 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>eff</italic>
 </sub> values), we estimated that an average annual number of 37.7 million doses would be sufficient to vaccinate all provinces with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>eff</italic>
 </sub>≥1.01 over the 2018–2026 period. Such a strategy would prevent 9,900,000 (7,000,000–13,400,000) infections and 480,000 (180,000–1,140,000) deaths over the lifetime of the vaccinees, corresponding to 1.7 (0.7–4.1) deaths averted per 1,000 vaccine doses (assuming no doses wasting) (
