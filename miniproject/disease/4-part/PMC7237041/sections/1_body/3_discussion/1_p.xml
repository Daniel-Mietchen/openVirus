<p>By combining a regression model fitted to the reported local presence of YF with serological data collected in 11 countries, this modelling study presents updated estimates of YF burden across 34 African countries in terms of number of infections, severe cases, deaths, and DALYs lost. We also estimated that PMVCs conducted since 2005 will prevent a total of 3 to 6 million deaths over the lifetime of vaccinees, depending on whether we disregard or maximize herd effects, respectively. As both sylvatic and urban transmission cycles (with none or maximal herd effects, respectively) do contribute to the disease burden, the real impact of vaccination likely lies between these two extreme cases. Finally, we derived estimates of vaccine demand and impact of future PMVCs under a variety of targeted vaccination scenarios. We estimated that allocating a 37.7 million doses per year between 2018 and 2026 for PMVCs would prevent 9.89 (6.96â€“13.3) million YF infections and thus considerably reduce the risk of international spread.</p>
