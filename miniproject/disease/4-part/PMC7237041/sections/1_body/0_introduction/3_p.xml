<p>Previous mathematical models have assessed geographical heterogeneity in YF risk [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, modelling YF is challenging because of the co-existence of different transmission cycles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the sylvatic cycle, tree-dwelling mosquitoes transmit the virus within the wildlife reservoir (non-human primates) and spill-over infection may occur for humans living or working in jungle habitats. In the urban cycle, the domestic mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> transmits the virus between humans. Population (‘herd’) immunity (whether via natural infection or vaccination) will be expected to modify transmission intensity within the urban cycle, but not in the sylvatic cycle where transmission intensity is driven by non-human primates and their interactions with human populations. Recently, two models quantifying the incidence of the disease in Africa or worldwide have been used to derive estimates for vaccination impact [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both assumed a constant force of infection over time. A static force of infection, unaffected by susceptible fraction in the population reflects the sylvatic rather than the urban transmission cycle of the disease. As a corollary, these models disregarded possible herd effects that may arise in urban context due to changing population-level immunity.
