  <p>R1a-B6 reformatted for 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> gene delivery. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Surface structure model of hemagglutinin (HA) trimer of A(H1N1)pdm09 (PDB structure 3AL4) showing the key epitope residues of R1a-B6, Gly20, Trp21, and Ile45 (shown in red) located in the HA stem region (cyan) (
   <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The receptor binding site (magenta), fusion peptide (orange), and head domain (green) are also illustrated. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Four constructs, (i) R1a-B6 mouse Fc IgG1, (ii) R1a-B6 mouse Fc IgG2a, (iii) monovalent R1a-B6, and (iv) negative control mouse Fc IgG2a fusion carrying a nanobody, cAb1 [adapted from Arbabi Ghahroudi et al. (
   <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>)], specific for chicken egg white lysozyme were produced 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>. These constructs were cloned into an AAV expression system for protein expression 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Expression and purification of nanobody-Fc fusions. Detection of proteins was carried out under reducing and non-reducing conditions in SDS-PAGE gels. Theoretical molecular weights (MW) for R1a-B6-mIgG1, R1a-B6-mIgG2a, and cAb1-mIgG2a are ∼37 kDa under denaturing (reducing) conditions, and ∼75 kDA under non-reducing conditions. 
   <bold>(D)</bold>
   <italic>In vitro</italic> ADCC activation. Activation of luciferase reporter gene is shown in relative luminescence units (RLU) as a function of nanobody-Fc concentration. Each well was measured in triplicate. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Binding of R1a-B6 against a broad range of influenza A subtypes as tested by ELISA. Half maximal effective concentration (EC
   <sub>50</sub>) was measured in duplicate. There was no binding on A/TX/12(H3N2) or B/Brisbane/08 (data not shown). All values above the dotted line indicate no binding activity.
