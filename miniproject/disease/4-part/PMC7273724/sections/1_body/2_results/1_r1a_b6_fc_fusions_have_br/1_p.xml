<p>The cross-neutralizing nanobody R1a-B6 has been shown previously to bind to a highly conserved epitope in the HA stem (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), which overlaps the fusion peptide and is predicted to function through inhibiting membrane fusion. To test the prophylactic potential of R1a-B6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the requirement for half-life extension or effector functions we designed four single gene encoding proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) by fusion to a mouse Fc fragment of either an IgG1 or IgG2a isotype. Mouse IgG isotypes differentially interact with FcγR on effector cells, with IgG2a being the most potent having high affinity for activating FcγR, whereas IgG1 is the least potent preferentially interacting with inhibitor FcγR (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). After purification, a product of approximately 75 kDa was seen under non-reducing conditions demonstrating the formation of a dimeric Fc fusion protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then tested the ability of R1a-B6-Fc to mediate ADCC via activation of mouse FcγRIV as detected by a luciferase reporter assay; and as expected, only R1a-B6-mIgG2a showed any ADCC activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Purified R1a-B6-Fc fusion proteins were then shown to bind to a broad panel of whole influenza virus reference reagents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) and neutralize key Group I Influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1), A(H2N2), A(H5N1), and A(H9N2) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). As reported previously (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), converting R1a-B6 into a bivalent format was shown to increase the breadth of neutralizing activity to include the more divergent influenza subtype A(H2N2) rather than increasing maximum levels of potency against A(H1N1) and A(H5N1) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We have previously speculated that this is related to the mechanism of action of R1a-B6 which mediates its effect after the virus has already attached to the cell surface and been internalized. We have suggested that internalization of the virus nanobody complex may be a rate limiting step in the potency of stem binding antibodies, so conversion to a bivalent format does not increase potency above a certain maximum threshold. As such, converting R1a-B6 from a monovalent to bivalent Fc fusion is seen to enhance potency for more divergent subtypes [i.e., A(H2N2) and A(H9N2)] with a lower affinity interaction, whereas for higher affinity interactions A(H1N1) and A(H5N1), no further enhancement is seen as a maximum level has already been reached.
