<p>To determine if mice that received AAV were expressing functional R1a-B6, we performed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assays against pandemic A/California/07/2009(H1N1) (CA/09). Terminal sera (24 weeks) from mice expressing the control nanobody against lysozyme, cAb1, did not show any neutralization of CA/09, as expected (data not shown). Similarly, no neutralization of CA/09 was seen with monovalent R1a-B6, which correlated with serum levels being approximately 1000-fold lower in molar equivalence than the levels attained by the Fc fusions (data not shown). In contrast, sera from mice that received AAV expressing R1a-B6-mIgG1 and R1a-B6-mIgG2a were able to neutralize CA/09 (

 <sup>11</sup> vg gave the highest nanobody serum titer (
