<p>In this study we have shown that the use of AAV vectors to deliver R1a-B6 through a single IM injection is an attractive approach to confer broad-based protection against important influenza subtypes (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>) which can enhance preparedness against future potential influenza pandemics. In addition, our data suggest that the potency of R1a-B6 does not depend on the coupling of Fc effector functions to HA binding for neutralization of influenza. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, as well as viruses of subtype H2N2 and H1N1 continue to represent pandemic threats and while pre-pandemic vaccines against these strains have been stockpiled by some governments, there is uncertainty as to exactly what strain could emerge or if these vaccines would be sufficiently antigenically matched to be effective particularly in at risk patient groups. Our alternative approach mitigates these risks and combines the advantages of AAV mediated gene therapy with highly potent cross-neutralizing nanobodies against influenza to provide broad protection independent of the prior availability of the influenza strain and the need for a natural host induced immune response.
