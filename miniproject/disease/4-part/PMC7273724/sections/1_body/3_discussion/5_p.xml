<p>This independence from the host immune system is an attractive facet to include when considering the optimal antibody format for long-term expression 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> against a variable pathogen. Eliminating the need for an Fc mitigates some of the concerns of antibody dependent enhancement of influenza (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>) mediated by interactions with the effector arm of the immune system or pro-inflammatory functions that can lead to cytokine release and other toxic side effects (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). In addition, this may reduce the risk of transgene immunogenicity through Fc mediated uptake and antigen presentation by immune cells (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). The hypothesis that the effector arm of the immune system is not essential for R1a-B6 to provide sufficient protection against influenza opens up new opportunities for designing an optimized transgene using alternative approaches to half-life extension (
