<p>Recent studies by Laursen and colleagues have also described cross-neutralizing single domain antibodies to influenza and furthermore shown 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy by intranasal AAV delivery at the natural site of infection (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In addition, they describe linking multiple single domain antibodies together specific to different epitopes on HA to provide almost complete protection against both influenza A and B virus in mouse challenge models. Our study confirms single domain antibodies can be delivered by gene therapy but is distinct in that we explore AAV8 intramuscular rather than AAV9 intranasal delivery of R1a-B6 in different formats to evaluate the relative importance of the Fc domain for prophylactic efficacy (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Direct intramuscular injection of AAV8 allows for a simple method for crossing the blood vessel barrier to achieve gene transfer into muscle cells (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Muscle then becomes a biological factory for expressing antibodies 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and has previously been shown to be effective in mice against HIV (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and influenza (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). AAV8 and AAV9 share the same tropism, however, low levels of protein expression and genome copy numbers of AAV9 has been detected in the brain and testes, which is an important safety issue for clinical development of this serotype (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Our choice of muscle specific delivery and AAV8 as vector serotype is expected to provide higher level, more sustainable transgene expression over a longer period of time than AAV9 mediated intranasal delivery which has previously been shown to decrease in macaques after 3-4 months (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).
