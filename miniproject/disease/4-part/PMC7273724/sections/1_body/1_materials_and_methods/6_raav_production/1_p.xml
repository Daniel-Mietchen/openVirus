<p>HEK293T cells were grown to a density of 4.0 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> 293T cells in a final volume of 100 mL per triple flask of Dulbecco’s Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) (Sigma D6546) supplemented with 10% (v/v) Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) (Sigma 14A138), 1% (v/v) L-glutamine (Sigma G7513), 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin (PenStrep) (Sigma P0781). Twelve triple flasks (TF) were used per rAAV construct to make a cell factory. Recombinant AAV vectors pseudotyped with serotype eight capsid containing AAV2 ITRs (AAV2/8) were generated by transient transfection using polyethyleneimine (PEI) (PolySciences 24765-1) of pHelper, pAAV construct, and pAAV2/8/Rep-Cap. Flasks were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 72 h, virus was harvested and extracted from the supernatant via ammonium sulfate (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (Sigma A4418) precipitation. Cells in the triple flask were trypsinized and combined with the supernatant and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles and treated with 10,000 U Benzonase (Novagen 70746-4). Tubes were then centrifuged to clarify the lysate and run on an iodixanol (OptiPrep Sigma D1556) gradient (
