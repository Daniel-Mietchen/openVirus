<p>AAV-R1a-B6-mIgG1, AAV-R1a-B6-mIgG2a, AAV-R1a-B6, and AAV-cAb1-mIgG2a, were generated by cloning the nanobody constructs into the AAV2 ITR-containing plasmid pTRUF11. The rAAV plasmids were transformed in XL-1 Blue (Stratagene 200249) competent cells via heat shock and scaled up in suspension cultures for large-scale DNA extraction using the NucleoBond Xtra Midi Endotoxin Free Kit (Macherey Nagel 740420.10). To check for ITR integrity, plasmid DNA was digested with 
 <italic>Sma</italic>I (Promega) and run on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel.
