<p>Nanobodies R1a-B6 (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and a control anti-lysozyme specific nanobody cAb1 (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) sequences were reformatted as Fc fusions separated by a mouse hinge region. The mouse CH1 domain was removed and the C-terminal end of the nanobody was directly fused to the N-terminus of the mouse hinge region followed by the CH2-CH3 domains of either mouse IgG2a or mouse IgG1. All constructs were synthesized (IDT technologies) and cloned into pcDNA 3.4-TOPO (Invitrogen A14697) for mammalian expression. Large-scale preparation of endotoxin-free plasmid DNA using NucleoBond Xtra Midi EF Kit (Macherey Nagel 740420.10) was carried out. We then used the ExpiCHO Expression System (Thermo Fisher Scientific A21933) to produce soluble nanobody-Fc fusion proteins. Cell supernatants were purified using HiTrap Protein A HP (GE Healthcare 17040203) chromatography. Eluted fractions with high A280 readings that appeared as bands in the SDS-PAGE gels were pooled and dialyzed in a 10 L solution of 1X PBS overnight at 4Â°C.
