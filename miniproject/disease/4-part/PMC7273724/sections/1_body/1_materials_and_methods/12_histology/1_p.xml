<p>Mouse lungs were washed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Four-micron-thick sections were then cut using the Leica RM2125 RTS Microtome. Slides were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) (Vector Laboratories Inc. H-3502). High definition scans were taken using Pannoramic Digital Slide Scanner (3D HISTECH) and analyzed using CaseViewer 2.3 (3D HISTECH). Inflammation was scored in blinded fashion as follows: 0 = no to minimal inflammation, 1 = occasional infiltration in bronchioles, 2 = infiltration of bronchioles and slight thickening of perivascular walls; 3 = mass infiltration of bronchioles, thickening of perivascular walls, and lung rupture.</p>
