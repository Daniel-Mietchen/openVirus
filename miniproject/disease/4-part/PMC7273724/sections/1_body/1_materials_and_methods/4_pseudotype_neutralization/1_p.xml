<p>The following pseudotypes with luciferase reporters (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), A/Korea/426/68(H2N2) (KR/68), A/Vietnam/1194/2004(H5N1) (VN/04), and A/Hong Kong/1073/99(H9N2) (HK/99) were used. Serial two-fold dilutions of nanobody-Fc were made ranging from 32 nM to 1 pM. Influenza pseudotypes at a concentration of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> RLU/well were then added to the nanobody-Fc dilutions and 1.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> 293T cells were added to each well. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Supernatant was then harvested, and plates were read using the GloMax Navigator (Promega) using the Promega GloMax Luminescence Quick-Read protocol.
