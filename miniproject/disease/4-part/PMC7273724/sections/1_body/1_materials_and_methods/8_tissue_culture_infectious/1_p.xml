<p>Viral diluent consisting of 500 mL DMEM (Sigma D6546), 1% (v/v) Pen-Strep (Sigma P0781), 1% Amphotericin B (v/v) (Sigma A2942), and 1% (v/v) L-glutamine (Sigma G7513) was prepared. For TCID
 <sub>50</sub> determination, a 10
 <sup>–</sup>
 <sup>4</sup> dilution of influenza virus was made and diluted ten-fold across the plate. Virus dilutions were transferred to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at about 70-90% confluency. Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Dilutions were then discarded and replaced with 100 μL of freshly-prepared Infection Medium [10% (v/v) 10X Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Sigma M0275), 0.7% (v/v) Bovine Serum Albumin fraction V solution 7.5% (Sigma 10735078001), 2% (w/v) NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (Sigma S8761), 1% (v/v) HEPES (Sigma H0887), 0.5% (w/v) DEAE dextran (Sigma 93556), 1% (v/v) Pen-Strep (Sigma P0781), 1% (v/v) L-glutamine (Sigma G7513), 1% (v/v) Amphotericine B (Sigma A2942), 0.7% (v/v) Tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma T4376)]. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Supernatants were then transferred to round-bottom 96-well plates and 50 μL of 0.7% (v/v) turkey red blood cells (t-RBCs) in PBS were added and the highest dilution with complete hemagglutination in 10 wells in a single row was recorded. The number of hemagglutination positive wells after this row was also recorded and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated using the Reed-Muench method (
