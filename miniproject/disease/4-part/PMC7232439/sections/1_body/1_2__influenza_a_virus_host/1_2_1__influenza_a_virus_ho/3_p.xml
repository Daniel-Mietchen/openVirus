<p>With the development of gene sequencing technology, machine learning (ML) facilitated with large genomic datasets are used in prediction about sequence changes in newly invaded viruses from other animal hosts, take the “Batch-Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM)” method for instance [

 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and prediction of amino acid changes for interspecies transmission [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. These studies provided measures in identification of potential high-risk strains. In addition, the nucleotides and dinucleotide compositions of viruses play important roles in prediction of viral host species [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Combining gene sequencing technology and ML methods, researchers applied large IAV genomic datasets to analyze species selection bias of IAV mono-/dinucleotide composition and predict human-adaptive swine or avian IAVs [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The application of multi-disciplinary subjects would provide useful information for prediction of pandemic influenza.
