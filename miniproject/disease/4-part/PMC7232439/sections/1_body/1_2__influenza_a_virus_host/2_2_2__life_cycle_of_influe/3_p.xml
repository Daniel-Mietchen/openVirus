<p>Proteins in the vRNP complex contain different nuclear localization signals (NLSs), thus helping the vRNP complex to enter the host cell nucleus via active transport, take the Crm1-dependent pathway for instance [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The acidic environment of the endosome also activates M2 ion channel, hence acidifies the viral core, resulting in entrance of vRNP complex into the host cell [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Replication of viral genome does not require a primer but a full-length complementary RNA (cRNA), which is essential for the newly formed vRNP complex. The viral RNA polymerases first bind to the 3′ end and the 5′ end of the segmented viral RNA and cRNA, respectively, then start replication with the help of the 5′ cap of host pre-mRNAs via a PB1-PB2-mediated “cap snatching” mechanism [

 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The conserved segment-specific nucleotides at the 3′ and 5′ ends of the viral genome could modulate genome expression and replication during infection [
