<p>In general, the life cycle of the IAV is generally divided into four steps: virus entry into the host cell, transcription and replication of the viral genome, assembly, and virus budding. Though alveolar epithelial cell is the primary target cell for IAVs, different IAV subtypes have different patterns of viral attachment (PVA). For human IAVs, Alveolar type II epithelial cells, as well as immune cells such as alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, are major target cells for an established infection [
