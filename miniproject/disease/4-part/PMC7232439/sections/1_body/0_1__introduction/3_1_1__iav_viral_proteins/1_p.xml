<p>HA is a type I glycosylated protein, which is responsible for virus entry to host cell. Functional HA protein is a homotrimer structurally composed of a stem region and a globular head region in each monomer. The head region bearing N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid, SA) binding pocket is critical for receptor attachment, and contains most antigenic determinants. The stem region undergoing conformational changes is responsible for low pH-triggered membrane fusion [

For instance, human viruses prefer binding to SAs attached to cell-surface-associated α-2,6-linked galactose, whereas avian viruses prefer α-2,3-linked galactose [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while G186V was reported to be pivotal for the avian-specific strain to acquire human receptor-binding capacity [
