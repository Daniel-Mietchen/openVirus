<p>NS1, structurally composed of an N-terminal dsRNA binding domain and a C-terminal effector domain, plays important roles in control of viral RNA synthesis, viral mRNA splicing, and virus particle morphogenesis during the virus life cycle [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is also considered as the key factor to antagonize host immune system [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], since it could inhibit activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I proteins (RIG-I), interferon-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase of the innate immunity via blocking nuclear export of host messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The mechanism underlying is revealed by determination of crystal structure of the NS1 and nuclear RNA export factor 1-nuclear transport factor 2-related export protein 1 (NXF1-NXT1) complex that NS1 could prevent mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex via binding of NXF1-NXT1 to nucleoporins [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Conserved RNA secondary structures at RNA positions 82-148 and 497-564 are essential for NS1 protein expression, thus affecting viral reproduction and virus–host interaction processes [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A detailed description of structure and function of the NS1 was reviewed by Han and his colleagues [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. NS2, also known as NEP, contains a nuclear export signal and is responsible for chromosome region maintenance 1 (Crm1)-dependent nuclear export of RNPs in the infected cells [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Crm1 contains leucin-rich nuclear export signals (NES1 and NES2) [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which are important for the NS2Crm1 interaction [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition, interaction of CHD3 and NES1 was identified to be important in the NS2-mediated vRNP nuclear export [
