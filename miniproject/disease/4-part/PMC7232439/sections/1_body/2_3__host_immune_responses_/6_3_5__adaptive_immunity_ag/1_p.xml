<p>Upon detection of IAVs, DCs trigger production of IFNs and cytokines, which in turns assist maturation of the DCs into antigen presenting cells (APCs), and initiate T cell immune responses. Through the activation of Ag-bearing DCs, naïve CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th7, regulatory T cells (Treg cells), follicular helper T cells, and killer cells. Th1 and follicular helper T cells are the most abundant CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T helper cells. They can secret antiviral cytokines, regulate CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation, promote B cell activation, and maintain immunological memory [
