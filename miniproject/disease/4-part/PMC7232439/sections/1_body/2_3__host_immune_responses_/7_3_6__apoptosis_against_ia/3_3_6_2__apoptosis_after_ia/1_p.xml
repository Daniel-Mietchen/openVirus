<p>During IAV infection, viruses modulate host apoptotic responses in a time-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B206-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. For instance, in order to earn enough time for replication and virion formation, IAV inhibited apoptosis via upregulating the anti-apoptotic phophoinositide-3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) pathway at the beginning of infection. However, in the later phase of infection, the virus suppressed this pathway to upregulate the pro-apoptotic p53 pathway, thus allowing successful release of virions [
