 <xref rid="B199-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Besides prototypical changes, cells undergoing apoptosis can be detected through DNA and biochemical assays, take the TUNEL and in situ end-labeling (ISEL) techniques for instance. Two primary pathways are involved in activation of apoptosis: the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, and the extrinsic or death receptor pathway.
