<p>The intrinsic pathway is also known as “the mitochondrial pathway”, which operates in response to various intracellular stress. Several factors such as nitric oxide (NO), cytochrome c, and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) can activate this pathway, and the key player of this pathway is proteins in the bcl-2 family, which are activated by stress signals and then release apoptotic factors via destabilizing the mitochondrial membrane [

 <xref rid="B201-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>], resulting in release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Cytochrome c then binds to apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1) and forms a complex with pro-caspase 9 (then cleaved into caspase 9), the function of which is to cleave its effector pro-caspase 3 [

 <xref rid="B204-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>], forming the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) with pro-caspase 8, resulting in activation of caspase 8 and downstream activation of other caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7) [
 <xref rid="B199-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. In the TNFα/TNFR1 pathway, TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) is activated after binding of TNFα to TNFR1, leading to recruitment of FADD and receptor interacting protein (RIP) [
 <xref rid="B205-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. FADD then associates with pro-caspase 8 to form the DISC, resulting in activation of caspase 8 and apoptosis.
