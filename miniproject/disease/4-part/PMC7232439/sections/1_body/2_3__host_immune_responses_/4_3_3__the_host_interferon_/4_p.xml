<p>In order to counter IFN-stimulated antiviral proteins, IAV viral proteins apply multiple strategies. For instance, HA protein was shown to trigger ubiquitination of IFNAR to attenuate the type I IFN signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B162-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. The follow-up work showed that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) functions as an interacting partner of HA protein to mediate the HA-induced IFNAR degradation [

NS1 is the most important IFNs antagonist protein via mechanisms including inhibition of the TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, suppression of protein kinase R (PKR), phosphorylation of IκB kinases (IKK) α and β in the NF-κB pathway, interruption of the phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], and degradation of OTUB1 [
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Phosphorylation of NS1 is crucial for its function of antagonizing IFN-β expression, since dephosphorylation at position 73 and 83 of the protein induced a high level of IFN-β [

 <xref rid="B164-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>], is multifunctional in deregulation of type I interferon [

 <xref rid="B166-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. It counteracted RLR-mediated activation of IFN pathway not only by targeting mitochondrial MAVS [

 <xref rid="B167-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>], but also by binding to the DEAD-box helicase DDX3 to induce proteasome-dependent degradation [
 <xref rid="B166-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Furthermore, PB1-F2 interacted with mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM) to mediate formation of autophagosome, thus inducing complete mitophagy, which is critical for MAVS degradation [
 <xref rid="B167-viruses-12-00376" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Novel PA-X protein could also modulate innate immune responses. A review regarding the function of NS1 and PA-X proteins in antagonizing host innate immunity is recommended here [
