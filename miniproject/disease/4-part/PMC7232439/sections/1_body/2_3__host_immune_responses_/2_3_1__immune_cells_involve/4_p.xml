<p>T cells and B cells are critical components in adaptive immunity against IAV infection. CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and defend IAV infection via producing cytokines and effector molecules, and cytotoxic effects (i.e., lysis) of infected cells mediated by MHC class I. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells target IAV-infected epithelial cells through binding with MHC class II molecules and contribute to B cell activation thus consequently promote antibody production. The activation of T cells and B cells in IAV infection will be exposited in
