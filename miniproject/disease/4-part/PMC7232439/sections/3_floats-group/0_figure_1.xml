  <p>Schematic diagram for activation of innate immune responses and interferon (IFN) signaling pathway after influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Intracellular detection conducted by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including retinoic acid-inducible gene-I proteins (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and toll-like receptors (TLRs), activate transcription factors such as IRFs and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB), resulting in expression of IFNs and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).</p>
