<p>We obtained blood samples from all nestlings for all 11 nests which contained a BFDV-positive bird (parent or nestling). We collected blood samples and cloacal swabs of both parents for six of the 11 nests, blood samples from both parents and cloacal swabs from one parent for two of the nests, blood and cloacal samples for only one parent for one nest, and blood samples only for one parent for two nests (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the five nests (45.5%, 16.7–76.6) which contained an infected nestling, these nestlings were BFDV-positive only at one of the two age stages we sampled nestlings at: in four out of five cases (80%, 28.4–99.5), the BFDV-positive nestling was approximately four weeks old (
