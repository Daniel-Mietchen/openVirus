<p>We subsampled our nest swabs, which had been taken at monthly intervals during the year and fortnightly during the breeding season, in order to create three categories of nest swabs: ‘before’, ‘during’ and ‘after’ breeding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). Swabs for the category ‘before’ were collected in August and September, before we found any nests in the boxes. Swabs for the category ‘during’ were collected from nests containing nestlings and paired control nest boxes fortnightly during the period when breeding was taking place in our study population (October–January). Of these, we tested the swabs taken closest to the date (range: 0–8 days before or after) when BFDV-positive blood or cloacal swab samples were collected from birds, mostly during late November and early December. For the category ‘after’, swabs were collected after the end of the breeding season, in late January and early February.
