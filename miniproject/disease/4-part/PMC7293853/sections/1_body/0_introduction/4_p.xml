<p>BFDV is thought to be transmitted directly between individuals through faeces, contaminated feather dust and crop secretions (
 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 1991</xref>), as well as from mothers to embryonated eggs (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Rahaus et al., 2008</xref>). It was found in mites infesting a BFDV-positive cockatoo, suggesting that it may be transmitted through ectoparasitic vectors (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Portas et al., 2017</xref>). BFDV is considered highly stable in the environment (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Raidal &amp; Peters, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Todd, 2000</xref>) because it is resistant to heat, surviving exposure to high temperatures, for example, 80 °C for 30 min (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Raidal &amp; Cross, 1994</xref>), and many disinfectants (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, indirect transmission through contaminated nest hollows is considered likely, as infected birds shed high amounts of BFDV in both feather dander and faeces into the environment (
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Raidal, Sabine &amp; Cross, 1993</xref>). Additionally, Psittaciformes often compete for limited nest hollows (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Heinsohn, Murphy &amp; Legge, 2003</xref>), which may increase the potential for interspecies transmission through contaminated nest hollows (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2014</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the presence and persistence of BFDV in nesting material. Understanding the role of contaminated nest boxes in disease transmission and the potential impact they might have on wild, as well as managed, populations is crucial (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2014</xref>), and a key step in developing a method for decreasing rates of indirect transmission and improving pathogen management outcomes (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Australian Department of Sustainability Environment, Water, Population and Communities, 2012</xref>). Such a method, which would allow simple, standardised sampling from nest boxes for BFDV detection, would aid targeted BFDV surveillance in species recovery programs, many of which do not yet include BFDV as a risk (
