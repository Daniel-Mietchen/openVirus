<p>Most studies on environmental contamination with pathogens have been conducted under laboratory conditions, with inoculated animals sacrificed for testing (

 <italic>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</italic> showed that the pathogen could be detected using swabs of the environment inhabited by hosts (

 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Vong et al. (2008)</xref> successfully used soil swabs to detect environmental contamination of human households with Influenza A virus from domestic poultry. However, this approach using swabs has not been applied for pathogen surveillance in wild bird populations, where it could potentially provide a useful, non-invasive method for surveillance of environmental contamination with pathogens, the results of which could help to reduce indirect transmission. To our knowledge, environmental contamination of nesting material with avian pathogens has rarely been investigated. One example is a study by 
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Sikorski et al. (2013)</xref>, who collected and tested the nesting material in a single nest.
