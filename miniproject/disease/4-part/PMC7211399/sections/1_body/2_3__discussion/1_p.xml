<p>‘Precision epidemiology’ recently proposed by Kristian et al. refers to a more targeted approach to infectious disease control at both the individual and population-level via genomic technologies, aided by using NGS and phylogenetic analyses (

With the advances of NGS, clinical metatranscriptomics and metatranscriptomics, the comprehensive analysis of microbial and host genetic material (DNA and RNA) in clinical samples, is rapidly changing infectious disease diagnosis and treatment (

It allows us to determine the causative pathogen of infectious diseases and even to characterize entire viral and bacterial genomes from infected individuals nearly real-time without the need for a priori knowledge of the potential causative agent. Incorporation of the genetic sequences and epidemiological information, phylogenetic analysis can be used to trace the source, transmission, and spread of diseases at both time and spatial levels (

In response to the emergence of virus outbreaks, the viral genomic sequences are more informative due to the rapid evolution of viruses. Here, we show that using ‘precision epidemiology’ in combination with metatranscriptomics, phylogenetics, and epidemiology surveillance data can be used to untangle critical public health questions related to E11 outbreaks in Guangdong, China 2019.
