<p>In total, fifty-four full E11 VP1 genes were sequenced from the outbreak cases in H1 (twelve cases), cases from H1 neighboring hospitals after the outbreak (five cases), and the retrospective clinical and environmental surveillance (thirty-seven sequences, 2017–18). The analysis was performed by using newly generated VP1 sequences and all published VP1 sequences from 1978 to 2016 (

Majority (fifty of fifty-four) of E11 Guangdong strains clustered together into Clade C (
