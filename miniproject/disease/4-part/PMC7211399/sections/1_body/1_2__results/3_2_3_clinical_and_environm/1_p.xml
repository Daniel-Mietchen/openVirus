<p>After the identification of echovirus E11 as causative agent, we next screened seventy samples collected from twenty-five suspicious cases from H1 (25) by using a specific E11 RT-PCR. In total, twelve of twenty-five cases from H1 were positive for E11 during the outbreak. This suggests that E11 virus was the primary causative agent for the outbreak and fatal cases, given the prevalence of the virus in all samples tested. We also enhanced the surveillance in H2–H4 where the H1 E11 patients were transferred in order to trace the possible viral transmission among hospitals. Between April and May 2019, 5 E11 infections were identified in 149 cases admitted into H2–H4 after the outbreak in H1.</p>
