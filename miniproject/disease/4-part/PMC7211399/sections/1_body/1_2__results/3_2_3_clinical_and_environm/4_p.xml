<p>To understand the E11 circulations among different age groups of the population, the seroprevalence of E11 neutralizing antibody (NA) was investigated from 400 healthy individuals’ serums obtained between August and October 2019 in Guangzhou city of Guangdong Province. The overall positive rate of E11 NA was 16.4 per cent (38 in 232) for male and 21.4 per cent for female (36 in 168). Notably, there was a significant increase of E11 seroprevalence with age from 0 to 4 years old (

The seroprevalence of E11 stayed in a relative high level in 3–15 years old individuals (34.6–43.8%) and decreased in those age over 15.
