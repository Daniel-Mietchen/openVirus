<p>A wide range of enteroviruses may circulate in a population without apparent increases in illness reports (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B34" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al. 2013</xref>). However, occasionally a previously rarely reported enterovirus genotype may cause large-scale outbreaks or continuous epidemics. For instance, HFMD associated enteroviruses were sporadically identified in mainland China before 2007 but in 2007–08, EVA71 C4a genotype emerged and caused an HFMD outbreak in eastern China (

In addition, novel human enterovirus genotypes are frequently reported, sometimes regionally, potentially reflecting large enterovirus outbreaks (
