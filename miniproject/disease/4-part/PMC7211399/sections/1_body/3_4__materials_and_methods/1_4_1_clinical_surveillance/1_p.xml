<p>On 25 March 2019, an outbreak of E11 was reported in a neonatal department of a hospital (H1) in Guangdong, China. Following the pathogen confirmation, at the end of April 2019, the Guangdong Provincial CDC launched an E11 molecular surveillance in H1 and H2–H4 where H1 patients were transferred during the outbreak. The seroprevalence of E11 was evaluated by using serum samples from health population in Guangzhou city of Guangdong province. The population were divided into 0–2, 3–5, 6–25, 26–60 age groups and one hundred serum samples were randomly selected for NA testing from each group. The Ethics Review Committee of the Guangdong CDC confirmed that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and molecular surveillance and metatranscriptomic analyses were performed for anonymized patient samples. All patients or their guardian(s) were informed about the surveillance before providing written consent.</p>
