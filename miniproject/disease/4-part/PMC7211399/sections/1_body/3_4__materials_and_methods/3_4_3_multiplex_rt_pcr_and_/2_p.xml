<p>The datasets were quality controlled (QC) using fastp (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2018</xref>) to trim artificial sequences (adapters), to cut low-quality bases (quality scores &lt; 30), and to remove short reads (&lt; 50 bp). Reads were then mapped to the human genome (hg38) using Bowtie2 (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B19" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>) to remove human-related RNA reads. General taxonomic profiles of the microbe were generated using CCMetagen with ncbi_nt database (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B25" ref-type="bibr">Marcelino et al. 2019</xref>), and all best mappings reach the alignment score threshold (0.5) and 
 <italic>P</italic>-value threshold (0.5) were printed. The abundance of microbes transcriptomes identified in oral swabs, anal swabs, and serial blood samples were calculated and normalized with number of raw reads using R scrips. 
 <italic>De novo</italic> assembling was performed using Trinity for each dataset after human RNA depletion. Assembled contigs were annotated using blastn (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B5" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al. 2009</xref>) using the complete nt database. The depth and coverage of E11-specific reads were calculated by using samtools (
 <xref rid="veaa029-B20" ref-type="bibr">Li 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009
 </xref>). Whole genome of E11 viruses were sequenced by using the Enterovirus Genome Sequencing Kit (Gene Denovo, China). All sequences generated in this study have been submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers
