  <p>Recombination analysis of E11 genomes. (A) Bootscanning recombination analysis of E11 strains and other closely related enterovirus B genotypes. The outbreak representative strain (Accession No. MN597939) was used as query sequence. The dashed line indicates &gt;70% bootstrap support. The genome structure of the E11 was annotated according to the E11 reference strain KY981558. ML trees were construct separately for the 
   <italic>5’UTR-3A</italic>, 
   <italic>2B-3B</italic> (B) and 
   <italic>5’UTR-3A</italic>, 
   <italic>3C-3’UTR</italic> (C) parts of the E11 genome and genomes from other closely related enterovirus genotypes. The E11 genomes generated in this study (
   <italic>n</italic> = 32) and collected from public database (
   <italic>n</italic> = 41) were highlighted with black circles and light grey dots, respectively. The different parts of the genome from the same virus were connected with a line. In the phylogeny of 
   <italic>2B-3B</italic> and 
   <italic>3C-3’UTR</italic>, other enterovirus genotypes clustered with E11 suggesting potential recombination, and name of these enterovirus genotypes were noted on the right.
