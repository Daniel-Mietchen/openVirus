<p id="Par55">We investigated the possible side effects of INH in this cohort study and found no close association with the completion of the INH dose. Clinicians and program personnel frequently express concern about the potential toxicity of TPT medications, especially for patients who are also receiving ART. Neuropathy is associated with INH but is also seen with certain antiretrovirals (ARVs) and HIV infection itself, making it difficult sometimes to determine the causative agent.

Blurred or loss of vision, convulsions, mood changes, unusual bleeding, skin rash, sore throat, joint pain, fever, dizziness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, dark urine were among other side effects that we are monitoring in the course of the study. However, there was limited data given the rarity of clinically relevant adverse events and effects. The study did not document baseline side effects prior to TPT initiation to conclude potential side effects associated with TPT.
