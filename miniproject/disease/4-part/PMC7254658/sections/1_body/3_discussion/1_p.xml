<p id="Par49">The implications of our assessment are multi-fold as it provides a synthesis of primary and secondary outcomes for IPT in the context of a limited resource setting. The study was conducted in a setting where collaborative initiatives used quality improvement approaches to reach the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets and sustain epidemic control relying on the WHO guidelines for the public health approach. Several studies have assessed completion of INH. All these studies have provided information critical for determining covariates of treatment outcomes but not displayed a nationally representative assessment of TPT outcomes from a perspective of a national collaborative. This study was nested on the national collaborative aimed at improving IPT completion as one of the priority areas.</p>
