<p id="Par58">This study had some limitations. There was no control group, to ascertain what happens where no initiatives for improving completion are in place. Thus, the analysis may have bias arising from studying patients from sites with ongoing improvement initiatives for IPT but was cured by creating cohorts with a baseline month when all factors were considered the same. Secondly, adherence was measured by pill counts which may not reflect actual patient adherence practices. However, the study established patient’s clinical attendance which could be used as a proxy indicator of the patient’s intention to comply with treatment. Our cohort was part of the HIV-infected children and adults receiving IPT as part of their routine HIV care and treatment and therefore could not determine whether being on ART was a predictor of completion. The findings are, therefore, generalizable in Uganda and other resource-limited settings.</p>
