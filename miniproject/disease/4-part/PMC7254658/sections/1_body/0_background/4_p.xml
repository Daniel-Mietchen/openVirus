<p id="Par32">While there is adequate evidence that the use of IPT results in a lower risk of progression to TB disease and TB related mortality for people with HIV, it is important to document completion. In contexts where patients on ART are in different service delivery models, completion of IPT is of concern and must be prioritized. In Uganda, a national quality improvement (QI) collaborative was used to address multiple health care delivery, patient and provider level barriers to IPT completion using the continuous quality improvement (CQI) approach. In a collaborative, multiple teams work toward the same aims and share their results so all teams can learn how to most efficiently improve care. Researchers must recognize the need to evaluate not only endpoint outcomes, but also assess the extent to which implementation is effective in a specific context to optimize intervention benefits, prolong the sustainability of the intervention in that context, and promote the dissemination of findings into other contexts [
