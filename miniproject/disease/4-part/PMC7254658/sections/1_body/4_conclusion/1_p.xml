<p id="Par59">Treatment completion is the end-point of the IPT initiation strategy in Uganda. With an 89% completion rate, our results are reassuring but call for more concerted efforts to achieve over 95% target. The 89% completion rates in the national QI sites suggest a collaborative as effective in achieving high uptake of preventive interventions at scale in the study setting. However, the ongoing delivery of IPT would require periodic evaluation to prevent possible relapses in progress attained. The recognition that IPT provision for PLHIV is bound to challenges resulting from the covariates of completion implies a need for more serious commitments to address known and anticipated barriers for the evidence-based method of prevention to benefit-eligible patients. Studies such as this one, are necessary for routine monitoring of successes to prevent possible relapses in both secondary and primary outcomes so far documented.</p>
