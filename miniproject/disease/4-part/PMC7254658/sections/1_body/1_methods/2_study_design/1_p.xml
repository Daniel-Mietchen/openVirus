<p id="Par37">This was both a prospective cohort and longitudinal study nested within the national QI collaborative in which multiple QITs tested changes in care delivery to improve the delivery of IPT. The study was conducted in ART clinics in 14 high volume sites. High volume sites were operationally defined as sites handling approximately 2000 patients in the outpatient department. The study sites were public facilities and represented all levels of health facility. Study sites were supported to commit full doses of INH and Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) for study participants up to completion to prevent stock out. Additional support was given to study sites on the management of uncommitted doses of INH and Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) for new patients as an added benefit of the study to the study sites.</p>
