<p id="Par36">To rule out active TB disease among patients, screening for active TB was conducted as part of routine clinical care using clinical assessment with the aid of the intensive TB case finding guide that was administered to all study participants on INH at each clinic visit. Patients who were identified with presumptive TB were further investigated using microscopy, GeneXpert (Xpert MTB/RIF assay) and X-ray depending on the symptoms of presentation. Microscopy or GeneXpert was used for PLHIV presumptive TB patients with no danger signs and with CD4 &gt; 200. X-ray was used for clients from whom samples could not be obtained and from clients with negative microscopy or GeneXpert results.</p>
