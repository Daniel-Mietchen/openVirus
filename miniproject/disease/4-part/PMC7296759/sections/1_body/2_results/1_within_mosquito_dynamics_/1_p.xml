<p id="Par31">We first wanted to determine if the age at which a mosquito is offered an infectious blood meal and acquires the ZIKV infection (Age
 <sub>acquisition</sub>) impacted the within-vector kinetics of the mosquito. To do this, we looked at infection, dissemination, and transmission of the three treatments in the context of days post-infection. We found no significant difference in the infection (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) or dissemination rates (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) across all treatments (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). However, when direct age comparisons are made, the effect of Age
 <sub>acquisition</sub> on infection becomes obvious (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The average rate of infection of mosquitoes given exposure was 78.2% across all treatments and days post-infection (95% confidence interval: 74.3–82.0%).
