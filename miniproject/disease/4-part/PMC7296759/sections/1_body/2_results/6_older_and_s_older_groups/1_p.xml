<p id="Par40">For both the OLDER and S.OLDER groups, the infectious blood meal occurred at 12 days post-emergence, which was outside the window of opportunity for VC
 <sub>age</sub> in all but one scenario (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). Only at a bite rate of twice daily did the OLDER group achieve the minimum VC
 <sub>age</sub> of 0.256 on or after Age
 <sub>acquisition</sub> of 12 days-old, and only when parameterized with the EIP
 <sub>min</sub>. The window of opportunity for this scenario was days 12–13 post-emergence.
