<p id="Par38">To calculate VC
 <sub>age</sub>, we used treatment-group specific average TTD and predicted daily probabilities of survival (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4) and the overall daily prediction of willingness to bite in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Since biting rate (the number of bites per day) is a field-derived parameter, we calculated VC
 <sub>age</sub> over three biting rates: 0.5 (once every 2 days), 1 (once a day), and 2 (twice a day) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For comparison, we calculated the traditional VC using the average life-dependent traits determined experimentally above, EIP
 <sub>min</sub> and EIP
 <sub>max</sub>, and the biting rates referenced above. These VC values are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, along with corresponding values for R
 <sub>0</sub>. In the absence of published data regarding the probability of human to mosquito ZIKV transmission success, we used the average infection rate from our experimental data (78.2%) to parameterize human to mosquito transmission, recognizing that this model system used a high dose of ZIKV titer, although such titers in individuals are not unheard of [
