<p id="Par42">Prediction of vector-borne disease spread remains difficult, as transmission of vector-borne disease is a dynamic, multifaceted system. This includes life traits of the mosquito, environmental factors, and vector-virus interactions [

Here we demonstrate through a combination of experimental and computational methods that mosquito age at the time of pathogen acquisition is a powerful driver of transmission potential due, in large part, to the age-dependence of daily mortality and biting habits. Further, these drivers lead to differences in the estimates of R
