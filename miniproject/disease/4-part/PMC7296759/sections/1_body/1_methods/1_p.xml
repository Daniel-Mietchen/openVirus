<p id="Par14">We first wanted to determine if age and/or prior blood meals affected the within-mosquito viral dynamics, as well as various life traits of the mosquito. To that end, we designated three treatment groups: YOUNG, OLDER and S.OLDER. The YOUNG group was offered an infectious blood meal at approximately 5 days post-emergence (dpe). The OLDER group was offered a non-infectious blood meal at 5 dpe and then an infectious blood meal 1 week later (12 dpe). The S.OLDER group was not offered a prior, non-infectious blood meal, but a single infectious blood meal at approximately 12 dpe (to match the OLDER timing). S refers to sugar, which was done in order to distinguish the absence of a blood meal at 5 dpe. All non-infectious blood meals are referred to as “mock” blood meals, as they contain non-infectious cell culture media in place of infectious media.</p>
