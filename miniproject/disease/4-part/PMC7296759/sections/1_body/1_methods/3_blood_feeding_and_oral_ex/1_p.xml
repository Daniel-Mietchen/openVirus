<p id="Par16">Infectious and non-infectious blood meals were prepared with ZIKV-infected cell culture supernatant and non-infected cell culture supernatant, respectively. Whole bovine blood in Alsever’s solution (Hemostat Labs, Dixon, CA, USA) was used in a 2:1 blood to supernatant ratio [

 <italic>via</italic> the Hemotek membrane feeding system (Hemotek, Blackburn, UK) for 45 min, after which mosquitoes were cold anesthetized and blood-fed females were placed into clean cartons until further treatment. Because starvation and cold anesthetization could affect mortality rates, every treatment was subjected to the same schedule of each of these conditions. For example, all groups were starved 24 h prior to days 5 and 12 post-emergence, regardless of whether that group would receive a blood meal. In addition, not only were blood-fed mosquitoes cold anesthetized and moved to a new carton, but other groups that did not feed on that schedule were treated the same in order to mimic these conditions and control for these factors. The experimental design is depicted in Additional file
