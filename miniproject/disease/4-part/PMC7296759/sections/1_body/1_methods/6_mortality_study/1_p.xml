<p id="Par20">Mortality studies were performed for the same three treatments (YOUNG, OLDER, and S.OLDER). We added additional mock blood meal controls (that is, accounting for any infectious blood meal-associated alteration of mortality) where a mock blood meal was used in place of infectious blood meals. The three controls were: (i) a mock blood meal at 5 dpe (M.Y) to correspond to the YOUNG treatment; (ii) a mock blood meal at 5 dpe, followed by another mock blood meal at 12 dpe (M.M) to correspond to the OLDER two blood meal treatment; and (iii) a mock blood meal at 12 dpe (S.M) to correspond to the S.OLDER, one blood meal treatment. An additional negative control treatment was performed where the mosquitoes were never blood-fed (S). All treatments were cold anesthetized at 5 and 12 dpe, regardless of whether they were offered a blood meal so that all mosquitoes experienced the same treatment, and mosquito density per carton was kept relatively constant with an average of 47 mosquitoes/carton (range 36–58). Each mortality treatment was repeated a total of three times and data are averages of the three replicates.</p>
