<p id="Par17">In order to determine if the timing of the infectious blood meal affected the within-mosquito viral kinetics, mosquitoes were sampled at 5, 8 and 11 days post-infection (dpi) to test for infection and dissemination across all groups (sample sizes are provided in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Mosquito legs and bodies were placed into separate tubes containing 900 μl BA-1 diluent media and BBs. Samples were then homogenized twice at 25 Hz for 3 min using a Qiagen Tissuelyzer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was extracted (5× MagMax 96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and tested for the presence of viral RNA
