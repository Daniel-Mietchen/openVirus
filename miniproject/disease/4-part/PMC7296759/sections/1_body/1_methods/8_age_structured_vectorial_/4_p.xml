<p id="Par29">VC is a component of R
 <sub>0</sub>, which also includes the average infectious period of the human and the probability of transmission from the human to the vector. For illustrative purposes, we calculated R
 <sub>0</sub> using both the traditional calculation of VC (Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>), as well as VC
 <sub>age</sub>. We made the following assumptions: mosquito density is held constant at m = 1; the average infectious period of the human is 5 days (r
 <sup>−1</sup>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]; and the average probability of transmission from human to vector is parameterized experimentally as the average proportion of mosquitoes that develop a midgut infection given exposure (c). From these data, we can calculate the value of VC needed to push R
 <sub>0</sub> above this threshold. We use this value as a “threshold” to compare VC
 <sub>age</sub> across treatment groups and with the traditional VC measures.
