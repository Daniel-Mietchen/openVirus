 <caption>
  <p>The phylogenetic tree based on the entire 
   <italic>VP1</italic> genome of 36 representative strains isolated from 1958 (Bastianni strain of E-30 prototype) to 2016, with the E-21 strain used as an outgroup. The black triangle indicates the strains isolated from this study, and one strain was included for genotyping. The node numbers at each node show the bootstrap support constructed by neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The letters on the right represent the genotypes of E-30, from genotypes Aâ€“C.
