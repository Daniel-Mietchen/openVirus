<p>The probable cases were reported, and samples of patients were referred to the laboratories for pathogen detection. The local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staffs collected the clinical samples in several local hospitals that have patients with viral encephalitis; the use of their clinical samples was explained to the guardians of children, and written consent was signed by guardians of children for permitting analysis of their clinical samples. Patients were classified as having viral encephalitis infection in Gansu province between June 27 and August 5 of 2015 if they had encephalitis, high fever (≥38°C), nausea, vomit, and other neurological symptoms, such as seizures, unconsciousness, and autonomic nervous system dysregulation (
