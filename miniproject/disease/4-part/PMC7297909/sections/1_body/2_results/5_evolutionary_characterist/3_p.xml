<p>Based on the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region, the coalescent reconstruction revealed the oscillating patterns on the genetic diversity of Chinese E-30 from 1996 onward (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The results showed that the genetic diversity of E-30 in China experienced two large expansions besides three small increases. In 2000 and 2008 nearby, the genetic diversity of E-30 arrived at the top and subsequently decreased dramatically. The increases of genetic diversity in 2000 were primarily associated with E-30 outbreaks in Taiwan of China, with 16.6% detection ratios of E-30 in 1130 enterovirus-infected patients with encephalitis (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). With the decrease in relative genetic diversity of E-30 after 2008, it was coincided with the construction of hand, foot, and mouth pathogen surveillance net of China in 2008. The genetic diversity also showed a dynamic fluctuation between 2009 and 2012, especially the small-scale epidemics in 2011, revealing the transmission activities of E-30 among provinces. From 2012 till present, the population dynamics of E-30 showed weaker fluctuations over time, whereas it locally caused a large-scale outbreak in Gansu Province in 2015.
