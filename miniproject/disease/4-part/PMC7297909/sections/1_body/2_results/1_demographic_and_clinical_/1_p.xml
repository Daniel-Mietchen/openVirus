<p>A large-scale encephalitis outbreak caused by E-30 was confirmed through clinical characteristics, epidemiological evidences, and laboratory diagnosis. We defined the potential probable patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 101), probable cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 95), and laboratory-confirmed cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 50) during epidemiological investigation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the probable cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 95), male outnumbered female patients, with the ratio of male to female being 188% (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All cases had high fever (≥38°C), and headache accounted for 29.5% of all suspected cases. Of all the probable cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 95), 61.1 and 62.1% had nausea, vomiting, and neurological appearance (listlessness and unconsciousness), respectively. Of the total number of probable cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 95), 10.5% were children aged ≤5. Children aged 6–10 years accounted for the highest percentage at 51.6%, followed by children 11–15 years of age (28.4%). Children aged ≥16 only accounted for 9.5%. Several probable cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 82, 86.3%) were school students, while other 13 cases were from different professions, including farmers (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> not shown). From the geographical distribution angle, the Nancha town and Guangzhi town constituted 45.3 and 25.3% within the probable cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 95), respectively, whereas seven other towns only accounted for 29.5% within the probable cases. A total of 60% (9/15) towns of this prefecture were attacked by the large-scale infectious disease outbreak.
