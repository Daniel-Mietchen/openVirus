The clinical features, molecular epidemiological characteristics, and evolutionary dynamics of this outbreak were analyzed. Furthermore, the detailed transmission patterns were tracked to illustrate the prevalence scope and extent of occurrence of E-30 in China. This is the first report about encephalitis caused by E-30 in the northwest region of China. The investigation provides further insight into the epidemiological patterns and evolutionary history of E-30 in China.</p>
