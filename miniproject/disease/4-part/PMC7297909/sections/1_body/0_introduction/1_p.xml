<p>Enteroviruses belong to the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of the 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family, which now consists of 15 species designated as 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> A–L and 
 <italic>Rhinovirus</italic> A–C (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zell et al., 2017</xref>). 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> A–D (EV-A, EV-B, EV-C, and EV-D) are closely associated with human diseases and were studied for the purpose of public health. The genomic length of enterovirus is ∼7.5 kb, which contained a long open reading frame (ORF), with 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and 3′-UTR. The polyprotein could be cleaved into 
 <italic>P1</italic>, 
 <italic>P2</italic>, and 
 <italic>P3</italic> protein precursors, followed by the further cleavage into 
 <italic>VP1–VP4</italic>, 
 <italic>2A–2C</italic>, and 
 <italic>3A–3D</italic>, respectively. The 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region of enterovirus contained the major antigenic neutralization sites responsible to immunoreaction. The molecular typing approach, which primarily based on the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region of enterovirus, was accepted as the major method for serotyping (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bergamini et al., 2000</xref>). With the development of molecular typing technologies, there are more and more new serotypes of enteroviruses have been found, with the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region and partial 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding region targeted (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tokarz et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zhang Y. et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2018</xref>). This method has become the gold standard for enterovirus typing and detection and allows for greater convenience than serotyping (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Oberste et al., 1999a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). EV-B consists of 63 serotypes, including coxsackievirus (CV)-A9, CV-B group (serotypes 1–6), echovirus (serotypes 1–7, 9, 11–21, 24–27, 29–33), and newly identified enteroviruses (serotypes 69, 73–75, 77–88, 93, 97–98, 100–101, 106–107, 110–113) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2017</xref>). These serotypes of enteroviruses are usually associated with a series of diseases, such as encephalitis; myocarditis; hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD); acute flaccid paralysis (AFP); and other diseases. For example, CV-B3 has been linked to myocarditis and encephalitis, whereas it could also cause outbreaks of HFMD as reported recently (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2019</xref>). CV-B5 is an important pathogen that caused the outbreaks of encephalitis and HFMD (
