<p>Echovirus 30 (E-30), which was classified as a member of 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> species B, has caused several diseases, including encephalitis, HFMD, myocarditis, and other mild clinical manifestations, such as fever and headache (

In rare cases, it can cause cute myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute flaccid paralysis in immunosuppressed transplant recipients (
