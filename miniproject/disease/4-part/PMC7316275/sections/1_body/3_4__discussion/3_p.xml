<p>To our knowledge, this is the first published documentation of the health care and public health structure as it relates to the case-based disease surveillance system in a rural Guinean prefecture during the era of the largest EVD outbreak in history. The case-based disease surveillance system in Boffa, Guinea during October 1, 2015â€“March 31, 2016, was simple in design, with three levels of case reporting and data exchange by telephone (community to prefectural) and by e-mail (prefectural to national). Despite zero reported cases, routine weekly reporting of (zero) cases from health care facilities to the prefectural health department and from the prefectural health department to the national level appeared to be complete and were received on time, as reported by the interviewees. However, the system relied heavily on telephone reporting with minimal documentation, making it impossible to fully assess data quality. Notably, interviewees at all levels of the disease-reporting structure requested additional training on data management and analysis. Other requests of support from the health centers included guidance on motivational strategies for community health workers, provision of rapid diagnostic tests, and information pamphlets on epidemic-prone diseases for the community. Based on this assessment, we conclude that system simplicity could be improved with the provision of weekly case count notebooks and case registers that are preformatted according to data collection forms in use country-wide. Preformatted tools would reduce the amount of staff time use to develop notebooks and would ensure that case data can be efficiently accessed for data analyses. Partners should consider capacity building throughout the system for data analysis, including developing epidemiologic curves, mapping the geographic distribution of cases, and data summaries by case characteristics. Any surveillance data analysis training should encompass interpretation, feedback to stakeholders and data providers, and use of results to inform public health action.</p>
