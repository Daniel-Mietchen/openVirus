<p>The diseases caused by food-borne pathogens can be classified into 2 forms: food-borne infection and food-borne intoxication.

 </sup> In food-borne infection (eg, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> food poisoning), live cells of the food-borne pathogen are ingested, while in food-borne intoxication (eg, 
 <italic>Clostridium botulinum food poisoning)</italic>, toxins are ingested. Some food-borne diseases involve both ingestion of live cells and toxins (eg, 
 <italic>C. perfringens food poisoning).</italic> For successful gastrointestinal infection, pathogens must gain access to the host in adequate numbers to initiate infection. Infective dose, which is the number of cells required to successfully infect a host, varies significantly among food-borne pathogens. For instance, the infective dose of 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> is about 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells while that of 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> is 10
 <sup>1</sup> to 10
 <sup>2</sup> cells.

 </sup> Once inside the host, the pathogens establish colonization, and this is facilitated by adhesion factors, invasion factors, chemotaxis, and sometime immune evasion. Most food-borne microorganisms such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> cause localized infection but some such as 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> spread to deeper tissues to induce systemic infection.
