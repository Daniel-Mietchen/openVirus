<p>Compared with bacteria, the other types of food-borne microbes tend to be carried by cockroaches to a lesser extent. Four main food-borne parasites are reported to be carried by cockroaches: 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia duodenalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="table2-1178630220913365" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These pathogens are transmitted faecal-orally from ingestion of their oocyst/cysts, which can persist and survive for long periods in the environment, water, and on foods.

 </sup> Among food-borne viruses, rotavirus and hepatitis A virus have been reported to be associated with cockroaches.

 </sup> Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea in young children globally, and is responsible for about 50% of paediatric diarrheal disease hospitalizations in developing countries.

 </sup> In this regard, the presence of cockroaches in homes could have serious implications for paediatric health. Hepatitis A is the most common form of acute viral hepatitis worldwide and therefore its association with cockroaches is a cause for concern, especially in the developing world where the infection is mostly prevalent.

 </sup> Several fungi implicated in food-borne infections have been isolated from cockroaches and include 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Mucor</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> spp. (
 <xref rid="table2-1178630220913365" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among these fungal pathogens, 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. poses the biggest threat to humans through the production of aflatoxins, which are extremely potent liver carcinogens.
