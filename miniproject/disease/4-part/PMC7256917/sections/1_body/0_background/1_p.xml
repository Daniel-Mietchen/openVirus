 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients’ outcomes in influenza range from simple upper respiratory infection (URI) to acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Influenza progresses rapidly and leads to morbidity and mortality within days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, influenza increases the mortality of vulnerable patient groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A modeling study estimated the global influenza-associated respiratory mortality in 33 countries between 1999 and 2015 and showed that the estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory excess mortality rate ranged from 0.1 to 6.4, 2.9 to 44.0, and 17.9 to 223.5 per 100,000 individuals in individuals younger than 65 years, between 65 and 74 years, and ≥ 75 years, respectively [
