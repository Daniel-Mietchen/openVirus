<p id="Par37">In 1992, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Consensus Conference committee introduced the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria to define sepsis and predict in-hospital mortality. The SIRS is a scoring tool that combines data on vital signs and white blood cell (WBC) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Most of the results of previous research suggested that the qSOFA score is specific but lacks sensitivity in predicting risk of either mortality or ICU admission [
