<p id="Par40">Patients with flu-like syndrome in the ED were evaluated by at least one emergency physician and managed by the guidelines approved by our ED committee. Most of these patients received the rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) or influenza reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. However, to avoid ED crowding, some patients with minor symptoms would be discharged home directly without further examinations, such as radiographic, laboratory, or flu investigations. This study was approved by the Institute Review Board, Chung Gang Memorial Hospital.</p>
