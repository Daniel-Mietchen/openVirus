 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The mean age of patients in this study population was 48 years, and 1716 patients (48.9%) were male. The CCI (mean ± SD) was 3.94 ± 4.19. Of the patients with influenza, 1527 (42.9%) were hospitalized (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and 286 (8.0%) were admitted to the ICU. The overall in-hospital mortality in this study population was 2.7%. Only 31 patients (0.9%) were readmitted within 72 h after direct discharge from the ED. The primary outcome of in-hospital mortality rate was 0.6, 7.2, 15.9, and 25% when the qSOFA score was 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Patients with qSOFA scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 had ICU admission rates of 2.8, 21, 34.8, and 58.3%, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Furthermore, we compared the performance of SIRS criteria for predicting in-hospital mortality, which was not associated with the SIRS criteria based on our results (Fig.
