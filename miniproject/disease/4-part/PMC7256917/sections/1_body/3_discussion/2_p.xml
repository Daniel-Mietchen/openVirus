<p id="Par52">Since the qSOFA score was developed, many people have evaluated its clinical value for sepsis. Some articles reported that the qSOFA as a good prognostic predictor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], whereas other studies found that the qSOFA may not be an adequate screening tool in the ED because of its poor sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis showed that the qSOFA was better than the SIRS was in predicting in-hospital mortality of sepsis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and a similar finding was observed in our cohort. The predictive performance of the qSOFA was better than that of the SIRS (good accuracy, but poor sensitivity) in the prognostication of patients with influenza, and we rationalized that this finding was related to the septic reaction induced by the influenza or a secondary bacterial infection.
