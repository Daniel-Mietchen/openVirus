<p id="Par51">Worldwide, influenza epidemics emerge almost every year and patient visits to the ED increase dramatically during the flu seasons. Most influenza infections are self-limiting and manageable with symptomatic treatment, and antiviral therapy might not be necessary in most patients. However, during the outbreak in Taiwan in 2015–2016, we observed extremely rapid disease progression in some patients. Severely ill patients may progress to acute hypoxic respiratory failure within 24 h even if the initial chest x-ray shows normal findings. Therefore, a simple early prognostic indicator might be clinically important to an emergency physician. In the present study, we found that the qSOFA score was a better prognostic indicator compared with the SIRS criteria.</p>
