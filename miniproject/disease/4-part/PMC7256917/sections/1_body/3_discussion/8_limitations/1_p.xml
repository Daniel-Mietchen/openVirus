<p id="Par58">This study has strength in numbers, although it was a single-center retrospective study with the inherent limitations of this study design. In addition, we might not have ordered an influenza test for everyone presenting to the ED with fever or URI symptoms, especially in the non-flu season. Moreover, all tests for influenza generate false negatives. These factors might induce some bias. Further studies are required to confirm our findings and prospectively validate the use of qSOFA in this specific patient population.</p>
