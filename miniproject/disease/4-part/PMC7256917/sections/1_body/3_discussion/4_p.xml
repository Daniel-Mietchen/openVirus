<p id="Par54">Several previous studies have reported the use of different prognostic scales of pneumonia to evaluate influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Myles et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] compared the performance of Community Assessment Tools (CATs), CURB-65 score, and the Pandemic Medical Early Warning Score in influenza. They found the CATs were a useful triage tool to predict severe outcomes. However, theirs was a case–control study and was limited to H1N1 infections, which might have conferred some bias. Another retrospective study used eight different scoring tools, including CURB-65, Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score, the Nursing Home-Acquired Pneumonia score, PMEWS, Pneumonia Severity Index, severity score for the elderly with community-acquired pneumonia score, SMART-COP Score, and Simple Triage Scoring System, to predict the outcomes of influenza in the ED [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These researchers found that the PSI and MEDS scores were moderately predictive of in-hospital mortality, and the SMARTCOP score was a good predictor of ICU admission. In the present study, we did not compare these pneumonia scales because all of these scoring tools need further radiographic or laboratory investigations. We did not routinely arrange these exams for every patient with flu-like symptoms in the ED. In addition, the qSOFA score is much easier and simpler to use for the frontline ED staff. Further prospective studies are required to define the roles of these scoring tools for influenza in the ED.
