<p id="Par23">Specific attraction of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> to human odor was evaluated using a dual-port olfactometer (160 ×60 ×43 cm) in a controlled environment room at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). The experiments included 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> as an anthropophilic control. To mimic human scent, a sheer polyamide stocking washed in 70% ethanol was worn by the experimenter for 12 hours and stored at −20 °C until use. An unworn stocking, which had been cleaned in the same manner, was used as control. Prior to the experiment, 5- to 7-day-old mosquitoes were deprived of sucrose for 24 hours. Batches of 20 to 30 females were transferred into a release chamber and allowed to acclimatize for 1 hour. Stockings were thawed during 1 hour and placed inside the traps according to two distinct experimental designs. The first design, denoted “CO
 <sub>2</sub> + Human odor vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only” hereafter, consisted of one trap with human odor and one trap with no odor. The second design, denoted “CO
 <sub>2</sub> only vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only” hereafter, consisted of both traps without human odor and was used as a negative control. This negative control ensures that the device is not intrinsically biased and that mosquitoes are not preferentially attracted to one of the traps in the presence of CO
 <sub>2</sub> only, a known mosquito attractant. The air stream was heated and humidified, then subsequently directed to traverse either trap until it reached the release chamber. The air stream was supplemented with CO
 <sub>2</sub> (5%) released at the entrance of each trap at a rate of 175 mL/min. The air speed at the exit of the traps was set at 0.2 m/sec with a variation of no more than 0.01 m/sec between each trap (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B,C</xref>). The sliding door of the release chamber was opened, and mosquitoes were allowed to enter the flight chamber for 20 min. During each run, mosquitoes that flew upwind towards the odor were caught inside the traps. A total of 9 replicates were performed for each mosquito species to test their attraction to human odor (CO
 <sub>2</sub> + Human odor vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only), in addition to 6 replicate runs for each species to control for any bias in the olfactometer (CO
 <sub>2</sub> only vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only). We used a Latin square design to randomize the position of each trap between replicate runs by systematically switching traps between the right and left openings. Flight activity was measured as the percentage of mosquitoes that exited the release chamber after 20 min. Attraction to human odor was estimated as the percentage of trapped mosquitoes that chose the trap with human odor over the trap with no odor in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> + Human odor vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only design. Our measure of attraction to human odor ranged from 0% (full attraction to CO
 <sub>2</sub> without human odor) to 100% (full attraction to CO
 <sub>2</sub> with human odor) with 50% indicating a lack of either attraction.
