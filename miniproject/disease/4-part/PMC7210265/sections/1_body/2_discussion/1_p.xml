<p id="Par10">In this study, we demonstrated that a sylvatic 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> population from a forested area of the Nakai district, Laos was competent for DENV-1 transmission, but to a lower extent than the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> control population. We also showed that this 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> population had lower YFV vector competence indices than the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> control population, although TR was low for both species in our experimental conditions. Finally, whilst our olfactometer experiment did find greater flight activation by CO
 <sub>2</sub> with human odor than by CO
 <sub>2</sub> only, 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> did not display attraction to human odor under these laboratory conditions. Overall, our assessment indicates a low potential for this sylvatic 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> population to act as an arbovirus bridge vector in rural Laos.
