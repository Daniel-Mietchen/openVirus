Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">Many emerging arboviruses of global public health importance, such as dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV), originated in sylvatic transmission cycles involving wild animals and forest-dwelling mosquitoes. Arbovirus emergence in the human population typically results from spillover transmission via bridge vectors, which are competent mosquitoes feeding on both humans and wild animals. Another related, but less studied concern, is the risk of ‘spillback’ transmission from humans into novel sylvatic cycles. We colonized a sylvatic population of <i>Aedes malayensis</i> from a forested area of the Nakai district in Laos to evaluate its potential as an arbovirus bridge vector. We found that this <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population was overall less competent for DENV and YFV than an urban population of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>. Olfactometer experiments showed that our <i>Ae. malayensis</i> colony did not display any detectable attraction to human scent in laboratory conditions. The relatively modest vector competence for DENV and YFV, combined with a lack of detectable attraction to human odor, indicate a low potential for this sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population to act as an arbovirus bridge vector. However, we caution that opportunistic blood feeding on humans by sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> may occasionally contribute to bridge sylvatic and human transmission cycles.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="Par2">Many emerging arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of humans such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses originated in sylvatic transmission cycles where they circulate between vertebrate animals and forest-dwelling mosquitoes<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup>. Over the last few centuries, these arboviruses have emerged into sustained transmission cycles among humans, causing substantial mortality and morbidity. Zoonotic arboviruses are typically brought into the human population by mosquitoes referred to as bridge vectors, which make the link between sylvatic and human transmission cycles. Bridge vectors are competent for arbovirus transmission and display host-feeding behavior towards both humans and non-human animals. The emergence or re-emergence of sylvatic arboviruses into the human population is an important public health concern<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup> that calls for careful investigations at the interface between human populations and the sylvatic environment.</p> <p id="Par3">Another related, but less studied concern, is the risk of ‘spillback’ of arboviruses from the human population into novel sylvatic cycles in regions where they were previously absent<sup><a href="#CR3">3</a></sup>. Not only are newly established sylvatic arbovirus cycles virtually impossible to eradicate, but such spillback events can have potentially serious consequences for wildlife. This was exemplified by yellow fever virus (YFV), which was introduced into the Americas from West Africa about 400 years ago during the slave trade and contributed to shape the expansion of settlements and colonial powers<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>. YFV also established sylvatic transmission cycles within the Amazon, Araguaia, and Orinoco river basins where it has been responsible for deadly outbreaks among non-human primates of the New World. The incriminated bridge vectors were mosquitoes in the genera <i>Haemagogus</i> and <i>Sabethes</i><sup><a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>. Recent reports from Kenya suggest that human dengue virus (DENV) infections may be a source of ‘spillback’ transmission to baboon populations<sup><a href="#CR6">6</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par4">The Nakai National Biodiversity Conservation Area, Nakai district, Khammouane province consists of dry evergreen forests, cloud forests and mountainous riverbeds that are the biotopes of various mosquito species and monkeys with increasing incursions of humans. About 10,000 humans (1.95 persons/km<sup>2</sup>) reside in and around this area bordering and within the primary forest of the Annamite Range<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. The mosquito <i>Aedes malayensis</i> in the <i>Stegomyia</i> sub-genus is widely distributed in South-East Asia with records in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Taiwan<sup><a href="#CR8">8</a>–<a href="#CR10">10</a></sup>. It was also identified in peridomestic habitats of Singapore as a putative vector of YFV, DENV and chikungunya virus<sup><a href="#CR11">11</a>,<a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>. Recently, our mosquito surveys in the Nakai National Biodiversity Conservation Area indicated the presence of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> in this area<sup><a href="#CR13">13</a>,<a href="#CR14">14</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par5">Here, we evaluated the potential of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> to act as an arbovirus bridge vector in the Nakai National Biodiversity Conservation Area, using a combination of vector competence assays and behavioral experiments. Relative to <i>Ae. aegypti</i> controls, we found that our field-derived <i>Ae. malayensis</i> colony had similar vector competence indices for DENV type 1, but a lower susceptibility to YFV. In addition, olfactometer bioassay measurements showed that this <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population was not significantly attracted to human odor in laboratory conditions. We conclude that although this sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population does not display a strong attraction to human odor, its vector competence for arboviruses such as DENV may contribute to bridge sylvatic and human transmission cycles when it engages in opportunistic blood feeding on humans.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Lower DENV-1 vector competence of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> relative to <i>Ae. aegypti</i></div> <p id="Par6">We measured the DENV-1 vector competence of 39 <i>Ae. malayensis</i> females and 53 <i>Ae. aegypti</i> females in two separate experiments. The data from both experiments were combined because initial analyses showed that none of the vector competence indices differed significantly between them. In each experiment, mosquitoes were exposed to an infectious dose of 1.16–1.38 ×10<sup>7</sup> FFU/ml of DENV-1. Vector competence was analyzed 14 days post infectious blood meal. The proportion of blood-fed females that became infected (i.e., the infection rate; IR) was 69.2% (27/39) and 100% (53/53) for <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, respectively (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). The difference in IR between the two species was statistically significant (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001). The proportion of infected females that developed a disseminated infection (i.e., the dissemination rate; DR) was 66.7% (18/27) for <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and 93.3% (42/45) for <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). The difference in DR between the two species was statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.004). The proportion of females with a disseminated infection that also released virus in their saliva (i.e., the transmission rate; TR) was 33.3% (6/18) for <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and 54.8% (23/42) for <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). The difference in TR between the two species was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.125). The overall proportion of blood-fed females with virus-positive saliva (i.e., the transmission efficiency; TE) was 15.4% (6/39) and 51.1% (23/45) for <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, respectively (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). The difference in TE between the two species, which summarizes their relative vector competence, was statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.0004). Together, these data indicate that <i>Ae. malayensis</i> is a competent DENV-1 vector, but to a lesser extent than the <i>Ae. aegypti</i> control population. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span></a></div>   <p>Vector competence of sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i> controls after exposure to 1.16–1.38 ×10<sup>7</sup> FFUs/ml of DENV-1.

Transmission efficiency (TE) is the overall proportion of blood-fed females that shed virus in their saliva. The <i>Ae. aegypti</i> population was included as a positive control. The figure compiles data from two independent experiments that did not differ significantly. Blood meal titers were 1.16 ×10<sup>7</sup> and 1.38 ×10<sup>7</sup> FFUs/ml in the first and second experiment, respectively. **<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01; ***<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001.</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="loweryfvvectorcompetenceofae.malayensisrelativetoae.aegypti" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"><b>Lower YFV vector competence of</b><b><i>Ae. malayensis</i></b><b>relative to</b><b><i>Ae. aegypti</i></b></div> <p id="Par7">We analyzed the YFV vector competence of 22 <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and 31 <i>Ae. aegypti</i> 14 days after oral exposure to an infectious blood meal containing 1.84 ×10<sup>6</sup> FFU/ml of YFV.

The DR was 10% (1/10) and 36.7% (11/30) for <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, respectively (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>), and the difference between the two species was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.087). The TR was 0% (0/1) and 9.1% (1/11) for <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, respectively (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>), and the difference between the two species could not be statistically tested because there was only 1 <i>Ae. malayensis</i> female and thus no replication. Overall, there was no evidence for a statistically significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.297) in vector competence between the two species, as TE was 0% (0/22) and 3.2% (1/31) for <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, respectively (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). However, the very small proportion of positive saliva samples overall (a single <i>Ae. aegypti</i> saliva sample was found positive) limited our ability to detect differences. Together, these data do not conclusively demonstrate the YFV vector competence of <i>Ae. malayensis</i>, but suggest that it is likely lower than that of the <i>Ae. aegypti</i> control population. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2</span></a></div>   <p>Vector competence of sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i> controls after exposure to 1.84 ×10<sup>6</sup> FFUs/ml of YFV.

This index of attraction varies from 0% (full attraction to CO<sub>2</sub> without human odor) to 100% (full attraction to CO<sub>2</sub> with human odor), with 50% indicating a neutral behavior (no effect of the human odor). To rule out any bias in the intrinsic attractiveness of the traps, we also performed control CO<sub>2</sub> only vs. CO<sub>2</sub> only experiments for each species. In the control experiments, 51% (95% CI: 36.8–65.2) of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> females and 56.2% (95% CI: 28.9–83.6) of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> females chose one trap over the other. For both species, the percentage of mosquitoes in each trap did not significantly differ from 50%, which confirmed the lack of bias between the traps. As expected, 87.5% (95% CI: 81.9–93.1) of trapped <i>Ae. aegypti</i> females chose the trap with human odor (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3B</a>), indicating significant attraction to human odor. In contrast, 33.3% (95% CI: 14.3–52.3) of trapped <i>Ae. malayensis</i> chose the trap with human odor (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3B</a>), and this percentage was not statistically different from 50% indicating a lack of response to human odor.

Discussion</div> <p id="Par10">In this study, we demonstrated that a sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population from a forested area of the Nakai district, Laos was competent for DENV-1 transmission, but to a lower extent than the <i>Ae. aegypti</i> control population. We also showed that this <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population had lower YFV vector competence indices than the <i>Ae. aegypti</i> control population, although TR was low for both species in our experimental conditions. Finally, whilst our olfactometer experiment did find greater flight activation by CO<sub>2</sub> with human odor than by CO<sub>2</sub> only, <i>Ae. malayensis</i> did not display attraction to human odor under these laboratory conditions. Overall, our assessment indicates a low potential for this sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population to act as an arbovirus bridge vector in rural Laos.</p> <p id="Par11">Mosquito vector competence for arboviruses depends on several tissue barriers associated with the midgut and the salivary glands<sup><a href="#CR15">15</a></sup>. The physiological and molecular nature of these barriers is poorly understood, but they are used as conventional phenotypes to characterize vector competence. IR informs on the midgut infection barrier (i.e., preventing infection of midgut epithelium), DR represents the midgut escape barrier (i.e., preventing virus exit from the midgut cells into the haemocoel), and TR relates to both salivary glands infection and escape barriers<sup><a href="#CR16">16</a></sup>. Our sylvatic colony of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> was experimentally competent for DENV-1, but its overall TE ( = IR x DR x TR) was lower than that of the <i>Ae. aegypti</i> control. This difference resulted from significantly lower IR and lower DR, but not lower TR (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). This pattern suggests that the lower vector competence of this <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population compared to the <i>Ae. aegypti</i> control is not primarily due to salivary glands barriers, but rather to midgut-related mechanisms hindering virus infection and dissemination. The pattern was different for YFV, for which all vector competence phenotypes were similar between the two species with the exception of IR (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). In our experiment, the same oral infectious dose of YFV infected about twice less <i>Ae. malayensis</i> than <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, whereas subsequently DR and TR did not differ significantly. Nevertheless, the low TR overall limited our ability to detect a difference between the two species. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying differences in vector competence between <i>Ae. malayensis</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>.</p> <p id="Par12">The results obtained with this sylvatic population of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> in Laos should not be extrapolated to other populations of the species. Indeed, vector competence of a mosquito species for an arbovirus depends on the specific combination of the mosquito and the virus genotypes<sup><a href="#CR17">17</a>,<a href="#CR18">18</a></sup> as well as on environmental factors such as ambient temperature<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a></sup>. The mosquito <i>Ae. malayensis</i> is widely distributed across South-East Asia with documented occurrence in Vietnam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, Taiwan, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Laos, and Thailand<sup><a href="#CR8">8</a>–<a href="#CR11">11</a>,<a href="#CR13">13</a></sup>. Recently, a peridomestic population of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> in Singapore was shown to be competent for diverse arboviruses such as DENV, YFV and chikungunya virus<sup><a href="#CR11">11</a>,<a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par13">A human-baited trap survey demonstrated that this peridomestic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> in Singapore displayed an anthropophilic behavior<sup><a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>, as was also documented for other field populations of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> in South-East Asia<sup><a href="#CR8">8</a>,<a href="#CR9">9</a></sup>. The discrepancy between the present and the earlier studies could be due to several, non-mutually exclusive explanations. First, there could be biological differences in human-biting behavior between different populations of the same species, as was observed for <i>Ae. aegypti</i><sup><a href="#CR20">20</a>,<a href="#CR21">21</a></sup>. Second, behavioral assays in the laboratory may lack critical cues underlying host-seeking behavior in the field. Indeed, multiple sensory modalities such as CO<sub>2</sub>, heat and visual cues that were not present in our simplified laboratory approach may contribute to attract <i>Ae. malayensis</i> to feed on humans in a natural situation<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a>,<a href="#CR23">23</a></sup>. Moreover, volatiles were collected from the foot only and <i>Ae. malayensis</i> might not respond to foot odor since metabolites and volatiles largely vary according to the human body part<sup><a href="#CR24">24</a></sup>. Additionally, the human-associated microbial flora may have been largely eliminated during −20 °C storage of the stocking used to collect human odor. Although our behavioral bioassay successfully detected a strong attraction of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> to human scent, it is possible that for <i>Ae. malayensis</i> the experimental setup did not faithfully represent a natural situation. Additionally, the fact that more <i>Ae. malayensis</i> responded to the combination of CO<sub>2</sub> and human odor than CO<sub>2</sub> only indicated that they were activated by human odor, implying that human odor was enough to initiate flight and stimulate the beginning of a host location response, but perhaps not follow through to closer-range behavior. It would be interesting to increase the complexity of the sensory signals available for the mosquitoes to better mimic the natural conditions, for example using a live host olfactometer assay<sup><a href="#CR20">20</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par14">Arbovirus bridge vectors represent the most likely mechanism of arbovirus spillover transmission to humans. Whereas sylvatic YFV transmission is only known to occur in Africa and South America, sylvatic DENV transmission cycles have been documented in the forests of South-East Asia. In particular, sylvatic DENV transmission was reported in peninsular Malaysia where sylvatic DENV strains were isolated from sentinel monkeys such as the crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) in remote forest reserves<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a>,<a href="#CR2">2</a>,<a href="#CR25">25</a>–<a href="#CR27">27</a></sup>. Crab-eating macaques are distributed across South-East Asia and can also be found in the forests of southern Laos<sup><a href="#CR28">28</a></sup>. Whether sylvatic DENV strains circulate in forests of Laos in unknown, but their emergence in the human population is a concern in those areas<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup> because they can potentially result in severe disease<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. The NNT NPA harbors abundant biodiversity with the presence of at least nine non-human primate (NHP) species such as macaques, gibbons, langurs, and red-shanked doucs<sup><a href="#CR29">29</a></sup>. Further investigations at the human-forest interface in Laos are necessary to evaluate the risk of spillover DENV transmission to humans.</p> <p id="Par15">Dengue is endemic in Laos with the circulation of at least three serotypes (i.e., DENV-1, -2 and -4) all year long and yearly epidemics during the rainy season<sup><a href="#CR30">30</a>,<a href="#CR31">31</a></sup>. Dengue epidemics occur not only in urban areas, but also in more rural settings. For instance, an outbreak of DENV-1 was detected in 2008 in a remote village of northwestern Laos<sup><a href="#CR32">32</a></sup>. DENV-3 was isolated from <i>Armigeres subalbatus</i> collected on the Nakai plateau<sup><a href="#CR33">33</a></sup>. DENV circulation in rural Laos increases the risk of spillback transmission to NHPs because most of the people living in rural Laos still depend on the forest to sustain themselves. Moreover, one of the goals of WMPA is to develop ecotourism in the NNT NPA. Similar projects exist in the country or are in development. Therefore, infected travelers represent another possible source of DENV introduction or re-introduction into the sylvatic environment. This risk is likely under-estimated as humans can transmit DENV to mosquitoes in the absence of clinical symptoms<sup><a href="#CR34">34</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par16">To more fully assess the potential of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> as an arbovirus bridge vector, future studies will need to consider additional populations of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> found in various ecological habitats both in Laos and in surrounding countries of South-East Asia, as well as other virus strains and serotypes including sylvatic DENV isolates. In addition, it will be important to account for other parameters underlying the vectorial capacity such as the longevity of female mosquitoes.</p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="conclusion"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par17">The relatively modest vector competence for DENV and YFV, combined with a lack of detectable attraction to human odor, indicate a low potential for this sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> population to act as an arbovirus bridge vector. However, we caution that opportunistic blood feeding on humans by sylvatic <i>Ae. malayensis</i> may occasionally contribute to bridge sylvatic and human transmission cycles. The presence of susceptible NHPs combined with the possibility of a human-mediated introduction of DENV into the sylvatic environment are additional risk factors that should be taken into account. Once entrenched, a newly established sylvatic cycle would undermine long-term DENV control in Laos.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Olfactometer bioassays</div> <p id="Par23">Specific attraction of <i>Ae. malayensis</i> to human odor was evaluated using a dual-port olfactometer (160 ×60 ×43 cm) in a controlled environment room at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4A</a>). The experiments included <i>Ae. aegypti</i> as an anthropophilic control. To mimic human scent, a sheer polyamide stocking washed in 70% ethanol was worn by the experimenter for 12 hours and stored at −20 °C until use. An unworn stocking, which had been cleaned in the same manner, was used as control. Prior to the experiment, 5- to 7-day-old mosquitoes were deprived of sucrose for 24 hours. Batches of 20 to 30 females were transferred into a release chamber and allowed to acclimatize for 1 hour. Stockings were thawed during 1 hour and placed inside the traps according to two distinct experimental designs. The first design, denoted "CO<sub>2</sub> + Human odor vs. CO<sub>2</sub> only�? hereafter, consisted of one trap with human odor and one trap with no odor. The second design, denoted "CO<sub>2</sub> only vs. CO<sub>2</sub> only�? hereafter, consisted of both traps without human odor and was used as a negative control. This negative control ensures that the device is not intrinsically biased and that mosquitoes are not preferentially attracted to one of the traps in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> only, a known mosquito attractant. The air stream was heated and humidified, then subsequently directed to traverse either trap until it reached the release chamber. The air stream was supplemented with CO<sub>2</sub> (5%) released at the entrance of each trap at a rate of 175 mL/min. The air speed at the exit of the traps was set at 0.2 m/sec with a variation of no more than 0.01 m/sec between each trap (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4B,C</a>). The sliding door of the release chamber was opened, and mosquitoes were allowed to enter the flight chamber for 20 min. During each run, mosquitoes that flew upwind towards the odor were caught inside the traps. A total of 9 replicates were performed for each mosquito species to test their attraction to human odor (CO<sub>2</sub> + Human odor vs. CO<sub>2</sub> only), in addition to 6 replicate runs for each species to control for any bias in the olfactometer (CO<sub>2</sub> only vs. CO<sub>2</sub> only). We used a Latin square design to randomize the position of each trap between replicate runs by systematically switching traps between the right and left openings. Flight activity was measured as the percentage of mosquitoes that exited the release chamber after 20 min. Attraction to human odor was estimated as the percentage of trapped mosquitoes that chose the trap with human odor over the trap with no odor in the CO<sub>2</sub> + Human odor vs. CO<sub>2</sub> only design. Our measure of attraction to human odor ranged from 0% (full attraction to CO<sub>2</sub> without human odor) to 100% (full attraction to CO<sub>2</sub> with human odor) with 50% indicating a lack of either attraction. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 4</span></a></div>   <p>Dual-port olfactometer apparatus.

Transmission rate (TR) was estimated as the proportion of females with a disseminated infection that released virus in their saliva. Transmission efficiency (TE) is a summary metric estimated as the overall proportion of blood-fed females with virus-positive saliva. Vector competence indices (IR, DR, TR and TE) were analyzed with a logistic regression model in which each individual mosquito was associated with a binary variable (infected = 1, uninfected = 0), followed by an analysis of deviance with the R package <i>car</i><sup><a href="#CR43">43</a></sup>.
