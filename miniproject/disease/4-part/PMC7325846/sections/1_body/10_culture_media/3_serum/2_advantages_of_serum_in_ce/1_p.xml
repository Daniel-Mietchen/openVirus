   <label>1.</label>
   <p id="p0425">It has basic nutrients present either in soluble or in protein-bound form.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0105">
   <label>2.</label>
   <p id="p0430">It provides several hormones such as insulin and transferrin. Insulin is essential for the growth of nearly all cells in culture and transferrin acts as an iron binder.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0110">
   <label>3.</label>
   <p id="p0435">It contains numerous growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and chondronectin. These factors stimulate cell growth and support specialized functions of cells.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0115">
   <label>4.</label>
   <p id="p0440">It supplies protein, which helps in the attachment of cells to the culture surface (e.g., fibronectin).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0120">
   <label>5.</label>
   <p id="p0445">It provides binding proteins such as albumin and transferrin, which helps transport molecules in cells.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0125">
   <label>6.</label>
   <p id="p0450">It provides minerals such as Ca
    <sup>2+</sup>, Mg
    <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
    <sup>2+</sup>, K
    <sup>+</sup> Na
    <sup>+</sup>, Zn
    <sup>2+</sup>, etc., which promote cell attachment.

   <label>7.</label>
   <p id="p0455">It increases the viscosity of the medium, which provides protection against mechanical damage during agitation and aeration of suspension cultures.</p>
