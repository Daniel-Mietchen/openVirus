<p id="p0380">Complete formulation of media that supports growth and maintenance of a mammalian cell culture is very complex. For this reason, the first culture medium used for cell culture was based on biological fluids such as plasma, lymph serum, and embryonic extracts. The nutritional requirements of cells can vary at different stages of the culture cycle. Different cell types have highly specific requirements, and the most suitable medium for each cell type must be determined experimentally. Media may be classified into two categories: (1) natural media and (2) artificial media.</p>
