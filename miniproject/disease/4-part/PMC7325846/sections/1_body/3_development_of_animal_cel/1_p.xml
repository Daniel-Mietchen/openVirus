<p id="p0070">The first mammalian cell cultures date back to the early 20th century. The cultures were originally created to study the development of cell cultures and normal physiological events such as nerve development. Ross Harrison in 1907 showed the first nerve fiber growth in vitro. However, it was in the 1950s that animal cell culture was performed at an industrial scale. It was with major epidemics of polio in the 1940s and 1950s and the accompanying requirement for viral vaccines that the need for cell cultures on a large scale became apparent. The polio vaccine from a de-activated virus became one of the first commercial products developed from cultured animal cells (
