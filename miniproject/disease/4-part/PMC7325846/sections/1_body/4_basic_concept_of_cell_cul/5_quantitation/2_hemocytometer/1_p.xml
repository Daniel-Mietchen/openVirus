<p id="p0135">Cell counts are important for monitoring growth rates as well as for setting up new cultures with known cell numbers. The most widely used type of counting chamber is called a hemocytometer. It is used to estimate cell number. The concentration of cells in suspension is determined by placing the cells in an optically clear chamber under a microscope. The cell number within a defined area of known depth is counted, and the cell concentration is determined from the count.</p>
