<p id="p0095">Fragments exercised from animal tissue may be maintained in a number of different ways. The tissue adheres to the surface aided by an extracellular matrix (ECM) constituent, such as collagen or a plasma clot, and it can even happen spontaneously. This gives rise to cells migrating from the periphery of the explant. This culture is known as a primary explant, and migrating cells are known as outgrowth. This has been used to analyze the growth characteristics of cancer cells in comparison to their normal counterparts, especially with reference to altered growth patterns and cell morphology.</p>
