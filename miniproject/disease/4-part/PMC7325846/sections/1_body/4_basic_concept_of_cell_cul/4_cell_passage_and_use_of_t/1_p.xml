<p id="p0125">Passaging is the process of subculturing cells in order to produce a large number of cells from pre-existing ones. Subculturing produces a more homogeneous cell line and avoids the senescence associated with prolonged high cell density. Splitting cells involves transferring a small number of cells into each new vessel. After subculturing, cells may be propagated, characterized, and stored. Adherent cell cultures need to be detached from the surface of the tissue culture flasks or dishes using proteins. Proteins secreted by the cells form a tight bridge between the cell and the surface. A mixture of trypsin-EDTA is used to break proteins at specific places. Trypsin is either protein-degrading or proteolytic; it hydrolyzes pepsin-digested peptides by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. EDTA sequesters certain metal ions that can inhibit trypsin activity, and thus enhances the efficacy of trypsin. The trypsinization process and procedure to remove adherent cells is given in
