<p id="p0900">Therapeutic antibodies are used in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections, and autoimmune diseases. In 2004, the antibody Avasin (Bevacizeimab) was approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. This antibody acts as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor. Zenapax, another commercially available antibody, is used during prophylaxis for preventing the rejection of transplanted organs. This is commercially grown in the NSO cell line and was approved for human use in 1997.</p>
