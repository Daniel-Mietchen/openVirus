<p id="p0865">Growth factors are proteins that bind to receptors on the surface of cells to activate the cells for proliferation and or differentiation. The different types of growth factors are TGF, insulin-like growth factor, and (EGF. The primary sources of PDGF are platelets, endothelial cells, and the placenta. Two isoforms of this protein are present in the human body and both of these have one glycosylation site and three disulfide bonds. Examples of growth factors used as biopharmaceuticals are the following:
