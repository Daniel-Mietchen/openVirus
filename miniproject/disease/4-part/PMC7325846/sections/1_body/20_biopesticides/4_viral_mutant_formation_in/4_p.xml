<p id="p0990">DIP mutations are the formation of DIPs. They occur due to serial passaging for long periods, which results in a decrease in the filtering of infectious virus. DIPs have been reported in a number of animal virus systems and in baculovirus systems. DIP formation can be avoided by low multiplicity of infection. This minimizes the probability of the defective virus entering the cell with an intact helper virion.</p>
