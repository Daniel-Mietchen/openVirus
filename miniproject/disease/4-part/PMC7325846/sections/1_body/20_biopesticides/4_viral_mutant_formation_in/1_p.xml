<p id="p0975">The continuous culturing of cells for virus production leads to virus instability and the so-called passage effect. This can result in a decrease of virulence and polyhedral production and a variety of mutations. All these changes affect commercial production in vitro. Two types of mutations are commonly seen in continuous passaging of cell cultures for viral productions: (1) defective infective particles (DIPs) and (2) few polyhedral (Fp) mutations.</p>
