<p id="p0190">When primary cell cultures are passaged or subcultured and grown for a long period of time in fresh medium, they form secondary cultures and are long-lasting (unlike cells of primary cell cultures) due to the availability of fresh nutrients at regular intervals. The passaging or subculturing is carried out by enzymatic digestion of adherent cells. This is followed by washing and re-suspending of the required amount of cells in appropriate volumes of growth media. Secondary cell cultures are preferred as these are easy to grow and are readily available; they have been useful in virological, immunological, and toxicological research.</p>
