<p id="p0270">The culture becomes confluent at the end of the log phase as growth rates during this phase are reduced, and cell proliferation can cease in some cases due to exhaustion. The cells are in contact with surrounding cells, and the growth surface is occupied. At this stage, the culture enters the stationary phase and the growth fraction falls to between 0% and 10%. Also, the constitution and charge of the cell surface may be changed, and there may be a relative increase in the synthesis of specialized versus structural proteins.</p>
