<p id="p0250">The cells in the culture show a characteristic growth pattern, lag phase, exponential or log phase, followed by a plateau phase. The population doubling time of the cells can be calculated during the log phase and plateau phase. This is critical and can be used to quantify the response of the cells to different culture conditions for changes in nutrient concentration and effects of hormonal or toxic components. The population doubling time describes the cell division rates within the culture and is influenced by nongrowing and dying cells.</p>
