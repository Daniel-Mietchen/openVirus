<p id="p0915">The first step in gene therapy is to identify the faulty gene. This is followed by gene isolation and generation of a construct for correct expression. Integration of the gene followed by delivery of the genetic material in vivo or ex vivo is crucial to the success of gene therapy. In in vivo therapy, the genetic material is introduced directly into the individual at a specific site, and in ex vivo treatment, the target cells are treated outside the patientâ€™s body. These cells are then expanded and transferred back to the individual at a specific site. The ex vivo technique involves gene therapy in the cultured cells, which are expanded and subsequently transferred to the targeted tissue.</p>
