<p id="p0755">Animal cell culture technology has played an important role in the development of viral vaccine production. The establishment of cell culture technology in the 1950s and the consequent replacement of live animals for the development of antigens have led to considerable progress in bioprocess technology. With the advent of DNA technology, molecular manipulation of viruses has led to the development of a recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and several others potential vaccines that are in the final phase of clinical trials.
