<p id="p0760">Viral particle production by cell culture differs from the production of molecules such as proteins, enzymes, and toxins by bacteria or animal cells. The product formation may not be related to the development or growth of a cell and may occur through secondary metabolic pathways, unlike virus production, which does not result from secondary metabolic pathway. Virus production occurs after the viral infection directs cell machinery to perform viral particle production.</p>
