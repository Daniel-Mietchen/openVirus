<p id="p0795">Viruses of the Papillomaviridae family are known to induce lesions and warts and also cause cervical cancer. Fifteen strains of Papillomaviridae are known to cause cervical cancer. HPV-16 is considered a high-risk HPV type as the risk of cancer may be higher than for other high-risk HPV types. The two virally encoded proteins of HPV are L1 and L2. L1 is the main capsid protein that forms the outer shell of the virus. L2 is found in the interior of the viral particle and is less abundant. The recombinant L1 VLP is able to induce neutralizing antibodies in animals. Gardasil (the first HPV vaccine) was approved by the FDA in 2006. This vaccine is manufactured by Merck and Co., Inc.
