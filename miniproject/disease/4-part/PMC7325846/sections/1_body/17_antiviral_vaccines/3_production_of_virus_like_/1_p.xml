<p id="p0780">Most of the existing classical vaccines for viral disease are either altered or chemically inactive live viruses. However, incomplete inactivation of a virus or reversion of an attenuated strain can risk infection in vaccinated individuals. Viruses with segmented genomes with a high degree of genetic exchange can undergo re-assortment or recombination of genetic material with viruses of different serotypes in the vaccinated host, which can result in the production of new variants of the virus. Moreover, some live virus vaccines are teratogenic; for example, Smithburn neurotropic strain (SNS) (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Caplen et al., 1985</xref>) vaccine strains of the Rift Valley fever virus. A new type of vaccine that does not present the typical side effects of an attenuated or inactivated viral vaccine has been made possible with the development of rDNA technology. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are highly effective as they mimic the overall structure of the virus; however, these particles lack the infectious genetic material. Capsid proteins can aggregate to form core-like particles in the absence of nucleic acids. These spontaneously assembled particles are structurally similar to authenticate viruses and are able to stimulate B-cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, VLPs stimulate a CD4-proliferative response and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response (
