<p id="p0210">Cell lines obtained from in vitro transformed cell lines or cancerous cells are indefinite cell lines and can be grown in monolayer or suspension form. These cells divide rapidly with a generation time of 12–14 hours and have a potential to be subcultured indefinitely. The cell lines may exhibit aneuploidy (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bhat, 2011</xref>) or heteroploidy due to an altered chromosome number. Immortalized cell lines are transformed cells with altered growth properties. HeLa cells are an example of an immortal cell line. These are human epithelial cells obtained from fatal cervical carcinoma transformed by human papilloma virus 18 (HPV18). Indefinite cell lines are easy to manipulate and maintain. However, these cell lines have a tendency to change over a period of time.
