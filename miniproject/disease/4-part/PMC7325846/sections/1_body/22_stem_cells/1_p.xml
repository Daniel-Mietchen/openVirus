<p id="p1010">Stem cells are unspecified cells that have the potential to differentiate into other kinds of cells or tissues and become specialized cells. The two characteristics that define stem cells are their ability of self-regenerate and to differentiate into any other cells or tissues. These cells have the capability to renew themselves to form cells of more specialized function. In recent years, stem cell research has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of medicine. This property of turning a cell into any other specialized function cell has made researchers believe that stem cells could be utilized to make fully functional, healthy organs to replace damaged or diseased organs.</p>
