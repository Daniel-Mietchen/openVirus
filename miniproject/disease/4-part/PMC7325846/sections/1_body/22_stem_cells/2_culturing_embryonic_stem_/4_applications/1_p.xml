<p id="p1040">Microfluidics technology has emerged as a viable and robust platform for tissue engineering—a multidisciplinary field aimed at replacing and repairing damaged and diseased tissues and/or organs and developing in vitro models to mimic physiological conditions. Successful clinical applications include the development of organ-on-a-chip technology—a microfluidic perfusion device for regenerative medicine—and a chip-based platform for the culture of cells and toxicological studies.</p>
