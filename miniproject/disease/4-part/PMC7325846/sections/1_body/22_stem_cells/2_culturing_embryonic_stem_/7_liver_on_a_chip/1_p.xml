<p id="p1055">Various chemicals and drugs, when administered over a long period, result in adverse effects and acute liver toxicity, known as hepatotoxicity (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gershell &amp; Atkins, 2003</xref>). In vitro models used for identifying drug-induced liver toxicity have drastically limited utility. Therefore, efficient and reliable tools for testing liver toxicity are required. Microfluidics devices for liver tissue and cells that can maintain metabolic activity and can be used for drug discovery and toxicity studies have shown great potential for solving this problem.
