<p id="p0285">Temperature is one of the most fundamental variables as it directly interferes with the growth and production processes. On a small scale, thermostatically controlled incubators can be used to control temperature. However, cell cultures grown on a large scale in bioreactors require more sensitive control of temperature. Different bioreactors use different methods to maintain the temperature of the cell culture. Temperature in a bioreactor is maintained by a heat blanket and water jacket with a temperature sensor.</p>
