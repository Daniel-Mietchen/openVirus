<p id="p0055">Early studies targeting antibody prophylaxis to prevent RSV infection in high-risk infants utilized high-titer human immunoglobulin products obtained from screened volunteers administered to infants intravenously 
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In one study, where high-risk children were administered monthly doses of intravenous immunoglobulin containing high levels of RSV neutralizing antibody (RSV-IVIG) had reduced rates of hospitalization from RSV infection. This human immunoglobulin product, Respigam (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD), was licensed in 1996. Subsequently, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the F-protein of RSV, Palivizumab (Synagis; MedImmune and AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK), was evaluated and approved in 1998 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use by intramuscular injection in high-risk children. The studies definitively demonstrated that RSV-specific antibody alone may prevent or reduce RSV disease in infants 
 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Currently, Palivizumab is the only FDA- and European Medicines Agency-approved therapy utilized for the prophylaxis of RSV in infants and young children who are at increased risk of hospitalization. Palivizumab was originally approved for preterm infants &lt; 35 weeks gestational age, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and those with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. This preventive approach, requiring the intramuscular administration of 15 mg/kg of Palivizumab at 4-week intervals during the RSV season, has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing serious RSV illness and hospitalization in high-risk young children 
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Further refinements of recommendations for Palivizumab prophylaxis have changed over the past decades due in part to considerations of cost effectiveness

 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Impacts of a more restrictive policy on Palivizumab use in the US which limits its use among preterm infants to those less than 29 weeks of gestation at birth have been described, with increasing cases of RSV hospitalizations and morbidity in young infants 29–34 weeks gestation reported in some studies 
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Surveillance systems in place and other studies, including birth cohorts, will further inform policy on the use of Palivizumab for the prevention of severe RSV in high-risk infants in the US. Specific recommendations for pediatric populations that should receive Palivizumab therapy currently varies by country.
