<p id="p0040">More recently, the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and sites in four countries evaluated the impact of RSV in hospitalization among pregnant women in high income countries – the US, Canada, Israel and Australia 
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Among a total population of 1,604,2016 pregnant women hospitalized over various seasons from 2010 to 2016, 15,287 (15%) had at least one hospitalization associated with a diagnosis of acute respiratory or febrile illness, but only 6% of those admitted were tested for viruses, including RSV, highlighting the low level of awareness and testing for RSV by obstetric providers. Importantly, 2.5% (range 1.9–3.1%, 21 RSV-positive cases in total) of women tested were positive for RSV by PCR. Two-thirds of the tests and diagnoses of RSV occurred in the third trimester of pregnancy. A pre-existing health condition was documented in 38% of women, with asthma being the most common. Importantly, a diagnosis of pneumonia was more frequent among RSV-positive compared to RSV negative women (38% vs. 19%,

 <italic>p</italic>  = 0.034). There were, however, no differences in the frequency of overall low birth weight and small-for-gestational age infants between RSV-positive and negative women. This study suggests that RSV is an important cause of LRTI in hospitalized pregnant women, particularly those with underlying medical conditions, however given the small proportion of pregnant women tested for RSV during a hospital admission with acute respiratory illness, further data is required to fully appreciate the burden in this population.
