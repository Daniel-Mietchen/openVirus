<p id="p0035">Data from influenza vaccine trials has been commonly used to determine the incidence of RSV and other respiratory viruses in order to estimate RSV epidemiology in pregnant women. This approach permits the evaluation of many pregnant women in prospective studies but has potential issues, with the main limitations being the use of influenza-like-illness (ILI) criteria requiring the presence of fever to guide which samples are obtained for the diagnosis of respiratory illness. Also, surveillance has often been ongoing only during influenza season. ILI criteria are typically based on the combination of fever and cough and/or sore throat, but the majority of cases of RSV in adults are afebrile

 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In Nepal, where nasal swabs were collected prospectively from women with a fever and respiratory symptoms year round, RSV prevalence was 0.2%, with an incidence of 3.9/1000 person-years overall. In South Africa, RSV prevalence during the maternal influenza trial where specimens were obtained based on the presence of any respiratory symptoms was much higher at 2%, or an incidence of 14.4â€“48.0 cases per 1000 person-years overall 
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Importantly, no maternal RSV case in the South Africa trial had a fever documented. RSV was not associated with an increased risk of low birth weight or preterm birth in either the South African or Nepal studies, although numbers of RSV-infected women in both studies were small.
