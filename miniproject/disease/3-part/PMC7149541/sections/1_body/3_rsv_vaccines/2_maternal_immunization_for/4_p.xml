<p id="p0125">A non-adjuvanted purified F-protein (PFP-2) vaccine for RSV was the first vaccine evaluated in pregnancy nearly 20 years ago, in the early 2000s 
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This was a small proof of concept, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 35 healthy women who were vaccinated at 30–34 weeks of gestation, and in whom the RSV PFP-2 vaccine was well tolerated, though it did not significantly increase neutralizing antibody titers to RSV, and was not further developed. Nevertheless, maternal immunization with this experimental vaccine was safe in mothers and infants, no obstetric adverse events were associated with vaccination, efficient transplacental passage of vaccine induced antibodies was demonstrated, the half-life of these antibodies was estimated to be between 30 and 40 days, and anti-F IgA and IgG were present in breastmilk of vaccine recipients at higher concentrations than placebo recipients in the first 6 months after delivery. Importantly, after close follow up of these infants for natural infection in two consecutive viral seasons, no enhanced RSV disease was observed.
