<p id="p0135">Lastly, an aluminum-adjuvanted RSV F-protein nanoparticle vaccine (Novavax, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland, US) was evaluated in women of childbearing age 
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> and in a phase II study in pregnant women prior to being the first vaccine evaluated in a phase III clinical trial, seeking an indication for administration in pregnancy. The phase II study demonstrated that the vaccine was safe and well tolerated, and induced significantly higher concentrations of both anti F-IgG, but also neutralizing antibodies and Palivizumab competing antibodies 
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. This study also found that maternal antibody responses peaked at 14 days after vaccination, and that an interval of ≥ 30 days from maternal vaccination to delivery maximized transplacental antibody transfer for all measured antibodies 
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. This study allowed the progression to a global phase III efficacy clinical trial to evaluate this maternal vaccine for the protection of RSV in infants. This clinical trial in healthy pregnant women was conducted in 11 countries worldwide from 2015 to 2019. The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of maternal immunization against medically significant RSV LRTI in infants through various time points including the first 90 days of life, and up to 180 days, when mothers were vaccinated with a single dose of vaccine at 28–36 weeks of gestation. The clinical definition of medically significant RSV LRTI included the presence of at least two clinical symptoms of illness, laboratory confirmation of RSV infection by PCR, and objective assessment of tachypnea and hypoxemia (O
 <sub>2</sub> saturation &lt; 95%). Secondary endpoints included the reduction of RSV LRTI hospitalization and RSV LRTI with severe hypoxemia (O
 <sub>2</sub> saturation &lt; 92%). Preliminary data shared to date by the manufacturer indicates that among 4636 women who were randomized 2:1 to receive vaccine or placebo, the vaccine was well tolerated and was not associated with any vaccine-related maternal, infant or obstetric adverse event. This study failed to meet its primary objective of efficacy against medically significant RSV LRTI in infants, which was estimated to be 39.4% (97.5% CI, − 1 to 63.7) at 0–90 days of life, and the secondary outcome of RSV LRTI with severe hypoxemia was also not met. However, maternal vaccination was effective in protecting infants against RSV-associated LRTI hospitalization in the first 90 days and up to 180 days after birth (

While vaccine licensure based on this study is unlikely in the US given the observed geographic variability in vaccine efficacy and overall lower numbers of cases than expected, the results are encouraging. When pre-specified analyses were conducted to evaluate these results utilizing expanded data (which increased the number of evaluable subjects), the vaccine efficacy achieved in the first 90 days of life varied between 40% and nearly 60% for these primary and secondary outcomes (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which is considered a result worthy of continuing the development and evaluation of this vaccine. This study was pivotal in generating data to better understand the potential for maternal RSV immunization to prevent the most severe outcomes of RSV in infants, and to answer specific programmatic questions, such as the impact of the timing of immunization during pregnancy and the interval between vaccination and delivery to optimize the impact of maternal immunization in protecting the infant. The observation that geographic, seasonal, and potentially, population based differences in vaccine efficacy can occur will help inform the design of future clinical trials. While these and other results from this study continue to be evaluated, the experience of this trial has provided further impetus for the ongoing development and evaluation of RSV vaccines for maternal immunization, with an important contribution to defining the clinical endpoints to which clinical trials should be powered to.
