<p id="p0145">In parallel, the research field is active in establishing standardized methods for the assessment of RSV infection and immunity, the clinical assessment of severity of disease, and the determination of correlates of protection against RSV. Preferred product characteristics for RSV vaccines have been developed by the WHO 
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> and a clear road map for the research and development of technology associated with RSV vaccines is in place 
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Various vaccine candidates remain in preclinical and clinical phases of development, while work to identify the key necessary elements for the implementation of maternal RSV vaccines worldwide continues with the support of multiple stakeholders

 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Implementation of RSV vaccines for maternal immunization should be guided by accurate estimates of RSV disease burden in infants to determine their potential impact. Establishing robust surveillance systems to assess vaccine safety and efficacy outcomes after implementation is key, as is the support from key policy makers, national and local maternal and child health systems and other funding and administrative organizations (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). A successful maternal immunization delivery platform would include integrated antenatal and neonatal care services and immunization programs, informed by existing vaccination (e.g. tetanus and influenza) and routine antenatal care interventions (e.g. HIV diagnosis and prevention), which would likely need strengthening, financial and policy support. Lastly, effective communication plans and advocacy planning are important elements to ensure vaccine uptake by educating providers, pregnant women, parents, and the public about the impact of RSV and the role of maternal immunization in the prevention of infant disease and its associated mortality.
