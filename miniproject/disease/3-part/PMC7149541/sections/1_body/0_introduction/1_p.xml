<p id="p0010">The impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on global health is becoming increasingly appreciated. Advances in RSV diagnostic methods, with increasing availability of rapid sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, as well as enhanced understanding of the molecular structure and function of the virus, have accelerated our understanding of RSV biology and epidemiology over the past decade. Serious RSV disease in infants, elderly, and immunocompromised hosts is now well recognized, and development of potential RSV preventative measures are underway. Although no RSV vaccine is currently available to prevent RSV, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that an RSV vaccine will be in clinical use within the next 5–10 years 
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Many strategies for the prevention of RSV in infants, children, and adults are under consideration. The potential of maternal immunization to prevent serious disease in infants will be discussed in this chapter.
