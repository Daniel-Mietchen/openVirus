  <p>Distribution of NV SNV frequencies in the partial P region. Samples syh1 and syh2, and syh2 and syh3, were collected after 7 and 4 months, respectively. Only SNVs with frequencies &gt;1% are included. The distributions of SNVs across the sequence in the three samples were similar, with most SNVs occurring at positions 880â€“895.
