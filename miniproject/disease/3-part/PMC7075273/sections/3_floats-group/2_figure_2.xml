  <p>Analysis of capsid alignment of the haplotypes. Commonly defined epitopes are shown as colored frames. Orange, epitope A; green, epitope D; blue, epitope E; red, epitope F. HBGA-binding sites are marked by Δ, and red Δ are conserved aas constituting the GII conventional HBGA-binding interface. The positive and negative selection pressures determined by the Datamonkey algorithms are shown as red plus and black minus signs, respectively. Solid black-underlined sequence indicates the P domain of the capsid.</p>
