  <p>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the VP1 nt sequences of the patient compared to representative related NV GII.4 VP1 sequences in GenBank. Reference sequences are indicated by colors; red nodes represent sequences from the patient in this study. The three VP1 sequences belong to Sydney 2012, and were closest to the Henan strain from China.</p>
