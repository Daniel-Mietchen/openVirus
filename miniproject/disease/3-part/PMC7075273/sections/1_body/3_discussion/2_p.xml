<p>One of 10 patients (1%) or 3 of 50 (0.6%) fecal samples were positive for NVs, lower than a previously report (10%) in hematological malignancies (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bok et al., 2016</xref>). This may be related to the short time of sample collection and the small number of samples collected in this study. Interestingly, the three NV-positive samples were from the same patient. Although the patient had been using anti-rejection drugs after transplantation, symptoms of mild diarrhea and long-term fever persisted. No bacterial, mycotic, or

 <italic>difficile</italic> toxin was detected, and no other common diarrhea-related virus was found in the stool. Although the blood was negative for NV (data not shown), the quantitative results showed that the concentration of NV in feces was stable at 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mL 10% (w/v) stool suspension, which was lower than that in acute infection and comparable to that in chronic infections (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Steyer et al., 2018</xref>). We cannot determine whether the patientâ€™s fever and diarrhea were caused by NV. However, it can be inferred that the virus adapted to host immunity so that it can be stable in the host; on the other hand, the moderate immunity of the host provided selective pressure to the NVs and could generate new variants, which had been reported in previous studies (
