<p>The NVs reported in this study were most similar to the strain reported in Henan, China in 2017, followed by that in Sydney in 2012. Sequence analysis of the P domain showed that the NV population in the patient was highly heterogeneous at the nt level and encompassed a large number of NV quasispecies. The dN/dS ratios of the S and P domains were &gt;1, indicating strong positive selection and suggesting that a large number of NV quasispecies were present in the host. A previous study showed many positive selection sites in the capsid protein of an enterovirus with strong antigenicity (
