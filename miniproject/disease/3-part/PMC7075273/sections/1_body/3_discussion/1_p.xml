<p>Despite its high population seroprevalence, GII.4 NV strains have circulated worldwide for decades, and new strains emerge and replace ancestral strains. Different GII.4 NVs exhibit different ligand-binding properties and antigenicity (

New GII.4 NV strain emergence is associated with changes in antibody blockade epitopes, and it is assumed that GII.4 NV persistence in the human population is driven by viral evolution that results in antigenic drift and changes in binding characteristics to escape herd immunity. NV infections in immunocompromised patients after transplantation are regarded as chronic symptomatic infections. It was found that numerous mutations in the capsid did not alter the HBGA binding profiles, and chronically infected patients might not generate novel variants that cause outbreaks (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mai et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Steyer et al., 2018</xref>). Our data provided insight into the extensive genetic diversity and evolution of NVs in a patient following allo-HSCT, and suggested that novel variants of NV GII.4 with HBGA and antigenic site changes were produced; chronically infected cases may serve as a potential reservoir for novel NVs.
