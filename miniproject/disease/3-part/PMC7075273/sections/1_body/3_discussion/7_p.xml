<p>A phylogenetic analysis of NV haplotypes based on the capsid nt sequences showed that the three variants belong to the Sydney 2012 lineage, and were closest to the HNZZ201707 strain, which was identified in China in 2017. Therefore, the patient may have been exposed to circulating NV strains. However, the first sample, syh1, showed only 98.34% nt identity to HNZZ201707, suggesting that the patient was infected some time before the initial sampling. With the accumulation of mutations, the distance between the variants and the HNZZ201707 strain increased over time within the host. Therefore, NVs may evolve into new strains quite different from known NV GII.4 strains.</p>
