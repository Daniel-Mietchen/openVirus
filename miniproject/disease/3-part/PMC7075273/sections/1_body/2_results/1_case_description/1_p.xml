<p>Three of the fifty fecal samples were positive for NV GII.4. Interestingly, the three samples (syh1, syh2, and syh3) were collected at different times from the same patient. The patient was a 32-year-old female with anemia, transfusion dependency, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytosis diagnosed as myelodysplastic syndrome, refractory anemia with excess blast 5–9% (MDS RAEB-I) in June 2016. An allo-HSCT was performed, in which the stem cells were from her HLA identical sibling. After the transplant, a long-term fever of up to 38.5°C developed gradually, accompanied by mild dyspnea. Conventional bronchoalveolar lavage fluid examinations such as bacterial and fungal culture, acid-fast stain of tubercle bacillus and PCR for Epstein–Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were negative. All anti-infection therapy was ineffective. Chronic lung graft versus host disease (GVHD) was suspected. Following oral administration of cortical hormone and tacrolimus, the dyspnea was relieved, and the body temperature returned to normal within 7 days. But 2 months later, the fever relapsed and persisted for more than 2 years accompanied by mild diarrhea (grade 1, CTCAE/NCI). Her stool was loose, without blood or pus. No bacterial, mycotic, or 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> toxin A was detected in the stool. Three samples were collected on April 13, 2018 (syh1), November 19, 2018 (syh2), and March 25, 2019 (syh3). During this period, the patient had a fever of up to 37.8°C. She received oral cortical hormone (30 mg daily) and tacrolimus for 19 months to control the suspected chronic GVHD.
