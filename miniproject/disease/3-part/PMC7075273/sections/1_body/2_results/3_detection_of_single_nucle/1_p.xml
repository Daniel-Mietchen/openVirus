<p>Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified in the high-throughput sequencing data to assess the intra-host genetic diversity. A short fragment (72 bp) in the P region was used for the analysis. We only called a SNV if it was observed in &gt;1% of the reads to reduce false positives. Using this criterion, we detected different SNVs in the reads from the three samples. The first sample (syh1) had 14 SNVs, the second sample (syh2) had 51 SNVs, and the third sample (syh3) had 31 SNVs, indicating a high level of genetic diversity of NVs. Compared to the first sample, both the number and frequency of SNVs increased in the second and third samples. The lower number of SNVs in syh1 was not due to less sensitive detection, as it had a much higher average coverage than syh3, and comparable average coverage to syh2. The distributions of SNVs across the sequence in the three samples were similar (

The non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution ratio was also determined (
