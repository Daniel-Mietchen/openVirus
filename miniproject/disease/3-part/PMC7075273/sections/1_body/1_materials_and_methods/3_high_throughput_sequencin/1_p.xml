<p>After dilution and filtration (0.45 and 0.22 Î¼m membranes), total nucleic acids were extracted from the samples. Using the SuperScript
 <sup>TM</sup> III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, United States), cDNA was synthesized, and were subjected to random PCR amplification using primers with unique barcodes. The PCR products were pooled for sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Metagenomic profiling of the shotgun datasets was carried out using the customized informatics pipeline VirusSeeker for computational identification of viral sequences (
