<p>Samples were diluted at a 1:10 ratio (w/v) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Total RNA was extracted and the partial ORF2 gene was amplified by conventional RT-PCR for genotyping as described previously (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kojima et al., 2002</xref>). The three samples from the patient were subjected to amplification of the full capsid gene, as described previously (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Vennema et al., 2002</xref>). The GII.4 NV viral loads in the samples were quantified by real-time PCR as reported previously (
