<p>A phylogenetic analysis was performed using both the maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony methods in the PHYLIP package with 100 bootstrap replicates. To precisely estimate the substitution rate of VP1 in immunocompromised populations, a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was implemented using BEAST software (v.1.8.2). jModelTest software (v.2.1.7) was used to identify the optimal evolutionary model. The results were computed and analyzed using Tracer v.1.6. The effective sample size values for the estimated parameters in the MCMC analyses were &gt;200. Statistical uncertainty in the data was reflected by the 95% highest probability density values.</p>
