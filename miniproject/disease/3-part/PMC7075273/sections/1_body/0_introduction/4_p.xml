<p>To evaluate NV evolution during chronic infection, we present a case of prolonged NV infection in a patient following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We examined the intra-host NV populations and assessed immune-driven NV evolution in the chronically infected immunocompromised host and explored the strength of the positive selection for NV mutants.</p>
