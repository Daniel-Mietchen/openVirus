  <p>Far western blot analysis to show factor H 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and VCP 
   <bold>(B)</bold> binding with purified H1N1 and H3N2. IAV subtypes (1.36 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>pfu/ ml) were first run on the SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The transferred membrane was then incubated with 10 μg/ml of factor H or VCP. The membrane was probed with either monoclonal mouse anti-human factor H or polyclonal rabbit anti-VCP antibody. Factor H and VCP bound to HA (~70 kDa), NA (~55 kDa), and M1 (~25 kDa) in the case of both IAV subtypes. The identities of factor H and VCP bound IAV glycoproteins were validated using a separate blot that was directly probed with monoclonal anti-HA 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, anti-NA 
   <bold>(D)</bold>, and anti-M1 
   <bold>(E)</bold> antibodies.
