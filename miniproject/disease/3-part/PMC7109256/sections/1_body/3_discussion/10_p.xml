<p>In conclusion, data from restriction of M1 mRNA levels, pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and luciferase reporter activity highlights the potential of factor H and VCP as cell entry inhibitors against the H1N1 IAV subtype. It appears that factor H and VCP restrict viral entry for H1N1, whilst conversely promoting H3N2 entry, which may be due to the inherent antigenic variations in binding sites for HA or NA. Further studies are required to pinpoint the specific molecular interactions of factor H and VCP against HA and NA by investigating a range of IAV strains with antigenic variability. This will not only provide further data on the pathogenesis of IAV infection, but also the utility of factor H and VCP, and their recombinant CCP modules, as possible cell entry inhibitors against IAV.</p>
