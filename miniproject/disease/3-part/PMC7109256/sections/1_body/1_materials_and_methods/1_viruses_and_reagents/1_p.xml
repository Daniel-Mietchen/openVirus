<p>The IAV subtypes used in this study, including the pH1N1 (A/England/2009) and H3N2 (A/HK/1999), were provided by Wendy Barclay (Imperial College, London) and Leo Poon (University of Hong Kong), respectively. The plasmids used for the production of H1N1 and H3N2 pseudo-typed viral particles were obtained from Addgene; pHIV-Luciferase (Addgene plasmid #21375); psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid # 12260); and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV-G) (Addgene plasmid #8454). pcDNA3.1-swineH1-flag (H1 from swine H1N1 A/California/04/09) (Invitrogen), pcDNA3.1-swine N1-flag (N1 from swine H1N1 A/California/04/09), and pCDNA H3 (from A/Denmark/70/03 (H3N2) (Invitrogen) were obtained commercially. pI.18-N2 [N2 from A/Texas/50/2012/(H3N2)] plasmid was a gift from Nigel Temperton (University of Kent). Anti-influenza antibodies used were obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, USA, and used as previously described (
