<p>The VCP gene (accession 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="X13166.1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">X13166.1</ext-link>) was codon-optimized for expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells by GeneArt® using GeneOptimizer® (Geneart GmbH, Regensburg). For lentiviral expression, amplified VCP cDNA was ligated into the pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO vector, using the ViraPower Lentiviral Directional TOPO Expression kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (K4950-00 Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad CA). Following transformation into DH5α chemically competent 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, a number of colonies were analyzed for correct insertion and orientation using colony PCR. Transient transfection of the plasmid pLenti6/V5/VCP in HeLa cells and indirect immunofluorescence using anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen # R960-25) was performed to verify the VCP expression. Replication-incompetent lentiviral stock was made by co-transfection with the ViraPower
 <sup>TM</sup> Packaging Mix (pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSVG: K4975-00, Invitrogen Corp) in HEK 293FT cells (ATCC CRL-1573) cells using Lipofectamine 2000® reagent (Life Technologies Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after co-transfection, viral supernatant was collected, concentrated by centrifugation, and the titer was determined using standard procedures. A number of stable HEK 293FT cell lines expressing VCP were generated under neomycin selection (0.5 g/L) and screened for VCP expression by Western blot analysis. Three clones of HEK-293 cells secreting high levels of the VCP were selected and cultured. Secreted VCP was purified using a heparin column. Column-bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–0.5 M NaCl). Fractions were collected and analyzed via SDS-PAGE and western blotting.
