<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a severe respiratory pathogens, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family and responsible for outbreaks with high morbidity, and mortality in both humans and animals (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). IAV exhibits antigenic variations within viral surface glycoproteins, including hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA) (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). HA is the most important viral glycoprotein that can bind to sialic acid on host cells, enabling cellular fusion and viral entry (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). HA epitopes are also known to trigger synthesis of neutralizing antibodies by B cells, allowing IAV to escape from immune surveillance, leading to seasonal epidemics (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). NA cleaves sialic acid moieties, which enables release of virions, and promotes IAV dispersion (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). There are around 16 antigenic variants of HA and 9 of NA, which are found in numerous combinations and subtypes (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Among all subtypes of IAV, H1N1 and H3N2 are the predominant IAV subtypes for seasonal flu in humans, with annual epidemics estimated to result in ~5 million cases of severe illness and half a million respiratory deaths (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Current circulating human IAV strains are likely to continue acquiring mutations resulting in antigenic drift and shift of HA and NA glycoproteins (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), which enhance the virus' ability to evade host immune system, promoting rapid viral invasion and replication.
