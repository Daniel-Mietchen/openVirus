<p>In the alternative pathway of the complement system, factor H is an important negative regulator that interacts with negatively charged surfaces containing sialic acids and glycosaminoglycans, and protects cellular structures from C3 convertase formation, hence diminishing complement activation. Factor H is a soluble, 155 kDa glycoprotein present at a concentration of 128–654 μg/ml in human plasma (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). It is composed of 20 complement control protein (CCP) modules with different ligand binding properties. There is plenty of evidence of the local extrahepatic synthesis of factor H [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)]. Factor H binds to many pathogens via charge interactions (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and for pathogens, surface-bound factor H may be of benefit for their survival. Factor H binds to sialic acids on 
 <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and the outer surface of OspE of 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, providing complement resistance to these pathogenic microbes. Its interaction with soluble West Nile virus NS1 protein has also been described (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Furthermore, 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> binds factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) to prevent complement-mediated lysis in the mosquito midgut via the plasmodial transmembrane gliding-associated protein 50 (GAP50) (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Factor H can also bind to the surface of mycobacteria, restrict their uptake by macrophages, and modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine responses (
