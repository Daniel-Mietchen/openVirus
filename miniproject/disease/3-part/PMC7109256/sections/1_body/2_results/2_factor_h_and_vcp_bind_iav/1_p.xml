<p>Since factor H was able to inhibit hemagglutination by H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes, a direct ELISA was set up with factor H -coated plates to establish possible interaction with IAV viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We also examined, for the first time, the likely interaction between IAV and VCP, which contains CCP modules (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) like human factor H. A/England/2009 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/1999 (H3N2) strains were used in this study. A comparable dose-dependent binding by factor H and VCP was evident with H1N1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and H3N2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) subtypes. VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus was used as a negative control, which did not show any binding with either factor H or VCP. The ability of factor H and VCP to interfere with IAV binding to A549 cells was then assessed via the cell binding assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). An increase of IAV binding in presence of factor H and VCP was seen at the concentration of 10 μg/ml for both H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes, and the binding occurred in a dose and calcium dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that factor H and VCP enhance binding of IAV to target cells, which in turn interferes with viral infection in a complement-independent manner. The binding of factor H and VCP was more effective in the case of H1N1 than H3N2. We then set up a far western blot to identify viral particles binding to factor H and VCP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In this assay, virus subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and were probed with either 10 μg/ml factor H or VCP. The far western blot also revealed the binding of factor H and VCP to HA (~70 kDa), and M1 (~25 kDa) of both H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, factor H also bound to NA (~55 kDa) of H3N2 strain more strongly compared to H1N1 strain.
