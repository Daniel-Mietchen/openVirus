    "Key Features •The majority of emerging diseases are caused by viruses, with many that are transmitted by insect vectors or are zoonotic.•RNA viruses in particular have high mutation rates and can evolve rapidly in new and changing environments. This, in combination with societal factors, climate change, and rapid travel, has increased the number of epidemics from emerging pathogens in the last several decades.•Understanding the travel history, incubation time of potential viruses, and the clinical presentation by illness day is essential in making the right diagnosis and identifying the infecting virus."
