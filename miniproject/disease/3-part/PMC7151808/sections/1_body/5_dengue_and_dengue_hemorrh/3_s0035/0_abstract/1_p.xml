<p id="p0060">Dengue is the most common and significant arboviral disease throughout the world. It is caused by infection with any one of four dengue virus serotypes (DENVs 1â€“4). The clinical manifestations of a DENV infection can range from an inapparent or mild febrile illness, to the more symptomatic and well-described dengue fever, to the most severe and sometimes fatal form of illness, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (severe dengue). The distinguishing characteristic of severe dengue is a vascular leakage syndrome that develops around the time of defervescence. The relative risk for developing severe dengue is increased in individuals with sequential heterologous DENV infections. Patients with dengue, or suspected dengue, who manifest pre-defined warning signs require close monitoring and supportive care during the critical phase of illness. The case-fatality rate for severe dengue is &lt;1% with early recognition and appropriate supportive care and management.</p>
