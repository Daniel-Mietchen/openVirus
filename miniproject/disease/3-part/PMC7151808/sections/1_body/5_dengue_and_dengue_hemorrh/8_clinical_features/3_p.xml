<p id="p0175">DHF/DSS is the dengue clinical syndrome whose distinguishing feature is abrupt plasma leakage from the intravascular to the extravascular space. The World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for DHF/DSS incorporates three additional clinical criteria beyond DF and has established a grading scale of I to IV for DHF severity (

 </xref> Despite the moniker “hemorrhagic fever,” most often the hemorrhagic manifestations may only be a positive tourniquet test or spontaneous skin or mucosal petechiae. Severe coagulopathy is nearly always seen in the context of profound shock and multi-organ failure. Recent WHO guidelines have moved away from the DHF case definition and, instead, proposed a new case definition termed

 </xref> Whether defined as DHF/DSS or severe dengue, the majority of serious morbidity and mortality caused by DENV infections is due to a vascular leakage syndrome with hypotension and shock. Clinically significant hemorrhage can sometimes occur in the absence of vascular leakage, particularly in adults. Other uncommon complications of DENV infections include hepatic necrosis, encephalopathy/encephalitis, and chorioretinitis. Unlike Zika virus infection, DENV infection during pregnancy has not been associated with congenital malformations.
