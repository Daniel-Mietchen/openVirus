 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 36.1.1</xref> ). In the Asian tropics, all four DENV serotypes co-circulate, creating a large region of hyper-endemicity. Dengue outbreaks occur with predictable seasonality and periodicity. The majority of dengue cases are seen during the rainy season in a given year. Through a complex interplay of population immunity, vector biology, and environmental conditions, a shift in the dominant circulating DENV serotype typically occurs every 4 to 6 years. The shift in the dominant circulating DENV serotype often leads to waves of large-scale epidemic dengue activity.

 </xref> Historically, the Americas were characterized by isolated and interspersed dengue outbreaks of a single infecting serotype. Over the past several decades, Asian genotype DENV strains have spread throughout the Americas accompanied by increased co-circulation of multiple DENV serotypes.
