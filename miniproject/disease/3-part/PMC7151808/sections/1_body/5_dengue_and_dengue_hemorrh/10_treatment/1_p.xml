<p id="p0295">No specific anti-viral therapies are available for dengue. The vast majority of uncomplicated dengue can be managed on an outpatient basis with rest, oral rehydration solution, and analgesia/antipyretics. The use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided, as they can exacerbate platelet dysfunction and mucosal bleeding. Patients and the parents of affected children should be notified of the warning signs and symptoms that should prompt an immediate return to medical attention.</p>
