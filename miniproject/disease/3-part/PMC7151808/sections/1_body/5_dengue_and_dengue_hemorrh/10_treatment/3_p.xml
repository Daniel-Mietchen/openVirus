<p id="p0305">Prophylactic platelet transfusions have not proven to be useful in dengue and should be avoided. Platelet transfusions can be considered in patients with thrombocytopenia and clinically significant hemorrhage. Intramuscular injections, multiple large-bore intravenous lines, and diagnostic or prophylactic placement of nasogastric tubes should be avoided, except as needed in the most severe cases. If possible, complicated or unusual severe dengue cases should be transferred to experienced referral centers in the area. The case-fatality rate for severe dengue is &lt;1% with early recognition and appropriate supportive care and management.</p>
