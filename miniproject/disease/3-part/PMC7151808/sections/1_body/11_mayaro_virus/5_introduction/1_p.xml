<p id="p1145">Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense, arthropod-borne RNA virus in the family Togaviridae, genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus.</italic> Typically, it causes Mayaro fever, an acute fever illness, accompanied by intense arthralgia and a rash syndrome.

 </xref> Mayaro virus causes sporadic cases or small outbreaks in forest workers, but has caused a few larger epidemics, particularly in Brazil and nearby South American countries, especially in people living in communities near or inside the forest. The original isolation of Mayaro virus occurred in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954 from the blood of febrile patients. Two major epidemics were described in the Brazilian Amazon region

 </xref>; smaller epidemics have been recognized since then in other parts of Brazil and in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

 </xref> The virus has been isolated several times from 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp. mosquitoes, mainly from 
 <italic>H. janthinomys</italic> species, which is considered the primary potential vector. There are three distinct genotypes of the virus. In addition, a unique strain of Mayaro virus has been recovered from 
 <italic>Coquillettidia venezuelensis</italic> in Trinidad, two others from 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> spp., and one from 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., which can represent spillover of the virus from the hosts.
