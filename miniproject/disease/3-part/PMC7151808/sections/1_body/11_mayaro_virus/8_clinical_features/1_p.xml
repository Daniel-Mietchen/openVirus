<p id="p1165">Mayaro fever is clinically characterized as an acute febrile illness, generally accompanied by headache, myalgia, rash, chills, and photophobia. Dizziness, eye pain, nausea, and vomiting are less frequently reported. Arthralgia, predominantly affecting the wrists, fingers, ankles, and toes, as well as a cutaneous rash, are also commonly observed on the trunk and extremities.

 <xref rid="bib7.3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Occasionally, there may also be painful joint swelling that can persist. In some patients, arthralgia lasts up to a year. An aspect to consider is the possibility of co-circulation of MAYV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in a same area, because both viruses are members of the Semliki Forest group in the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus, and a high cross-reactivity is present in serologic tests even on IgM-ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Thus the molecular biology approaches are more indicated to confirm MAYV and/or CHIKV infection; indeed, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard diagnostic test to make a confirmation of infection by both viruses.
