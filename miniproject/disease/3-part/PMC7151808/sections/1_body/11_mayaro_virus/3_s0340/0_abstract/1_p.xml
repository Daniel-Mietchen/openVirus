<p id="p1050">Mayaro fever is an arboviral disease characterized by an acute onset with fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and pruriginous skin rash. The causal agent is the Mayaro virus (MAYV) that is a member of the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus of the Togaviridae family. Three MAYV genotypes have been identified. MAYV belongs to the Semliki Forest complex group, together with other viruses such as chikungunya, O'nyong-nyong, Ross River, and Bharmah Forest, among others, that cause fever, skin rash, and arthralgia. In northern South America, MAYV is widely recognized, and the prevalence is increasing within communities with close contact with forested areas. MAYV is mainly transmitted by 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp., especially 
 <italic>H. janthinomys,</italic> to non-human primates, and humans are tangentially infected when intruding on the natural ecosystem where the virus is endemic. The arthralgias are severe and last several months. There is no specific treatment, nor vaccines to prevent Mayaro fever; non-hormonal analgesics should be used to combat arthralgias.
