  <bold>Diagnosis:</bold>
 </italic> SFTS should be considered in patients presenting with fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia between spring and fall, with a history of exposure to ticks or relevant animals in endemic areas of China, Japan, and South Korea. Laboratory diagnosis consists of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (if available) during the first week of illness, or virus-specific IgM/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after the first week.

 </xref> Because the clinical presentation is non-specific, the differential diagnosis is broad and may include scrub typhus, rickettsial infections, anaplasmosis, leptospirosis, Q fever, dengue fever (where endemic), and other etiologies.
