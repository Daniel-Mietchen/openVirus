<p id="p0055">Treatment and control are virus specific, emphasizing the need for early recognition and ordering the appropriate diagnostics. Many of the viruses that are responsible for febrile illnesses and are considered emerging or emerged have no available treatment or vaccine. Reading through the specific viruses and chapters in this book will give the reader valuable information on potential treatments. For vector-borne or zoonotic viruses, control will be specific and include both aerial and larvicidal spraying for mosquito-borne viruses, personal protection practices for both mosquitoes and ticks, and animal control for zoonotic-borne viruses. Contact practices and/or isolation may be appropriate for viruses that can be transmitted human to human, such as the respiratory viruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and the filoviruses Marburg and Ebola.</p>
