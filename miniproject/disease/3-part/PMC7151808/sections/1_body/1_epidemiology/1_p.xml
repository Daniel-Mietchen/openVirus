<p id="p0035">We are humbled by a 2011 editorial entitled “Microbiology by Numbers,” which estimates that “if all the 1 × 10
 <sup>31</sup> viruses on earth were laid end to end, they would stretch for 100 million light years!”

 </xref> Additionally in this editorial, it is estimated that there are approximately 1400 known species of human pathogens which includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites and represents 1% of the total number of microbial species on the earth.

 </xref> Approximately 50% of the human pathogens have an origin in the animal species.

 </xref> The potential of the remaining 99% of microbial species to adapt and transform into potential human pathogens is daunting and emphasizes the challenges we face in recognizing and predicting the next epidemic. 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 36.1</xref> lists the reported outbreaks by year as reported by the World Health Organization.

 </xref> Conclusions that we can draw from this table are that the majority of the reported outbreaks of diseases in the world are caused by viruses, the majority of these viruses are RNA viruses, most have an animal reservoir in their life cycle, and the majority of outbreaks affect developing countries and potential “hot spots” for emerging pathogens. Jones et al. analyzed 335 emerging infectious disease events between 1940 and 2004.

 </xref> Emerging disease events were found to have risen significantly over time, with the peak number of events occurring in the 1980s corresponding to the HIV pandemic. Emerging disease events were predominantly zoonotic (60.3%), originated from wildlife (71.8%), and are increasing over time. Factors that determine the emergence of these viruses include (1) high mutation rate and adaptation of the RNA viruses; (2) human intimacy (cross-species transmission) and movement of animal species due to land development and migration from political conflicts; (3) increase in urbanization; (4) climate change with increase and spread of potential insect vectors and changes in migratory patterns of birds; and (5) societal mobility through air travel.
