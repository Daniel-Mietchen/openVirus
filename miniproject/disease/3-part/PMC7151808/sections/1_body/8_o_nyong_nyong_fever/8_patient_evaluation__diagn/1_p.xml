 </xref> Careful history and physical examination should be directed at excluding other illnesses, as well as finding supportive features such as rash. Virus can be detected in whole blood by molecular amplification (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), with greatest sensitivity during the first 3 days after the onset of illness. Serology can help to establish the diagnosis, which can be made by the detection of specific IgM or by paired acute and convalescent sera showing development of specific IgG. IgM typically appears during the second week of illness and persists for about 2 months, but can be as long as 6 months in some cases.
