<p id="p1020">OROV has been found in Brazil, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago, and is basically maintained by two different life cycles. One occurs in urban areas of tropical cities in the Amazon basin and involves humans as the vertebrate hosts, with 
 <italic>Culicoides paraensis</italic> midges as the major arthropod vector. Transmission in general occurs outdoor in the daytime, especially during sunrise and sunset. The other described life cycle is sylvatic and not well understood and is based on serologic prevalence involving wild mammals (especially sloths and monkeys) and birds as the potential vertebrate hosts. The arthropod vector in the sylvatic life cycle is unknown, but may include
