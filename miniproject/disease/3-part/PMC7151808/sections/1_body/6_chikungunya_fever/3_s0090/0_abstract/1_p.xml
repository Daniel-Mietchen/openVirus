<p id="p0320">Chikungunya fever is a re-emerging arboviral disease characterized by the abrupt onset of fever with severe arthralgia followed by constitutional symptoms and rash lasting for approximately 1 week. The disease is nearly always self-limited, but some patients may have joint pain that persists for weeks or months. There is no specific treatment, and supportive care is indicated during the acute symptoms. It is transmitted by the bite of infected 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. There is no commercially available vaccine; therefore preventive efforts focus on the avoidance of mosquito bites and mosquito vector control.
