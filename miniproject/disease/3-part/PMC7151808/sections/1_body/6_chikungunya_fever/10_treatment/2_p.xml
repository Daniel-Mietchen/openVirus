<p id="p0440">Because no vaccine or specific medication is yet available against CHIKV infection, vector control is very important in controlling or preventing transmission. Elimination of breeding sites or source reduction is an important control approach. 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> is typically a container-habitat species (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 36.2.4</xref> ) and breeds primarily in artificial containers and receptacles. Therefore all water tanks, cisterns, barrels, trash containers, etc., need to be covered tightly with a lid. Old tires, tin cans, buckets, drums, bottles, etc., should be removed, as mosquitoes may breed in these containers if they accumulate water. In ornamental garden water tanks, larvivorous fish (e.g
 <italic>.</italic>, gambusia, guppy) can be introduced. In case water containers cannot be emptied on a daily or weekly basis, larvicidal treatments can be applied.
