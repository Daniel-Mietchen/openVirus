 <italic>Emerging diseases and/or pathogens</italic> is a term used frequently when describing new or spreading infections in the human population. It is a term used to describe the emergence of previously unrecognized pathogens that produce human disease or recognized pathogens expanding in different ways through the population.

 </xref> Emerging diseases have historically been responsible for civilization-altering events. Bubonic plague during the 14th century was responsible for the death of 60% of the European population.

 </xref> The Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 resulted in the death of 50 to 100 million worldwide; the rinderpest epidemic in livestock in Eastern Africa during the 19th century resulted in the starvation of 75% of the Massai population; and potato blight produced the Irish potato famine, reducing the Irish population by 25%.

 </xref> Our generation has had dramatic experiences in the last decade with emerging or reemerging pathogens that rapidly spread and result in death or illness in large segments of the population, to include many of the pathogens mentioned in this section and outlined in this book, such as Ebola and Zika viruses. For the clinician, the challenge is to distinguish a viral febrile illness caused by an endemic pathogen from one that is “emerging” and has the potential for human-to-human spread, requiring isolation and, if available, targeted therapy. The scenario is common: a patient presents to the emergency room, usually on a weekend, with fever and a constellation of symptoms and a recent history of travel overseas. The fear is this Ebola, Lassa fever, or another unknown contagious pathogen, and are the clinician and the staff at risk? In this section the epidemiology, clinical features, and evaluation of the patient with a potential viral febrile illness from an emerging pathogen are discussed.
