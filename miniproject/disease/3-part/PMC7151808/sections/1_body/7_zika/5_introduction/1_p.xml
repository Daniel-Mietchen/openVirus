<p id="p0535">Zika virus, a single-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus,</italic> originally isolated in Africa, gained worldwide attention in 2015 and 2016 when massive outbreaks in Brazil were followed by a marked increase in infants born with severe microcephaly and congenital abnormalities. The virus subsequently spread throughout the Americas. Intense research activities have answered key questions about Zika virus, its spread, and control, but gaps in knowledge remain.
