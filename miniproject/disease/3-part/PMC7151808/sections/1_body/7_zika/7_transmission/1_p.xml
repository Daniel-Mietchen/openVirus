<p id="p0545">Infection is spread primarily via infected female mosquitoes, with 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> being the primary vector in the Americas. 
 <italic>A. albopictus,</italic> which can survive in more temperate areas, can also transmit Zika virus. These mosquito vectors infest most sub-tropical and tropical regions globally, including urban areas (areas with a total population of about 3.6 billion people). Seasonality of transmission is linked to local temperature and rainfall patterns. The same mosquitoes can also transmit dengue and chikungunya (and co-transmission can occur). In the past 10 years, Zika transmission has been reported from at least 84 countries.

 </xref> Zika virus can be transmitted vertically in 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The transmission cycle in the Americas has been person–mosquito–person. It is not known whether the virus will become established in an animal reservoir host in the Americas, as occurs in Africa, where the virus infected animal hosts and occasionally spilled over into the human population—at least in the past.

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> provides a suitable environment for transmission.
