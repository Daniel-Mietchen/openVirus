<p id="p0560">Perinatal transmission of Zika virus was reported to occur in the French Polynesia outbreak in 2013 to 2014, but the association between Zika virus and microcephaly was not recognized until the observations had been made in Brazil and a retrospective study was done in 2016 based on serologic and surveillance data.

 </xref> Zika virus can infect the placenta, reach the developing fetus, and can target neural precursors. Maternal infection disrupts fetal central nervous system development and causes intrauterine growth retardation and fetal loss. Infection is associated with cortical malformations and intra-cranial calcifications. The congenital malformations include ventriculomegaly, dystrophic calcifications, severe cortical neuronal depletion, decreased brain weight, congenital contractures, marked early hypertonia with symptoms of extrapyramidal involvement, and ocular and hearing problems.
