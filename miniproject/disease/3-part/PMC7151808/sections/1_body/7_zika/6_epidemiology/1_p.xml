<p id="p0540">Zika virus, first isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947, was found in the same area in 1948 in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. The first human infection was identified in the 1950s. In subsequent decades it was identified sporadically in animals and in mild human infections in Africa and Asia. In 2007 Zika virus caused a large outbreak on Yap Island (western Pacific), initially thought to be caused by dengue virus; the virus was estimated to infect 70% of the population.

 </xref> Zika virus was first associated with recognized outbreaks in Brazil in 2015, but recent analyses using sequencing, molecular mapping, and modeling suggest Zika reached the Americas as early as 2013, with cryptic transmission before the disease was detected.

A 2016 outbreak in Singapore (455 cases confirmed) shows the potential for outbreaks in many tropical and sub-tropical regions where competent mosquito vectors are present and ecoclimatic conditions are favorable.
