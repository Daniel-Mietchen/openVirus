<p id="p0590">Definitive Zika diagnosis can be made by detection of viral RNA during acute infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid tests (NATs). RNA appears to be detectable longer in whole blood and urine samples compared with serum samples. These molecular tests can be performed on serum, whole blood, or urine up to 2 weeks after symptom onset; in pregnant women, NATs may be performed up to 12 weeks after symptom onset or exposure
