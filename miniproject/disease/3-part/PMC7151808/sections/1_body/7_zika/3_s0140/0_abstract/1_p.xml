<p id="p0450">Zika virus is a Flavivirus identified in 1947 transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. It remained obscure until Zika outbreaks erupted in Yap in 2007, French Polynesia in 2013 to 2014, Brazil since 2013, and the Americas thereafter. Outbreaks have occurred in Asia and Africa, and importations by travelers are well documented. Zika virus infection causes typically mild symptoms (or is asymptomatic), such as rash, fever, conjunctivitis, and myalgias, but has been associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome and other complications. Infection during pregnancy can lead to severe microcephaly and other birth defects. The symptoms of Zika resemble those of dengue and chikungunya virus infections, and Zika testing has limitations in terms of availability, sensitivity, and specificity. Sexual transmission is of concern, with potentially prolonged viral shedding in semen. Transfusion-related transmission has also occurred. Prevention of Zika virus infection rests on avoidance of vector mosquitoes and sexual contact with infected persons, especially important during pregnancy to reduce the occurrence of congenital infection.
