<p id="p0145">Before the measles vaccine existed, 9 out of every 10 children got the disease before age 15 and 2 million people died from it every year. Similarly, small pox killed 3 out of every 10 people and left survivors with unsightly scars. Sadly, as vaccinations have successfully eliminated such previously deadly or terribly debilitating diseases, people have become indifferent or even hostile to them. The number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children, and the surge in the opposition to vaccines, in general, what has been termed the anti-vaccination movement, particularly in developed countries, should be a major concern. Recent measles outbreaks in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France should be a shocking reminder that surging opposition to vaccines surely paves the way for the return of deadly diseases.</p>
