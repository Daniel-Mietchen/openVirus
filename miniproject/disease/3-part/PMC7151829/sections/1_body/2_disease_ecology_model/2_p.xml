<p id="p0025">The disease ecology framework has been criticized for its positivist philosophy; dearth of social theory; neglect of social divisions such as race, gender, disability, and sexuality; and trivializing the role of place and locality. For example, Kearns called on medical geographers to incorporate social theory, but Mayer and Meade and Paul chastised the supposed call for discarding disease ecology in favor of narrow health geography. Current work includes much broader frameworks such as vulnerability theory and political ecology.</p>
