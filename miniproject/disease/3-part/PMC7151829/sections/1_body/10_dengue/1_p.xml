<p id="p0105">Dengue is transmitted by the mosquitoes 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, which are found throughout the world. In many parts of the tropics and subtropics, dengue is endemic, that is, it occurs every year, usually during a season when 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito populations are high, often when rainfall is optimal for breeding. These areas are, however, additionally at periodic risk for epidemic dengue, when large numbers of people become infected during a short period. Dengue epidemics require a coincidence of large numbers of vector mosquitoes, large numbers of people with no immunity to one of the four virus types (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3, DENV 4), and the opportunity for contact between the two. Although 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> are common in the southern United States, dengue is endemic in northern Mexico, and the US population has no immunity, dengue transmission in the continental United States is low primarily because contact between people and the vector is too infrequent to sustain transmission.
