<p id="p0085">In 2016, a total of 5,168 noncongenital ZIKAV disease cases were reported in the United States, mostly in travelers returning from ZIKAVâ€“affected areas, but local mosquito-borne transmission increased. No local mosquito-borne transmission has been reported in the continental United States in 2018. Despite the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in multiple states, other environmental conditions (e.g., use of air conditioning and window screens and temperate climate) likely limit the transmission risk in US states.
