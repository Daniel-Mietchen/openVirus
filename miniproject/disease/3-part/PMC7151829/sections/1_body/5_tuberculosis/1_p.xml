<p id="p0050">Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne respiratory disease caused by 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. TB bacilli are propelled into the air when people who are sick with pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, talk, or during normal breathing. Inhaling even a small number of these airborne bacilli is enough to cause infection. Most exposed persons never become ill but develop latent TB. An important minority (5%â€“10%) progress from latent to active TB due, for example, to immunosuppression from coinfection with the HIV.
