<p id="p0115">Chikungunya virus is most often spread to people by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus. Chikungunya was first described during an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1952. The name “chikungunya” derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning “to become contorted,” and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with very debilitating joint pain that usually lasts for a few days or may be prolonged to weeks. Occasional cases of eye, neurological, and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints. Outbreaks have occurred across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the late 2013, chikungunya virus was found for the first time in the Americas on islands in the Caribbean. There is no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat chikungunya virus infection. The symptoms of chikungunya are similar to those of dengue and Zika.
