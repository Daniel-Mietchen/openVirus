<p id="p0040">At the end of 2016, about 36.7 million people were living with HIV globally, with 25.6 million cases in sub-Saharan Africa, a region with 11% of the world's population, and 91% of the world's children living with the disease. HIV prevalence rates vary widely between African countries, ranging from a low of less than 1% of the adult population in Senegal and Somalia to more than 15% in South Africa and Zambia. But the world's most affected region remains southern and eastern Africa where an estimated 19.4 million people were living with HIV in 2016, 59% of them being female. The region also had 43% of the global total of new HIV infections, but only 60% of the people living with HIV in the region were accessing antiretroviral therapy in 2016.</p>
