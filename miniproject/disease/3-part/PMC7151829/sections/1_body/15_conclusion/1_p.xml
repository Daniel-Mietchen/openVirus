<p id="p0150">Communicable diseases remain a major threat to humankind. Effective surveillance and response remain our best protection against these deadly threats. Unfortunately, surveillance remains poor and rudimentary in areas where outbreaks are most likely. Strengthening the health and surveillance systems of poor developing countries is critically important because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries. Sadly, as vaccinations have successfully eliminated previously deadly or terribly debilitating diseases, people have become indifferent or even hostile to vaccinations, making it more likely the deadly diseases return. Global cooperation is vital to prevent this threat to humankind.</p>
