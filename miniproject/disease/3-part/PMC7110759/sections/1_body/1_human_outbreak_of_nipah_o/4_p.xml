<p id="par0075">Separate from any naturally-occurring Nipah virus outbreaks, intentional release of Nipah virus has also been recognized as a potential risk. The initial October 2015 publication of the US “Bipartisan Report of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense” included a brief scenario of a hypothetical attack in Washington, DC, and in other locations in the USA and abroad that was due to a ‘genetically modified’ and aerosolized Nipah virus. The zoonotic or ‘One Health’ nature of human infections with Nipah virus was recognized in this scenario, with animal deaths occurring as well as human fatalities. Notably, of the 34 recommendations from this Blue Ribbon panel, recommendation number 7 was to “integrate animal health and One Health approaches into biodefense strategies” (

The hypothetical pathogen was a bioengineered transmissible hybrid virus with genes from Nipah virus and human parainfluenza virus. Intentional attacks began in Caracas, Venezuela and in Frankfurt, Germany and then spread to over 300 cities via international travel.
