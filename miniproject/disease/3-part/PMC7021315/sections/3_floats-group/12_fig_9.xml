  <title>Effect of depletion of cross-reactive antibodies from serum pools with Rio Bravo E on ADE of dengue virus infection.</title>
  <p>Fcγ receptor-positive K562 cells were infected with dengue virus in the presence of serially diluted (A) flavivirus-naïve pool, (B) YF pre-vaccinated pool, (C) TBE pre-vaccinated pool, and (D) YF and TBE pre-vaccinated pool. IgG-containing serum pools were further depleted with RB E protein as described in Methods. Colored symbols: mock depletion, empty symbols: RB depletion. Data are shown as mean values +/- SEM from three independent experiments. Dotted line indicates no enhancement of infection. Comparison of fold-enhancement of dengue virus infection in the presence of depleted and mock-depleted pools was performed by applying a general linear model as described in Methods. p-values are indicated in the graphs. DENV2, dengue virus serotype 2; mock dep, IgM and mock-depleted serum pool; RB dep, IgM and Rio Bravo virus E-depleted serum pool.</p>
