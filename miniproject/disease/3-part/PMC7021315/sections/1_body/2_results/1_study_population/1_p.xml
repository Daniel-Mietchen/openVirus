<p>To assess the effect of pre-existing flavivirus immunity on the patterns of antibody responses in primary Zika virus infections, we analyzed serum samples from laboratory-confirmed Zika patients (travelers returning from Zika-endemic regions) with and without prior TBE and/or YF vaccination (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Since these samples were not derived from a prospective study but were randomly received for diagnostic purposes from travelers returning with Zika virus infections, the groups were relatively heterogeneous with respect to age and comprised mostly adults. Flavivirus pre-immunity due to vaccination was confirmed by TBE and YF neutralization assays as described in Methods. The time points of vaccinations, however, have not been documented for the diagnostic samples used.
