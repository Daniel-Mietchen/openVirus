<p>To obtain information about the contribution of IgM antibodies to virus neutralization, we depleted IgG antibodies from the four serum pools using protein G columns (Methods). Control experiments demonstrated that IgG depletion was &gt;99.5% complete (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the contribution of IgM to virus neutralization was high in the naïve and single-vaccinated groups, accounting for approximately half of the total neutralizing activity with no significant difference between these groups (p = 0.759 and 0.616). In contrast, in the TBE and YF double-vaccinated group, this contribution was significantly lower than in the naïve group (26.8% vs. 51.3%; p = 0.022). The significance of these differences was calculated by applying a GLM and Wald’s test as described in Methods.
