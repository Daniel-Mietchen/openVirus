<p>To confirm these results, we carried out additional ADE experiments with single dilutions of the following preparations of the four pools: i. unmodified, ii. IgG depleted, iii. IgM depleted, iv. mixture of equal aliquots of IgG- and IgM-depleted pools (

The results show clearly that IgG are responsible for ADE, that IgM have neutralizing activity under the assay conditions, and that the addition of IgM to the IgM-depleted pools counteracted IgG-mediated ADE. Taken together, our data point to the ability of IgM in reducing possible infection-enhancing effects of IgG antibodies early after infection.
