<p>The serum pools described above did not provide information about possible differences in the time course of antibody production in our cohorts. We therefore also compared individual serum samples from na√Øve and pre-immune Zika patients (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), for which sufficient volumes were available, in Zika IgM and IgG ELISAs, RB IgG ELISA, as well as Zika and dengue NTs. For this comparison and based on the small number of Zika patients in the YF group, all samples from pre-vaccinated individuals were analyzed together. The samples span a time window of one to 93 days after disease onset, and the results are displayed in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g010">10</xref> and
