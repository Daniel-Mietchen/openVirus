<p>NTs were performed with Zika virus strain H/PF/2013 (European virus archive), dengue virus serotype 1 strain Hawaii (kindly provided by Herbert Schmitz, Bernhard-Nocht-Institute), dengue virus serotype 2 strain NGC (European Virus Archive) and TBE virus strain Neudoerfl in black 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One). The assays were carried out in principle as described previously for YF virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but fluorescence-labeled instead of alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibodies were used for detection. In each assay, a positive and negative polyclonal serum were included as controls. Briefly, serially diluted serum samples were incubated with a pre-determined dilution of virus for 1 h at 37°C. Then BHK-21 (TBE virus) or Vero cells (ECACC) (Zika virus, dengue virus) were added and incubated for 3 (Zika virus, TBE virus) or 4 (dengue virus) days. After removal of cell culture supernatants, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, and incubated with a Tris-buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 3% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min at 37°C. Mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing viral structural proteins (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were then added and the cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C. Bound antibodies were detected with a rabbit-anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Fluorescence was measured with Synergy HTX (excitation: 485/20 nm, emission: 528/20 nm, Biotek). Titers were determined after curve fitting with a four-parameter logistic regression using 50% of the fluorescence in the absence of antibody as a cut-off (NT
 <sub>50</sub>).
