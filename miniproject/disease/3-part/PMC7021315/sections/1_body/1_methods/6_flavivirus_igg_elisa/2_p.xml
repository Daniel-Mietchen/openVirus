<p>Validation of the ELISAs was performed as follows: Proper display of the antigens in this ELISA format was verified by the use of a number of E-specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). These included FL-specific antibodies (A1, 4G2 and B12 –[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], giving a positive reaction in all assays), E dimer-dependent (EDE)-antibodies (C8 and C10 –[
