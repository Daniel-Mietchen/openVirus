<p>Comparisons of the four pools (naïve, YF, TBE, and YF+TBE) were done by application of the GLM with data from naïve pools as reference. Maximum likelihood estimates of parameters reflecting the difference to naïve pools were tested for significance by Wald’s tests. Deviations of residuals from normality were assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s tests.</p>
