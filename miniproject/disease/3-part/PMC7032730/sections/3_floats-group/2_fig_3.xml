  <title>Parsimonious reconstructions with effective distances infer the simulated spread more accurately than reconstructions with geographic or equal distances.</title>
  <p>Boxplots of discrete Fréchet tree distances comparing simulated phylogeographies to reconstructed phylogeographies, using a total of 50 simulations. Fréchet tree distances are presented on a log
   <sub>2</sub> scale. In panel A, the reconstructions use airports as locations and were performed on the tree inferred on simulated sequences using geographic (cyan), effective (orange) and equal (light blue) distances, and on the simulated tree, again using geographic (pink), effective (green) and equal (yellow) distances. In panel B, the reconstructions use countries, the same way as described above. Additionally, reconstructions were inferred with BEAST with symmetric rates (dark blue), asymmetric rates (dark green) and a GLM (red).
