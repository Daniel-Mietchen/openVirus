<p>We evaluated this approach using simulated data and our recently described distance measure to compare phylogeographic spread among different tree topologies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We showed that effective distances calculated on air passenger flows yield more accurate reconstructions than geographic distances and Bayesian reconstructions with BEAST using the classical approach without any distance information [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We then used this method to study the early spread of the pH1N1 influenza A virus. Our method correctly inferred Mexico as an origin. Further, we proposed a list of airports that were mainly involved in the initial spread of the virus and seeded a large number of infections in new locations. In the case of future pandemics, this method allows to quickly analyze viral sequence data to identify the origin and major spread routes, which could help to implement surveillance and control measures to contain the spread of the disease.
