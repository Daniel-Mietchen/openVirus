<p>To evaluate the phylogeographic reconstruction, we first simulated geographic spread using GLEAMviz and then the sampling, trees and sequences using FAVITES. It should be noted that the list of transmissions generated by GLEAMviz didnâ€™t include transitions to locations that have been previously infected; an assumption which might be adequate for the very beginning of a pandemic but not in later stages. Further, the sampling process was simplified, with locations randomly chosen for sampling and only a small number of sequences per sampled location, while real influenza A virus sequences usually show a distinct geographic bias. Since the sequence diversity and tree resolution were similar to real pH1N1 sequence data and comparable locations were observed, we believe the simulation was appropriate for an evaluation of phylogeographic methods despite these simplifications. To our knowledge, no other reference dataset with known phylogeographic spread exists as an alternative. In the future, the simulation could be adjusted to study other scenarios and problems in phylogeography that are difficult to address, e.g. the effect of different sampling biases on phylogeographic reconstructions as well as different strategies to mitigate this bias, for example by using different subsampling schemes.</p>
