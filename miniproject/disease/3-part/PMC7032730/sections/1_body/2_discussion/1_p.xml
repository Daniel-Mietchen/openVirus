<p>Parsimonious ancestral character state reconstruction has been used for phylogeographic inference in the past [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Instead of using the Fitch algorithm for the reconstruction, therefore minimizing the number of state transitions, we here used the Sankoff algorithm to minimize distances between locations along the tree. This allowed us to introduce two innovations compared to the previous parsimony approach with the Fitch algorithm: the inference of unobserved locations for internal nodes, as well as the direct inclusion of air transportation data via effective distances, as is commonly done in Bayesian analyses [

While effective distances based on air travel are sensible for influenza A viruses, geographic distances are likely the best choice for pathogens with a local spread, including the historical spread of diseases or the spread of animal viruses like rabies. Effective distances can further be defined using local movements based on commuting data or gravity and radiation models [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which can be useful to study epidemics in single countries where air travel does not play a major role. As long as prior knowledge about the mode of transportation is known, itâ€™s simple to adjust the distance matrix used in the phylogeographic reconstruction with the Sankoff algorithm to a specific pathogen. Distance matrices could further offer the opportunity to easily incorporate epidemiological data about the timing of an outbreak by preferring or inhibiting certain transitions.
