<p>To test the parsimonious reconstruction with effective distances on a real dataset, we analyzed the 378 HA sequences sampled from the beginning of the pH1N1 outbreak until the end of April 2009. For the phylogeographic reconstruction, locations were assigned to each sequence based on the sampling locations, as stated in the isolate name. The resolution of these locations varied between cities, states and countries. We assigned the main airport (as defined via the highest number of passengers) of the respective city, state or country to the sequence. Three cities did not have an airport and instead we used the geographically closest airport available in our list of locations. In total, this resulted in a set of 67 unique locations. The phylogeographic reconstruction using the Sankoff algorithm was performed using effective distances and is displayed in
