<p>An example of a reconstructed spread is shown next to the simulated spread in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007101.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. In this reconstruction, the inferred origin was Zacatecas, a city north of Mexico City. From there, the virus spread to various locations including Mexico City and Cancún, which seeded a large number of infections in new locations. In the north of the USA, the virus further spread mainly via Chicago. In the simulated spread, locations like Mexico City and Chicago only play a minor role, but they could be unobserved intermediate locations due to connecting flights in the GLEAMviz simulation, where transitions are only reported via origin and destination. However, while the exact reconstructed paths differed from the simulated spread, most of the inferred internal locations in Mexico were geographically close. To quantify these geographic differences between spread paths, reconstructed phylogeographies were compared to the known spread on the simulated tree by calculating discrete Fréchet tree distances [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] using geographic distances between locations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007101.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This method compares the paths of locations from the root to each leaf node, calculates discrete Fréchet distances [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] between them and corrects the distance for each node by the number of paths.
