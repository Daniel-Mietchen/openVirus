<p>Using the same 50 simulations as before, we repeated the analysis using countries instead of airports as locations. With this resolution, a comparison to the Bayesian reconstruction using BEAST was possible. As before, discrete Fréchet tree distances were calculated to compare the reconstruction to the reference data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007101.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The parsimonious reconstruction using countries was comparable to the reconstruction using airports: using effective distances resulted in lower Fréchet tree distances than geographic ones (P-values of paired t-test: 1.5×10
 <sup>−9</sup> for inferred trees, 5.6×10
 <sup>−6</sup> for simulated trees). Notably, when compared to the other distance measures, using equal distances on the country level resulted in more accurate reconstructions than on the airport level. However, when using the inferred tree topology, using effective distances still resulted into significantly lower Fréchet tree distances (P-value of paired t-test: 0.0328). As observed previously, Fréchet tree distances were lower on reconstructions using the simulated tree topology as with the inferred one when using geographic distances, but not when using effective ones (P-values of paired t-test: 0.0231 for geographic distances, 0.3483 for effective ones). On the country level, however, a difference was also observed for equal distances (P-value: 0.0021) Phylogeographic reconstructions using BEAST with symmetric rates showed higher distances than the parsimonious reconstruction with effective distances, but were comparable to the reconstruction with geographic distances (P-values of paired t-test: 0.2668 for the comparison to geographic distances, 3.7×10
 <sup>−5</sup> for the comparison to effective distances). Using asymmetric rates for the Bayesian reconstruction resulted in similar, but slightly lower distances. We further used a GLM with both geographic and effective distances as potential predictors for the Bayesian reconstruction. Geographical distances were not included in any of the models (Bayes Factor (BF) support &lt; 1 for all 50 datasets), while effective distances were included with at least moderate support in 33 datasets (BF &gt; 3). The reconstruction using the GLM approach showed significantly smaller Fréchet tree distances than the two other Bayesian reconstructions (P-values: 8.1×10
 <sup>−5</sup> and 0.0015 compared to using symmetric and asymmetric rates, respectively) as well as the parsimonious reconstruction using geographic distances (P-value: 4.4×10
 <sup>−6</sup>). Compared to the reconstruction using effective and equal distances, no significant difference was observed (P-values: 0.1693 and 0.3345, respectively). Enforcing effective distances in the GLM by fixing the predictor in the model did not significantly alter the performance (P-value: 0.0827 for the comparison to the GLM that estimates the predictors,

We further studied the influence of the estimated tree topology on the Bayesian GLM approaches by fixing the simulated tree topology in the analysis. This had two effects on the GLM using both geographic and effective distances as potential predictors. First, when fixing the simulated tree, effective distances were included in all 50 datasets, showing decisive support (BF &gt; 100). As before, geographical distances were not included in any of the models (BF &lt; 1). Second, the analysis showed significantly lower Fréchet tree distances compared to the GLM approach when estimating the tree (P-value: 7.710
 <sup>−8</sup>) and the parsimonious approach using effective distances on the simulated tree topology (P-value: 7.0×10
 <sup>−5</sup>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007101.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Since the GLM on the simulated tree always included effective distances, fixing effective distances as predictors in the model gave nearly identical results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007101.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These analyses show that the Bayesian GLM approach is sensitive to errors in the estimated tree topology. Given the correct topology, this approach outperforms the parsimonious reconstruction; however, this advantage only holds in theory, as the correct topology is always unknown in practice.
