<p>Further, the phylogeographic reconstruction was performed using a generalized linear model (GLM) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We used both geographic and effective distances as possible predictors, calculated as described above. Distances were log-transformed and standardized before the analysis. Bayes Factors were calculated to evaluate the inclusion of the predictors into the model, using a prior probability of 50% that no predictors are included.
