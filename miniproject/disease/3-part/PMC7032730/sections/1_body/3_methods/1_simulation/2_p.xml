<p>The geographic spread simulation was performed with GLEAMviz version 6.6 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] using a stochastic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model. We considered three compartments for infectious people: symptomatic (with travel), symptomatic (without travel) and asymptomatic, in line with previous studies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this model, the world is divided into 3252 metapopulations interconnected via an airport and commuting network. We set the origin of the pandemic to Veracruz, Mexico, on February 18th 2009, which was reported as the source and time of the outbreak [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and has been used in similar models [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The simulation produced proportions of individuals in each SEIR compartment per day for each of the metapopulations, as well as the seeding location and day of first arrival of the disease for each newly infected population.
