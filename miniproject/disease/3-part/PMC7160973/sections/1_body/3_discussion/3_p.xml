<p id="Par23">Although it was reported from one study, the present review showed that no more than 0.4% PLWH willed to quit tobacco smoking but did not initiate any attempt. In accordance with the trans-theoretical model of health behaviour change used to describe the psychological mind-set of smokers [

Indeed, only 7.1% of PLWH tried to quit tobacco consumption but failed, corroborating other estimates driven from general smokers [
