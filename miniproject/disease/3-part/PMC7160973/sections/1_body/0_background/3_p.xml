<p id="Par10">Strikingly, reasons for this higher prevalence of smoking among PLWH have not been well elucidated. Some evidence indicates that tobacco use among PLWH may be associated with some factors including substance use disorders (heroin, cocaine, marijuana, crack, heavy alcohol drinking), socioeconomic factors (unemployment, lower educational level, lower income), mental disorders or lack of access to health services, housing, and transportation [

Accordingly, when a PLWH starts accepting his/her condition as serious and life-threatening, he/she may be motivated to take action in order to control the disease process by quitting unhealthy habits including smoking. Therefore, it is expected that positive smoking behaviour changes would occur in the course of HIV-infection. We designed and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize evidence on the changes in smoking patterns after HIV diagnosis or ART initiation.
