 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The prevalence of current smokers at study initiation (38.1, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 24.7–52.6) was in the range of the prevalence at the end of the study (35.6, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 6.6–72.5) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the same way, the prevalence of former smokers at study initiation (21.4, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 15.1–28.5) was in the range of the prevalence at the end of the study (17.6, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 5.1–35.5) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The prevalence of never smokers decreased from study initiation (28.6, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 20.3–37.8) to study completion (6.1, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 4.8–7.6), although only one study was included for study completion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There was a low prevalence of people starting smoking during the study: shifting from never to current smoking (2.1, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 0.9–3.6) and from former to current smoking (1.5, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 0.6–2.9) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The prevalence of shifting from current to former smoker was 10.5% (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 7.2–14.4) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The prevalence for staying in the never smoking category was 10.1% (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 3.0–20.5) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Substantial heterogeneity was found, however, there was no publication bias for all analyses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
