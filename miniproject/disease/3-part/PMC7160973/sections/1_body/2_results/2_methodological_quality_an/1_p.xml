<p id="Par19">Four studies had a low risk of bias, five studies had a moderate risk of bias, and no study had a high risk of bias. In total, 25 502 participants were included. All studies were prospective. Participants’ inclusion and follow-up ranged between 1984 and 2014. Studies were conducted in USA (

 <italic>n</italic> = 2), Uganda (

 <italic>n</italic> = 1). Seven studies were multisite and two were single site. Six studies were hospital-based, two were population-based, and one did not specify the site. History of smoking was assessed by self-reporting in eight studies and by measuring nicotine in blood in one study. As reported in three studies [

The proportion of people on ART varied from 36 to 100% in six studies. The mean age of participants varied from 35 to 53 years. The proportion of male participants varied from 31 to 100%. The mean/median CD4 cells count varied from 133 to 496 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> from five studies. The proportion of PLWH with detectable viral load at study initiation varied from 18 to 70% from three studies. The median duration of follow-up varied from 1.7 to 9.6 years from six studies. Counselling for tobacco smoking cessation was performed only in one study (Table
