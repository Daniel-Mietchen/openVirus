<p id="Par28">This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed no positive changes in smoking patterns among people living with HIV, globally. These results put in light the crucial need to settle the fight against tobacco consumption as a priority in HIV care delivery in order to prevent the excess morbidity and mortality secondary to tobacco-related diseases in PLWH. Accordingly, cost-effective and appropriate interventions should be identified, that should be tailored to individual needs. Tobacco cessation services should be integrated in HIV programs and smoke-free policies should be implemented in HIV-treatment facilities. Having a pivotal role to play, HIV healthcare providersâ€™ awareness and skills should be reinforced and upgraded to provide adequate cessation advice to patients and awareness of the harmful effects of smoking consumption and subsequent benefits of quitting particularly for PLWH should be increased. Beyond and considering the low number of studies included in this review, there is need to carry-out further well-designed researches to better investigate changes in smoking patterns in the course of HIV-infection.</p>
