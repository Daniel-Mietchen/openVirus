    <td align="center" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cases occurred in the community in an area immediately around smallpox hospitals, without known contact with smallpox cases or explanatory smallpox cases in the surrounding community. As supportive evidence, the density of smallpox cases around Fulham hospital fell away proportionally to distance. In 1881, smallpox hospitals were located in densely populated urban areas. That year, WH Power, the medical inspector, showed through a series of disease maps that there was an increasing incidence of smallpox in the city with increasing proximity to the hospital. This effect was observed for at least 1 mile. He investigated the movement of hospital staff and patients and concluded that contact with patients or hospital personnel could not explain the observation. Further, the disease map patterns were not concentrated near main traffic units to and from the hospital highlighting a possible difference in the mechanism of transmission. Power was the first person to attempt to quantify this and coined the term “aerial convection”. A report in 1886, “Statistics of Smallpox Relative to the Operations of Hospitals in the Metropolis” confirmed that the same phenomenon was observed with other smallpox hospitals in London and in the provinces.</td>

Some speculate there were clandestine visits by the crew to shore, but only one such instance was reported. Further supportive evidence is that the same phenomenon of epidemics in Purfleet following mooring of the hospital ships was observed in three consecutive epidemics.</td>

All of them had been in the same building: the index case and the baby on the ground floor and the 47-year-old male on the seventh floor. Three men, aged 43, 57, and 60, all patients at Bellevue Hospital when the index case was there, got infected. A 4-year-old boy who got discharged on the day the index case died, developed rash later. He was the source of 3 other cases—a nun, aged 62, a 5-year-old boy, and a 2-year-old girl. There is a probability of airborne transmission of smallpox from the index case to 9 secondary cases residing in the same hospital building but spatially separated, including on different floors.

There were no other smallpox cases in this area prior to the outbreak. Multiple possible means of transmission were postulated, including transfer by fomites, through laundry procedures and bed linen, contaminated blood collection equipment and aerial convection.

She contracted smallpox at the end of July 1971. Official reports claim she got off the ship at several stops, but in an interview she denied it. Official policy was that only male crew were allowed to disembark. During the voyage, she spent a large amount of time outdoors on the deck, collecting samples. Dr Pyotr Burgasov, chief sanitary physician, said in an interview in the Russian press in 2001 that weaponized smallpox was being tested on Vozrozhdeniye Island (a Soviet biological weapons testing site) at the time. It seems likely this was the source of infection, with virus travelling at least 15 km to infect the index case. Whether this was the result of deliberate dispersal of the virus through smallpox “bomb” being tested, or accidental dispersion from the lab, is unknown, although Dr Burgasov is quoted as saying “The smallpox formulation—400 g of which was exploded on the island—“got her” and she became infected.”</td>

    <td align="center" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Some of the smallpox laboratory work on the ground floor was carried out inside a safety cabinet, using unsafe procedures. The reports also suggest that “the opening and closing of the smallpox room door and the passage in and out by whoever was conducting work on the virus would have created the opportunity for any airborne virus to escape into the animal pox room”. The service ducts in the animal pox room and the smallpox room both had gaps which could allow the leakage of viruses. There also might have been a possibility of aerosol transmission from the ground floor to the first floor either through the air conditioning system or through an open window.</td>
