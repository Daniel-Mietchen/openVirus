<p>We estimated that the annual deaths in London were 13% of deaths in England and Wales between 1911 and 1919, according to the population in London (4.52 million) taking 13% of the population in England and Wales (36.07 million) in 1911 [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Using the case fatality rate of 30% [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we calculated the annual number of deaths in the UK from 1920 to 1958 based on the yearly reported cases [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The annual deaths in London were 17% of deaths in the UK between 1920 and 1958, according to the population in London (7.39 million) [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] taking 17% of the UK population (43.90 million) in 1921 [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The deaths in London between 1958 and 1980 were extracted from documented smallpox outbreaks in the UK [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These different data sources were used to create a timeline of smallpox deaths in London from 1700â€“1980. Then we plotted all identified observations of aerial convection over this timeline, to show the relationship of this observation period of aerial convection to the epidemiology of smallpox and the waning incidence of smallpox.
