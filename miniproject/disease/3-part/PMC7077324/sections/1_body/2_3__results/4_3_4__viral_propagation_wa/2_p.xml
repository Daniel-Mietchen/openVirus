<p>On the other hand, viral loads in AG129 mice were not significantly different between the M-30 and S-27 infections at 2 days pi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f005">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that viral propagations in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) tissues are reflected in the higher clinical severity of M-30-infected mice and that the type-II IFN response exerts more potential effect against the viral proliferation of the S-27 infection than the M-30 infection.
