<p>Low titer infections also caused 100% fatality in both the M-30- and S-27-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f002">Figure 2</xref>D) and their survival times were 3.2 ± 0.26 and 3.3 ± 0.30 days, respectively. The M-30-infected mice showed lower weight reductions than the S-27-infected AG129 mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f002">Figure 2</xref>E), and the weights of lethal mice were significantly different (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f002">Figure 2</xref>F), similarly to the high titer infections.
