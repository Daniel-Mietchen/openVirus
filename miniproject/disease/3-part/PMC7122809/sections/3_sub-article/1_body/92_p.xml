<p>The Universal health coverage (=CMU) (basic health insurance coverage implemented in 1999) no longer exists since 2016, it was merged with national Health Insurance (Assurance maladie) during the Universal Health Protection reform (Protection universelle maladie -Puma-). In addition, the CMU does not have a 3-month residency obligation in France, unlike the AME.</p>
