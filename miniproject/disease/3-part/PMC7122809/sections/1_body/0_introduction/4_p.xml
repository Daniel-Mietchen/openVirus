<p>The distribution of microcephaly in Brazil suggested a possible link between poverty and the risk of Zika virus -related microcephaly[

This epidemic spread to neighboring French Guiana in 2016, but until now there was no study of the impact of poverty on the prevalence of infection. In order to deal with the important proportion of asymptomatic Zika virus (ZIKV) infections [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] ZIKV serology was recommended at each trimester for all seronegative pregnant women. A first analysis of data collected during the 4 first months of the outbreak provided a representative picture of the spectrum of disease of ZIKV infection in pregnant women and mapped the intensity of the epidemic throughout French Guiana[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008193.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], however it did not look at specific subpopulations of pregnant women. However, the serological surveillance at each trimester during the ZIKV outbreak in 2016 allowed us to test whether the poorest pregnant women were more likely to acquire ZIKV than more socioeconomically privileged women. The objective of the study was thus to compare the prevalence of ZIKV contact in FG for pregnant women according to their health insurance status (HIS).
