<p>The variables used are a coarse proxy for environmental and behavioral aspects linked to poverty, which were not measured. However they have been robustly associated with a number of chronic and acute health problems in French Guiana. [

Although, the type of health insurance is based on legal or illegal residence, length of stay, and on having an income below a certain threshold, it is conceivable that health insurance as a proxy for social precariousness is not perfect and that some women in the regular health insurance group may have been precarious. The limited number of adjustment variables, notably the living area used for the analysis did not allow to precisely study confounding between individual and collective socio-economic determinants. Despite these limitations, the present results were not a quest for any significant p value but were a clearly defined
