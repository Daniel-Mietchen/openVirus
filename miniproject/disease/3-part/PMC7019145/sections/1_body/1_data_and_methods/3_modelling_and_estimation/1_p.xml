<p>Four different nonlinear growth models are adopted to pinpoint the epidemiological features of each epidemic. The models are the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz and Weibull growth models. These simple structured models are widely used to study S-shaped cumulative growth processes; e.g. the curve of a single-wave epidemic and have been extensively studied in previous work [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These models consider cumulative cases with saturation in the growth rate to reflect the progression of an epidemic due to reduction in susceptible pools or a decrease in the exposure to infectious rodent populations. The extrinsic growth rate increases to a maximum (i.e. saturation) before steadily declining to zero. The modelling and fitting via the growth models of the epidemic curve are illustrated in
