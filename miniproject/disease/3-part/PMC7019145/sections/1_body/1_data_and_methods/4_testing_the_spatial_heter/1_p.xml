<p>After finding the model-averaged estimates, we apply Cochran's 
 <italic>Q</italic> test to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the epidemics in different regions over the same period of time [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For instance, we treat the model-averaged 
 <italic>R</italic> estimates as the univariate meta-analytical response against different Nigerian regions (states) and further check the heterogeneity by estimating the significance levels of the 
 <italic>Q</italic> statistics. A 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05 is regarded as statistically significant.
