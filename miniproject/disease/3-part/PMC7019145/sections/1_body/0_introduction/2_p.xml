<p>LF epidemics typically start in November and last until May of the following year, with the majority of cases occurring in the first quarter of the following year, in addition to sporadic cases reported throughout the year. The 2017â€“18 epidemic in Nigeria was an unprecedented LF epidemic in the country's history [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which resulted in 400 confirmed cases, including 97 deaths, between January and March 2018 [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The most recent epidemic in Nigeria has already caused 526 confirmed cases from January to March of 2019, which included 121 deaths [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The five states of Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Bauchi and Plateau are the only states that have been among the top 10 hit hardest states in terms of number of LF cases in both the 2018 (85.5% of total national cases) and 2019 (85.7% of total national cases) epidemics. While there have been discussions about the association of rainfall level and LF incidence rate [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], this association has not yet been demonstrated and quantified. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions between January 2016 and March 2019. We estimate LF infectivity in terms of the reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>) and quantify the association between 
 <italic>R</italic> and state rainfall. We explore the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics and summarise the overall findings with model-average estimates.
