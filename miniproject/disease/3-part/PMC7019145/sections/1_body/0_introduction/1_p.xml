<p>Lassa fever (LF), caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is increasingly recognised as an important rodent-borne viral haemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to some of the communities in sub-Saharan West Africa [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Discovered in 1969 [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], LF is endemic to much of rural Nigeria and regions in the Mano River Union [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. LASV transmits from human to human, as well as via the zoonotic cycle [

 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The common reservoir of LASV is 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic>, one of the most widespread rodent species in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which exhibits sensitive population dynamics to the water level, e.g. rainfall, flooded agricultural activities [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous studies have recognised the ecological association between the population levels of rodents and rainfall [
