<p>The rainfall time series of the five states and the weekly reported LF cases of the whole of Nigeria are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">(b)</xref>. We observe that the major LF epidemics usually occur in Nigeria between November and May of the following year. The cumulative lagged effects were observed via matching the peak timing of the rainfall and epidemic curves. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1(c)</xref>, we shift the rainfall time series of the five states by + 6 months to match the trends of the national LF epidemic curve in Nigeria. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1(d)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">(e)</xref>, we find that the fit has a 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.0001, which indicates a statistically significant association between the LF cases and shifted rainfall curve.
