<p>In this work, we choose to use the average reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>) rather than 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, as the measurement of the LASV transmissibility. The estimated 
 <italic>R</italic> summarises the LASV transmissibility over the whole period of an epidemic. The reasons why we prefer 
 <italic>R</italic> rather than 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> are as follows. First, the temporal changes of the susceptible population or decrease in the exposure to infectious sources are removed from the 
 <italic>R</italic> estimates due to the nature of the growth models. Second, the changes of the susceptible population and/or disease awareness or control measures and the effect of the rainfall cannot be disentangled in the time-varying reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, the average reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>) adopted is a better proxy to explore the association between LF infectivity and rainfall. With respect to point (iii) and other heterogeneities of epidemics in different regions, we account for this issue by including the ‘region' dummy variables in the LMER model in Eqn (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">3</xref>). These dummy variables serve as random effects to offset the regional heterogeneities of LF epidemics. Therefore, we can then quantify a general effect, i.e. the 
 <italic>β</italic> in Eqn (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">3</xref>), of the lagged rainfall on the LASV 
 <italic>R</italic> estimate among different Nigerian places.
