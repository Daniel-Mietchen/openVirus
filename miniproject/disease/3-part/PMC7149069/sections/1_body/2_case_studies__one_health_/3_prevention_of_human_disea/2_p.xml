<p id="Par29">Yellow fever (YF) is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] that is perpetuated in a transmission cycle involving mosquitos and non-human primate hosts. Because New World primate hosts are especially susceptible to YFV infection, acute clusters of mortality in these populations can signal YFV activity and alert authorities to increased risk of human infection, thereby serving as an early warning system.
