<p>The recombinant baculovirus rBac-N-G, upon being identified as correct, was used to infect suspended Sf9 insect cells, which were cultured in suspension at 120 rpm and 27°C for ~96 h. The cells were then collected and centrifuged at 7,000 rpm and 4°C for 30 min to remove cell debris. The collected culture supernatant was concentrated via ultracentrifugation at 4°C and 35,000 rpm for 2 h; the pellet was resuspended in PBS and dissolved overnight at 4°C. Sucrose solutions of 60, 40, and 20% were prepared in advance and filtered individually with 0.22-μm filters. Subsequently, the 60, 40, and 20% sucrose solutions were, in turn, gently added to a special ultracentrifuge tube. In doing so, a 20–40–60% sucrose gradient was formed from top to bottom in the tube. The PBS resuspended liquid was slowly added to the upper surface of the sucrose gradient (20–40–60% (w/v), which was then centrifuged at 30,000 rpm at 4°C for 120 min. Next, the white matter between the 40 and 60% sucrose liquid levels was collected and added to an ultracentrifuge tube with PBS. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 1.5 h, after which the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS and dissolved overnight at 4°C. The solution concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, China), and other methods were used for verification. The final concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml, and the solution was aliquoted and stored at −80°C for further use.</p>
