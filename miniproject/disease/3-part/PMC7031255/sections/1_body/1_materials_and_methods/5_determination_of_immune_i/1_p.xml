<p>To measure IgG-specific antibodies, the mice were euthanized at 4 weeks after the primary immunization, and blood was collected. The blood samples were kept at room temperature for 2 h and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain serum. An indirect ELISA method was used to determine the RVFV antibody titers in the mouse sera after the second immunization. The Gn protein was used for coating at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, with incubation overnight at 4°C; the plates were then blocked with 1% BSA for 120 min. The serum samples were used as the primary antibody, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 120 min after their addition. Goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody, with incubation at 37°C for 60 min, after which the tetra methyl benzidine (TMB) substrate was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The stop solution was added, and the OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> value of each sample was determined using a microplate reader (
