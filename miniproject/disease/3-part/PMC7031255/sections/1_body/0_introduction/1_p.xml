<p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) that is prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, African continent and several islands in the southeast Indian Ocean (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In these areas, RVF has repeatedly erupted among animals and humans (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Domestic ruminants, especially sheep, are most susceptible to RVFV, and infection in pregnant sheep results in abortion in almost 100% of cases and in nearly 100% mortality in newborn lambs. Although cattle, goats, and wild ruminants are slightly less sensitive to this virus, these animals are also at considerable risk (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Though, RVFV is a single-stranded RNA virus (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), it is very stable. Reports, showed that the genetic diversity of RVFV is quite limited, with maximum pairwise differences for the S segment and partial M segments of 4 and 5.4% for the nucleotide sequence and 1 and 2.8% for the amino acid sequence (
