<p>In a previous study, our research group successfully developed a method for the preparation of RVFV VLPs based on an insect baculovirus system (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this study, large quantities of high quality RVFV VLPs were obtained using large-scale preparation, concentration, and purification methods, and the prepared VLPs were used to perform mouse immunization studies. The immunogenicity of the RVFV VLPs was examined to determine whether they have the potential to be used to develop a novel RVF vaccine, thereby laying the foundation for the development of a VLP-based RVF vaccine.
