<p>The RVFV VLPs immunizations were conducted according to the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. At day 14 after the second immunization, the serum IgG titers were determined. The results, showed that the IgG antibodies against the RVFV VLPs were not produced in either the first group (the PBS group) or the second group (the Freund's adjuvant group) of mice. The highest titer, 1:2
 <sup>7</sup>, was produced in the fourth group (the VLPs + Freund's adjuvant group) of mice. The third group (the VLP group) mice also produced a high serum titer, 1:2
 <sup>6</sup>, in the absence of any adjuvant. The results were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>. The results showed that RVFV VLPs could induce mice to produce a strong humoral immune response in mouse model.
