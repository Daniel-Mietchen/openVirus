<p>The sera prepared from the blood samples taken from the mice on day 14 after the second immunization were doubly diluted, and neutralizing activity was determined using an HIV-based lentiviral-packaged RVFV pseudovirus (with an EGFP marker) (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) prepared by and stored in our laboratory. The experimental results, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; no neutralizing activity was detected in sera from mice in the first group (the PBS group) or second group (the Freund's adjuvant group). Sera from mice in the fourth group (the VLPs + Freund's adjuvant group) demonstrated 70% neutralization activity at a dilution of 1:2
 <sup>7</sup> and 100% neutralization activity at a dilution of 1:2
 <sup>6</sup>. In sera from mice in the third group (the VLP group, which did not include an adjuvant), 100% neutralization activity at a dilution of 1:2
 <sup>5</sup> and 60% neutralization activity at a dilution of 1:2
 <sup>6</sup> were observed. These results showed that VLP-based experimental vaccines have high immunogenicity in mouse models and can induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies even in the absence of adjuvants.
