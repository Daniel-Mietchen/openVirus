Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines, which have the advantages of strong immunogenicity and safety, play an important role in the prevention of this disease. VLPs for RVFV were successfully prepared by our research group using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system. To study the immunogenicity of these RVFV VLPs, a correct 3rd or 4th generation recombinant baculovirus, rBac-N-G, was identified and used to infect Sf9 cells, which were cultured in suspension at a large scale. Subsequently, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the VLPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and purified using a sucrose gradient, after which they were used to immunize BALB/c mice by intramuscular injection. The results showed that the RVFV VLPs prepared by our research group could effectively induce mice to produce RVFV neutralizing antibodies and that the prepared VLPs could stimulate mouse spleen cells to produce high levels of the cytokines IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3;. Moreover, the proportion of lymphocytes producing IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; in the spleen of mice immunized with RVFV VLPs was significantly increased. Therefore, the RVFV VLPs prepared in this study had strong immunogenicity and could effectively activate humoral and cellular immunity in mice. This study lays a solid foundation for the development of RVFV VLP vaccine candidates and promotes the healthy development of animal husbandry and human public health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rift valley fever</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>virus-like particle</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="4822"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) that is prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, African continent and several islands in the southeast Indian Ocean (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In these areas, RVF has repeatedly erupted among animals and humans (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Domestic ruminants, especially sheep, are most susceptible to RVFV, and infection in pregnant sheep results in abortion in almost 100% of cases and in nearly 100% mortality in newborn lambs. Although cattle, goats, and wild ruminants are slightly less sensitive to this virus, these animals are also at considerable risk (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). RVFV has been isolated from more than 30 species of mosquitoes, several of which are distributed globally. These features explain why RVFV is one of the most serious arboviruses that threatens human and animal health (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). RVF disease is classified as a Class A disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and has been included in the list of diseases that require statutory reporting (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Though, RVFV is a single-stranded RNA virus (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), it is very stable. Reports, showed that the genetic diversity of RVFV is quite limited, with maximum pairwise differences for the S segment and partial M segments of 4 and 5.4% for the nucleotide sequence and 1 and 2.8% for the amino acid sequence (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) list RVFV as a Class A pathogen (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). China lists RVF as one of the 13 exotic animal diseases that require focused prevention in <italic>The National Medium- and Long-term Plan for Animal Disease Control (2012&#x02013;2020)</italic>. Due to its significant biological impact, this disease must be prevented and controlled.</p><p>Laboratory studies have shown that vaccination is the main means of preventing and controlling RVF (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). No specific anti-RVFV drugs are available on the market, nor are there any commercial RVF vaccines. In recent years, virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines, which have the advantages of strong immunogenicity and safety, have shown great potential for novel vaccine development.</p><p>VLPs display epitopes in a form close to that of natural viruses, thus rendering them not only highly immunogenic but also easily acquirable by specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs), i.e., dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). VLPs can bind to Ig receptors on B lymphocytes, which activates them and leads to the recruitment of DCs via increased co-stimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Upon being processed, VLPs are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, thereby stimulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; VLPs are recognized and presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by MHC class I molecules via cross-presentation.</p><p>In a previous study, our research group successfully developed a method for the preparation of RVFV VLPs based on an insect baculovirus system (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this study, large quantities of high quality RVFV VLPs were obtained using large-scale preparation, concentration, and purification methods, and the prepared VLPs were used to perform mouse immunization studies. The immunogenicity of the RVFV VLPs was examined to determine whether they have the potential to be used to develop a novel RVF vaccine, thereby laying the foundation for the development of a VLP-based RVF vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Viruses and Cells</title><p>The recombinant baculovirus rBac-N-G, which contains the RVFV Gn, Gc and N proteins, was constructed in a previous study (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

The cells were then collected and centrifuged at 7,000 rpm and 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min to remove cell debris. The collected culture supernatant was concentrated via ultracentrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C and 35,000 rpm for 2 h; the pellet was resuspended in PBS and dissolved overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Sucrose solutions of 60, 40, and 20% were prepared in advance and filtered individually with 0.22-&#x003bc;m filters. Subsequently, the 60, 40, and 20% sucrose solutions were, in turn, gently added to a special ultracentrifuge tube. In doing so, a 20&#x02013;40&#x02013;60% sucrose gradient was formed from top to bottom in the tube. The PBS resuspended liquid was slowly added to the upper surface of the sucrose gradient (20&#x02013;40&#x02013;60% (w/v), which was then centrifuged at 30,000 rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 120 min. Next, the white matter between the 40 and 60% sucrose liquid levels was collected and added to an ultracentrifuge tube with PBS. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 1.5 h, after which the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS and dissolved overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The solution concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, China), and other methods were used for verification. The final concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml, and the solution was aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for further use.</p></sec><sec><title>VLP Immunization of Mice</title><p>A wide host range can be experimentally infected with RVFV, but as mice can be infected by various means, they are a good animal model for studying the pathogenesis of RVFV infection in large mammals. In this experiment, mice were immunized with the purified RVFV VLPs. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups of 10, with the first group being the PBS group, the second group being the Freund's adjuvant group, the third group being the VLP group and the fourth group being the VLP + Freund's adjuvant group. Freund's complete adjuvant and Freund's incomplete adjuvant were used for the first and second immunization, respectively, with an immunization dose of 100 &#x003bc;l/mouse via hind limb intramuscular injection. Group one was intramuscularly injected with PBS, group two with Freund's adjuvant (PBS and Freund were mixed at an equal volume ratio of 1:1), group three with VLPs (15 &#x003bc;g VLPs/mouse) and group four with VLPs + Freund's adjuvant (15 &#x003bc;g VLPs/mouse). Blood was collected from the mice at 2 weeks after the second immunization, and immunity-related indexes were determined.

The secretion of IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; by T lymphocytes (CD8<sup>+</sup>) from mice in the first group (the PBS group) and second group (the Freund's adjuvant group) was extremely low.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>RVF can be transmitted by mosquito bites and by contact with contaminated materials, and it has a mortality rate of approximately 1%. However, in recent epidemics, the mortality rate has increased significantly (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). At present, no specific anti-RVFV drugs are available on the market, nor are there any commercial RVFV vaccines for human use. Currently, the primary means of preventing RVFV is vaccination. There are three main vaccine types: recombinant live vector vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and live attenuated vaccines. These vaccines each have their own shortcomings, limiting their application and effectiveness during RVFV outbreaks.</p><p>VLPs have a polyprotein structure that mimics that of their natural virus in morphology and structure and is free of viral genetic material, thus making them safe and expensive candidate vaccines. At present, VLP-based commercially available preventive vaccines have been developed worldwide (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), including Glaxo Smith Kline's Engerix (for hepatitis B virus) and Cervarix (for human papillomavirus) as well as Merck's Recombivax HB (for hepatitis B virus) and Gardasil (for human papillomavirus) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In 2011, the Hecoin vaccine for hepatitis E virus (HEV) that was developed by Innovax Biotech of Xiamen, China, was approved for use in China. In the veterinary field, a vaccine for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) developed using VLPs has been approved for marketing (Intervet International Ltd., the Netherlands) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). VLPs can effectively activate APCs and B lymphocytes by virtue of their size, potential and other properties (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, VLPs can be processed and presented through two pathways, the MHC-II and MHC-I molecular pathways, to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which allows DCs to efficiently induce cellular T lymphocyte responses in the absence of viral replication (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, some VLPs can activate responses in both helper T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. VLPs can also directly induce DC maturation, thereby positively regulating co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines to activate T lymphocytes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>In this study, a previously constructed recombinant baculovirus (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), rBac-N-G, which contains the RVFV Gn, Gc, and N proteins, was used to infect Sf9 insect cells to express RVFV VLPs. Although the virion cannot replicate, it can be adsorbed to cell receptors, in a manner similar to that of cells infected with RVFV. VLPs have certain advantages compared with soluble proteins, including adequate antigen stability and immunogenicity. VLPs are first adsorbed to cellular receptors, after which the virion envelope proteins are digested by lysosomes and the antigen is presented by MHC (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The rBac-N-G recombinant baculovirus was used to infect the Sf9 insect cells, which were cultured at large scale. The RVFV VLPs were concentrated and purified and then used to immunize mice. The experimental results showed that the RVFV VLPs induced mice to produce high-specificity immunoglobulins and neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>RVFV VLPs have been generated by several other researchers (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and the animal model experiments confirmed its effectiveness in the induction of virus neutralizing antibody (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, the cellular immune response induced by the RVFV VLPs has not been studied. In this study, a cellular immune response was triggered by the RVFV VLPs in the RVFV VLPs immunized mice. Result showed that the VLPs significantly increased/stimulated the secretion of high levels of the cytokines IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3;; they also significantly increased the proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes secreting IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; in the mouse spleen cells. IFN-&#x003b3; is a Th1-type cytokine, and IL-4 a Th2-type cytokine, indicating that the VLPs alone can induce a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response in mice. Hence, the prepared RVFV VLPs could induce a strong immune response in small animals. This study showed that VLP-based experimental vaccines (strains) have good immunogenicity in mouse models and can induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies even in the absence of adjuvants.</p><p>However, many tasks must be completed to prepare a vaccine with RVFV VLPs using the Bac-to-Bac system. The immunogenicity of the VLPs would be further improved and the production costs would be reduced, thereby laying the foundation for the development of vaccines using RVFV VLPs. In addition, there are some limitations in this study. For example, the virus challenge experiment after vaccine immunization is lacking due to the limited experiment conditions. Further studies are needed for evaluating the vaccine efficiency using animal models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All the animal studies were conducted according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (No. 55 issued by the Ministry of Health, People's Republic of China, on January 25, 1998), and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
