<p id="p0170">The main objective of surveillance is to detect infection cases of arboviruses in an opportune manner. Early detection will allow an adequate response and characterization of the outbreak, as well as the identification of circulating viral strains. Multiple surveillance models can be considered to detect the introduction of arboviruses in an area; you can also track the disease once it is introduced or follow up on the disease when it is already established. A study conducted on domestic herbivorous animals in the Brazilian Amazon demonstrated susceptibility to alphaviruses using antibodies to inhibit hemagglutinins. Prevalences by animal species indicated that there were significant differences between horses and water buffaloes and between cattle and sheep. Horses showed high prevalence of antibodies in cross-reactions between four alphavirus antibodies used. These results show that domestic species could serve as sentinels to detect arbovirus circulation in the Brazilian Amazon (
