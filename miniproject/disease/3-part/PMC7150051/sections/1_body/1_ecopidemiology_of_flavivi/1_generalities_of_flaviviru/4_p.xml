<p id="p0140">In a 
 <italic>C. perspicillata</italic> captured in Ayapel and a 
 <italic>Phyllostomus discolor</italic> captured in San Carlos, municipalities of the department of Córdoba (Colombia), amplicons of a size of 143 bp of the NS5 gene were determined in brain, lung, and liver samples that when sequenced corresponded to serotype 2 of the DENV. The consensus sequence of these amplicons was 100 bp and presented high homologies of DENV-2 sequences registered in GenBank. The amplicons were registered in GenBank with MGO11655.1 sequences obtained from 
 <italic>C. perspicillata</italic> (CIIBT-106-2) and with MGO11656.1 sequences from 
 <italic>P. discolor</italic> (CIIBT-193-2). It is becoming known and proposing that bats may be involved with viruses that affect human health.
