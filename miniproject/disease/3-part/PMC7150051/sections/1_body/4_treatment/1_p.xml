<p id="p0175">There is no specific antiviral drug treatment for most arboviruses. Symptomatic treatment is recommended after ruling out other diseases. Control of the spread of arthropod-transmitted viruses in the Americas has not been very successful. Dengue continues to cause chaos in many areas of the Americas, extending from the United States to Argentina. During the first years of the 21st century, several outbreaks of dengue occurred in several regions of Asia, Africa, and Americas recently with an unprecedented magnitude, especially in Central America and the Caribbean. For some arboviruses causing large outbreaks such as DENV and CHIKV, there is no specific treatment or commercially available vaccine to prevent infection. Until a vaccine is developed, the only effective means of prevention is to protect individuals against mosquito bites. It should be noted, however, that the only method available to prevent transmission is vector control, although experience indicates that this has rarely been achieved. The resulting large outbreaks could collapse existing health-care systems and public health infrastructure in countries of Central South America and the Caribbean and potentially hinder some aspects of social organization.</p>
