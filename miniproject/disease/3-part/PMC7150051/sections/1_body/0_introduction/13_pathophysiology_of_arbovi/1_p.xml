<p id="p0120">The arboviruses are transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes, which become infected when feeding from reservoirs that contain high levels of viremia. In this process of infection, a dissemination is also generated that affects the salivary glands of the mosquito, which allows the passage to new reservoirs of the virus during the feeding of the vector, the saliva of the mosquito is initially deposited in the extravascular space of the affected vertebrate. Then after getting mediated by the interaction of the envelope protein and receptors on the surface of the host cell, they enter the cell by endocytosis and the low pH releases from the components of the virus, and they are taken to the cytoplasm through pores; the nucleocapsid is disassembled in the cytoplasm, giving rise to the replication of the virus (
