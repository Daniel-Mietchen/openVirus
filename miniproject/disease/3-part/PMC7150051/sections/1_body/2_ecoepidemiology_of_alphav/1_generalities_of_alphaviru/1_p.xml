<p id="p0145">They are enveloped RNA viruses, not segmented of single chain and positive sense, of the alphavirus family Togaviridade genus. They are transmitted mainly by arthropods (arboviruses) and also by a wide variety of small mammals and birds. Viruses belonging to this genus are classified as new or old world, depending on the geographical location from which they were originally isolated (

New world alphaviruses include EEEV, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and WEEV, which cause encephalitis in humans and other mammals, while old world alphaviruses, such as CHIKV, o'nyong-nyong virus (VONN), Ross River virus (VRR), Semliki Forest virus, and Sindbis virus (SINV), cause fever, rash, and arthralgia; this syndrome rarely causes mortality (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ferro et al., 2015</xref>). Many of these viruses circulate permanently in an enzootic cycle that involves wild animals that live in nearby environments where anthropic activities take place. Tropical alphaviruses have special tropism for osteoarticular tissue, patients develop chronic rheumatologic conditions similar to rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. The example is the CHIKV, although other viruses less known in our environment, such as Sindbis, VRR, MAYV, VONN, and Barmah Forest, have a potential to spread through vectors and cause chronic rheumatological disorders. With the exception of the Eilat alphavirus whose range of hosts is restricted to insects only (
