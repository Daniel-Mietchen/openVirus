<p>Detection of dengue or other flaviviral infections requires the use of specific laboratory testing, as the symptoms are often unspecific. Except for malaria, diagnostic tests are usually not available at the point of care, especially in rural areas of Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The aim of this study was to determine the role of DENV infection (and potentially other flaviviruses) in acute febrile patients in a non-outbreak situation, in urban and rural areas of Kenya. We investigated the role of DENV infection as a cause of acute febrile disease in non-epidemic settings in rural and urban study areas in Kenya with molecular methods. In addition, we aimed to obtain information on the rate of past exposure to flaviviruses in these cohorts with serological methods.
