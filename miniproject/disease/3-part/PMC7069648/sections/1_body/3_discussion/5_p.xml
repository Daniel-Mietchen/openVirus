<p>DENV-2 RNA was detected in five patients sampled in Taita–Taveta. The patients’ travel history implied that most of these infections could have originated in Mombasa (3/5) or Nairobi (1/5). One of the DENV-2 RNA positive patients was sampled in Mwatate and had not travelled in the preceding month. This would be compatible with local transmission of DENV-2 in the region. Interestingly,
