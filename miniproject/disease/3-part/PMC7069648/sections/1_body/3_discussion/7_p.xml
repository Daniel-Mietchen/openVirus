<p>To conclude, we detected unnoticed DENV-2 transmission outside epidemics and previously known endemic regions in rural Kenya. Dengue was not a common cause of acute febrile disease in the study area of rural Taita-Taveta. However, as asymptomatic people were not included in this study, the true level of infections remains to be determined. The subclinical infections enable the silent transmission and may constitute the majority of the infections in an non-outbreak situation [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The unrecognition of dengue due to lack of diagnostic testing is likely to lead to underestimates of its impact to the public health. Further studies would be needed for assessing the disease burden and for understanding the dynamics, maintenance and spread of dengue from the endemic coastal Kenya area to new areas. The monitoring of the population exposure would be needed in areas where the vector
