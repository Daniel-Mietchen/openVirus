<p>The sequence analysis was restricted due to the limited amount of DENV sequence data obtained in this study, and available in public databases from previous studies in Kenya and the neighbouring countries. In this study, a single DENV serotype (DENV-2) and genotype (Cosmopolitan) was detected. Our sequence data from Taitaâ€“Taveta, located inland approximately 150 kilometres from the coast, is from the year 2016 and thus timed between the two large dengue outbreaks of the coastal cities of Mombasa in 2013 and Malindi in 2017. The findings are in line with previous work, which used complete genomic data and concluded that the 2017 Malindi outbreak strains were clonally derived and closely related to strains from India [

The currently available data suggest, that after the 2013 Mombasa outbreak the virus spread towards the northeast along the coast. The virus was detected from febrile patients in Kilifi in 2014 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008099.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In our analysis, the sister group to all the Kenyan cosmopolitan DENV-2 strains included Indian strains and interestingly also a strain originating from Djibouti or Ethiopia in 2016 from a traveller patient. This suggests that dispersal of DENV-2 between Africa and India has occurred more than once. Globalization has probably facilitated the introduction of the Indian DENV to Kenya, as Kenya along with other African countries interacts actively with India for trade and travel [
