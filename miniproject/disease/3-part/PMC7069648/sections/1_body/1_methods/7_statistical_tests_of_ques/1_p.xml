<p>Statistical analyses combining diagnostic test results and questionnaire data were performed for 499 patients out of the total 560 patients (61 patients were excluded because positive IgM IFA could not be confirmed by IgM EIA or due to incomplete questionnaire data). We used SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) in the analyses, which included Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression analyses with the level of significance set at 95% (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to find the most significant risk factors and to control the effects of confounding variables. Based on diagnostic assay results, patients were divided into groups of ‘DENV marker positive’ (positive in any test) and ‘DENV marker negative’ (negative in all tests).
