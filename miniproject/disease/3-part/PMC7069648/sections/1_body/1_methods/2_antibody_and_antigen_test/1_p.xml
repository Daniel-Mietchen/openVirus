<p>Initial IgG and IgM antibody screening was done using an in-house immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with DENV-3 (H87) antigen [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The samples were diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline for testing in IFA. Samples that were found to be positive for IgG at 1:20 dilution were further titrated until the last positive dilution was reached. The IgG-positive samples were treated with GullSORB IgG inactivation reagent (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, USA) prior to IgM IFA testing. Known DENV IgG and IgM positive samples were used as positive controls in the IFA tests. For the samples reactive by IgM IFA, a commercial dengue IgM enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Capture DXSelect, Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, USA). Samples that were found to be positive in DENV IgM EIA, IgG IFA or viral RNA screening were additionally tested for dengue NS1 antigen using Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag test (BIORAD). If there was enough sample volume left, DENV IgG IFA positive samples were further tested for anti-Zika (ZIKV) virus IgG using a commercial ELISA test (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany), and samples positive for DENV IgM IFA were tested for anti-ZIKV IgM using an ELISA test (Zika IgA/M, Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (
