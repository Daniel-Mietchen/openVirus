<p id="Par23">Mosquito bodies, leg and wing and saliva samples were homogenized with metal pellets in 2 ml of Vero media on a vortex mixer and then clarified by centrifugation at 1500Ã— 
 <italic>g</italic> for two min. Supernatants were tested for infection using Vero cell plaque assay following the methods of Barker et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. If virus was recovered from the body but not the legs and wings, the mosquito was classified as having a non-disseminated infection; if virus was detected in the wings and legs, the mosquito was classified as having a disseminated infection; mosquitoes with virus in saliva were classified as transmitting. Infection rate was determined as the percentage of the orally infected mosquitoes positive for virus in the body. Dissemination rate was determined as the percentage of orally infected mosquitoes that were positive for virus in the legs and wings, regardless of infection status. Transmission rate was determined as the percentage of orally infected mosquitoes that had virus in the salivary expectorant, regardless of infection status. Infectious blood meals were thawed at room temperature, diluted with a series of 10-fold serial dilutions and tested for virus concentration using plaque assay.
