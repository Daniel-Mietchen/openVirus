<p id="Par21">For oral infection, 1-week-old female mosquitoes were starved 24 h before blood-feeding and provided cotton balls soaked with deionized water. Approximately 40–50 female mosquitoes were placed into 1-gallon cages covered with a mesh screen top. The mosquitoes were offered infected blood meals contained in a glass water-jacketed membrane feeder attached to a circulating 37 °C water bath. Pig intestine sausage casing was used as the membrane. After a 2-h feeding period, fully engorged females were anesthetized on ice and transferred to a new 1-liter cage. A 0.5 ml sample of the infected blood was removed after the feeding period and stored at − 80 °C for later virus titer. Parenteral infection was done by intrathoracic inoculation of week-old females that had never taken a blood meal with 0.2 µl of virus [
