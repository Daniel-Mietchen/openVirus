<p id="Par35">Our studies show that a species that has not been tested for ZIKV vector competency, 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>, was able to transmit the virus, but at a low rate. 
 <italic>Aedes japonicus</italic>, however, was competent for CVV transmission. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, the most widespread anthropophilic mosquito in Virginia, was competent for both ZIKV and CVV. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was competent for both viruses, but its inability to overwinter in colder climates reduces this speciesâ€™ likelihood of ZIKV transmission in Virginia. With the abundance of highly competent mosquito species, there may be greater concern for increased CVV transmission in temperate regions of the USA.
