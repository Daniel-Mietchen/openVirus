<p id="Par29">A meta-analysis by McKenzie et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] suggested that the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for Zika virus varied among geographically disparate populations. We found that the vector competence of a Virginia strain of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was equivalent to that of a Florida strain of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes were found to be refractory to ZIKV infection. Other studies have also observed similar results, suggesting that it is unlikely this group plays a role in ZIKV transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We also found that 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> from Virginia was capable of transmitting ZIKV, but at a much lower rate compared to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. A study by Aliota et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showed that laboratory strains of 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> were able to become infected with ZIKV PRVABC59, the same strain that we used, but no dissemination or transmission resulted. Our study showed similar results working with an F1 generation of field-caught 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> where only midgut infections resulted from oral exposure.
