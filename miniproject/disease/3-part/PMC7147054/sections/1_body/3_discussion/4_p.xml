<p id="Par31">Although 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> was capable of ZIKV transmission, it is not an aggressive human biter and predominantly inhabits forested areas, which limits its role in ZIKV transmission. Surprisingly, 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx, pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> were not competent for ZIKV even though they are competent vectors of other flaviviruses, such as WNV or SLEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, on the other hand, was highly competent for ZIKV and exhibits aggressive, anthropophilic behaviour. The likelihood for this species to contribute to ZIKV transmission in Virginia is much higher compared to other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in this region.
