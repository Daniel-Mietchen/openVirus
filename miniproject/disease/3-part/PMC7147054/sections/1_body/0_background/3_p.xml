<p id="Par15">Cache Valley virus (CVV) (family 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>) is a neuroinvasive arbovirus that is also spread by mosquitoes. Although CVV infection typically causes mild symptoms in humans, fever, meningitis, and encephalitis have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The symptoms of CVV infection are more severe in ruminants, such as sheep or cattle, and include stillbirths, congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. CVV has a widespread distribution in North America and has been isolated from many species of mosquitoes including 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The principal vector is unknown, but vector competence studies and field isolations have shown that 
 <italic>Anopheles quadrimaculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>An. punctipennis</italic> may play a significant role in the natural transmission cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Laboratory transmission studies have also shown that 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. sollicitans</italic> and 
 <italic>Cq. perturbans</italic> are competent vectors of CVV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
