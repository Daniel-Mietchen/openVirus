<p>After the search in Coosto, 2 researchers separately scanned all titles for relevance. Articles were excluded if the title was unrelated to influenza in hospitals in the Netherlands or if it was a duplicate news article.

In each news article, the following information was identified: whether (1) the article was recently published, (2) it came from a designated spokesperson, (3) the name and place of the hospital was mentioned, (4) it was about a specific hospital department, and (5) the specific problems pertaining to influenza and the implemented preventive/response measures were mentioned.

The problems reported by hospitals in the news articles were categorized as (1) hospital admission stops, (2) postponing nonurgent surgical procedures likely caused by the high number of influenza patients, (3) staff capacity problems because of influenza, and/or (4) other influenza epidemic-related problems [
