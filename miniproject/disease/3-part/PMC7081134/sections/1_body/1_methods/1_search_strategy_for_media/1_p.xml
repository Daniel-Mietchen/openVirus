 <italic>griep EN ziekenhuis</italic> (in English: 
 <italic>flu/influenza AND hospital</italic>) was used. There is only 1 word for flu/Influenza in Dutch used in media reporting, that is, 
 <italic>griep</italic>. Only articles from the Netherlands published on regional or national news websites during the influenza season (week 40 of 2017 until week 20 of 2018) were selected. Trend in weekly number of news articles from the Coosto search was plotted against trends in the different influenza surveillance systems that were available on a weekly basis. A content analysis was performed on a selection of news articles with data on influenza in hospitals during the 2017/2018 influenza season. The relevance of the news articles and possible duplicates was only assessed for the content analysis.
