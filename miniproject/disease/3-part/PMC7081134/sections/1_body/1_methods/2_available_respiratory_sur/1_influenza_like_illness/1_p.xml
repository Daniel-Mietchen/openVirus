<p>The basis for the weekly, near real-time surveillance of influenza in the Netherlands is the incidence of ILI as reported by approximately 40 GP sentinel practices participating in the Nivel Primary Care Database [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The population of these sentinel practices covers 0.7% of the Dutch population and is nationally representative for age, sex, regional distribution, and population density [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The ILI incidence is calculated as the number of patients with a new episode of ILI divided by the total number of enlisted patients in the participating sentinel GP practices. As all Dutch residents are registered in a general practice, the number of enlisted patients represents the general population. An influenza epidemic is declared when the ILI incidence is &gt;5.1 per 10,000 inhabitants for a consecutive 2 weeks and when influenza virus is detected in swabs from ILI patients.
