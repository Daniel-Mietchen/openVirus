<p>The six viral populations isolated from 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. erythroleucus</italic> show very different emergence periods according to the rodent populations from which they originated in West Africa (

 <xref rid="biology-09-00026-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, the LASV clade obtained from rodents in Mali is the oldest and dates back to 96 years, whereas that obtained in Denguedou near the Sierra Leonean border is very recent and seems to have emerged 20 years ago. Between these two emerged the LASV population of Faranah in Upper Guinea; those from Ekpoma and Kenema synchronously; and then that of Madina Oula in coastal Guinea (

 <xref rid="biology-09-00026-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We did not present the results of the random and fixed local clock because the models never converged well, i.e., the ESS parameters did not reach the value of 100 after a MCMC chain of 50 M.
