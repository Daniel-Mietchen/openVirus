<p>To compare the sequences obtained from humans to those from rodents, we have only two sites with sufficient numbers of individual human-derived sequences for analysis: Ekpoma in Nigeria and Kenema in Sierra Leone. This analysis is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00026-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="biology-09-00026-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> where we note the same pattern: the sequences observed in 
 <italic>Homo</italic> are on average earlier than those detected in 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic>. A superimposition exists between the two viral populations, which indicates a close contact and the passage of the virus from one host to another. On the Kenema graph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00026-f002">Figure 2</xref>b), the two peaks are more disjointed than in Ekpoma (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00026-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), probably because of a greater distance between the sites sampled within this locality. Additional analyses that do not take into account cases from Bo or Liberia show even more disjointed peaks (data not shown).
