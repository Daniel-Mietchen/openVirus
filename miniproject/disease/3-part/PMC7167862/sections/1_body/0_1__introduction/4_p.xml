<p>During outbreaks of rodent-borne viral hemorrhagic fevers, phylogenetic comparison has helped to link infection in human patients to rodent populations for hantaviruses in the USA [

 <xref rid="B18-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is also similar for arenaviruses, such as the Lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus in France [

 <xref rid="B6-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These studies typically involved few virus sequences obtained both from the infected patients and rodents in their domestic surroundings, and do not allow a statistical comparison between rodent versus human hosts.
