<p>Here, we seek to phylogenetically infer ancestry and descent between LASV sequences detected in rodents and humans in selected localities within West Africa in order to provide increased insight into virus transmission at the rodentâ€“human boundary. Our aim was to compile a dataset including LASV sequences collected from both humans and 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> rodents within distinctive hotspots of Lassa fever. Two localities in West Africa currently fit this description: Kenema (represented by Kenema and other closely surrounding localities within a 35 km radius, Sierra Leone) and Ekpoma (comprising Ekpoma and Eguare Egoro, only 6 km from each other within Nigeria).
