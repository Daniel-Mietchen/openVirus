<p>We are aware that the notion of reverse zoonosis in Lassa fever would require a large body of additional evidence to become established, including experimental approaches. Furthermore, as we envisage the impending availability of a much expanded pool of rodent-sourced LASV sequences against which our findings can be tested, we regard our research as a precursory, yet important foundation that will inform subsequent data collection and analyses.</p>
