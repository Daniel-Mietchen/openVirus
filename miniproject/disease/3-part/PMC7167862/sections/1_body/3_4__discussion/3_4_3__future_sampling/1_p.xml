<p>Appropriateness and robustness in data acquisition lend to interpretability. In Ekpoma, for instance, which is known as one of the most endemic localities for Lassa fever in Nigeria [
 <xref rid="B31-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we conducted rodent trapping in 24 GPS-tracked sites spanning the city, including precise addresses where Lassa fever cases were previously recorded. We sampled these sites twice each year during 2011–2012 (Olayemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) and in eight sessions through 2014–2016. Therefore, we find it surprising that, considering the geographic and temporal scope of our compilation, almost all the LASV strains we sequenced from
