<p>In addition to the structured sampling in the ecological projects that generated most of the rodent-derived LASV sequences, we suggest conducting opportunistic collection approaches in future studies. In such a case,

This would result in a greater probability of detecting the older strains that have already been documented in humans; if they are indeed circulating in rodents. Studies in molecular epidemiology such as ours can be notoriously confounded by misleading human geographic data (due to movement after infection or poor hospital records [
