<p>Our findings do not necessarily contradict the rodent-to-human route of LASV transmission, which is supported by recent LASV phylogenies based on sequences mostly sampled from humans [
 <xref rid="B8-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Instead, we call for a broader paradigm including infection in the reverse direction. In such a scenario, few infectious humans could initiate a LASV focus area, which is then perpetuated by commensal rodents acting as transmission enhancers.
