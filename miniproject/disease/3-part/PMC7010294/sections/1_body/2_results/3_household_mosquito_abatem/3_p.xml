<p>The idea of cleanliness as being key to avoiding mosquito proliferation was widely held, with a majority of participants considering the prevention of household clutter as an effective method for reducing mosquito densities in houses. Women rarely reported routinely applying topical mosquito repellents to themselves, although regular use on young children was more common. A reluctance to use repellents was often accompanied by comments describing repellents as being excessively expensive, at least for routine use, and this was particularly common in the groups containing participants from lower socio-economic strata. Women from lower socio-economic groups, particularly in Cali, were also more likely to report the topical use of products not manufactured for the purpose of repelling mosquitoes. Most notably, Vicks VapoRub, a cream sold as a nasal decongestant, was mentioned frequently by respondents as being routinely used as both a method of repelling mosquitoes and for the soothing of bites. Johnsonâ€™s Baby Oil and various other moisturizing body creams were also reported being applied as a protective barrier to mosquito biting.</p>
