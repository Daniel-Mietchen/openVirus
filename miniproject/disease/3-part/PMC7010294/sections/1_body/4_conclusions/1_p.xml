<p>Given the importance and challenges of achieving high uptake with topical repellents and repellent clothing among pregnant women, this study attempted to identify areas where product design and dissemination can be optimized to maximise target-user uptake and compliance. The FGDs revealed that not all pregnant participants were aware of the full range of pathologies associated with Zika, and worryingly, several did not know about the possibility for congenital transmission and fetal birth defects. While knowledge of mosquito transmission appeared universal, sexual transmission was mentioned rarely. Equitable access to repellents was often raised as a concern, particularly in the lower socioeconomic groups, with several participants indicating that, for them, regular use of commercially-available repellents would not be financially viable. Significant worries were raised that there may be health risks associated with repeated contact with repellent chemicals, particularly during pregnancy. The use of repellent products that do not contain recommended active ingredients also appears to be common, with the view that these products present lower toxicity. Participants viewed plant-derived repellents as possessing inherently less toxicity than synthetic repellents, and identified health workers as particularly trusted sources of information on bite-prevention.</p>
