<p>Focus group transcripts were analysed in their original Spanish by researchers at Universidad del Valle and Universidad de Cooperativa del Colombia, sede Villavicencio. English translations were produced, and were provided to researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) for independent analysis. Transcripts were analysed by thematic coding according to a pre-defined coding scheme. Coding was performed using the Atlas.ti (version 8.0) (Scientific Software Development Gmbh, Berlin) and NVivo (version 11.0) (QSR International, Melbourne) software packages. There were 7 coding families in total, representing: common mosquito control methods, arbovirus concerns, Zika knowledge, sources of Zika knowledge, changes to control behaviours during the Zika outbreak, ideal mosquito control tools, and views around PPT. Each theme family was divided into a larger number of sub-families. Each interview was independently analysed by at least three individual researchers, and results were compared and discrepancies discussed until a consensus was reached. As the purpose of using the two study sites was to increase diversity and not to directly compare the two cities, comparisons have only been drawn when clear differences between study sites emerged.</p>
