<p>All women in the study made out‐of‐pocket payments either during their pregnancy or for their affected child. These payments were made to access medical consults, laboratory tests, and procedures that are included in the Obligatory Health Plan (POS, Spanish acronym). They were not performed for several reasons that acted as barriers, including multiple administrative procedures and authorization denials by a woman's EAPB. In other cases, women made out‐of‐pocket payments to access procedures in a timely manner.</p>
