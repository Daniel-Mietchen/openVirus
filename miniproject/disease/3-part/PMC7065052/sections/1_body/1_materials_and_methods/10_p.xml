<p>During the analysis phase, a set of categories were defined based on the instrument guide and the conceptual framework chosen for the analysis. A deductive thematic analysis was used to elaborate a codebook with the definition of each category and subcategory, to provide the coder with a guide for the encoding process. These category definitions were based on the conceptual framework, existing literature, and in concepts and procedures outlined in the national management guidelines for women suspected to have Zika virus infection. Besides the previously described deductive approach, the authors implemented an inductive approach to code qualitative data, allowing the coding of new emergent categories while the text was examined. Next, review and re‚Äêevaluation of the obtained categories and subcategories was made to simplify and refine them according to the conceptual framework initially proposed. A final set of categories and subcategories was achieved. The detailed set of categories can be found in supporting information
