<p>Data about respiratory support were available for 8667 (65%) of the 13 368 patients. Support was not required for 1005 (12%) patients, oxygen was given to 506 (6%) patients, and 7156 (83%) patients were ventilated. Of 579 patients reported to have pneumonia, 430 (74%) were ventilated, 118 (20%) received oxygen, and 31 (5%) received no respiratory support. Of 3085 patients with ARDS, 2843 (92%) were ventilated, 134 (4%) were reported to be given oxygen, and 108 (3.5%) received no respiratory support. The risk of death increased more than 4-fold when ventilation had to be commenced (IRR, 3.98; 95% CI, 3.03–5.23), but not for patients only given oxygen support (IRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.68–1.52) compared with patients without any respiratory support, adjusting for reporting country, age, and sex.</p>
