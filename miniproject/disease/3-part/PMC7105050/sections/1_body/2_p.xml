<p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has conducted hospital-based surveillance of severe influenza since the pandemic in 2009 [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Aggregate data are published weekly during the influenza season [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but case-based data have not been systematically analyzed at the European level [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, our aim was to analyze data on laboratory-confirmed influenza cases admitted to ICUs to identify common determinants of fatal outcome that may inform risk communication and help target prevention strategies.
