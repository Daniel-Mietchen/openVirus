<p>The proportion of fatal cases among patients in ICU was higher in this study (21%) than in previous analyses (mean 16%) [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which might be due to the inclusion criteria we used: known virus type, age, gender, and outcome. The results showed an increasing risk of death associated with influenza A and increasing age over 40 years, which partly confirms the findings of other studies that indicate mortality during A(H3N2) seasons mostly affects people 65 years of age and older and middle-aged during A(H1N1)pdm09-dominated seasons [

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, fatality in ICU represents only a small fraction of the mortality toll of influenza, particularly in the elderly, which are less likely to be admitted to ICU and have also been shown to be less likely tested for influenza virus infection in the hospital setting [
