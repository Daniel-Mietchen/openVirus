<p>The present study is limited by the small number of EU countries reporting. Cases were reported from only 12 of the 31 EU/EEA Member States, and so their cases might not be representative of all severe cases across the EU/EEA. A further limitation of this study is the differences in ICU reporting systems between Member States and the pooling of such case-based data across countries that have different underlying healthcare systems and surveillance [

Nevertheless, we assessed the variation by applying different statistical methods and identified a reasonable test to compensate for the reporting country effect according to Barros et al [

We believe that this study, even with its limitations, provides valuable information on several determinants relevant for increased risk of fatal outcome due to influenza in Europe. The identified limitations of reporting and pooling of such case-based clinical data across countries will need to be addressed to develop more robust variables and apply clinical severity scores. This process needs to create data independent from the respective underlying surveillance system to be useful to identify determinants for severe disease and fatal outcome.
