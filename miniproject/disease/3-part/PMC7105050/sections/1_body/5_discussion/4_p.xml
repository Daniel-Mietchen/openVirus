<p>The data reported to TESSy were not complete regarding influenza virus A subtype and B lineage as well as underlying conditions. A considerable number of cases (4611; 34%) from the basic dataset had to be dropped from the specific subset analysis due to missing virus subtype information. The high proportion of unsubtyped influenza A viruses, ranging from 0.1% during the pandemic season 2009/2010 to 60% in 2016/2017, limited determination of the dominant virus subtype for most of the seasons in the analysis. We also observed that the proportion of unsubtyped influenza A viruses was higher in A(H3N2)-predominant seasons than in A(H1N1)pdm09 seasons. This might be explained by the fact that detection systems specifically developed for A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2009 pandemic continue to be used in diagnostics, so if influenza A viruses test negative in the specific A(H1N1)pdm09 test, they are reported as “influenza A unsubtyped”, which creates a bias towards more A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in the subtype-specific analyses. Another reason could be an increased testing for influenza A and B in acute hospital settings using point-of-care tests without further subtyping. Better virological data would be desirable for a better assessment of the clinical impact of the virus subtype but also regarding vaccine effectiveness. In a French study, female sex and influenza vaccination were described as protective factors with regard to ARDS in severely ill patients [

In our study, vaccination showed some protection; however, the data on vaccination status had several limitations in the available information on vaccination date, vaccine type, and onset of disease. The small number of cases with information on underlying conditions and vaccination status did not allow for a more in-depth analysis.
