<p>Influenza viruses pose a permanent threat to public health due to seasonal epidemics with surges of associated morbidity and mortality and their pandemic potential [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref>]. Therefore, intense global surveillance is conducted to constantly monitor and assess the epidemiological and virological situation and evaluate prevention and control measures [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref>]. The World Health Organization underlines the need to specifically monitor severe disease and its clinical patterns, causative viral strains, and population groups at risk [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The severity and impact of annual influenza epidemics are key indicators for assessing both seasonal and pandemic situations, particularly indicators based on influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths. These data are used to inform stakeholders, prioritize and allocate resources, and target prevention strategies to the most vulnerable. Vaccination programs in particular depend on the identification of specific risk groups [
