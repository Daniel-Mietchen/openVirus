    "Limited knowledge exists on the quality of polyclonal antibody response generated following Ebola virus (EBOV) infection compared with vaccination. Polyclonal antibody repertoire in plasma following EBOV infection in survivors was compared with ChAd3-MVA prime-boost human vaccination. Higher antibody binding and affinity to GP was observed in survivors compared with vaccinated plasma that correlated with EBOV neutralization. Surprisingly, a predominant IgM response was generated after prime-boost vaccination, whereas survivors demonstrated IgG-dominant antibody response. EBOV infection induced more diverse antibody epitope repertoire compared with vaccination. A strong binding to antigenic sites in the fusion peptide and another in the highly conserved GP2-HR2 domain was preferentially recognized by EBOV survivors than vaccinated individuals that correlated strongly with EBOV neutralization titers. These findings will help development and evaluation of effective Ebola countermeasures including therapeutics and vaccines."
