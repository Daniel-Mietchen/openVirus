<p>To determine the transmission status of medically important mosquito-transmitted arboviruses in Ghana, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquito pools were screened for DENV, CHIKV, or WNV by RT-PCR. Screening was carried out using the PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR Kit ver. 2 (Takara Bio) and the species-specific primers DENV (D1: 5’-TCAATATGCTGAAACGCGCGAGAAACCG-3’ and D2: 5’-TTGCACCAACAGTCAATGTCTTCAGGTTC-3’); CHIKV (Chik10294s, 5’-ACG CAA TTG AGC GAA GCA CAT-3’ and Chik10573c, 5’-AAA TTG TCC TGG TCT TCC TG-3’ for CHIKV); and WNV (WNNY514, 5’-CGG CGC CTT CAT ACA CW-3’ and WNNY904, 5’-GCC TTT GAA CAG ACG CCA TA-3’ for WNV) [
