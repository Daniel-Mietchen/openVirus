<p>The F3 generation of colony GH 115 was screened for two novel viruses detected in the F2 generation, Aedes aegypti virga-like virus (AaVV) and Aedes aegypti totivirus (AaTV), to confirm persistently infected colonies. Briefly, five pools of 10 female mosquitoes from colony GH 115 were homogenized and tested for AaVV and AaTV by RT-PCR. Furthermore, individual mosquitoes and dissected body parts (the head, thorax, abdomen, legs, wings, and gonads) were screened to determine the virus-infection rate in the colony as well as the dissemination rate.</p>
