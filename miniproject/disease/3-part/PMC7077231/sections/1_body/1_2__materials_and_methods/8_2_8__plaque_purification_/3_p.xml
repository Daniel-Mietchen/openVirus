<p>Double-stranded RNA viruses were purified using cF11 cellulose [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The total RNA extracted from virus-infected C6/36 cells was mixed with CF11 cellulose in 16% ethanol in STE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl) containing 2-mecarptoethanol. After incubation for 1 h, the suspension was washed with 16% ethanol in STE buffer and dsRNA eluted with STE buffer. Subsequently, dsRNA was concentrated using LiCl and ethanol precipitation. NGS analysis was combined with 5’ and 3’ RACE using the DT88 adaptor primer to determine the complete genome sequence of the dsRNA viruses [
