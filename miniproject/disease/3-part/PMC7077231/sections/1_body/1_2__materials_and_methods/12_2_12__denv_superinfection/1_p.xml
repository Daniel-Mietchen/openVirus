<p>A C6/36 cell culture persistently infected with AaTV was established following a previously established protocol, with modifications [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, a monolayer of C6/36 cells was inoculated with AaTV-infected supernatant in a 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> culture flask at 28 Â°C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The inoculum was removed after virus adsorption and cells were covered with fresh culture medium. AaTV-infected cells were sub-cultured weekly. Persistent AaTV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
