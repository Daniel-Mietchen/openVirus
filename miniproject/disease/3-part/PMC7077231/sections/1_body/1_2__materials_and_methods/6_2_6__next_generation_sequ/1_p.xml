<p>RNA virus detection was performed using the next-generation sequencer (NGS) on cytopathic effect-causing (CPE-causing) supernatants in 2015 and on all supernatants in 2016 [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A total of 390 μL of cell supernatant was treated with four units of TURBO DNase (Life Technologies), four units of Baseline zero DNase (Epicentre, Madison, WI), and 0.4 µg of RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h. Nuclease treatment was followed by total RNA extraction using ISOGEN II (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). The extracted RNA was used to prepare the cDNA library and amplified with the SeqPlex RNA Amplification kit (Sigma-Aldrich) in 2015 and the NEBNext Ultra RNA First Strand Synthesis Module (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) in 2016. The sequence library was prepared from the cDNA library using the ion Plus Fragment library kit (Life Technology) in 2015 and the Truseq Nano DNA LT Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in 2016. NGS was performed with the Ion PGM in 2015 and Illumina MiniSeq in 2016. Reads were assembled in CLC genomics workbench software (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) and compared with other nucleotide and amino acid sequences by Blastn and Blastx on the NCBI Blast database. Virus positive pools were confirmed by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers designed from each assembled genome.
