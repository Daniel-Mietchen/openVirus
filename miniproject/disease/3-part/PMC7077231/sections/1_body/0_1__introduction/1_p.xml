<p>Arboviruses are generally regarded as agents of emerging or re-emerging diseases [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Arboviral infections can be asymptomatic and self-limiting but can also cause flu-like symptoms, neurological defects, and in some cases, death [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As the classification suggests, the distribution and intensity of arboviral infections differ around the world. The mosquito-borne arboviruses, Yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), are globally distributed, whereas the Japanese encephalitis virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, and Rift Valley fever virus have a more regional distribution [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Arboviruses are transmitted by arthropods, and there are about 300 types of mosquitoes capable of transmission. However, the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are considered the most medically important mosquito vectors [
