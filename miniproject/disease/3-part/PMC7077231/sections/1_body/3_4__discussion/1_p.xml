<p>The incidence and distribution of vector-borne arboviruses have increased exponentially over the last 30 years, with migration and globalization regarded as being among the major factors influencing the spread [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. With a global arboviral PAR of over 40%, active surveillance is an important tool in controlling and preventing the spread of infection. In highly endemic areas, human surveillance serves as a good indicator of the rate of active transmission and as a monitor for the effectiveness of a control measure [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, in non-endemic and low endemic areas, human surveillance, which involves taking blood samples, may be considered a non-effective invasive method of disease control. For this reason, vector surveillance, which is monitoring of the presence and density of a disease vector, such as a mosquito vector, in a community is increasingly being explored as a possible tool for assessing the risk of infection [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Ghana is regarded as a high-risk country for arboviruses, although it is yet to record any arbovirus outbreak other than yellow fever, which is under control because of active vaccination. Nonetheless, recent reports have noted instances of possible locally acquired infections [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, this study combined entomological surveillance with virus screening and isolation, and RNA virus characterization, to determine the status and risk of arbovirus transmission in Ghana.
