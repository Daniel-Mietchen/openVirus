<p>PCLV, for example, has been reported to inhibit the propagation of La Crosse virus, an orthobunyavirus, as well as flaviviruses such as ZIKV and DENV in vitro [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, although CFAV was initially reported to interact mutually with flaviviruses in vitro, this effect is antagonized by PCLV, and recent reports indicate that CFAV interferes with DENV dissemination in vivo [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These reports show the importance of determining and understanding the role of ISVs in arbovirus transmission, in vitro and in vivo, particularly as this study reports the first mutualistic relationship between a medically important flavivirus, DENV, and a dsRNA virus, AaTV. The possible mechanisms behind this observation and potential implications remain to be determined.
