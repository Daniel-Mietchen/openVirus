<p>Aedes aegypti totivirus (AaTV) was the second virus detected in the F
 <sub>2</sub> generation of colony GH115 (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). AaTV is an unclassified virus of the family 
 <italic>Totiviridae</italic>. The genome of AaTV comprises two ORFs encoding a capsid protein and RdRp (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00147-f013">Figure 13</xref>). AaTV was detected in the F
 <sub>3</sub> generation with an infection rate of around 60% confirming successful transmission. AaTV was also detected in all the body parts screened, including the male and female gonads, suggesting trans-ovarian transmission within the colony. A virus-free colony of GH 115 was successfully established. AaTV was also successfully propagated in C6/36, NIID-CTR (
