<p>Korle-bu Aedes virus (KoBV) is a novel virus that forms a clade with mosquito-associated unclassified viruses closely related to the family 
 <italic>Tombusviridae</italic>. KoBV was detected in female 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes only in the Greater Accra region in 2016 (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The genome of KoBV is predicted to have a stop codon read through in ORF 1 because of a premature stop codon (UAG) between nucleotides 1253â€“1256, similar to reports on Hubei mosquito virus 4 (

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The stop codon read through is typically observed when a stop codon is misread or recorded as a sense codon, allowing continuous translation until the next stop codon [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The stop codon read through facilitates the expression of several viral and cellular genes, including viral replicases [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. KoBV is therefore predicted to have three ORFs, similar to the unclassified Hubei Mosquito virus 4.
