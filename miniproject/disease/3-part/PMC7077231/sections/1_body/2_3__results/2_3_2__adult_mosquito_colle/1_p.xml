<p>A total of 8680 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were collected over two years. Mosquitoes were divided based on collection sites and pooled based on species and sex. A total of 1138 female mosquitoes divided into fifty pools were screened for medically important arboviruses, while the RNA virome of 188 pools of male and female mosquitoes was analyzed. In this study, we detected and/or isolated 14 RNA viruses belonging to at least eight different families, including the newly proposed taxon Negevirus. No medically important mosquito-transmitted viruses were detected in this study (
