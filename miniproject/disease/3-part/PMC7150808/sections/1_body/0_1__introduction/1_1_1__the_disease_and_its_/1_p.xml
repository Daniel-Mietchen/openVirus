<p>Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious and devastative viral disease of both domestic (goats and sheep) and wild small ruminants. It is caused by a morbillivirus and is clinically and pathologically close to rinderpest and human measles. PPR infection was first described in Côte d’Ivoire in 1942 and now countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East have reported PPR infections [

Among the 198 countries recognized by the United Nations, 57 have already have PPR-free status as per May 2019 according to OIE Standards, while 67 are infected and 74 have never reported PPR. Infected countries are home to some 68% percent of the world’s 2.5 billion small ruminant according to FAO statistic in 2018, with this disease having a direct impact on over 300 million families who rely on small ruminants. Between 2008 and 2018, PPR socio-economic studies were carried out in several countries. During the 2006–2008 PPR outbreak, in Turkana of Kenya, over a million animals perished and the total value, in terms of loss of production, it was estimated to be USD 2.4 million [personal communication]. In 2017, Mongolia reported its first ever PPR outbreak in domestic small ruminants as well as in endangered saiga populations. In this case, spill-over of virus from livestock at a multiple locations and time points, led to subsequent spread among wild ungulates. Worryingly, estimates of saiga abundance suggested a population decline of 80%, raising substantial concerns for the species’ survival [
