<p>As described above, from the 198 countries targeted for freedom, 57 are already PPR free, 67 are infected and 74 never reported PPR. From these 74 countries, 12 are at risk of PPR infection. Therefore, the targeted for the programme are these at risk and infected countries for a total of 79 to be supported for freedom although countries at risk should also be assisted for freedom on the historical basis. From the above 79 countries assessed since 2015 using PMAT , 30 are at stage 1, 38 in stage 2, 5 in stage 3 and 6 in stage 4 [personal communication].</p>
