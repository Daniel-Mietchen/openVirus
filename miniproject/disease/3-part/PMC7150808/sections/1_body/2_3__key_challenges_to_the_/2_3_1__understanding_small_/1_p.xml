<p>Small ruminants are often found in marginalized extensive production systems and/or produced by poor people, women and/or pastoralists with limited access to services. For these people, small ruminants are often their most important asset. At the national level, small ruminant lobbies often have limited access to decision makers or resources partners, reducing the attention given to PPR (and small ruminant health in general). Another challenge facing small ruminant production is the short cycle nature of production or annual turnover rate of 30% to be considered regarding the vaccination programme. This implies a very different cost benefit picture for veterinary services and household units in relation to investments in vaccines and other animal health inputs. It is therefore important for any strategy to engage the small ruminant owners in improving their own systems and enhancing private sector service delivery channels. This is also where the FAO has a comparative advantage since it has extensive multidisciplinary experiences and a mandate to work within rural and smallholder settings, integrating production and animal health issues, along with social and economic issues either in livestock only or mixed farming systems.</p>
