<p>In stage 1 of the PPR GCES [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00313" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the assessment aims to define the epidemiological situation through the following: i) early detection of the appearance of the disease, ii) demonstrating the absence of clinical disease or infection, and iii) determining and monitoring the prevalence, distribution and occurrence of the disease or infection. The surveillance components to be considered include: passive surveillance including zero reporting, active surveillance (including targeted or risk-based surveillance), sero-surveillance, syndromic surveillance, participatory disease searches (PDS), wildlife, and abattoir surveillance. A functional surveillance programme requires the following: (i) capacity building for field personnel; (ii) sensitization of livestock value chain actors with extension/communication materials; (iii) development of good animal health data management systems for information reporting; (iv) supporting the disease intelligence surveys. Through PDS, countries or zones may be classified as either: (i) low risk (currently PPR free); (ii) high risk or “hot spots” or (iii) infected (endemic) areas. From the methodological point of view there are different considerations when designing surveillance systems or analyzing data aimed at assessing either the baseline level of exposure to PPR or detecting differences between sub-populations assumed to have different levels of PPRV exposure. Countries identified through PDS as low can move directly to stage 4. Those considered as high risk or infected should move to stage 2. Surveillance options vary from country to country and within country depending on the GCES (stages 1). PDS and other surveillance components should prepare the ground for vaccination campaign in stages 2 and 3.
