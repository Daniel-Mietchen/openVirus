<p>Whether vaccination is free or not, has been a major concern in several epizones with pastoralists moving in search of free vaccination. If not informed, the vaccination teams will be forced to come back in to the same areas several times to make sure that animals are immunized. Indeed without comprehensive cooperation from stakeholders, any animal control and or disease eradication campaign could ultimately be more costly and take longer to complete or even fail entirely. The level of acceptance of vaccination could be a problem in endemic areas or in areas where the disease is not yet present. In Uganda, a participatory epidemiological assessment included risk mapping with livestock owners, community animal health workers and veterinarians.

Better communication is also essential for developing and influencing peopleâ€™s attitudes, behaviour and decisions concerning the control of PPR. It is also essential to learn and share knowledge about the attitudes of livestock owners and other key stakeholders. Social science methodologies could be used across the whole eradication campaign to maintain the link between local stakeholders and the eradication team at the regional/national level or to explore potential options such as making herders contribute or not to the vaccination. The absence of communication at this level is another challenge to be addressed.
