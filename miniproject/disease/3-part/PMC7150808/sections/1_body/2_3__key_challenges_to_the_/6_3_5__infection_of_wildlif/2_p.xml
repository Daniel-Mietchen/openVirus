<p>The importance of this research was highlighted by a recent outbreak in Mongolia. In December 2016 the disease was diagnosed in several wildlife populations in the East of the country, including saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica mongolica), ibex (Capra sibirica) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subguttorosa), with more than 80% mortality of the 10,000, highly endangered saiga population of the country [

Studies in camel populations, kept together with small ruminants, in the Isiolo, Mandera, Marsabit, and Wajir counties of Kenya, established that camels in the study area suffer with PPR manifesting clinical signs that are mainly characterized by inappetence, loss of body condition, and general weakness, leading to diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and ocular nasal discharges preceding death. These clinical signs are similar to those observed in small ruminants with slight variations of manifestations such as keratoconjunctivitis as well as edema of the ventral surface of the abdomen. This shows that camels could be involved in the epidemiology of PPR in the region and that PPRV could be involved in epidemics of disease in camels [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00313" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moving forward, an important first step is to ensure that the currently available tests for sero-diagnosis of PPRV are validated in serum samples from these animal species, e.g., camels, saiga and ibex. With specific reference to the PPRV eradication campaign, and as mentioned above, the significance of these infections as a whole should be carefully evaluated, as they may not significantly affect the ultimate success of the programme.
