<p>Many of the countries where PPR is now endemic simply cannot finance an efficient, effective and sustained control/eradication programme. Indeed, they will need significant support for operational costs, training and meetings in order to properly implement PPR GEP. Even if livestock owners themselves contribute more towards the costs of vaccination, there will still be a requirement at the regional and global level for international funding to provide technical and coordination costs, as well as member state support [

In this context, it will be necessary to explore public-private partnerships, such as those that have proved so effective for polio, measles and malaria control. The PPR GEP budget for 2017–2021, was estimated at USD 996 million. The majority of the funding for PPR GEP relies on resources at a country level, in particular national budgets [

A recent study in Kenya and Uganda suggested that trade routes, refugee camps and areas of animal crowding during droughts increase PPR incidence as well as the socio-economic impact. These should be targeted for interventions, monitoring and surveillance as part of PPR control programmes [

However, global funding is needed for some catalytic components of the programme, including activities that support the effective mobilization of additional national and regional resources. On 6–7 September 2018, FAO and OIE, in collaboration with the European Union and the African Union Commission, organized the global conference “Partnering and Investing for a PPR-free World” in Brussels. The Conference represented a historic milestone for the collective efforts to address PPR. Prior to the conference, a mapping of PPR funding shown that of the approximately USD 1 billion needed for the first PPR GEP phase (2017–2021), USD 656 million have been secured through national budgets and resource partners. The critical financial gap was therefore estimated at USD 340 million [

That said, it is worth highlighting that more than 70% of the PPR GEP budget is allocated for the vaccination of 1.5 billion sheep and goats (this includes costs for vaccine procurement, logistics and post vaccination evaluation). It is unfortunate to note that the funding already secured, only small portion of these resources is dedicated to PPR control and eradication. Research is also important to identify indicators for monitoring the eradication programme.
