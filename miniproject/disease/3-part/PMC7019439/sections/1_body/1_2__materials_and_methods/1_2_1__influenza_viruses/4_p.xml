<p>Cells were seeded in a T175 cm
 <sup>2</sup> culture flask at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL with UltraMDCK SFM. After 18–20 h, the cell monolayer was washed twice with sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). After the DPBS had been carefully removed, cells were infected with 3.5 mL (IDV) or 10mL (ICV) of UltraMDCK SFM (without Trypsin) containing the respective virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001. After 1 h of incubation at 33 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 50 mL of UltraMDCK SFM containing a final concentration of 2 µg of trypsin acetylated (IDV) and 0.5 µg of TPCK (ICV) was added to the flask. The infected cells were incubated at 33 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 36 h. At the end of the incubation period, additional acetylated trypsin was added up to a final concentration of 1 µg/mL and the flask was incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for another 36–48 h. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored every day, along with the hemagglutination (HA) titre of the supernatant. At 90% of the CPE, the culture medium was harvested, centrifuged at 4 °C in order to remove the cell debris, and stored at −80 °C.
