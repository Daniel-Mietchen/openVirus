 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the viral genome shows approximately 50% overall homology with influenza C virus (ICV), no cross-reactivity with antibodies directed against human ICV and no re-assortment with human ICVs have been observed so far. Moreover, attempts to detect viable recombinant progeny involving ICV and IDV have not been successful [
