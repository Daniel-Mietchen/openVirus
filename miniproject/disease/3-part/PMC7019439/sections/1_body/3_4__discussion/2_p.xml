<p>The results of the present study indicate that the findings of studies conducted in various countries also apply to Italy. The low seroprevalence (5.1%) of IDV specific antibodies found in the human serum samples from the first year of the study (2005) suggests that IDV may have circulated at least in Italy already before 2005. This finding is supported by a study by Luo et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which suggested that Nebraska beef cattle had been exposed to IDV since at least 2003, and that the virus may have already circulated at least 8 years before its detection.
