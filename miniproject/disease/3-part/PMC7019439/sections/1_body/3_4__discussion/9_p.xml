<p>At least three antigenic lineages of IDV have been identified—D/Oklahoma, D/660 and D/Japan—and HI analysis have shown up to a 10-fold loss in cross-reactivity against heterologous antiserum [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00030" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Serological analysis in this study has been conducted using D/660-like strain; however, the use of a single IDV strain may ultimately lead to an underestimation of the true seroprevalence in Italian population, leaving the conclusions of this study unchanged.
