<p id="p0130">A similar mRNA-based vaccine also incorporates a modified nucleoside (1-methylpseudouridine) and encodes the prM-E glycoproteins of the H/PF/2013 strain of ZIKV.

 </xref> This vaccine construct contains modified nucleosides intended to boost antigen production and reduce innate immune responses to the construct. Mouse studies revealed that the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody, antigen-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses and protected against viral challenge. Vaccination of nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques) resulted in the development of E protein–binding antibody and neutralizing antibody, and 80% of immunized animals were protected against viral challenge (ie, no detectable viremia).
