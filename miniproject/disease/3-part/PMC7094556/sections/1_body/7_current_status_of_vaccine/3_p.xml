 <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03611946" id="intref0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT03611946</ext-link>). This vaccine is constructed on the backbone of DENV serotype 4 and expresses ZIKV surface proteins. The virus vector has been attenuated through the deletion of a 30 nucleotide sequence in the 3′ untranslated region that drastically reduces viral replication. The resulting vaccine vector has been administered to rhesus macaques and to humans with no serious adverse events reported.
