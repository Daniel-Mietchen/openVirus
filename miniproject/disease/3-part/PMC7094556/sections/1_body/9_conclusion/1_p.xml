<p id="p0180">Public health urgency, advances in genetics-based design of vaccines, and newer insights in immunology have combined to accelerate vaccine development against Zika virus. Multiple vaccine candidates are already in preclinical through phase 2 studies, with some poised to enter phase 3 studies of efficacy. This is remarkable given the fact that Zika virus went relatively unnoticed until the large outbreaks in Brazil starting in 2016. On the positive side, this extraordinary progress has resulted from collaborations among academia, biotech start-ups, pharmaceutical companies, nongovernmental organizations, and a variety of funders. On the negative side, inadequate research funding, late funding given the initial outbreaks in the Yap Islands in 2007, and a variety of difficulties in moving vaccine candidates down the development pipeline, have slowed progress. In particular, governments must invest the research and development dollars and provide industry incentives for rapid clinical development to occur. This must be a shared burden but should particularly have intense and sustained involvement by the countries where mosquito abatement has been “too little too late” and where outbreaks of this disease have developed. Additionally, these outbreaks are an excellent example of the need for a global funding entity—as called for in a recent publication. It is likely that in the private sector, the costs of Zika vaccine development cannot be recouped due to the relative lack of current and ongoing large-scale outbreaks. Thus, industry will need incentives or government-provided development dollars to invest resources into the multimillion dollar enterprise needed to advance a vaccine candidate through to approval by regulatory authorities.</p>
