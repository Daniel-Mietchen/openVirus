<p id="p0095">Animal models provide an important testing ground for developing new vaccines. With the obvious caveat that these are models that only partially recapitulate human anatomy, physiology, and immune response, animal models of infection provide important insights because capturing the complexity and systemic interactions required for immune function requires a living organism. These models provide complete control over baseline characteristics (eg, age, sex, pregnancy status, preexisting immunity), timing and dose of infection, sampling time points, biospecimen collection (eg, blood, tissues, organs), and the ability to examine gonadal tissues and products of conception.</p>
