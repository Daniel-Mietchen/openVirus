<p>Tacrolimus is another immunosuppressive agent that also demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity. Like cyclosporine, tacrolimusâ€™ initial use was to prevent rejection in organ transplants. However, despite similar effects, tacrolimus and cyclosporine differ in their chemical makeup. Cyclosporine is a cyclic endecapeptide, in contrast to tacrolimus, which is a macrocyclic lactone. Both are calcineurin inhibitors, an enzyme necessary for T cell replication.

Blocking calcineurin subsequently inhibits the transcription of several cytokines that are necessary to the immune pathway and response, particularly IL-2. This cytokine is integral in the maintenance, differentiation, and survival of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells.
