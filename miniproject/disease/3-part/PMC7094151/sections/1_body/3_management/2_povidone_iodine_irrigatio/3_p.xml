<p>The mode of action requires the oxidation of pathogen nucleotides, amino acids, and proteins, damaging vital bacterial cellular mechanisms.
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Additionally, in vitro investigation indicates that PVI impedes the host’s inflammatory response to a viral pathogen by affecting both host and pathogen parameters.
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This may give insight into how in-office PVI irrigation may alleviate inflammatory symptoms associated with EKC. Specific pathogen consequences include inhibition of production and release of exotoxins (such as α-hemolysin, phospholipase C, and lipase) and suppression of bacterial enzymes (such as elastase and ß-glucuronidase).
