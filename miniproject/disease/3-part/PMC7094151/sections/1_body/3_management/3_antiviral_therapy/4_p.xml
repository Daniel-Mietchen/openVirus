<p>Sun et al conducted a study utilizing a series of eye drops to treat active EKC infections, including GCV ophthalmic gel, interferon eye drops, a tobramycin-dexamethasone combo, and topical diclofenac sodium. In this study, interferon was administered with the purpose of inhibiting viral replication, while GCV was used for its antiviral properties. To improve efficacy and limit potential ocular side effects, such as inflammation, congestion, and edema, tobramycin-dexamethasone and diclofenac sodium treatments were also employed. This combination of drugs demonstrated a 91.76% cure rate in a 6-week treatment period, with low risk of side effects limited to transient corneal epithelial defects and elevated intraocular pressure. While EKC is often considered to be self-limiting, this study concluded that the proposed treatment plan, specifically during the early phase of the disease, could markedly reduce the patientâ€™s symptoms, shorten the course of the disease, and lessen the risk of corneal complications.
