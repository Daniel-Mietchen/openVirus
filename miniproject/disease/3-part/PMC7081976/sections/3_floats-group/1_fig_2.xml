  <title>IAV-S evolution.</title>
  <p>(A) Inferred spatial movements of the major Eurasian lineage of IAV-S (avian-like Eurasian H1N1) between countries, inferred from a time-scaled MCC tree of the N1 segment. Lines represent general directions of movement inferred from available genetic data, and actual paths may differ and include unsampled locations. (B) Genomic reassortment events between the three swine lineages that produced the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Horizontal bars represent the eight individual segments of the IAV genome, ordered from longest (PB2, 2,277 nucleotides) to shortest (NS, 890 nucleotides). HA, hemagglutinin; IAV, Influenza A virus; IAV-S, IAV of swine; MCC, maximum clade credibility; MP, matrix protein; NA, neuraminidase; NP, nucleoprotein; NS, nonstructural protein; PA, polymerase acidic protein; PB1, polymerase basic protein 1; PB2, polymerase basic protein 2.</p>
