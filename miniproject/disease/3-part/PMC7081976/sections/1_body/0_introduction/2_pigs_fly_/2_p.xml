<p>In the latter decades of the 20th century, the replacement of small-scale swine farms with larger, more efficient production systems (

But modern production systems often require pigs to be transported long distances between multiple locations specialized in different growth stages, facilitating the spread of IAV in swine (IAV-S; commonly known as swine flu) and other pathogens not specifically targeted for eradication. For example, many large breeding operations located in the southern US find it more efficient to transport fattening pigs to the Midwest “corn belt” than to transport the large volumes of feed back to the south. By the 2000s, trucks were transporting millions of pigs long distances across North America, facilitating the spread of IAV-S along established “swineways” [
