<p>It should be noted that the human–animal interface looks quite different from the perspective of the pig. Only one IAV has successfully transmitted from swine to humans to cause a pandemic (2009) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008259.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In comparison, swine are continuously experiencing pandemics of human origin. In the US alone, at least eight genetically distinct IAVs have successfully host jumped from humans to swine (reverse zoonosis). On a global scale, there have been at least 20 successful human-to-swine transmission events, defined by sustained onward transmission in swine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008259.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This number could be much greater, as many countries do not routinely test for IAV-S. Tellingly, almost every country’s IAV-S population that has been genetically characterized includes viruses of human origin. Recently, viruses of human origin were identified in swine in Australia and Chile that have circulated undetected for decades [
