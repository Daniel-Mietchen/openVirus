<p>The 2009 pandemic vividly demonstrated both the promise and persisting limitations of outbreak investigation in the genomic era. Genetic sequencing of the first H1N1 pandemic viruses isolated from humans in April 2009 rapidly determined that the reassortant virus was comprised of three genetic lineages of swine origin (

Many countries did not consider IAV-S an important clinical disease. To their credit, the 2009 pandemic stimulated an expansion of IAV-S research in many countries, filling gaps in our knowledge of IAV-S diversity and evolution on a global scale [
