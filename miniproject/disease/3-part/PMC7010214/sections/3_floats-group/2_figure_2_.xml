  <p id="P46">(A) Circular heatmap displaying the relative abundance of barcode reads for each recombinant virus within the library upon infection of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs, MDCK cells, or 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Samples were collected at 48 h post-infection (hpi), and after viral RNA extraction, they were further processed to quantify the total number of barcode reads. Averages of triplicates are listed in columns around the phylogenetic tree and expressed as the log
   <sub>2</sub> fold induction over the relative proportion of barcode reads found in the initial viral mix (input). Red and green indicate high or low barcode reads versus input, respectively.
  </p>
  <p id="P47">(Bâ€“D) Multiple comparison between differences in amino acid sequence versus differences in fitness between all viruses within the library were analyzed in mouse lungs (B), in MDCK supernatants (C), and in allantoic fluid (D) at 48 hpi. Highly correlating viruses were grouped in clusters labeled in different colors for visualization purposes. Pairwise comparisons showing viruses with similar fitness profiles but with significant amino acid differences are depicted in red. *p &lt; 0.05.</p>
