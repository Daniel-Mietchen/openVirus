<p id="P16">Next, we analyzed the multiple NS1 evolutionary directions based on their host-specific fitness within the viral library. To this end, we generated an identity matrix based on amino acid sequence differences and analyzed the log
 <sub>2</sub> induction over the input at 48 h post-infection for each virus. Data were plotted as three-dimensional (3D) landscapes to visualize the distribution of specific viral groups and their contribution to the overall fitness profile (

 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), allele A H3N2 NS1-expressing viruses showed poor fitness in all three host models tested. However, the distribution of some avian allele A viruses was different among mice (

 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), and allantoic fluid (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Among them, recombinant viruses containing H7N9 (A/Shanghai/02/2013) and H9N2 (A/Chicken/Rizhao/2013) NS1 showed increased viral fitness in mouse lungs. Intriguingly, multiple H7N9 human infections have been reported in China since 2013, with more than 1,560 reported human infections as of December 2017 (
