<p id="P10">We next selected various NS1 variants from fully sequenced IAV strains based on their relative phylogenetic distance, their host, and their year of isolation. To maximize functional representation, we also took into consideration the inclusion of NS1 sequences with different structural and functional sequence feature variant types (SFVTs) (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> contains our final selection of 56 NS1 sequences from different strains, hosts, countries, and years. 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the position of our selected NS1 sequences within a global NS1 phylogenetic tree. Their widespread distribution among different clades confirms that our curated viral library is representative of the NS1 sequence space in circulating IAVs from 1954 to 2013. The selected NS1 sequences were assembled into split NS segments and assigned to unique barcode sequences. Recombinant viruses were rescued by reverse genetics in an influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus background (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fodor et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Neumann et al., 1999</xref>). While each virus contained a unique NS1 sequence, the rest of the viral genome remained constant within the library.
