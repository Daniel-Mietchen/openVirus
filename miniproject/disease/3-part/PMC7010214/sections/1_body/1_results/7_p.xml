<p id="P14">We next wanted to validate whether the viral library profile dynamics can be reproduced in single-virus experiments using a selection of three viruses within the library with different barcode abundance profiles in all hosts tested (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), MDCK cells (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), and 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) were inoculated with 100 PFU of A/Moscow/2/2007, A/Tasmania/277/2007, or A/Udorn/1972 recombinant viruses, and viral replication was analyzed, as well as body weight loss

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). No statistical differences were found in the replication kinetics of the three viruses in eggs and in MDCK cells. A possible reason for the lack of differences in viral titers between these viruses at later time points in these substrates is that they might provide an unlimited resource of replication that only becomes limited when these viruses are put in competition. However, levels of viral replication in mouse lungs were consistent with the data obtained in the context of the library, and this correlated with significant differences in morbidity and mortality among the three viruses tested.
