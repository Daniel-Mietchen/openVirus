<p id="P9">After confirming that expression of the modified NS segment did not significantly affect viral replication (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>), we validated our approach to study NS1-mediated fitness in multiple hosts using a mixture of 4 recombinant IAVs containing the following NS1 sequences: A/Shanghai/02/2013 from an avian H7N9 strain, A/Udorn/1972 from a human H3N2 strain, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) from a human mouse-adapted H1N1 strain, and the loss-of-function mutant PR8-R38A/K41A, which is unable to bind to dsRNA (

Several models of influenza virus infection—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, embryonated chicken eggs, and 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice—were infected with a mix containing either 50 or 100 plaque-forming units (PFUs) per virus. Total barcode reads per virus were normalized to the initial proportion present on the viral mix before infection (input) after 48 h of replication and plotted in viral progression diagrams (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>). As anticipated, barcode reads of PR8-R38A/K41A NS1 severely decreased compared with input. This was also the case for the NS1 of A/Udorn/1972, although to a lesser extent. However, levels of wild-type (WT) PR8 notably increased, followed by A/Shanghai/02/2013. These results support our barcode-based strategy as a tool to study individual viral fitness within a library of IAVs only differing in their NS1 sequences. Because generally similar profiles were obtained between replicates at both concentrations tested in all three infection models, a dose of 100 PFU/virus was selected for further experiments with our full library of recombinant IAVs.
