 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, which are deficient in IFN signaling, or wild-type (WT) mice (

 <sup>−/−</sup> animals infected with the whole virus library (

 <sup>−/−</sup> animals when compared with WT, because several viruses replicated more efficiently in IFN-deficient conditions (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>). Such is the case of the recombinant allele B NS1 viruses, for which enrichment was lost in the absence of STAT1, despite still exhibiting increased viral fitness compared with the rest of the library. Viruses containing NS1 sequences from H7N9, H9N2, and H10N4 strains also showed increased fitness levels in

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice when compared with their WT counterparts. Thus, we concluded that differences in fitness within these viruses resulted from their NS1-dependent ability to counteract the IFN-mediated antiviral response in WT mice. However, many other viruses in the library, including those with human H3N2 NS1 sequences, were still underrepresented after replication in

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, indicating an NS1-regulated host factor independent of IFN restricts the fitness of these viruses in murine lungs.
