<p id="P11">Importantly, each NS1 sequence in our final virus library was represented by two recombinant viruses, each with a unique barcode. This was implemented as an internal control of variability, because viruses that carry the same NS1 but have different barcodes should behave similarly within the library. Moreover, this duplication approach is used to account for possible differences in amplification due to the different nucleotide composition among the barcode sequences. Recombinant viruses were individually rescued, grown in MDCK cells, titrated, and fully sequenced to confirm that no additional changes were generated during the rescue and that our virus stocks were generally free of defective interfering RNAs. Finally, all individual viruses were mixed in a common library preparation using identical numbers of infectious units. Then, MDCK cells, embryonated chicken eggs, and mice were infected with the library, and 48 h later, barcode abundance for each virus was analyzed and normalized to the original library (input) (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Viruses containing phylogenetically related NS1 behaved similarly in all three hosts tested, and no major differences were found in barcode abundance among duplicated NS1 viruses. However, overall fitness diversity was observed due to the NS1 species-specific tropism within the library (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, avian H5N1 NS1-containing viruses replicated poorly in mouse lungs compared with MDCK supernatants and egg allantoic fluid. In contrast, viruses carrying human H3N2 NS1 were underrepresented in all three models tested, suggesting poor adaptation to canine, chicken, and murine hosts. Conversely, viruses containing mammalian non-human NS1 (H3N8) were overrepresented in MDCK supernatants and in chicken allantoic fluid. Interestingly, the group of viruses containing NS1 from the allele B clade were ubiquitously overrepresented in all models tested. This is consistent with recent studies suggesting that allele B NS1-containing viruses do not exhibit specific host restrictions or attenuation in replication or in pathogenicity (
