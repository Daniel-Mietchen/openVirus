<p id="P38">NS1 protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE algorithm in MEGA7 (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Neighbor Joining (NJ) clustering analysis was performed to create a phylogenetic tree with all NS1 sequences available in the databases and further map our NS1 sequences within the library. Bayesian evolutionary analysis (BEAST) was used to create a phylogenetic tree containing our final selection of NS1 sequences within the library. Phylogenetic trees were assembled with Geneious software (version 9.1.5). Further tree visualizations were performed using FigTree software.
