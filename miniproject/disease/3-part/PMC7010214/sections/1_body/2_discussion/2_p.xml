<p id="P22">We also found that sustained circulation of NS1 in a particular host may or may not result in specialization. Such is the case of viruses containing H3N2 NS1, which showed preference to human hosts. In contrast, we found that viruses with avian-origin allele B NS1 were not restricted to a particular host, because they had efficient replication profiles in all systems tested. While it has previously been shown that allele B-derived segments efficiently replicated in mammalian hosts despite their avian origin (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Turnbull et al., 2016</xref>), the specific contributions of NS1 and NEP were not explored. In our current study, we addressed the replication abilities of a curated selection of NS1 proteins in a NEP-independent manner because of our split NS construct strategy. We can conclude that allele B NS1 is able to provide efficient replication fitness in a range of hosts.
