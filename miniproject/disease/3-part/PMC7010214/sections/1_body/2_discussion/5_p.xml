<p id="P25">In summary, our barcoded library approach can aid in the identification of IAV strains with increased host tropism and thus higher pandemic risk potential. Our system can be applied to viruses with high sequence diversity besides IAVs, facilitating analysis of specific viral genes and their contribution to the overall viral fitness in different hosts and/or cell types.</p>
