<p>Phylogenetic analysis based on HA1 domain of hemagglutinin gene showed that all A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses circulating in Kenya during 2015/2018 belonged to genetic clade 6B; subclade 6B.2 (2015/2016 isolates) and 6B.1 (2017/2018 isolates) (

Compared to the vaccine strain A/California/7/2009, Kenyan 2015/2016 strains showed several amino acid changes in HA1 including S84N (antigenic site E), S203T, E374K, S451N, S185T (antigenic site B), D97N, K283E (antigenic site C), S162R (antigenic site B), K163Q (antigenic site D), A256T and E499K (

Similarly, relative to A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine virus, Kenyan 2017 strains showed S74R, S162N (antigenic site E), S164T (antigenic site D), I295V (antigenic site C) and I510T amino acid variations in HA1, whereas the 2018 strains displayed additional T120A (antigenic site A), S451A (n = 2), K36R (n = 1), P137S (n = 6) (antigenic site A), A141E (n = 6) (antigenic site A), H273Y (n = 6) (antigenic site C), T2K (n = 12), I149L (n = 3) (antigenic site A), A315V and V479I amino acid mutations (Figs
