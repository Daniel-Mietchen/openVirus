<p>The predicted vaccine efficacies of vaccine strains A/California/7/2009 and A/Michigan/45/2015 against Kenyan 2015/2016 and 2017/2018 strains are summarized in 
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The P
 <sub>epitope</sub> between vaccine strain A/California/7/2009 and Kenyan 2015/2016 strains was 0.059 (dominant epitope E; substitutions P83S and S84N), suggesting a predicted vaccine efficacy of 32.4% of that of a perfect match with the vaccine strain. The P
 <sub>epitope</sub> between the vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 and Kenyan 2017 strains ranged from 0.021–0.03, suggesting a predicted vaccine efficacy of 39.6–41.8%. Antigenic drift in Kenyan 2018 strains was observed mainly on epitopes C, D and E, yielding a predicted vaccine efficacy range of 32.4–42.1%. The predicted vaccine efficacy of the 2019 influenza A H1N1 pdm09 vaccine strain component (A/Brisbane/02/2018) against Kenyan 2018 strains yielded vaccine efficacy range of 32.2–42.1% of that of a perfect match, with mutations observed mostly on epitopes C and D. Remarkably, the vaccine effectiveness between A/Michigan/45/2015 and A/Brisbane/02/2018 vaccine strains against Kenyan 2018 A/H1N1 pdm09 isolates fell within the same margin (Σ 32–42%), plausibly implying that the latter A/H1N1 pdm09 vaccine component would not have provided improved protection against these viruses.
