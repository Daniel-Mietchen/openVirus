 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we have shown that influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses that circulated in Kenya during 2015–2018 belonged to phylogenetic clade 6B; sub-clades 6B.1 and 6B.2. Clade 6B of the A (H1N1) pdm09 variants are defined by D97N, K163Q (antigenic site D), S185T (antigenic site B), K283E (antigenic site C) and A256T amino acid mutations in HA1 while those belonging to sub-clade 6B.1 harbor additional S74R (antigenic site E), S162N (antigenic site B), S164T (antigenic site D), I216T (antigenic site D) and I295V (antigenic site C) amino acid substitutions [
