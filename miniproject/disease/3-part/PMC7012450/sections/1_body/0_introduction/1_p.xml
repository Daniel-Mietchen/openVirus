<p>The influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus emerged in North America in March 2009 and rapidly spread worldwide causing the first influenza pandemic of the 21
 <sup>st</sup> Century [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The virus genome comprised a rare mixture of gene segments from swine, avian and human influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The A (H1N1) pdm09 virus was first detected in Kenya on June 2009 [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Presently, A (H1N1) pdm09 has become endemic in humans, co-circulating with A/H3N2 and B as seasonal influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein is the prime target of host's neutralizing antibodies [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is typically cleaved by host cells proteases into HA1 and HA2 domains [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Proteolytic cleavage of influenza virus HA protein is crucial for virus infectivity and spread [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The A/H1N1 virus HA1 sub-unit comprise five major antigenic sites (epitopes) designated Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, mapping of H3 epitopes to H1 hemagglutinin (H3 numbering) has provided an alternative approach for identifying antigenic sites in A /H1 viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The principal strategy for prevention of influenza disease is vaccination [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, build-up of amino acid mutations coupled with N-linked glycosylation at epitope sites can diminish antibody recognition leading to waning vaccine efficacy and intermittent seasonal epidemics [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since 2010 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended using A/California/7/2009 as the vaccine component for A (H1N1) pdm09 virus in Northern and Southern hemispheres [

 <xref rid="pone.0228029.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This was later replaced in 2017 with A/Michigan/45/2015-like virus due to emergence of antigenic drift variants [
