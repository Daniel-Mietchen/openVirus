<p>6. -line 142: I would indicate that you should also consider the NGlyc result in your estimation of glycosylated sites. The algorithm is very specific in that a &gt;/= score of (++) should be used for describing an N-glycosylation site with high specificity. I would include that criteria as well and only inform those sites that also meet that criteria. A bit more conservative, since you are using only computational analyses throughout this manuscript.</p>
