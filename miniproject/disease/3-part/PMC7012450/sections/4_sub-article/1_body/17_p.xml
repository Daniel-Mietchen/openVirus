<p>Thank you for your suggestion. The calculated vaccine effectiveness across the study period (2015-2018) have been presented in the manuscript in lines 221-235 and summarized in Table 2. However, we would like to point out that no vaccine effectiveness studies involving clinical trials are ever done in Kenya due to cost considerations. Hence, we are unable to compare the calculated vaccine effectiveness against predicted/observed (via clinical trials) vaccine effectiveness for Kenya.</p>
