<p id="p0125">IFN-β levels were measured in lung homogenates using a mouse ELISA kit (PBL Assay Science, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, lung homogenates and assay standards were added to antibody-coated microtiter strips, followed by a biotinylated-labeled antibodies solution, streptavidin-HRP conjugate, and finally, a substrate and stop solution. The plates were read using a BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Absorbance at 450 nm values were converted to concentrations (pg/mL) from a standard curve.</p>
