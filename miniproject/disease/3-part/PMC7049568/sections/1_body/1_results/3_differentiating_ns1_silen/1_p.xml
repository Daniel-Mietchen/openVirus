<p id="p0030">To distinguish the antiviral responses mediated by RIG-I activation and induction of type 1 IFN and its interaction with type 1 IFN receptors due to the presence of the 5′-PPP moiety on the shRNA versus those mediated by the NS1 silencing effect of the shRNA, we used Vero cells that lack the IFN-α and IFN-β genes.

 </xref> Vero cells were transfected with shRNAs with or without 5′-PPP groups and then infected with A/Brisbane/59/2007 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 at 6 and 24 h post-transfection. RNA and cell lysates for NS1 mRNA and protein expression were collected. A 75% reduction in the levels of NS1 transcripts (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), as well as NS1 protein (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B), was observed only in cells treated with NS1shRNA uncapped or m7G-capped followed by influenza virus infection as compared with controls. However, no reduction in NS1 expression either at message or protein level was observed in cells treated with 5′-PPP-scrambled shRNA or 5′-PPP control RNA (Is9.2). These results coupled with those described in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> support the hypothesis that NS1shRNA mediates antiviral effects both by suppression of NS1 expression and by induction of type 1 IFN-mediated antiviral effects.
