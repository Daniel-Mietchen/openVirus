<p id="Par45">Several studies have shown that viral infections precede bacterial infections in airways. This phenomenon may occur due to several reasons; viruses may induce expression of airways receptors used by bacteria, viruses may disrupt epithelial barrier, and they increase the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators causing increased inflammation and risk of asthma exacerbations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. In addition, patients with asthma are frequently colonized with bacteria in lower and upper airways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and acute wheezing in infants has been associated with both viral infections and airway microbiota dominated by bacterial pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Bacterial infections may impair mucociliary clearance and increase mucus production. However, evidence linking bacterial infections to acute asthma exacerbation is limited.
