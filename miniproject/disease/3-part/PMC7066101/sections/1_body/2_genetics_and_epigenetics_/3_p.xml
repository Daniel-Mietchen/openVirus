<p id="Par12">Another asthma risk gene, 
 <italic>CDHR3</italic>, was discovered in a GWAS of childhood asthma with recurrent acute hospitalizations before 6Â years of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Experimental studies have later demonstrated that CDHR3 functions as a rhinovirus-C receptor and is highly expressed in differentiated bronchial epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The association between 
 <italic>CDHR3</italic> risk variants and rhinovirus-C respiratory illness was subsequently confirmed clinically in birth cohorts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These findings suggest that the mechanism associated with 
 <italic>CDHR3</italic> variants is at least partly explained by an increased risk of rhinovirus-C respiratory illnesses and that targeting CDHR3 might be a strategy for preventing rhinovirus-C triggered asthma exacerbations.
