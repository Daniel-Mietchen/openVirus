<p>Every week, even when no signals were detected, each health facility focal point communicated by telephone with CPC or LNSP for zero reporting. This weekly call was an opportunity to confirm that no signals were detected that week as well as to maintain open lines of communication. CPC then submitted a weekly report on EBS for the DLMEP surveillance meeting each Friday. These data were additionally presented during the weekly Monday coordination meeting led by the top MOH leadership. Five months after implementation, DLMEP conducted site visits at each health facility to discuss EBS with focal points and clinicians. These site visits culminated with a DLMEP‐hosted refresher training workshop in October 2017 in Mfou that brought together all health facility focal points. This workshop offered supportive supervision and allowed for knowledge sharing among the healthcare facility staff. The EBS pilot continued until January 2018.</p>
