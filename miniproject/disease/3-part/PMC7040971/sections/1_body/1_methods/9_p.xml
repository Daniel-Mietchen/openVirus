<p>After specimens were collected, all samples were immediately transported by portable cooler to the Virology Laboratory at CPC and analyzed according to a pre‐defined algorithm. Specimens were first tested for influenza A/B viruses using in‐house real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT‐PCR) assays. Influenza‐positive specimens underwent additional subtyping. Influenza‐negative specimens were tested with a multiplex platform, the Fast Track Diagnostic 33 (FTD33; Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg), a commercial rRT‐PCR testing kit capable of detecting 21 respiratory viruses and 12 bacteria. Patients with negative test results underwent additional pathogen detection if the clinical circumstances warranted further investigation. To strengthen diagnostic capacity in preparation for EBS, as well as for general public health preparedness, CPC participated in an advanced training on rRT‐PCR diagnostic techniques and the use of multiplex platforms hosted by CDC in July 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia. The FTD kits were provided free of cost through the International Reagent Resource (
