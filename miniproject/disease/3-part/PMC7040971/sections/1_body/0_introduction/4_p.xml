<p>While the H5N1 outbreak illustrated rapid notification from the animal to human health sectors, the situation raised important questions about detection and reporting of potential human infections with avian influenza from hospitals. The existing IDSR and influenza surveillance systems in theory contributed to routine counting of SARI, ILI, and atypical respiratory cases; however, neither system reliably notified the MOH of suspected outbreaks in a timely way, despite specific instructions to do so within IDSR. During the H5N1 outbreak, it was unclear whether Yaoundé health facilities would recognize potential human infections with avian influenza, and if they did, whether the MOH would be alerted rapidly to initiate control measures. To improve timely detection and immediate notification of suspected outbreaks, the MOH, with support from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), implemented an event‐based surveillance (EBS) program focused on detection of unusual respiratory events in Yaoundé.</p>
