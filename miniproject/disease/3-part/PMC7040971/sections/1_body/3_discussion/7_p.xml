<p>Half of the signals detected, 15 out of 30 (50%), were determined to be events by CPC/LNSP and were reported to DLMEP. This finding is consistent with EBS systems where triage and verification take place at healthcare facilities, such as in Ethiopia where 64% of EBS reports from health centers were verified and found to be true events.
 <xref rid="irv12684-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> In Ratnayake et al, where community EBS was implemented for detection of Ebola virus disease, approximately 2% of signal alerts corresponded to a patient who met the case definition of suspected, probable or confirmed case.
 <xref rid="irv12684-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> In our study, a large proportion of the reported signals were determined to be events, however, because clinicians and health facility staff are trained in health and medicine, their judgment of what constitutes a signal and when to report may represent an early type of filtering, reducing background noise.
