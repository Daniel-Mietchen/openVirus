  <title>Full set of candidate predictors considered.</title>
  <p>Values were taken at the moment a focal antigenic cluster reached a specified surveillance threshold. The columns 
   <italic>Population</italic>, 
   <italic>Cluster</italic>, 
   <italic>Relative</italic> indicate the scale and measure (e.g. mean and/or variance) that a predictor was considered in the model. Depending on the scale of the predictor, the 
   <italic>formula</italic> could refer to all strains in the population, i.e. the strains of infected hosts, or the subset of strains in a specific cluster. *For computational simplicity, these quantities were calculated using strains from a random sample of 10,000 infected individuals. N = number of hosts; 
   <italic>t</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>a0</italic>
   </sub> = the time of birth of virus a; 
   <italic>λ</italic> = antigenic distance between two strains. The antigenic distance is the pairwise degree of cross-immunity between two strains determined by the size of antigenic mutations and parent-offspring relationships; 
   <italic>k(v</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>i</italic>
   </sub>
   <italic>)</italic> = the number of deleterious mutations on a virus 
   <italic>v</italic> of infected host 
   <italic>i</italic>; 
   <italic>s</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>d</italic>
   </sub> = the fitness effect of a deleterious mutation; 
   <italic>σ</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>v</italic>
   </sub> = the average individual population susceptibility to cluster 
   <italic>c</italic>; 
   <italic>σ</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>v</italic>,
    <italic>c</italic>(
    <italic>h</italic>,
    <italic>v</italic>)
   </sub> = the probability of infection of a host with historical infection 
   <italic>i</italic> by a strain of cluster 
   <italic>v</italic>.
