  <title>Relative growth rates predicted future success.</title>
  <p>(A) Clusters that eventually establish had significantly higher 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>c</sub>/〈
   <italic>R</italic>〉 than those that fail to establish. As clusters increased in relative frequency from 1% to 10%, their 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>c</sub>/〈
   <italic>R</italic>〉 generally declined but the distinction between future successes and future failures became more pronounced. (B) 
   <italic>R</italic> is a composite value based on the mutational load and 
   <italic>S</italic>
   <sub>eff</sub>. We compared the mutational load (left) and 
   <italic>S</italic>
   <sub>eff</sub> (right) of a cluster when it crossed the 1% and 10% thresholds by subtracting the former from the latter (orange distributions); we simultaneously calculated the difference in average mutational load and 
   <italic>S</italic>
   <sub>eff</sub> across the entire viral population (grey distributions). The top and bottom rows show the distributions of change for clusters that establish and transiently circulate, respectively. The decrease in a cluster’s fitness advantage was driven by both increasing mutational load and a decreasing 
   <italic>S</italic>
   <sub>eff</sub>. The background mutational load did not change noticeably, while the background 
   <italic>S</italic>
   <sub>eff</sub> increased slightly.
