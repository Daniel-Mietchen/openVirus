  <title>Frequency distribution of 2846 clusters from 620 random time samples across the 1500 years of simulated seasonal influenza dynamics.</title>
  <p>In addition to a surveillance threshold sampling regime, we considered opportunistic sampling. Clusters that were below 1% relative frequency in the population or those that had already reached our establish criteria were excluded. Because the majority of clusters are sampled at low relative frequencies, predictive models built on an opportunistic sampling scheme performed similarly to predictive models at low surveillance thresholds.</p>
