<p>Taken together, this body of work points to the promise of predictive evolutionary models. Phylodynamic simulation models provide a complementary window into the molecular evolution of emerging viruses. By observing influenza evolution

Viral growth rates––both for an emerging cluster and its competitors––are the most robust predictors of future ascents. When a new antigenic cluster first appears at low frequency (e.g., 1% of sampled viruses), our statistical logistic regression models can predict whether it will eventually rise to dominance (e.g., maintain a relative frequency greater than 20% of sampled viruses for at least 45 days) with reasonable confidence and advanced warning. We also attempt to adapt these statistical models into actionable guidelines for global influenza surveillance by developing proxy indicators that can be readily estimated from available data. Using both simulated data and 6,271 influenza sequences collected between 2006 and 2018, we quantify the limits in the accuracy, precision and timeliness of predictions, and construct models to predict future frequencies of emerging clusters.
