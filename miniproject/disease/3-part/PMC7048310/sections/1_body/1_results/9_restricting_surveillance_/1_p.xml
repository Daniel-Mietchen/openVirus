<p>We next considered an alternative surveillance paradigm. Rather than waiting for specified surveillance thresholds, we fit models to predict the presence and frequency of clusters based on opportunistic sampling of clusters, Cluster frequencies tended to skew towards low frequencies (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). We next fit a second two-part model that sequentially predicted the presence-absence and the frequency of a cluster in three-month intervals out to one year ahead (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The model predicted up to twelve-month ahead presence-absence with 92% discriminatory power (AUC). However, the accuracy of the frequency predictions declined after six months, with a tendency to underestimate the frequencies of future dominant clusters (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s013">S5</xref> Tables). The top predictors included the frequency of the cluster at the time of sampling and most of the top predictors selected for the surveillance threshold models.
