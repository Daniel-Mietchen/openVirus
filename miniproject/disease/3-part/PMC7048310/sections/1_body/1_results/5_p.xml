<p>We examined the dynamics of the top two predictors. As newly emerging clusters rose in relative frequency from 1% to 10%, their relative growth rate declined towards one. That is, they approached the population average fitness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The relative growth rate was significantly higher for clusters that will eventually establish than those that will burn out, with the separation between the two groups increasing as the clusters ascend in frequency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This predictor is a composite quantity, estimated based on both mutational load and effective susceptibility. We compared these two quantities at two time points, when the clusters reached 1% and 10% frequencies. Mutational load increased and effective susceptibility decreased in ascending clusters, with more extreme changes occurring in clusters that ultimately failed to establish. We also measured the changes in these two quantities for the entire population, and found that the background mutational load remained relatively constant and background effective susceptibility increased slightly. The background effective susceptibility peaked when a new cluster began to constitute a major proportion of the circulating types––at this point the immunity from previous infections was not strongly protective against the newly dominant cluster. The decline in cluster fitness likely stems from the accumulation of deleterious mutations and exhaustion of the susceptible population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). While this occurred within both established and transient clusters, the mutational loads in established and transients increased by averages of 1.4 and 2.04 mutations, respectively (Wilcox, p &lt; 2.2e-16).
