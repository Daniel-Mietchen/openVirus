<p>We ran 100 replicate simulations and selected a subset that produced realistic global influenza dynamics. Specifically, we excluded 38 simulations in which endemic transmission died out prior to the 30 years. We treated the first five years of each simulation as burn-in periods. In total, we analyzed 1550 years of simulated influenza transmission and evolutionary dynamics.</p>
