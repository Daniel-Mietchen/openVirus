<p>Throughout each simulation, we tracked 23 metrics reflecting the epidemiological state of the host population (i.e., number of susceptible and infected individuals) and evolutionary state of the viral population (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s010">S2 Table</xref>) at 14-day intervals. When possible, we monitored these quantities for both individual antigenic clusters and the entire viral population, and then calculated their ratio. For example, we monitored the average number of deleterious mutations within each antigenic cluster and across all viruses, as well as the 
 <italic>relative</italic> mutational load of each cluster with respect to the entire viral population. Henceforth, we refer to the metrics as 
 <italic>candidate predictors</italic>.
