<p>We classified each novel antigenic cluster in each simulation into one of three categories: (1) rapidly eliminated clusters that never reach 1% relative frequency in the population, (2) transient clusters that surpass 1% relative frequency but do not qualify as established clusters, and (3) established clusters that circulate above 20% relative frequency for at least 45 days. With this criteria, transient and established clusters constituted on average 81% of the infections at any point in time (
