<p>We also considered an opportunistic sampling regime, where samples are tested as they arise regardless of their relative frequency. We fit models aimed at two prediction targets: (1) the evolutionary success of a cluster sampled at an arbitrary relative frequency and (2) the frequency of a cluster up to twelve months into the future. We built models based on data sampled from ten random time points in each of the 62 25-year simulations. We considered all clusters present above 1% relative frequency but not yet established as a dominant cluster. The frequency of a cluster at the time of sampling was included as an additional predictor. To predict the frequency of an antigenic cluster

We used forward variable selection and cross validation model, as described above. We used the R statistical language version 3.3.2 [
