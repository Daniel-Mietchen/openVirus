<p>Our study demonstrates that the early detection of emerging influenza viruses is limited by a tight race between the typical dynamics of antigenic turnover and the annual timeline for influenza vaccine development. The relatively poor performance of our models on empirical data provides impetus for denser sampling and the development of rapid computational and biological methods for estimating viral fitness. Nonetheless, it provides a foundation for analyzing the costs and benefits of expanding surveillance capacities and shortening the vaccine production pipeline. As we strive to expedite and improve molecular surveillance for vaccine strain selection, even incremental progress is valuable. Earlier detection of antigenic sweeps, regardless of vaccine efficacy, can inform better predictions of severity, public health messaging regarding personal protective measures, and clinical preparedness for seasonal influenza.</p>
