<p>Our attempts to apply the optimized models to empirical data were of limited success. While the global evolutionary dynamics of influenza A/H3N2 clusters visually resemble those observed in our simulations, the sparse genotypic data available do not permit estimation of the phenotypic predictors identified in our study. In the absence of these phenotypic predictors, we identified proxies of fitness and competition in the number of epitope mutations and frequency. The number of epitope mutations in a newly emerging cluster relative to co-circulating viruses provides early indication of future success. This provides proof of concept that the evolutionary viability of influenza viruses is predictable but will require better models for estimating viral fitness from sequence data and the expansion of surveillance efforts [

The poor model performance likely stems from both data quality and data quantity. At the 10% surveillance threshold, we trained and tested each

 <italic>empirical</italic> models were trained and tested on 303 and 75 clusters (only three of which eventually established), respectively. The empirical models may also be limited by real-world complexity that is not captured in the simulation model. Whereas the model assumes a well-mixed population of 40 million people, actual influenza circulation occurs in a larger and more heterogeneous population in which the fate of a newly emerging virus may be far more context dependent and thus less predictable.
