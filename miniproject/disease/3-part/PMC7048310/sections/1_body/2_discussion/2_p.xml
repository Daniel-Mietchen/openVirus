<p>Phylodynamic models provide insight into both the interplay of evolutionary and epidemiological processes and how these dynamics are manifested in observable data. In simulated data, the strongest predictor of future dominance across all of our models is the relative effective reproductive number of a cluster, that is, the growth rate of the cluster compared to the average growth rate across the viral population. This measure of viral fitness incorporates both the real-time competitive advantage (vis-a-vis the immunological landscape) and deleterious mutational load. Intuitively, faster growing clusters are more likely to persist and expand. Our ability to predict the fate of an emergent virus improves as the cluster increases in relative frequency. Both sensitivity––the proportion of successful clusters detected by the model––and positive predictive value––the proportion of predicted successes that actually establish––surpass 80% by the time a cluster has reached 10% relative frequency.</p>
