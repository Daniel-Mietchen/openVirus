<p id="Par26">Total RNA from serum samples was extracted using the Qiagen BioRobot Universal Instrument and QIAamp Virus BioRobot MDx Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA). Extracted and purified RNA was evaluated in two separate RT-PCR assays. Primarily, Zika vRNA was detected and quantified using RT-qPCR with primers and probe specific to known ZIKV genotypes as described in Lanciotti

The geometric mean, range of peak Zika vRNA detection, and the respective percentage of protected macaques (as defined by absence of vRNA) was calculated using quantities greater than the assay lower limit of quantitation of 2.9 log

 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL were considered negative.
