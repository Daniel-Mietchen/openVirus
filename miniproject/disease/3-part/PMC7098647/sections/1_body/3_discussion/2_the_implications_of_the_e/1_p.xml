<p>For most of its known history, CBSV was confined to coastal East Africa and the shores of Lake Malawi but more recently the virus has been undergoing a dramatic increase in geographic range [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In general, infectious disease epidemics depend on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, the pathogenâ€™s basic reproduction number (i.e. the average number of secondary cases produced by a primary case in a susceptible population). In particular, a condition of epidemic spread is that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, while epidemic fade-out occurs if 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1. In epidemiological terms it is reasonable to suppose that some component of the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for CBSV in sub-Saharan Africa has changed in recent decades, and, as a consequence, the sub-threshold dynamic (i.e., where 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 outside of the confined coastal East Africa and the shores of Lake Malawi regions), has transitioned to a dynamic of super-threshold spread (i.e., 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1). It is clear that the retention, acquisition and inoculation periods, together with the density of whitefly are all critical components of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Quantifying these epidemiological parameters is therefore an important step in understanding CBSV range expansion.
