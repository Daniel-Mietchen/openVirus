<p>We describe here the typical experimental design of acquisition and inoculation assays, from which we extract a computational and a mathematical model for vector dynamics and vector transmission as well as a corresponding event-based, stochastic, simulation model. Initially we demonstrate the accuracy of our methods using simulated datasets. We finish by applying the methods to a recent CBSV dataset and provide an initial validation.</p>
