<p id="Par16">The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is located in central Africa. It is the second largest and one of the most populated countries in Africa. The DRC harbours rich fauna, flora and biodiversity which offer suitable opportunity for the emergence of numerous viral diseases. A number of mosquito-borne virus species have been documented in some regions of DRC during the last century. The first yellow fever outbreak in DRC was reported from Kongo-Central in 1912 [

During the same time, the circulation of other mosquito-borne viruses of public health importance such as DENV, ZIKV, RVFV and West Nile virus (WNV) have also been recorded [

This review attempts to summarize the available data on mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC in order to provide an insight of their geographical distribution, virus species diversity, mosquito vectors and animal reservoirs. In addition, the review explores the risks factors associated with their transmission and epidemic occurrence.
