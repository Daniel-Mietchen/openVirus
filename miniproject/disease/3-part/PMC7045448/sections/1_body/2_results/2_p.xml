<p id="Par22">These viruses were identified using different diagnostic methods ranging from serological investigation [animal inoculation, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)], morphological investigation of affected organs, tissue culture cell lines (Vero, C6/36) and molecular biological methods including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection, genome sequencing and molecular genetics analysis. The majority of sample specimens analysed were from humans; few were from animals and mosquitoes. Some studies reported co-occurrence or co-infections of mosquito-borne viruses. These included CHIKV and YFV, CHIKV and DENV, YFV and DENV [
