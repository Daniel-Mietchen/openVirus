<p id="Par32">Despite the medical and veterinary importance of mosquitoes, published reports on mosquito vectors of viruses are extremely rare in DRC. Entomological indices even during outbreaks within the regions with high mosquito-borne virus transmission risk are lacking in most cases. Moreover, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> were the most recorded in the regions where mosquito-borne virus outbreaks occurred. Yet, in certain areas, the presence of these 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species were not significantly recorded during outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The entomological investigation during the first yellow fever outbreak at Matadi failed to collect a significant number of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> at that time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Ten years later, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> predominated during the second yellow fever outbreak in Matadi and neighbouring townships [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], while in Gemena, 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were found in proportions of 90% and 10%, respectively during these outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the Bongo and Ango territories, where many mosquito-borne viruses reports are documented, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> predominated 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the four, last of the yellow fever outbreaks, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae were collected from various breeding habitats in both natural and artificial breeding sites, while most positive breeding habitats were artificial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A range of mosquitoes circulating in Kinshasa were found infected with different arboviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. O’nyong’nyong virus has been detected in 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> and unspecified flavivirus was detected in 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> has been recently established in Kinshasa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], where the most recent outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; its implication in spreading mosquito-borne viruses in DRC needs to be investigated. It is important that vector species, distribution pattern, competence and virus infection rates are established. Furthermore, studies on the genetic population and vector competence will be more helpful in improving the understanding on transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne viruses in DRC.
