  <p>Detection of ZIKV transcytosis. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Fluorescence intensity profiles of elution from a Sephadex G-25 size-exclusion column is shown. An Atto647N-ZIKV particle was purified within the fraction layer 6 to 10 from gel filtration (solid squares). No fluorescence signal was detected in Atto647N-free ZIKV (solid triangles) within the same fraction layers. The 40 nm fluorescence microspheres were used as a size marker (solid circles). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Plaque assays were performed to determine the infectivity of the Atto647N-ZIKV. Dye-free ZIKV was used as a control. Both virus samples were purified from the same fractions of the Sephadex G-25 column. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Atto647N-ZIKV was used to validate virus crossing efficiency in JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 barriers at 37 or 4 Â°C. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> FITC-dextran was used to validate the permeability of JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 barriers in 
   <bold>(C)</bold> condition. The error bars represent standard deviations from three independent experiments. **
