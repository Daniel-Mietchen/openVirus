  <p>The infectivity and virulence of ZIKV in JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The immunofluorescence images of ZIKV E protein revealed the population of ZIKV-infected cells in JEG-3 (MOI of 0.25 to 1) and hCMEC/D3 cells (MOI of 1 to 10) at 24 h post-infection. The ZIKV E protein antibody was recognized by an Alex488-secondary antibody (green). Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 20 Î¼m. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The percentage of infected cells was quantified from 
   <bold>(A)</bold>. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> JEG-3 cells were infected ZIKV at MOI of 0.5 to 1, and hCMEC/D3 cells were infected ZIKV at MOI of 5 to 10 during 24 h. The virulence of ZIKV in JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 was measured by a cell viability assay. The error bars represent standard deviations from three independent experiments. Statistical differences were obtained through 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests. **
