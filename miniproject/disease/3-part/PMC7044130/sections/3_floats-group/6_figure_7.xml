  <p>ZIKV transcytosis across JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 barriers can be reduced by endocytosis and microtubule inhibitors. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The cell viabilities of JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 with/without various inhibitors treatment were analyzed by a SRB assay. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The permeability of JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 barriers with/without various inhibitors treatment were validated by detecting FITC-dextran across cell barriers. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Atto647-ZIKV was used to validate virus crossing efficiency in JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 barriers with/without inhibitors treatment. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> A plaque assay was used to measure the virus titers across JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 barriers with/without various inhibitor treatments. All results are depicted as fold changes compared to the non-treatment control. The error bars represent standard deviations from three independent experiments. *
