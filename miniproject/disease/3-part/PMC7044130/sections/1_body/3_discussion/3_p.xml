<p>Using a SVT approach, we provided evidence to elucidate that the ZIKV can cross the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> placenta model through transcytosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Maternal-fetal transmission of a number of viruses by transcytosis in the placenta has been proposed previously (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bhat and Anderson, 2007</xref>). Given that transport of maternal IgG across the placenta is minimal during the first trimester and rises dramatically between 22 and 26 weeks of gestation (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Simister and Story, 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Palmeira et al., 2012</xref>), Matthew al. showed that DENV cross-reactive mAbs bound to the ZIKV undergo FcRn-mediated transcytosis across the placenta to productively infect human placental macrophages (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, the ZIKV crossing the placenta barrier cells was directly visualized by using Atto647N-ZIKV particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results provide strong evidence demonstrating the straight passing of viral particles across the placental barrier rather than a release of newly produced viral particles after replication. Moreover, the action of ZIKV transcytosis could be inhibited by treatments with endocytosis inhibitors and colchicine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrated that both the paracellular pathway and the transcytosis pathway are utilized by ZIKV to cross the placenta barrier (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, top panel). Further studies will be needed in order to illustrate how ZIKV particles select a pathway to cross the placenta barrier and whether they require a specific receptor for ZIKV to interact with.
