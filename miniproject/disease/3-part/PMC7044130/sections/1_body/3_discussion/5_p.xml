<p>Understanding the pathways for ZIKV passing through physiological barriers, the placental barrier and the BBB, furthers our understanding of the pathophysiology of the ZIKV and provides a basis for developing anti-ZIKV drugs in a relevant cell type. Given that the activation of the proteasome degradation pathway to disrupt tight junction protein participates in a paracellular pathway for the maternal-fetal transmission of the ZIKV by disrupting tight junction proteins (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">–4</xref>), it may lead to a new anti-ZIKV approach to maintain the integrity of tight junction and inhibit the process of viral extravasation in the placental by blocking degradation of the tight junction protein. In addition, our findings offer evidence that transcytosis may be a common strategy for the ZIKV to cross both the placental barrier and the BBB (

Therefore, further studies to reveal whether there is a specific interaction of the ZIKV with the transcytosis machine will facilitate the development of new anti-ZIKV agents.
