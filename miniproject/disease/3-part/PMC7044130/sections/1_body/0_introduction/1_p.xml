<p>The Zika virus (ZIKV), first isolated from the rhesus monkey in 1947 in Uganda (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dick et al., 1952</xref>), is a re-emerging arthropod-borne RNA virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, which also include the dengue virus (DENV), the West Nile virus (WNV), the Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) and the yellow fever virus (YFV). Until 2015, most ZIKV infections were deemed as a mild illness with some common symptoms including headache, fever, arthralgia, rash, myalgia, edema, arthritis, vomiting, and non-purulent conjunctivitis (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hoen et al., 2018</xref>). For those infants born with a normal head, congenital ZIKV infection may also cause developed postnatal-onset microcephaly, joint disorders, sensorineural hearing loss, and eye abnormalities (
