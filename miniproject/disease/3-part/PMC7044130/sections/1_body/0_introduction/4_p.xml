<p>The placental barrier and the BBB protect the fetal brain development during human pregnancy by forming cellular tight junctions to limit pathogen paracellular movement under the normal condition. However, the ZIKV could be detected in the brains of microcephalic infants, suggesting that the ZIKV can penetrate the CNS in fetus (

The Rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), the Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the West Nile virus (WNV), the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and herpes viruses are known to breach the placental barriers to reach the CNS (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Liou and Hsu, 1998</xref>). These findings indicate that viruses may cross the barrier not only through the paracellular pathway but also through transcytosis. Although the ZIKV is detected in both the amniotic fluid of pregnant women and in microcephalic fetal brain tissues (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mlakar et al., 2016</xref>), and is thus capable of penetrating the CNS from mother to fetus, the mechanism of such remains unknown. In this study, we would like to combine the
