<p>To determine cell viability in the presence of various inhibitors or drugs, a sulforhodamine beta (SRB) assay was performed. JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells were seeded on 96-well plates. After a 24-h treatment, cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4°C for 1 h. Cells were washed with water prior to incubation of 100 μl of 0.5% sulforhodamine beta in 1% acetic acid for 30 min at RT. Plates were washed four times with 1% acetic acid and air-dried. SRB was dissolved in 50 μl of 10 mM Tris solution and absorbance was measured at 510 nm using an ELISA reader.</p>
