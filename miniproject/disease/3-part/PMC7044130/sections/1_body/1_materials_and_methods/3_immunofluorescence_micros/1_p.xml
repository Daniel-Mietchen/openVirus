<p>For ZIKV infection assays, JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells were seeded on 3.5 cm dishes and incubated overnight until cells grown to 80% confluent monolayer, and cells were then infected with different MOIs of the ZIKV. After 24 h post-infection, cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The expression of the ZIKV E protein was recognized by a 1:100 diluted rabbit anti-ZIKV E antibody (GeneTex, GTX133314) and Alexa-488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Nuclear DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence images were captured by an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with a 20 × objective lens. The percentage of ZIKV-infected cells was calculated by (ZIKV E positive cells/total cells) × 100%. The average percentages in ZIKV-infected cells were collected from three independent experiments. For tight junction protein expression assays, JEG-3 cells were seeded on a 3.5 cm glass-bottom plate (Mettek) until cells grown to 100% confluent monolayer, and then incubated with/without the ZIKV. After 24 h post-infection, the cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with ZO-1 (Invitrogen) or occludin (Abcam) antibodies. Afterward, cells were recognized by the Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody, and nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence images were captured by a FluoView 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) equipped with a 60 × oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture (N.A.) of 1.4.</p>
