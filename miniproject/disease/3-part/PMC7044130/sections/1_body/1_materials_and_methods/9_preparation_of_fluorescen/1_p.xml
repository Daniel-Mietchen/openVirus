<p>The procedure of virus labeling was performed as previously described with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). ZIKV particles were pelleted from a ZIKV-containing supernatant by ultra-centrifugation at 47,000 rpm in a Beckman 50.2Ti rotor for 3.5 h. Virus pellets were resuspended in a HNE buffer (5 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and further concentrated by ultrafiltration spin columns (GE healthcare). Concentrated ZIKV particles were labeled with Atto647N-NHS ester (Sigma-Aldrich), with maximum absorption at 646 nm and maximum emission at 664 nm. Briefly, 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>pfu/ml of ZIKV were mixed with 2 nmol of Atto 647N NHS ester in an HNE buffer for 45 min at room temperature. The unincorporated dye was separated from fluorescence-labeled ZIKV particles by a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare). The fractions containing Atto647N-labeling ZIKV were detected by a multimode microplate reader (TECAN 200/200Pro) and stored at −80°C.
