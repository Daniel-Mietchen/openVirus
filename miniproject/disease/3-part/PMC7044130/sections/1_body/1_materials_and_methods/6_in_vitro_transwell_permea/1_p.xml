<p>To test whether the permeability of the physiological barrier was affected by the ZIKV, FITC-dextran was added to the media in the apical Transwell insert after the barrier cells were exposed to the ZIKV for 24 h. The cells were seeded on the membrane insert in the Transwell chamber, as previously described. Before FITC-dextran was added to the media in the apical insert, the inserts were washed twice with a pre-warmed Krebs-HEPES buffer (99 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1.0 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 19.6 mM NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, 11.2 mM glucose, 20 mM Na -HEPES, and 2.5 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) to remove the residual medium. The inserts were then placed onto companion plates containing 500 μl of Krebs-HEPES buffer. Afterward, dextran conjugated with FITC (FITC-dextran 1 mg/ml) was added to the apical insert and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The insert was removed and the solution in the plate well (lower chamber) was collected and measured for fluorescence intensity of FITC-dextran using a fluorescent plate reader (excitation 492 nm and excitation 518 nm).
