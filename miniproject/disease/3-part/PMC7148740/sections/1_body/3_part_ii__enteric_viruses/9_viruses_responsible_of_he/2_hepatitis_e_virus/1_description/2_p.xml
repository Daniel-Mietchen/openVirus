<p id="p0405">The ORF 1, long of approximately 5 kb, codes for a nonstructural polyprotein, involved in the replication of the viral genome and the manufacture of viral proteins (methyltransferase, helicase, RDRP, and protease) (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Pelosi and Clarke, 2008</xref>). The ORF 2, long of approximately 2 kb, codes for the capsid protein (which interacts in particular with the 3′ of the viral RNA for its encapsidation and contains a signal peptide of endoplasmic reticulum as well as glycosylation sites) (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Pelosi and Clarke, 2008</xref>; Yugo and Meng, 2013). The ORF 3, more small, overlaps in part the 5′ end of the ORF2 and codes for a phospoprotein whose function is still poorly known, but who could be involved in the modulation of cell signaling in associating with the capsid protein and the cytoskeleton (
