<p id="par0060">The present study shows that three tested human mAbs, designated 1.2g5, 1.10f3, and 1.6c7, are suitable to detect MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE tissue sections of experimentally infected alpacas, though to a limited extend. The best immunolabelling results for all three antibodies were achieved at the lowest dilution (1:5) with heat-induced antigen retrieval. However, results demonstrate that the suitability of the antibodies was unrelated to the function of their target epitopes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and that commercially available monoclonal and polyclonal anti-nucleocapsid antibodies generally appear more suitable to detect MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE sections in routine diagnostics. However, for certain purposes such as double or triple immunohistochemistry, human mAbs might represent a promising alternative.
