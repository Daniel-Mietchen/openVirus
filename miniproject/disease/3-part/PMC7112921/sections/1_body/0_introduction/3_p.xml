 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Reusken et al., 2016</xref>), but not in any other livestock species (
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Reusken et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, experimental inoculation of pigs, alpacas, and llamas with MERS-CoV resulted in low levels of viral replication in pigs and moderate to high levels of viral replication and shedding in the latter species, respectively (

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Vergara-Alert et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, minimal virus shedding was detected in goats, sheep, and horses after experimental infection, but only goats developed neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Adney et al., 2016b</xref>). Due to the close interactions of humans with potentially susceptible and contagious livestock species in certain parts of the world, the development of an effective vaccination strategy against MERS-CoV was proposed early after its initial discovery and was recently followed up by the development of protective antibodies by different protocols (

Widjaja and colleagues (2019) developed a set of protective neutralizing and non-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which target different epitopes of the MERS-CoV spike (MERS-S) protein. The MERS-S protein is known to represent a key target for the development of new therapeutics and consists of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2 (
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2017</xref>). The subunit S1 is, in turn, composed of four different core domains. The domain S1B binds to the host-cell receptor dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4;

 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The subunit S2 comprises the fusion peptide, two heptad repeats and a transmembrane domain, which mediate fusion of the virus with the cell membrane (
