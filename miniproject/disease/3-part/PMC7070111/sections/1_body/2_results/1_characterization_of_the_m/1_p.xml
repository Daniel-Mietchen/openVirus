<p id="Par16">Two hybridoma cells secreted antibodies against H3-subtype AIV that were isolated and screened by the HI test. After three cycles of subcloning, 1 mAb, designated 9F12, had broad-spectrum reactivity to H3-subtype AIV strains and was chosen for subsequent analyses. The mAb 9F12 reacted with the H3 isolates tested but lacked cross-reactivity with other AIV subtypes, NDV and EDSV, as assessed by the HI analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The hemagglutination of H3-subtype AIV was inhibited by hybridoma supernatants and ascites, and the inhibition test titers were 2
 <sup>6</sup>–2
 <sup>8</sup> and 2
 <sup>16</sup>–2
 <sup>18,</sup> respectively. The heavy-chain subclass of 9F12 was determined to be IgG1, and the light-chain type was K. Nine H3 isolates were randomly chosen for identification of the reactivity of the mAb 9F12 by Western blot assay, and the results suggested that the H3 mAb could react with all nine H3 isolates, which showed specific bands at 66 kDa; in contrast, the AIV-H9, NDV and mock reactions had no band (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). IFA using the mAb 9F12 as the primary antibody revealed strong green fluorescence in infected cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a); mock-infected cells were stained in parallel, but no positive signal was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The mAb 9F12 was thus used to develop a sandwich ELISA.
