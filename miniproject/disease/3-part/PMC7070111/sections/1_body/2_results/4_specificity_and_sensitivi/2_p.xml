<p id="Par20">H3-subtype AIV (HA: 2
 <sup>8</sup>) was diluted 1:10–1:10
 <sup>5</sup>, and testing revealed that the OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> value was greater than the cutoff value. When the H3 virus was diluted 1:10
 <sup>6</sup>, the OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> value fluctuated around the cutoff value. When the dilution was 1:10
 <sup>7</sup>, the OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> value was less than the cutoff value, thus the sample was reported as negative (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Each sample was assayed three times under the same conditions on different days, and the replicate analyses produced very similar results.
