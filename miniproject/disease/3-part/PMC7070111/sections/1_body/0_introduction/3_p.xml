<p id="Par4">The traditional diagnostic method for H3-subtype AIV involves viral isolation and identification. These techniques are time consuming and tedious, require biosafety facilities and exhibit some limitations in practical application. Currently, detection methods for H3-subtype AIV are urgently needed as technical reserves, and mAbs and sandwich ELISA methods based on mAbs against H3-subtype AIV have rarely been reported. mAbs have a single epitope, display high specificity and have been widely adopted for medical examination. ELISA is highly suitable for epidemiological analyses involving a large number of samples, and sandwich ELISA methods based on mAbs have been developed for other pathogens (Chen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2018</xref>). This study had two purposes. First, we sought to produce an mAb against H3-subtype AIV in hybridoma cells and characterize its reactivity. Second, we sought to develop a sandwich ELISA method based on the mAb that could be used as an effective tool for the diagnosis of H3-subtype AIV.
