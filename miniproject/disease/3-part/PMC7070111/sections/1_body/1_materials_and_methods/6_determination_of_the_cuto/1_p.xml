<p id="Par11">To determine the cutoff value for the sandwich ELISA, 60 H3-free samples, including chicken cloacal swab samples and tissue samples, were tested with the developed sandwich ELISA, and the average (X) and standard deviation (SD) of the OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> values of the 60 samples were calculated. X + 3SD was the cutoff value. A sample with an OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> greater than or equal to the cutoff value was considered positive, and a sample with a value less than the cutoff value was considered negative.
