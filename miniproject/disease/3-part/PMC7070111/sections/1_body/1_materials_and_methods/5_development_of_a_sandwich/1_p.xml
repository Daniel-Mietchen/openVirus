<p id="Par10">A sandwich ELISA for the H3-subtype AIV antigen was developed using H3-positive polyclonal serum as the coating antibody, the mAb 9F12 as the capture antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the detection antibody. The basic protocol was composed of the following steps: coating of the ELISA plate with H3 polyclonal serum, three washes with PBS with 0.05% Tween (PBST), addition of blocking buffer with 5% skim milk, incubation, three washes with PBST, addition of the antigen sample, incubation, three washes with PBST, addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, incubation, three washes with PBST, addition of 0.24 mg/mL 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine and 0.003% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (TMB) substrate, and termination of the reaction with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The working concentrations and incubation times for the polyclonal antibody, antigen, mAb, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and other components of this ELISA were optimized though the use of checkerboard titrations. The optimal conditions were determined by evaluating the optical density (OD) values at 450 nm (OD
 <sub>450nm</sub>) and the positive/negative (P/N) ratios of the samples.
