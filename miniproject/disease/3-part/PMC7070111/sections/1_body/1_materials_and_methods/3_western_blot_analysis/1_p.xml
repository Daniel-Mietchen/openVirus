<p id="Par8">To investigate the reactivity of the mAb 9F12 with H3-subtype AIV antigen, Western blot was performed according to the kit manufacturer’s instructions (ProteinSimple Wes, part# PS-T001). In brief, the reagents were first prepared, the H3 virus was diluted with HeLa Lysate Control, and 4 parts of diluted lysate were combined with 1 part of 5× Fluorescent Master Mix in a microcentrifuge tube. The mixture was then heated at 95 °C for 5 min to denature the sample. Second, the sample and reagents were pipetted into the specified plate; the mAb acted as the primary antibody, and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, USA) acted as the secondary antibody. Finally, Western blot was completed with a fully automated instrument (ProteinSimple Wes, ProteinSimple Corp. 2014).</p>
