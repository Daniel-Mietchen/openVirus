<p id="Par24">BALB/c mice were inoculated with an inactive local epidemic strain of H3-subtype AIV, and hybridoma cells that could steadily secrete a high titer of antibody specific for H3-subtype AIV was obtained through a series of cell fusion screening, HI testing and subcloning steps. The mAb obtained from the resulting hybridoma cells had good specificity and sensitivity. The successful production of this mAb raised three key points. (1) For immunized mice, a higher antibody titer is associated with a higher success rate. If the antibody titer is low, the levels of corresponding specific antibodies in spleen cells are reduced, leading to a lack of a specific and high-titer mAb in the process of cell fusion. (2) PEG was used for cell fusion and was added within 1–2 min. In addition, attention was paid to the formation of particles. Once particles appear, the remaining PEG must be quickly added. The time of PEG addition must be controlled to avoid excessive fusion. (3) Myeloma cell activity must be ensured because cell morphology is not fully intact, and poor refraction will affect cell fusion, resulting in cell death. In this study, the preparation of the mAb laid a foundation for the establishment of a sandwich ELISA for the detection of H3-subtype AIV.</p>
