<p id="Par22">H3-subtype AIV is a major subtype threatening both human and animal health. It is important to enhance surveillance for H3-subtype AIV, and a simple, rapid, specific, sensitive and effective detection method suitable for mass detection is urgently needed. Some molecular methods for the detection of H3-subtype AIV have been developed. Thus far, several reports have described the diagnosis of H3-subtype AIV using RT-LAMP, real-time RT-PCR and multiplex RT-PCR (Peng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; Tang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>; Teng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>). However, serological detection methods for H3-subtype AIV have rarely been reported. Routine monitoring of H3-subtype AIV frequently involves large numbers of samples; notably, the developed ELISA method, which is performed with a 96-well plate, can be used to simultaneously analyze 94 samples in addition to the positive and negative control samples.
