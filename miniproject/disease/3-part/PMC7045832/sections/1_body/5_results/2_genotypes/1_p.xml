<p>We obtained genotype information for 470 (84.5%) of the 556 outbreaks. Of the 86 (15.5%) outbreaks with no genotyping results, 72 were not further genotyped by network laboratories and 14 were positive by rRT-PCR but negative by conventional RT-PCR and thus could not be genotyped. Of the typed outbreaks, 430 (91.5%) were GII, 26 (5.5%) were GI, and 14 (2.5%) comprised both GI- and GII-positive samples. Overall, 5 GI genotypes and 12 GII genotypes were detected (

Among GII outbreaks, 349 (74.3%) were typed as GII.2[P16], which was detected throughout the study period and peaked during winter 2016–17 (

 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table). Genotypes detected in &lt;1% of the outbreaks were GI.1[P1], GI.3[P13], GI.3[P13], GI.5[P12], and GI.6[P11] among GI viruses and GII.1[P33], GII.2[P2], GII.8[P8], GII.13[P21], GII.14[P7], GIX.1[P15], and GII.17[P31] among GII viruses. In the GII.2[P16] epidemic during winter 2016–17, GI viruses were rarely detected (1 [0.3%] of 298), whereas during the following seasons (2017–2018), GI viruses were detected in 24 (13.9%) of 172 outbreaks and peaked in March 2018 (10 [40.0%] of 25). Outbreaks caused by multiple genotypes were mainly detected in March 2018 (9 [64.3%] of 14); GII.17[P17] viruses were mainly detected during January–April 2018 (9 [64.3%] of 14); and GII.6[P7] viruses were detected primarily in the 2017–18 winter season (13 [81.3%] of 16).
