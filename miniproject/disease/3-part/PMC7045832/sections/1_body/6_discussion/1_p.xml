<p>CaliciNet China was launched in October 2016 for the surveillance of norovirus outbreaks in China. By using more sensitive inclusion criteria for reporting acute gastroenteritis outbreaks than PHEESS, CaliciNet China captured more norovirus outbreaks, especially in the catchment area where the network laboratories are located. In addition, the participating laboratories implemented standardized genotyping protocols, which enabled comparison across jurisdictions of norovirus sequences, including emerging strains. The sequence data are accessible only within CaliciNet China.</p>
