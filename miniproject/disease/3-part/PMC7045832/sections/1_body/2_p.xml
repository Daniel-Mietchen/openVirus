 </xref>), have been developed during the past decade. NoroNet captures molecular and epidemiologic data on norovirus outbreaks and sporadic cases submitted by 19 participating countries across Europe and Asia and by Australia. CaliciNet is a norovirus outbreak surveillance network in the United States in which state and local public health laboratories electronically submit laboratory data, including sequences from norovirus outbreaks, to a central database (

CaliciNet data are integrated with epidemiologic data from the National Outbreak Reporting System, yielding comprehensive surveillance in the United States that enables multifactorial characterization of norovirus outbreaks (
