<p>Noroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>. The genome is organized into 3 open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 encodes polyprotein, ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein (VP1), and ORF3 encodes the minor (VP2) capsid protein. The viruses are classified into at least 7 genogroups (G), of which viruses from GI, GII, and GIV infect humans (

 </xref>). On the basis of the diversity of VP1, these genogroups can be further divided into at least 33 genotypes: 9 GI, 22 GII, and 2 GIV (
