  <p>The list of conserved CD8 epitopes in CHIKV that was identified 
   <italic>in silico</italic> by others and published in the literature were arranged according to the positions they occupy along the CHIKV proteome. The immunogenicity scores are determined through the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and plotted as shown. Of all the CD8 epitopes, only the three epitopes in the 6K region are experimentally validated.
