<p>Activated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have been well-documented to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of CHIKV-induced joint swelling (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Our laboratory has comprehensively proven this through multiple methods. Mice depleted of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells do not develop joint pathology when challenged with CHIKV. Concordantly, the use of fingolimod, which blocks lymphocytes from exiting the lymphoid organs, also reduces joint pathology in CHIKV infected mice. In addition, TCR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, which lack T cells, do not develop joint swelling when challenged (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Independently, another group showed that the administration of antibodies against CTLA-4, which binds to CTLA-4 receptors found on the cell surface of activated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, caused elimination of the latter and thereby reduced joint swelling in CHIKV-infected mice (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Currently, there is no mouse model that develops the chronic arthralgia and arthritis as seen in chronic patients. Thus, it remains to be seen if the activated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are also responsible for the chronic phase of CHIKV infection.
