<p>Pathogenic CHIKV-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in CHIKV mouse models express T-bet and secrete IFN-γ, markers that are associated with Th1 phenotype (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). These findings concur with another study, which shows higher levels of Th1-associated cytokines in the sera of CHIKV-infected patients (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Although this drives IFN-γ production during infection, the antiviral effects of IFN-γ are unable to block CHIKV replication in virus-infected cells due to CHIKV interference with downstream JAK-STAT signaling (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). These CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, together with CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, is detected in the joints of patients during the chronic phase of CHIKV infection (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Two CHIKV CD4
 <sup>+</sup> epitopes have been identified in mouse models thus far, with the cognate CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells expressing IFN-γ during CHIKV infection (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Despite CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells being a cause of the pathogenic swelling accompanying CHIKV infection, they are also crucial in orchestrating the formation of CHIKV-specific antibody response. Dominant CHIKV-specific antibodies are of the isotype IgG2c (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and their production was severely impaired when CD4 T cells were absent (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
