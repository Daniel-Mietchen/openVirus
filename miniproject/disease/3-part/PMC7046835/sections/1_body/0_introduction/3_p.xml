<p>Host innate and adaptive immunity have multifaceted roles in CHIKV infection. While innate immunity in response to CHIKV infection has been well-studied (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), the functions of adaptive components, such as T cells and their myriad associated roles remain less defined. Recent studies have started to show that CHIKV-specific T cells and antibody response play significant roles in antiviral immunity, immunomodulation and pathology in CHIKV infection (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). A better comprehension of the roles each T cell subset play during CHIKV infection may aid in understanding how to control disease progression and immune-mediated pathology. This review illustrates the significance of T cells in the protection and immunopathogenesis of acute and chronic arthritogenic disease. We also provide alternative perspectives on the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of T cells against CHIKV.
