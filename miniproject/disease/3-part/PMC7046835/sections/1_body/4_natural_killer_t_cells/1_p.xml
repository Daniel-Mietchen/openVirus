<p>The impact of natural killer T (NKT) cells in CHIKV infection is less well-understood. In patients, acute CHIKV infection resulted in an increase of NKT cells in the blood (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). These NKT cells were found to upregulate the expression of IFN-γ, but not perforin. Although PBMCs from acute samples induced cytotoxicity in K562 cells during co-culture, it remains unclear if NKT cells account for the majority of the cytotoxicity effect (
