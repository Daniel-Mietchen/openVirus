<p>In the event where CHIKV penetrates the skin barrier and infect the surrounding cells during blood feeding by mosquitoes, CHIKV-specific skin resident memory T cells can recognize virus-infected cells quickly. This identification leads to rapid coordination of the anti-CHIKV immune responses and leads to the elimination of virus-infected cells before the disease is established (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Moreover, CHIKV exposure should further boost pre-existing anti-CHIKV immune response and lead to the accumulation of more CHIKV-specific skin resident memory T cells (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). Over time, repeated exposure of CHIKV should lead to further CHIKV-specific skin TRM accumulation all over the skin, with no establishment of CHIKV pathology.
