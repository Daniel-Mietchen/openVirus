<p id="p0470">The 3′ UTRs of the four DENV genomes contain highly conserved RNA elements (
 <xref rid="bib283" ref-type="bibr">Shurtleff et al., 2001</xref>). However, the length of this region is different for the four serotypes. In the case of DENV-1 the 3′ UTR is ~470 nucleotides long, 450 nucleotides for DENV-2, 430 nucleotides for DENV-3, and the shortest is for DENV-4 with 385 nucleotides 3′ UTR can be divided in three domains (
 <xref rid="bib254" ref-type="bibr">Proutski et al., 1997</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib257" ref-type="bibr">Rauscher et al., 1997</xref>). Domain I is located immediately after the stop codon of NS5 and is considered the most variable region within the viral 3′ UTRs. Domain II is of moderate conservation, comprising several hairpin motifs, including a characteristic dumbbell structure in DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, and a turret structure proposed in DENV-4 (

 <xref rid="bib284" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2008</xref>). Domain III is the most conserved region of the 3′ UTR, bearing a conserved sequence (CS1) followed by the terminal stem loop structure (3′ SL). CS1 contains the cyclization sequence 3′ CS involved in long-range RNA–RNA interactions (
