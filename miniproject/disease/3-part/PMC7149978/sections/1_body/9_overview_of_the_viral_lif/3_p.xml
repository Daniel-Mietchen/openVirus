<p id="p0425">After the nucleocapsid is delivered into the cytoplasm, uncoating of the genome, which involves dissociation of the capsid protein from the RNA, takes place by an unknown process. The positive-sense viral RNA is released in the cytoplasm to function as mRNA. Translation of the single ORF at the RER produces a large polyprotein, which displays a complex topology on the ER membrane. The viral polyprotein is cleaved co- and posttranslationally into at least 10 mature proteins. The N-terminus of the polyprotein encodes three structural proteins (capsid, prM, and E), and the rest of the ORF encodes the seven NS proteins (
 <italic>NS1–NS2A–NS2B–NS3–NS4A–NS4B–NS5</italic>). Polyprotein maturation is carried out by host and viral proteases. The host signal peptidase at the ER lumen is responsible for the N-terminus cleavage of prM, E, NS1, and NS4B, whereas the processing of most of the other NS proteins, as well as the C-terminus of the capsid protein, is carried out by the viral protease NS2B3 in the cytoplasm of infected cells (
