<p id="p0390">Within the dengue serocomplex of currently described serotypes 1â€“4, the E protein consists of conserved and variable regions, with up to 37% amino acid divergence (
 <xref rid="bib149" ref-type="bibr">Heinz and Stiasny, 2012</xref>). The presence of conserved regions accounts for the brief (in the order of months) cross-protection between serotypes (
 <xref rid="bib268" ref-type="bibr">Sabin, 1952</xref>) and the diminishing and/or weakly neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies that contribute to severe disease in dengue through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection (

 <xref rid="bib215" ref-type="bibr">Mady et al., 1991</xref>). In the end, the degree of variability in the E protein and resulting serological distinctiveness among dengue serotypes means there is no cross-protection for second, third, or fourth infections, although clinical illness is mild in third and fourth infections (
