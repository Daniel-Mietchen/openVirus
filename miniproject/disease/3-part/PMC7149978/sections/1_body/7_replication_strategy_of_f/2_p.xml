<p id="p0375">Flaviviruses are defined by their antigenic relatedness, among other things, and all exhibit various degrees of cross-reactivity profiles in serological tests (
 <xref rid="bib219" ref-type="bibr">Mansfield et al., 2011</xref>). Flaviviruses were first grouped together as Group B arboviruses based on cross-species hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and later divided into eight serocomplexes comprised of 49 viruses on the basis of cross-neutralization tests (
