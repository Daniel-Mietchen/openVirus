<p id="p0380">Phylogenetic structure across the highly ecologically diverse flaviviruses based on the entire coding region reflects the antigenic groups as well as host and/or vector associations. Three main clades emerge from the flaviviruses recognized by the ICTV the MBFV, the tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV), and those restricted to vertebrate hosts or with no known vector (NKV). The most divergent taxon represented in the phylogeny of the flaviviruses is another candidate flavivirus, Tamana bat virus (
