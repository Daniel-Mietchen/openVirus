<p id="p0335">Traditional dengue control strategies focus on reducing mosquito abundance, reducing adult mosquitoes life span, and preventing mosquito–human contact through: (1) source reduction (locating and destruction of mosquito breeding sites); (2) use of larvicides to control juvenile mosquitoes (life stages that occur in water); and (3) use of ultravolume aerosolized adulticides to control adult mosquitoes (

This strategy involves social mobilization, environmental management, epidemiological and entomological surveillance, and chemical and biological control (
