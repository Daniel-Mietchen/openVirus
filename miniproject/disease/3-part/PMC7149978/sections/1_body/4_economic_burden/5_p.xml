<p id="p0325">Unfortunately, there are only a few studies that estimate the economic and disease burden of dengue by region. There are areas of uncertainty in measuring the economic loss associated with dengue. First, estimating the total episodes of dengue is difficult due to paucity of data. Second, there is some evidence suggesting that the rate of underreporting varies by the severity of dengue, with better reporting for more severe cases of dengue (

 <xref rid="bib297" ref-type="bibr">Suaya et al., 2009</xref>). But dengue leads to substantial reduction in the patients’ quality of life during and after the febrile period. Last, there is considerable uncertainty in the burden of dengue in large parts of the world, including the Western Pacific, South Asia, and Africa. While there have been several reports of dengue outbreaks occurring in these regions, many countries do not have surveillance systems to monitor and report dengue episodes, or lack accurate identification methods. Another area of uncertainty includes population’s health-seeking behavior and the multiplicity of sites for treatment with privately treated patients having modest rate of reporting and near nil reporting from patients seeking alternate method of treatment such as pharmacy or traditional medicine (
