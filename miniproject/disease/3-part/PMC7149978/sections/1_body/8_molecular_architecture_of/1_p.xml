<p id="p0400">In recent years a great deal of research on DENV biology has provided an enormous amount of information about molecular aspects of its replication. Studies on molecular virology of viruses have been made possible by the use of full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) clones, genomic RNA with reporter genes and replicons. Full-length cDNA clones of four serotypes of dengue have been constructed and is being used to study their molecular biology (

These infectious clones have been used to genetically manipulate different regions of the viral RNA to define functions of viral proteins and RNA structures, to study virus–cell interactions, and to generate live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Another important advance has been the development of genomic and subgenomic DENV RNAs containing reporter genes, such as luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) (

Also reporter-containing viruses have been employed to study viral functions and host–virus interactions during viral entry, viral translation, RNA synthesis, and formation of infectious viral particles. Replicons are yet another useful tool to evaluate translation and viral RNA amplification, which can be followed by measuring reporter activity as a function of time after RNA transfection.
