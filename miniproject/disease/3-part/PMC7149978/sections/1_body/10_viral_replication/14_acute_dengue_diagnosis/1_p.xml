<p id="p0830">Diagnosis during the acute phase of illness allows early case diagnosis, which may be important for case management. Clinical samples should be collected as early as possible and preferably in the first 3 days of fever onset. Tools available for early diagnosis include molecular diagnosis such as reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) and real-time RT/PCR (allowing confirmation of the infection and serotype identification) as well as NS1 detection. This acute sample is also useful for virus isolation.</p>
