<p id="p1065">So with the failure of these control measures vector control agencies need new affordable, efficacious tools that are safe for people and the environment. Ideally, these tools should be scalable from small villages to large cities, and be socially acceptable and economically and politically sustainable. Furthermore, they should be compatible with current and developing control tools, including vaccines, antiviral drugs, and new insecticides. Genetic-based strategies targeting the vector mosquitoes have the potential to fill these needs and are poised to contribute to future vector control efforts (
