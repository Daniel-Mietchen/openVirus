<p id="p1070">Genetic strategies are based on the widely accepted theory that disruption of the vector phase of the pathogen life cycle will reduce or eliminate transmission to humans. Disruption can be achieved by eliminating or reducing mosquito densities below transmission thresholds or by making the mosquitoes refractory to virus infection. Novel strategies are being developed based on genetically engineered strains of mosquitoes with design features that maximize utility and safety profiles (
