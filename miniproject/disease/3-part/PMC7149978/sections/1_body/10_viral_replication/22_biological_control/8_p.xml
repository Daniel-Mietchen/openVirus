<p id="p1080">Engineered strains are species-specific, and because 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> are invasive species throughout most regions in the world and are preyed upon opportunistically, deployment of these strategies is anticipated to have a negligible impact on ecosystems. Adopting any of these strategies will require site-specific risk assessment prior to release, and monitoring and surveillance during and following releases. Successful genetic strategies will have to be affordable to have a meaningful impact on dengue transmission (
