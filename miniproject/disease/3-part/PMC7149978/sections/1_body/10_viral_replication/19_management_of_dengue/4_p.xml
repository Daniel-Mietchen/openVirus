<p id="p0935">In case of antipyretics, only paracetamol is recommended to reduce the height of fever, both in children and in adults. Aspirin and NSAID are contraindicated. An antiemetic may be given if the patients have nausea/vomiting. Other supportive and symptomatic medicines may be given according to the clinical signs and symptoms, for example, anticonvulsants, H2-blocker, or proton pump inhibitors.
