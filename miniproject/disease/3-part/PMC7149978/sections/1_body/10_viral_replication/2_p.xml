<p id="p0490">Viral RNA replication begins with the synthesis of a negative-strand RNA, which then serves as a template for the synthesis of additional positive strands. This process occurs in close association with cellular membranes (likely VPs) in the so-called viral RCs. The enzymatic reaction is catalyzed by the RdRp activity of NS5, together with NS3, other viral NS proteins, and presumably host factors. RNA synthesis is semiconservative and asymmetric, leading to 10-fold excess of positive over negative strands (

Three species of viral RNA can be metabolically labeled: (1) a ribonuclease-resistant double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) called replicative form; (2) a form partially resistant to ribonucleases, likely composed by RNAs with complementary nascent elongating strands, known as replicative intermediates; and (3) the genomic RNA that is fully sensitive to ribonucleases.
