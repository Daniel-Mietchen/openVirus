<p id="p0750">The most common method of monitoring leakage relies on identification of relative hemoconcentration. Unfortunately, the method is rather insensitive, particularly if the patient is receiving parenteral fluid therapy, and suffers from the serious limitation that an individualâ€™s baseline value is rarely known, so that final assessment of hemoconcentration may not be possible until the acute illness has resolved. Narrowing of the pulse pressure indicates that plasma volume depletion has reached a critical point and implies that decompensated shock will soon follow. If fluid resuscitation is not instituted promptly as soon as the pulse pressure narrows, the ongoing depletion of plasma rapidly becomes critical, the systolic pressure falls and irreversible shock and death may follow despite aggressive resuscitation. Profound or prolonged shock is often complicated by tissue hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Also liver failure, renal failure, and encephalopathy are seen in association with profound shock.</p>
