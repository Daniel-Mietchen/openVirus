A faint macular or maculopapular rash is present in some cases. Generalized mild enlargement of the lymph nodes is common. The liver is often palpable, soft, and a little tender, although rarely markedly enlarged and jaundice is unusual. Splenomegaly is occasionally observed in small infants. Mild hemorrhagic manifestations such as skin petechia and/or bruising at venepuncture sites are sometimes noted. Mucosal bleeding, from the nose, gums, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts, does sometimes occur.</p>
