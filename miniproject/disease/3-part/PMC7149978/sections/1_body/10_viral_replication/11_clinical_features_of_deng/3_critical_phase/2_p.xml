<p id="p0745">A major increase in vascular permeability resulting in severe plasma leakage will typically result in cardiovascular collapse within hours. Pleural effusions, ascites, and overt signs of cardiovascular decompensation will become apparent in the end. DSS is estimated to be developed in &lt;10% of cases (
 <xref rid="bib309" ref-type="bibr">Trung et al., 2012</xref>). Ultrasound studies indicate that pleural effusions, ascites, and gall bladder wall edema are commonly present during the critical phase and correlate with disease severity. Hypoproteinemia is well recognized during the critical phase and correlates with the severity of leakage (
