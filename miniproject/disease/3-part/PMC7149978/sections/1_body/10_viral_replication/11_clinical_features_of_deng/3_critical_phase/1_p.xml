<p id="p0740">Critical phase onset occurs from around days 3–6 of illness, lasting for 48–72 hours. A number of systemic problems may develop during this phase of the illness. The most feared complication is an unexplained “vasculopathy,” whereby an increase in vascular permeability results in a capillary leakage syndrome. Profound plasma losses leading to potentially fatal hypovolemic shock occur in a small proportion of cases. The altered capillary permeability is often accompanied by hemorrhagic manifestations and hematological abnormalities. No specific event defines the timing of onset of this phase, but vascular leakage often becomes apparent from around days 3–4 of illness, with shock (if it occurs) typically developing within 24 hours of defervescence.</p>
