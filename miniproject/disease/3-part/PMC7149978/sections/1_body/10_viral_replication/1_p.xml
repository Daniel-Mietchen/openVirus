These structures were originally described as CM, paracrystalline arrays, and VPs. Most current studies support the ER origin of the VPs and CMs induced during DENV infection. CMs have been proposed as putative sites for flavivirus polyprotein processing. Role of CMs as storage site for proteins and lipids involved in viral replication has been proposed. Intermediate forms of RNA replication and most of the NS viral proteins have been observed inside VPs by electron microscopy (EM) and confirmed by biochemical analysis (
