<p id="p0680">T cells recognize short antigenic peptides bound in the peptide binding groove of MHC I or MHC class II (MHC II) molecules. The peptides bound by these molecules are normally short fragments derived from the degradation of normal cellular proteins. However, during infection they can acquire and present peptides from a replicating pathogen. In general, MHC I molecules bind peptides derived from proteins expressed intracellularly such as a virus replicating in its host cell and present these to cytotoxic CD8 T cells. MHC II molecules on the other hand present peptides derived from endocytosed antigens to CD4 T cells.</p>
