<p id="p0650">Following a secondary infection, the rise of IgM is much less marked than following primary infection and can be absent; instead, IgG levels rise more rapidly and to a higher peak. This difference forms the basis of tests to distinguish primary from secondary dengue infections; a primary infection is inferred if the IgM:IgG ratio is &gt;1.8 and conversely a secondary infection is inferred if the ratio is &lt;1.8 (
