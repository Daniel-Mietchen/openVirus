 <italic>NS3</italic> protein (69 kDa) has various enzymatic activities essential for replication of viral genomic RNA: viral polyprotein proteolytic processing via its serine protease N-terminal domain, RNA helicase, nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase), and RNA nucleoside 5′ triphosphatase (RTPase) via its C-terminal domain. To be catalytically active, the N-terminal domain of NS3 must associate with a hydrophilic domain of the membrane-associated NS2B protein that acts as a cofactor. NS3 represents an important target for the development of specific antiviral inhibitors (

Besides the N-terminal two-component serine protease domain necessary for polyprotein processing, it contains three different enzymatic activities in the C-terminal domain: NTPase, RNA triphosphatase (RTPase), and RNA helicase (

Other possible functions include unwinding dsRNA intermediates that arise during RNA amplification, destabilizing secondary structures of the RNA to increase polymerase processivity, participating in RNA recruitment at specific subcellular locations, acting as RNPases stripping proteins from the viral RNA, and remodeling RNA structures that may function as modulators of the viral processes. NS4B with NS3 was found to induce NS3 dissociation from ssRNA and promote dsRNA unwinding activity (
