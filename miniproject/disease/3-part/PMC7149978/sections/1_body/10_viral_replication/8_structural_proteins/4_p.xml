 <italic>prM</italic> protein is present at the newly synthesized immature virus surface, while its furin protease-cleaved derivative, the M protein, is present on the mature infectious virus. The prM protein consists of a 91-residue N-terminal pr molecule followed by a 38-residue M ectodomain and a 35-residue TM region. The primary role of the pr molecule is to cap the fusion loop of the E protein, thus preventing the newly synthesized virus from fusing back into the cell, when moving through the acidic compartments of the trans-Golgi network. On the other hand, the function of the M protein remains largely unknown. The pr peptide consists of mainly antiparallel Î² strands. It caps the fusion loop of the E protein, which is consistent with its proposed function in preventing virus from fusing back into the cell during exocytosis (
