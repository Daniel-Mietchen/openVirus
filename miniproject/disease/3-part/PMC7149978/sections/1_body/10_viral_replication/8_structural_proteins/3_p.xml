<p id="p0570">The mechanism of fusion of E protein leads to internalization of DENV has been proposed by (
 <xref rid="bib229" ref-type="bibr">Modis et al., 2004</xref>) and involves domain II and domain III in the following manner. In the low pH environment of the endosome, the domain II of the E protein flips up, exposing its fusion loop, thereby leading to the insertion of the fusion loop into the endosomal membrane. The membrane may then catalyze trimerization, causing the formation of a prefusion intermediate. Trimerization then spreads from the fusion tip of E protein downward to domain I at the base of the trimer. Domain III then rotates and shifts, displacing the trimers, which in turn cause the endosomal and viral membrane to fuse. The fusion of membranes may require concerted twisting of a few trimeric E proteins.
