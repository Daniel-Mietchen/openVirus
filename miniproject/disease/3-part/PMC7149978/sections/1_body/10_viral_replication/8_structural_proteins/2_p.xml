 <italic>E protein</italic> is the major antigenic structure on DENV. It is involved in both host cell receptor recognition and fusion of the virus to the endosomal membrane during cell entry (
 <xref rid="bib261" ref-type="bibr">Rey et al., 1995</xref>). The E protein is thought to exist as dimers and when exposed to low pH, which mimics the condition in the endosome, the E protein rearranges to form trimers (

It is organized into three domains: the central domain I, the dimerization domain II, and the IgC-like domain III. Each dimer is assembled from two monomers arranged in a head-to-tail format. The tip of domain II contains the fusion loop, which interacts with the endosomal membrane during the fusion event (
