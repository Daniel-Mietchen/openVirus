<p id="p0605">The four DENV serotypes all have the ability to cause severe and fatal disease in humans, although DENV-2 and DENV-3 are more often associated with severe disease. Some serotypes are less symptomatic as a primary infection, while others are often symptomatic and can even lead to severe disease during primary infection (

In addition, viral strains within each serotype may differ from one another in their ability to both infect and cause symptomatic disease in either na√Øve or DENV-immune individuals (primary or secondary infection). Specific sequence of infection by heterologous serotypes may be important in determining disease outcome (
