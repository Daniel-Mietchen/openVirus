<p id="p0600">Halstead et al. have demonstrated that isolates from cases of severe dengue disease grew better in human monocytic cells than isolates from mild symptomatic illness. Also increased virulence of Asian DENV-2 in human infections has been linked to its enhanced replication in vitro. Mutations at certain position might increase or decrease their virulence based on the site of mutagenesis. In addition to mutations that may alter the replicative ability of DENV viruses in human cells, some viruses may also be less sensitive to elimination by the host immune system, including reduced neutralization by the host humoral (antibody-mediated) response.</p>
