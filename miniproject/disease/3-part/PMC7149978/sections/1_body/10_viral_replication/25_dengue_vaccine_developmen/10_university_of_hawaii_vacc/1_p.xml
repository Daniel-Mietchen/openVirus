<p id="p1200">United States Armed Forces Epidemiology Board initiated a cooperative scientific effort to develop vaccines against the four DENV. Workers at the Department of Tropical Medicine and Medical Microbiology of the University of Hawaii Medical School anticipated this effort by screening tissue culture-passaged wild-type DENV-1, -2, and -4 and mouse-passaged DENV-3 in cell systems that had been used to propagate viral vaccines licensed for use in the United States. These included WI-38 continuous human embryo lung, primary chick and duck embryo fibroblasts, primary rabbit kidney cells, primary dog (PDK) kidney cells and primary African green monkey kidney cells. Serial passage of different wild-type DENV (2 DENV-1, 2 DENV-2, and 3 DENV-4) resulted in phenotypic changes. These phenotypic changes were used successfully to identify human dengue vaccine candidates at Mahidol University and when this vaccine was introduced to human trials, all human volunteers at Thailand developed classical DF, and this result led to the abandonment of further development of the Mahidol LAV (
