<p id="p1220">The University of North Carolina has developed a vaccine in which DENV E protein is produced by a Venezuelan encephalitis virus replicon (VRP). A gene cassette encoding envelope proteins (E proteins) prM and E from mouse-adapted DENV-2 strain NGC was cloned into a VRP that programmed proper in vitro expression and processing of DENV-2 E proteins on infection of Vero cells. Immunization in BALB/c mice resulted in high levels of DENV-specific serum IgG and significant levels of neutralizing antibodies (
