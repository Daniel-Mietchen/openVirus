<p id="p0505">Upon entry, the viral genome is directly used as messenger for protein synthesis associated with the RER. The mature viral proteins reorganize cellular membranes to generate structures known as VPs, which will contain the RCs. After sufficient viral proteins are synthesized, translation stops, and the RNA is transported to the VPs by an unknown mechanism. It is possible that accumulated viral proteins or host factors induced by these proteins coordinate the switch from translation to RNA synthesis. Inside the VPs, the viral proteins NS4A, NS4B, and likely NS2A bind to the internal side of the membrane, while NS1 stays in the outer side (corresponding to the ER lumen). The viral polymerase NS5 and NS3 must be transported inside the VPs, presumably bound to the viral RNA. RNA transport could be mediated by NS proteins and possibly host factors. For RNA synthesis, NS5 specifically interacts with the SLA promoter at the 5′ end of the genome. Base pairings between the ends of the RNA and cyclization of the genome allows relocation of NS5 to the 3′ end of the molecule to initiate RNA synthesis. Hybridization between CSs 5′–3′ UAR opens the bottom half of the highly structured 3′ SL allowing initiation of negative-strand synthesis. NS5 synthesizes a dinucleotide CU de novo, which serves as the primer for RNA elongation. It has been proposed that the negative-strand RNA remains bound to the positive strand in a dsRNA form. The negative strand then serves as a template for positive-strand amplification. Multiple copies of positive-strand RNA are made from the negative strand, leading to an excess of positive versus negative strands.</p>
