<p id="p1035">Insecticides such as DDT were effective against 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> with a 24-hour LC50 for larvae as low as 0.002 ppm. An example of initial success followed by failure is the remarkable success that was obtained in Americas from 1948 to 1952 by “perifocal” treatments: a 3%–5% suspension of DDT applied to the inside and outside of potential breeding sites. By 1952, the species could no longer be found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, British Guiana, Chile, nearly all of Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and the Central American countries, and in 1962, it was declared fully eradicated from 22 countries in the Americas and in 1972 from all Mediterranean countries. Hopes for permanent eradication began to fade, however, with the rapid appearance of resistance to DDT and other organochlorine insecticides.
