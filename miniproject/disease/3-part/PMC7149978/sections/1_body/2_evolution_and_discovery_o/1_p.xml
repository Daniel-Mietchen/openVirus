<p id="p0175">All four DENV original serotypes have similar natural histories, including an enzootic cycle involving nonhuman primates and canopy-dwelling mosquitoes in Asia, and an urban cycle involving humans as the primary vertebrate host and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes of the subgenus 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> as the primary mosquito vectors globally in the topics. Some authors speculated an African origin and subsequent distribution around the world with the slave trade (
