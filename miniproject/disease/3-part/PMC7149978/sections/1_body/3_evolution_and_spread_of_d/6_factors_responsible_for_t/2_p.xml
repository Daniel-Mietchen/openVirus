<p id="p0260">The failure to control the mosquito vectors of dengue unfortunately coincided with a period of dramatic urban growth, globalization, and changing lifestyles. Contributing to the problem were water storage practices in the cities where water supplies were unreliable, the use of nonbiodegradable containers for packaging consumer goods, and the rapidly growing automobile industry. Water storage containers such as plastics and used automobile and truck tyres provided ideal oviposition sites and larval habitats for

Most mosquito control efforts since the early 1970s were directed toward adult mosquitoes using expensive methods that were ineffective, while changing lifestyles were providing increasingly more larval habitats. The result was large mosquito populations and crowded human populations living in intimate contact with each other and increased dengue transmission. Urban growth has been dramatic since the early 1960s, driven primarily by economic expansion, the cities of tropical developing countries exploded, with millions of susceptible people migrating from rural areas (
