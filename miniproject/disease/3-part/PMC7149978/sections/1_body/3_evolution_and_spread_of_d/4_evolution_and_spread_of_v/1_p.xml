<p id="p0225">At some point in the past 2000â€“4000 years, DENVs moved out of the Asian jungle and into rural villages, where they were, and still are, transmitted to humans by peridomestic mosquitoes such as 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>. Migration of people and commerce ultimately moved the viruses into larger villages, towns, and cities of tropical Asia, where the viruses were most likely transmitted sporadically by 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> and possibly other closely related peridomestic 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> species (

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, into the New World, most likely during the 17th century. This species became highly adapted to humans and the urban environment, and was ultimately spread throughout the tropics by the shipping industry. The species most likely first infested port cities and then moved inland as urbanization expanded (
