<p id="p0250">With documentation that YF was transmitted by mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="bib259" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 1900</xref>), many early workers suspected that DF was also a mosquito-borne disease. It was the first documentation that mosquitoes could transmit DF (
 <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">Graham, 1903</xref>). This work was followed, which showed conclusively that 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> could transmit the disease to volunteers following a 10-day incubation period after the mosquitoes had fed on a person acutely ill with DF.
