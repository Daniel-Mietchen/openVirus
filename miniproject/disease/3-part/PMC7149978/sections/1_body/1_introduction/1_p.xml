<p id="p0170">Dengue viruses (DENVs) form dengue complex in genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, family Flaviviridae, and consists of four antigenically related but distinct DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). These DENV can cause a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic dengue infection to dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) to dengue shock syndrome (DSS). It is estimated that close to 3.6 billion are at risk with 390 million infections of which 96 million are symptomatic. Among the 96 million symptomatic cases, 2 million end in severe form of infections, that is, DHF and DSS, and around 21,000 fatal cases occur annually around the world. Most of these infections occur in the developing and underdeveloped countries where the surveillance network for infectious diseases are not robust which means there is a possibility of gross underreporting of dengue. In this chapter we will discuss the evolution of virus and its vector, epidemiology of dengue, molecular and genomic structure of DENV, their pathogenesis, immune response of the host to the infection, laboratory diagnosis, management, and recent developments in dengue drug and vaccine development.
