<p id="Par7">In order to define the structure and distribution of the breakpoints across the alignment, we plotted a line graph of the relative frequency of the breakpoints. The K-means univariate-clustering algorithm as implemented in the ‘Ckmeans.1d.dp’ R package was used to define hotspots for recombination
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. The gap statistic method implemented in the ‘factoextra’ R-package was employed to estimate the groups based on similarity in breakpoint positions obtained from the Simplot analysis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. The recombination hotspot positions were then used to identify groups of three or more URFs with one or more similar breakpoint positions. Finally, to determine potential new CRFs, we performed a ML phylogenetic analysis using Garli (GTR nucleotide substitution model) to assess the epidemiological relatedness among the sequences
