<p id="Par28">In contrast to subtype G and CRF43_02G, where only one of the respective introductions resulted in major subepidemics, three large Nigerian subepidemics were found for CRF02_AG. The underlying mechanisms for this strain-specific difference are unknown. However, the CRF02_AG strain is the most prevalent strain in West Africa, and a previous study of the West Central African CRF02_AG epidemic estimated that this strain originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1973 (95%HPD: 1972–1975)

 <italic>et al</italic>. that estimated the CRF02_AG date of origin to 1976 (95%HPD: 1971–1981)

 <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that seven subvariants of CRF02_AG are circulating (as determined by a combination of phylogenetics and geographic dissemination)

 </sup>. The seven subvariants of CRF02_AG were estimated to have originated between 1967 and 2003 (combined 95%HPD: 1961–2005). More specifically, the analysis indicated that the oldest strain was the West African CRF02_AG strain (introduced 1967 [95%HPD: 1961–1974]). The three CRF02_AG clusters identified in the current study were estimated to have originated between 1963 and 1970 (combined 95%HPD: 1948–1980). Although the 95%HPD intervals are overlapping with the estimates suggesting the origin to be the DRC, they are on the lower side. Moreover, the CRF02_AG strain was first isolated in Nigeria in 1996
