<p id="Par17">Of the 328 identified URFs, 209 constituted variations of the three dominating circulating strains in Nigeria (CRF02_AG, CRF43_02G, and subtype G; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The remaining 119 URFs consisted of different combinations of various HIV-1 strains less common in Nigeria. We therefore performed a detailed recombination analysis on the 209 URFs consisting of CRF02_AG, CRF43_02G, and subtype G. One-hundred of the 209 URF sequences (48%) were from Abuja; 45 from Lagos (22%); 35 from Jos (17%); 10 from Maiduguri (5%); 9 from Kaduna (4%); seven from Ibadan (3%); and two from Adamawa (1%); and one from Enugu (&lt;1%). These sequences were initially selected from the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees if they branched off close to the root between two subtypes and had long branches. There were 655 breakpoint positions recorded among the 209 sequences, with some sequences having more than one breakpoint. These positions were plotted as a frequency plot of breakpoints along the alignment to identify hotspots for recombination (i.e. positions in the alignment were recombination breakpoints occur more frequently than the other positions, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Alignment positions around 285–315 (HXB2 K03455 positions: 2538–2568), 503–534 (2756–2787), 720–775 (2973–3028) and 923–956 (3176–3209) were identified as potential recombination hotspots. To define these positions more precisely, we used the inter-quartile range (IQR) of the optimal univariate K-median clustering algorithm with the number of clusters determined by the gap-statistic method (Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>: Recombination hotspot I: 294–312 (HXB2 K03455 positions: 2547–2565); II: 503–533 (2756–2786); III: 729–805 (2982–3058); and IV: 931–957 (3184–3210) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Of the 209 sequences, 139 (67%) had a recombination breakpoint in the hotspot I region; 104 (50%) in hotspot II region; 58 (28%) in hotspot III region; and 59 (28%) in hotspot IV region. The hotspot positions were unique independent recombination events from the original breakpoint positions as previously identified for the parental sequences of CRF43_02G (HXB2 K03455 positions: 1266, 3325, and 6097) and CRF02_AG (HXB2 K03455 positions: 2391, 3275, and 4175). We identified 37 URFs that could be divided into seven groups sharing breakpoint positions (each group consisting of 3–10 sequences, respectively, and thereby fulfilling the requirements as potentially novel CRFs; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The majority of these sequences had been collected in Abuja (23/37, 62%).
