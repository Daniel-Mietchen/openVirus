<p id="Par20">To assess the impact of sampling bias in our phylogeographic inference, we conducted a control analysis of the effects of potential over-representations of samples from particular regions in Nigeria (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Sequences were randomly selected based on population growth over time and HIV-1 prevalence in the different geographic regions. Information on the Nigerian population growth over time was obtained from the National Population Commission of Nigeria/National Bureau of Statistics for the population census, and information on HIV-1 prevalence was obtained from National Agency for the Control of AIDS

 </sup>. In these analyses, the median tMRCA of the Nigerian subtype G cluster was estimated to 1987 (95%HPD: 1982–1992); and the CRF02_AG clusters to 1974 (95%HPD: 1960–1983), 1972 (95%HPD: 1973–1981), 1961 (95%HPD: 1952–1979) for cluster 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Despite numerous attempts, the CRF43_02G control analysis did not reach sufficient temporal signal to converge.
