<p id="Par21">The analysis of the Nigerian subtype G epidemic showed that the number of effective infections, a proxy of HIV incidence, underwent a fast exponential growth between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, followed by a marginal decrease with minor fluctuations from the mid-1990s and onwards (Fig.

 </sup>. Using the exponential growth model, the median growth rate was 0.3 per year (95%HPD: 0.18–0.42). The three clusters representing the CRF02_AG epidemic displayed a similar pattern with a slow increase in growth rate from the 1980s to 2000s. The median CRF02_AG growth rates were estimated to 0.22 per year (95%HPD: 0.13–0.32) for cluster 1; 0.18 per year (95%HPD: 0.10–0.26) for cluster 2; and 0.24 (95%HPD: 0.11–0.38) for cluster 3 (Fig.

The CRF43_02G cluster had low temporal signal that could not inform the complex non-parametric coalescent model and thus only an exponential model was used to capture the demographic dynamics (Fig.
