<p id="Par3">Nigeria is the most populous country in Sub-Saharan Africa, has the second highest number of HIV-1 infected persons in the world, and the highest number of annual AIDS-related deaths

 </sup>. In addition, the CRF43_02G was recently shown to be highly prevalent in the capital Abuja

 </sup>. However, the estimates of each strain’s contribution to the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic have varied considerably, with frequency estimates ranging from 22–50% for subtype G, and 19–60% for the CRF02_AG
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. These variations could have several reasons, such as differences between geographic areas, transmission groups, or employed subtyping tools

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, a clearer picture of the HIV-1 subtype/CRF distributions and spread in Nigeria is needed. The objective of the current study was therefore to perform the first nationwide analysis of the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Nigeria.
