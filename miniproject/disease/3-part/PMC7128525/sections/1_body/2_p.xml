<p id="para30">Viruses and other microbes are phenomenally successful. They are the oldest form of life on Earth and together comprise 60% of the Earth's living matter. Most are beneficial or cause no great harm to humans and their livestock, but some are a formidable and constant challenge to humanity. In their June 2019 consensus statement,

 </xref> leading microbiologists reviewed the implications of climate change for microorganisms and what is known about microbial effects on climate change. They issued a stark warning about the consequences of inadequate microbial research, arguing that our knowledge about viruses and other microbes is surprisingly and dangerously scant. Since 2009, the US Agency for International Development has supported the PREDICT project in 35 countries and US research institutions to provide proof of concept that collecting samples from host species can lead to important scientific findings.

 </xref> The Prince Mahidol Awards Conference in 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand, highlighted the importance of the topic: “Global trends indicate that new microbial threats will continue to emerge at an accelerating rate, driven by our growing population, expanded travel and trade networks, and human encroachment into wildlife habitat. Most emerging viruses are zoonotic, that is, transferred between vertebrates and humans…Estimations show that there are more than 1·5 million mammalian and waterfowl viruses, spanning across 25 viral families. Compared with the more than 260 viruses known in humans, the unknown viruses represent 99·9% of potential zoonoses. These viruses usually remain undetected until they cause disease in humans.”
