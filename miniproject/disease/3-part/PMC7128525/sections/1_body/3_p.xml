<p id="para40">Much like map-making for newly-discovered continents, the Global Virome Project would be a pathway to improve capacity to detect, diagnose, and discover viruses that potentially pose threats to human populations, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Between 631 000 and 827 000 unknown viruses might be zoonotic and thus have the potential to infect humans after spillover from host animal populations. The big idea is to gradually build a global atlas of most of the planet's naturally occurring potentially zoonotic viruses by systematically creating the missing maps. Broadening the knowledge base on viral sequences, geographical ranges, and host distributions would provide vital intelligence about humanity's formidable microbial enemy. The three specific benefits that the project would provide are early warning of future threats, data to improve prevention and reduction of these threats, and inputs for advance preparation of responses for unexpected outbreaks of unknown diseases.</p>
