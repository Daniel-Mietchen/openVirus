<p>Heart disease associated with arboviruses has no specific treatment and may be a self-limited condition. Thus, quick supportive therapy to prevent further cardiac function loss and cardiogenic shock is still the most recommended management.

 </sup> There is also evidence that IV hydrocortisone may be helpful to accomplish full recovery in DENV myocarditis

 </sup> but there is yet no consensus about whether this drug should be used in this setting or if it has a real impact on recovery and mortality rates, even more in cases of combined arbovirus infection. Although arbovirus myocarditis is an acute condition, most patients persist chronically with cardiac disease, such as chronic heart failure and ECG T-wave changes.

 </sup> The role of coinfection in the severity of arbovirus cardiac manifestations is not currently known, but studies regarding other symptoms showed that it might contribute to a more severe disease.

 </sup> It is also noteworthy that the herein described myocarditis may have been caused solely by the CHIKV, since the NS1 protein test yielded a negative result. It is also important to note that the DENV IgM may be positive from 139 up to 179 days, respectively for secondary and primary infections.
