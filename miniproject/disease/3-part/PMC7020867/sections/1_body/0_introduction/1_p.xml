<p>Dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are arboviruses that cause ongoing epidemics in several countries of Latin America. DENV belongs to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family and CHIKV is an alphavirus of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family. Both viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (mainly 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>) and during the acute phase they may cause similar nonspecific febrile syndromes that can progress to severe or debilitating conditions.
