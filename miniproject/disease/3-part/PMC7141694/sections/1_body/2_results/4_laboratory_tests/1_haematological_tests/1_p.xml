<p>Average haematocrit and haemoglobin levels were within normal range for both DENV and CHIKV patients though 34.1% of DENV patients exhibited elevated haematocrit p &lt;0.001 (as compared to 20% of CHIKV patients). For DENV, thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count &lt;150,000/mm3). was a significant predictor of disease with 74.1% of patients exhibiting this phenomenon (p &lt;0.001) as compared to 18% of CHIKV patients; almost 150 platelets less than CHIKV (

While both DENV and CHIKV infected patients exhibited, on average, elevated leucocyte counts, 87% of DENV infected patients presented with atypical lymphocytes and were 3 times more likely to present with this sign than patients infected with CHIKV (

Altered red blood cell (RBC) morphology was also a significant finding and was reported almost twice as frequently in CHIKV infected patients than DENV infected patients, with 36.7% of CHIKV patients showing elevate levels of misshaped RBCs compared to only 20% of DENV patients (
