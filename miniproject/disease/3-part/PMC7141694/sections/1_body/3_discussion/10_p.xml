<p>For laboratory diagnostics, the Dengue Early Rapid NS-1 test was the most effective for DENV detection as most cases of DENV infection were detected using this assay. Many of these patients were also positive by RT-PCR. Most NS-1 negative cases in our study were also negative by RT-PCR, validating the clinical utility of the NS-1 assay. While factors such as specimen shipping and delayed preservation could be possible reasons for the false negative RT-PCR cases in our study population, our findings agree with Ahmed et al who found that the overall performance of DENV RT-PCR to be no better than NS-1 antigen detection [
