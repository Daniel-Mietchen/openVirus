<p>In this study, we analysed subset of data of an active surveillance study for patients with acute febrile illness and/or suspected DENV infection in 5 cities of Sindh province in Pakistan. This study aimed firstly to ascertain the presence of CHIKV as etiologic agent of NDFI in Sindh province, and secondly, to compare clinical features of laboratory confirmed CHIKV cases with DENV infection to identify clinical features and laboratory findings that may help differentiate CHIKV from DENV infection at the time of clinical presentation.</p>
