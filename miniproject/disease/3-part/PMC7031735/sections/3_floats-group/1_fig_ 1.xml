  <p>Effect of ginseng on respiratory tract infection. (A) Environmental and seasonal fluctuations influenced by rapid urbanization and drastic increase in air pollution increase the incidence rate and severity of respiratory tract infections causing respiratory outbreaks by microbial pathogens in host models. (B) Upon entry, contagious pathogens cause a decline in the immune status and triggers cytokines production and produce stress in the microenvironment, leading to increasing viral load and oxidative stress levels. (C) Thereby assisting bacterial and viral infections to break down the tissue defence barriers causing epithelial and cellular changes residing inside host cell known to contribute to eosinophil recruitment to the lung, mucosal damage, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. (D) Ginseng is believed to interrupt through multiple mechanism. (E) Activation of B cell causes production of antibody by triggering Th2 response to enhance systemic and mucosal specific antibody titer response serum hemagglutinin inhibition titer response, lymphocyte proliferative response. (F) In addition to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, ginseng also improved cell-mediated immunity associated with tissue repair and healing and thus used to alleviate the symptoms and reduce the incidence rate and frequency of respiratory tract infections.</p>
