<p id="p0130">Although a plethora of articles demonstrate that ginseng is devoid of adverse events and is well tolerated and effective as a seasonal prophylaxis for preventing respiratory infections and reducing their duration irrespective of age, it is still necessary to evaluate and understand its molecular mechanisms. Studies should focus on the application of various molecular biology techniques, including pathway analysis and proteomics techniques, to identify the primary cellular targets that trigger the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects characteristic of ginseng that are responsible for the alleviation of the symptoms of RTIs. This would definitely help in determining factors that may result in adverse events due to frequent or prolonged ingestion of standardized ginseng extracts.</p>
