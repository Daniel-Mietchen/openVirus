 <italic>P. quinquefolius</italic> exert an antibacterial activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against all 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains, including the O1 strain, as they attenuate pyocyanin, pyoverdine, swarming and swimming motility, lipase concentrations, and stimulated twitching. In addition, 
 <italic>P. quinquefolius</italic> extracts also successfully eliminated 6-day-old mature biofilms (5% w/v), and fluorescence microscopy indicated a reduction of live cells and biofilm complexes in treated biofilms compared with nontreated biofilms [
