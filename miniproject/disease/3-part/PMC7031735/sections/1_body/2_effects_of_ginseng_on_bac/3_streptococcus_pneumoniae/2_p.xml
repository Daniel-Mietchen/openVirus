 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a gram-positive facultative anaerobic bacterium causing pneumococcal diseases, particularly pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, with a high mortality rate in children (≤5 years) [
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Mice pretreated with Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed significantly increased survival rates and alleviated bacterial burden in the blood, lungs, and spleen at 24 and 48 h after infection and, thus, diminished inflammatory response in the lungs, compared with the control group. Moreover, KRG administration (100 mg/kg) prevented pneumococcal sepsis by inhibiting the production of cytokines, including IL-1β and TNF-α, neutrophil infiltration, and nitric oxide production 48 h after infection
