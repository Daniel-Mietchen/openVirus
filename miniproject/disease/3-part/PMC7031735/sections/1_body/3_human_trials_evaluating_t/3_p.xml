<p id="p0100">Ginseng efficacy in the treatment of common cold, flu, and upper and lower RTIs has been investigated in several randomized controlled clinical trials with varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. These trials have shown ginseng effects on severity, duration, and frequency of overall symptoms with a positive trend for preventing the development of respiratory infections, as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. KRGE at a dose of 9 capsules per day for a period of 3 months in 100 patients effectively suppressed the incidence of influenza-like illness against placebo-treated group [

The efficacy of COLD-fX in preventing acute respiratory illness (ARI) was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded trial comprising 43 adults (≥65 years) taking 2 capsules/day (200 mg/capsule) of either COLD-fX or placebo for a period of 4 months after one month of influenza vaccine. Evidence indicates that COLD-fX significantly increased lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and nitric oxide) from peritoneal macrophages
