<p id="p0105">To assess the safety and efficacy margins in relation to preventing common colds, a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing American and Korean ginseng root extracts in healthy adults was conducted. This study conducted by Seida JK

 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] in 747 patients showed that preventative ingestion of ginseng extracts for 8–16 weeks, significantly reduced the incidence and duration of common colds by 6.2 days when compared with the placebo control. McElhaney JE 
 <italic>et al</italic>, [
 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] proposed that oral administration (2 times/day) of COLD-fX, 200 mg as a prophylactic treatment could reduce the incidence rate of acute respiratory illness (ARI) during the influenza season. Data obtained for laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV infections showed that COLD-fX was safe and effective in preventing ARI symptoms. Ingestion of 2 capsules/day of COLD-fX–rich extract for 4 months in 323 patients between 18–65 years of age reduced the relative risk, duration, and the mean number of colds per person [
