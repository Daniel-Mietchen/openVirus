<p id="p0045">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative nonsegmented single-stranded RNA virus [
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], belonging to the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. It is the primary cause of lower RTIs [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], generally exhibiting acute and indistinct symptoms, including bronchiolitis, common cold, and pneumonia, in infants and immunocompromised patients

 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. During primary RSV infection, alveolar macrophages and lung epithelia in the respiratory tract are likely to be infected [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], ultimately leading to higher expression of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α); chemokines, including CCL5, CXCL10, IL-8, and IFN-inducible protein 10; growth-regulated proteins; and reactive oxygen species in different 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>], resulting in type 1 and 2 cytokine imbalance [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. KRGE orally administered to mice (25 mg/kg/day) in conjunction with formalin-inactivated RSV showed beneficial effects and improved outcomes, including a 2-fold increase in IgG2a antibodies as well as IFN-γ production accompanied by lower levels of IL-4 mitigating weight loss, after RSV infection

 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In addition, ginseng-treated groups also lowered pulmonary inflammatory responses and CD3 T-cell infiltration into the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell populations [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. RGE has been shown to mitigate Th2 responses by improving the Th1 response in formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus immunized mice, which have an intrinsic Th2-dominant immune response

 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It has been suggested that excess type 2 and/or deficient type 1 immune responses play a critical role in the pathogenesis of RSV infection [
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. RGE, at a concentration of 500 μg/mL, suppressed the production of RSV-induced TNF-α in murine dendritic and macrophage-like cell lines, thereby protecting human epithelial cells from RSV-induced apoptosis and viral replication. In addition, RGE treatment increased the population of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD11c
 <sup>+</sup> dendritic cells in BAL fluids after RSV infection in mice [
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Oral administration of KRGE in mice significantly inhibited the expression of RSV-induced genes (IL-6 and IL-8) and, subsequently, lowered viral titers and reduced reactive oxygen species production, thereby improving the survival of human lung epithelial A549 cells upon RSV infection [
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of RGE might be linked to the inhibition of RSV-induced apoptosis [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].
