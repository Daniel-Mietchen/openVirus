<p>Pluripotent stem cell-based in vitro models grow increasingly complex. Moreover, the current technological advancements in the research on early human embryogenesis offer great possibilities for the understanding of diseases and for finding new therapies. Organoid cultures and engineered tissue cultures might reach a complexity that is comparable to the one found in tissues and organs of the adult human body. As a technical advance in the field, three-dimensional bioprintings of human alveolar cells were infected with the seasonal influenza virus to mimic the clustered infection pattern that is also observed in the lung of human beings [

Accordingly, the advancement of our research questions requires ethical adjustments, legal regulations, and definitions in the context of scientific use and clinical application, such as transplantations. This applies especially to the generation of embryo-like structures that need to respect legal limitations and ethical constraints including the 14-day rule [
