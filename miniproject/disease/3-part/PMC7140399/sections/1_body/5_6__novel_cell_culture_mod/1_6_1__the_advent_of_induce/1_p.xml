<p>While the mouse model in general has provided valuable information for human development and, more specifically as outlined above, on congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS) and the associated pathology, it faces important restrictions. The interspecies differences between human and animal development and the awareness of the three Rs (3Rs) principle for animal research (Replace, Reduce, Refine) ask for alternative research approaches. On the one hand, humans and mice share a hemochorial placenta, 99% of their genes, and most of their protein-coding genes [

 <xref rid="B78-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. On the other hand, just to name a few differences, brain and eye development in humans are more complex than in mice [

 <xref rid="B80-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Correspondingly, some mutations and knock-outs of genes in mice resemble the phenotype observed in humans, and others do not [

The knock-out of the pluripotency transcription factor octamer binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) in human embryos by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology prevented their development to the blastocyst stage, whereas mouse embryos were stopped at a later stage [
 <xref rid="B81-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. These arguments emphasize the need for alternative ways to study human development. The closest view we probably could get on the earliest stages of human development was made possible through research achievements published recently by two groups; the groups of Zernicka-Goetz and of Ali Brivanlou, on the in vitro cultivation of human embryos donated by women after conducting in vitro fertilization programs [

 <xref rid="B83-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. They reported on in vitro cultivation of human blastocysts for an extended period of time in agreement with the ethical constraints posed by the so-called 14-day rule. Some European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands allow research on human embryos until day 14 of human development, including the use of ESCs. As an additional resource for conducting research on human development, sectioned human embryonic or fetal tissue samples are available through tissue banks, such as the Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR) in the UK [
 <xref rid="B79-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. However, the embryonic and fetal tissues provided by HDBR are restricted to 3 to 20 weeks of development (

Moreover, for technical and ethical reasons, the use of embryos and the samples provided by these tissue banks is fairly limited. Nevertheless, they could be used to verify findings on pluripotent stem cells (embryonal and induced). ESCs and iPSCs are especially a cell culture platform with unprecedented possibilities to address human development. Thus, a highly promising approach based on pluripotent stem cells is, not only moving into the focus of developmental biology, but also of congenital virology.
