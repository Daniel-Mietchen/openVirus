<p>Several studies were conducted on the impact of virus infections on mouse as well as on human pluripotent stem cells. Here, we want to focus on the findings related to the impact of HCMV, ZIKV, and RV on human development. Early reports on embryonal carcinoma cells suggested that HCMV permissiveness could change during the transition of the undifferentiated (pluripotent) to the differentiated state [
 <xref rid="B95-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The susceptibility of these cells was very low and possibly restricted to cells undergoing spontaneous differentiation. Upon treatment with retinoic acid, not only differentiation was induced, but susceptibility to HCMV also increased [
 <xref rid="B95-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. This block in replication, which appeared to occur at steps following entry, was also reflected through later studies on the assessment of the suitability of different promoter types for transgene expression in pluripotent stem cells [
 <xref rid="B95-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. This did not only support the use of the elongation factor-1 alpha promoter for genetic engineering of human ESC and iPSCs [
 <xref rid="B97-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], but also the notion on the relevance of such differences in epigenetic regulation between pluripotent stem cells and somatic cells for replication of HCMV. For MCMV, as a relative of HCMV, non-permissiveness of mouse ESCs was demonstrated, in addition to a lack of activity of the MCMV IE promoter in ESCs derived from MCMV immediate-early (IE) promoter-lacZ transgenic mice [
 <xref rid="B100-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Moreover, IE promoter activity and correlatively permissiveness were dependent on the state of differentiation, and especially present in glial differentiated cells [
 <xref rid="B100-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. As a follow-up, two studies on the effect of pluripotency on permissiveness to HCMV were published in 2012 and 2014 [
 <xref rid="B101-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,
 <xref rid="B102-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Both studies highlighted the nonpermissiveness of iPSCs to HCMV, whereas NPCs were susceptible and fully permissive. Furthermore, the study by Belzile et al. identified different restrictions in ESC-derived primitive prerosette neural progenitor cells (pNPC), including one at the level of IE gene expression [
 <xref rid="B101-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This block was associated with the presence of the neuronal developmental marker FORSE-1 and was partially lost after pre-treatment of pNPCs with retinoic acid and further differentiation into NPCs. Despite this inhibition in replication, viral genomes persisted in pNPCs [
 <xref rid="B101-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Due to their similarity to cells in the developing neural tube, they are suggestive of the presence of a cellular harbor at a very primitive neuronal developmental stage for virus persistence along further neuronal differentiation stages [
 <xref rid="B101-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This notion of a gradual release of viral restriction blocks along neuronal differentiation was corroborated by the transition to an increased susceptibility to HCMV during neural differentiation of ESCs into neural spheres [
 <xref rid="B103-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Susceptibility to HCMV appeared to be correlated to expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRÎ±) [
 <xref rid="B103-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Brown et al. showed correspondingly a lack of permissiveness of iPSCs to HCMV, but also identified iPSCs to be susceptible to HCMV infection through positive staining for the input tegument proteins [
 <xref rid="B104-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Brown et al. utilized such observations for the generation of cerebral organoids through differentiation of infected iPSCs to avoid experimental challenges for infection based on the compact three-dimensional structure of the organoid [
 <xref rid="B104-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. These cerebral organoids are promising as a model for congenital HCMV infection and its impact on the early stages of neuronal development. The following findings are correlated to the scattered distribution of viral antigen-positive cells in cortical sections of clinical tissue samples and the cortical lesions found in those samples; besides signs of necrosis and the presence of vacuoles and cysts in cortical structures, HCMV infection affected the patterning of postmitotic, differentiated neurons and reduced the number of true cortical structures [
 <xref rid="B104-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Thus, this reflects a promising approach to identify cellular mechanisms contributing to the severe effects of congenital HCMV infection on neuronal development [
