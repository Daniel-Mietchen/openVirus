<p id="p0190">Events like flooding can increase the risk of vector-borne, viral respiratory, gastrointestinal and soft tissue diseases. Some of the problems are resulted from direct contact with pathogenic organisms (wound infection, tetanus, pneumonia). Overcrowded survival shelters results to infections like measles, meningitis, tuberculosis and influenza. Absence of clean water supplies leads to intestinal complications (shigellosis, cholera). Buried dead bodies are potential reservoirs for dangerous diseases (anthrax). Also increasing stagnate water results to increasing the number of mosquitoes and vector- borne diseases (malaria, leishmaniasis). These problems can affect hundreds of lives in destructed areas and need critical attention in order to limit the consequences. In this review we discussed some aspects of devastating flood. Such natural disasters can pose long lasting effects on public health and will have more consequences in future which may not be predictable. More attentions are needed to protect forests and herbaceous coverage all around the world in order to prevent such disasters.</p>
