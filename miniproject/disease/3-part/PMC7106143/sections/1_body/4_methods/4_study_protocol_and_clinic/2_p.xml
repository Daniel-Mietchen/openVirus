<p id="p0050">Information regarding laboratory tests, antibiotic or antiviral therapy administration, duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment, length of intensive care unit stays, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality was obtained from electronic health records. We compared the outcome and duration of intravenous antibiotic use with a historical cohort with similar baseline characteristics and clinical presentations. The clinical impact was measured via the proportion of stopping or de-escalating antibiotics, neuraminidase inhibitor uses in the ED, duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment, length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stays, 30-day mortality, and overall all-cause mortality.</p>
