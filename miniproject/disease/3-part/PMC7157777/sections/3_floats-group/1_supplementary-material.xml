  <italic>In vivo</italic> characterization of protective efficacy of JE-CVax vaccination against lethal YFV-17D and ZIKV-MR766 challenge in AG129 mice. (A) AG129 mice (
  <italic>n</italic> = 5) were vaccinated i.p. with 10
  <sup>3</sup> to 10
  <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax (blue) and at 28 dpv challenged i.p. with 10
  <sup>3</sup> PFU of YFV-17D. (B) AG129 mice (
  <italic>n</italic> = 6) were first vaccinated i.p. with 10
  <sup>4</sup> PFU JE-CVax and at 28 dpv challenged i.p. with 10
  <sup>3</sup> PFU of YFV-17D (blue). At 28 days post-YFV-17D challenge, animals were challenged a second time with 10
  <sup>4</sup> PFU of ZIKV-MR766 and observed for mortality for the following 5 weeks. Age-matched nonvaccinated (red) animals were challenged with 10
  <sup>3</sup> PFU of YFV-17D (
  <italic>n </italic>= 5 [A]) or 10
  <sup>4</sup> PFU of ZIKA-MR766 (
  <italic>n </italic>= 7 [B]) as a control. Log rank (Mantel-Cox) survival analysis test was performed for statistical significance. **, 
  <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01 compared to the nonvaccinated group. Download
