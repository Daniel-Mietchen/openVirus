   <italic>In vivo</italic> evaluation of JE-CVax-mediated dual protection against lethal JEV SA14-14-2 and YFV-17D challenge. (A to D) AG129 and C57BL/6 mice were first vaccinated via the i.p. route with either 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax (blue), 1/6th of a human dose of Ixiaro (green), or assay medium as a negative control (red). Animals vaccinated with Ixiaro were boosted with another 1/6th of a human dose of Ixiaro 14 dpv. In order to facilitate vaccine virus replication (
   <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), wild-type C57BL/6 mice receiving JE-CVax vaccination were treated with MAR1-5A3 antibody. AG129 mice were i.p. challenged with 10
   <sup>3</sup> of PFU JEV SA14-14-2 at 28 dpv (A) or with 10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU of YFV-17D at 28 dpv (B) or at 0, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 dpv (C). C57BL/6 mice were i.c. challenged with 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of YFV-17D at 28 dpv (D). Animals were observed for 5 weeks after challenge and were euthanized when humane endpoints were reached. The data represent cumulative results of at least two independent experiments. Log rank (Mantel-Cox) survival analysis test was performed for statistical significance. **, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01; ****,
