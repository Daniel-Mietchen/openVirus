<p>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes and their binding affinities toward respective MHC class I molecules are different in different species. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of YFV-17D NS proteins was performed to compare the probable CTL epitopes and their binding efficiencies, using an algorithm that takes peptide processing, presentation, and MHC-peptide complex stability into account. Data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS10">Fig.Â S10</xref> indicate that as a predictor of immunogenicity, peptides of YFV-17D NS proteins have higher binding affinity to human MHC than to mouse MHC.
