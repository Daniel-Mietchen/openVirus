<p>To assess whether also cellular immune response against YFV may contribute to the protective activity, enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] and/or gamma interferon [IFN-γ]) and intracellular staining of cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) were performed on total splenocytes obtained from AG129 mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) and C57BL/6 mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) 18 and 4 weeks after JE-CVax immunization, respectively. Unlike the case with splenocytes of nonvaccinated mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig. S6E</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">H</xref>), robust and specific IFN-γ and/or TNF-α production was observed from splenocytes of either mouse strain vaccinated with JE-CVax (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>) after recall with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted peptide derived from YFV-17D NS3 or YFV-17D total cellular antigen. In line, flow cytometric analysis revealed robust and YFV-specific intracellular cytokine production in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from spleens of JE-CVax-vaccinated AG129 and C57BL/6 mice when stimulated 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> with the YFV NS3 peptide or YFV-17D total cellular antigen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">S6</xref>). Overall, JE-CVax vaccination induced specific long-lasting T cell responses against YFV, and cellular immunity against YFV was more vigorous than that elicited against JEV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">S6</xref>). This observation is consistent with YFV NS proteins serving as more immunogenic T cell antigens than prM/E of JEV (
