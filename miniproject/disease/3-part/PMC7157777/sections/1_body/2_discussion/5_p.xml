<p>To assess the efficacy of JE-CVax, we employed mice as the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model and the YFV-17D vaccine strain (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) as the challenge virus. This experimental setup implies some constraints. Generally, mice are not susceptible to human flavivirus infection (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) and the YFV-17D is not virulent in humans (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To overcome these limitations, we made use of two established, complementary and stringent mouse infection models that are accepted surrogates for testing of flavivirus vaccines (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); (i) immunocompromised mice (AG129 mice [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) that develop fatal neurotropic infection when challenged peripherally with YFV-17D, in particular when inoculated with a highly lethal (1,000 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) challenge virus dose (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig. S7</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and (ii) immunocompetent wt mice (C57BL/6 [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] that can be challenged i.c. with YFV-17D. YFV-17D was originally developed by adapting a viscerotropic clinical isolate (YFV-Asibi) to replication in mouse brains (“fixed to mouse brain”) (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). This vaccine virus can hence be considered a genuine mouse-adapted neurotropic and neurovirulent YFV strain. For this reason, it could also be considered in this study as the challenge virus. Besides experimental convenience (YFV-17D does not require biosafety level 3 [BSL3] containment), YFV-17D is a widely accepted, i.e., best-characterized and hence most widely used, challenge strain in mouse models. Classical i.c. inoculation of YFV-17D consistently causes fatal disease in mice (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) that cannot be distinguished from that induced by wt-YFV strains (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Also, because JE-CVax expresses the prM/E protein of JEV, which belongs to a serocomplex other than YFV, vaccination and subsequent challenge with YFV-17D compares to a certain extent to a heterotypic flavivirus vaccination challenge (as described by others [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]), however, with a markedly more pronounced vaccine efficacy. Therefore, in conclusion, similar mechanisms should hold when using wild-type YFV as the challenge virus (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Obviously, before proceeding to clinical use, this principle should be confirmed in JE-Cvax-vaccinated nonhuman primates, demonstrating protection from subsequent challenge with virulent wt YFV strains.
