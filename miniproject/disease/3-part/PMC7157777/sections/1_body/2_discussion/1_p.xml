<p>Neutralizing antibodies against the E protein are generally considered a primary correlate of protection against flaviviruses (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, some preclinical studies suggested that several NS proteins when used as immunogens for vaccination alone or in combination could induce some degree of protection against viral challenge in mice and nonhuman primates (

For instance, a recombinant vaccinia virus or replication-deficient adenoviral vectors expressing YFV-17D NS1, NS2a, and NS2b together or NS3 alone, respectively, resulted in some partial protective immunity against a lethal challenge of YFV-17D in mice (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, full survival could never be achieved and reached maximally 60 to 80%, versus 100% for YFV-17D-vaccinated controls. Similarly, 80% protection against challenge with the African YFV strain Dakar 1279 was observed in monkeys following repeated immunization with purified NS1 as the sole vaccine antigen, and protection correlated with the levels of non-nAbs against NS1 (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Conversely, vaccination of mice with E protein alone (or in combination with NS1 or NS3) resulted in complete protection (
