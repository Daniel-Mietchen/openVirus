<p>To conclude, we demonstrate that JE-CVax efficiently and rapidly induces high cross-protective efficacy (âˆ¼100%) in mice against YFV challenge, even with an exceedingly aggressive challenge inoculum. The study provides evidence that c-LAV flavivirus vaccines may be developed solely based on NS proteins. Moreover, immunization with a chimeric flavivirus, whereby the prM/E genes of the backbone have been replaced by that of yet another flavivirus, may have a dual protective effect. A vaccine such as Imojev/JE-CVax may thus be suitable for off-label use, namely, for protection against YFV, which in this case is not mediated by nAbs.</p>
