<p>Live attenuated JE SA14-14-2 and inactivated Vero cell vaccine account for the biggest use by volume, while Imojev is licensed and used in only a few Asian countries. It is evident from the literature that Imojev remains safe and immunogenic in individuals with a known history of JE vaccination (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). However, further studies are required to address whether Imojev will also induce protective immunity against YFV in those that have already been vaccinated with one of the other JE vaccines. In any case, formal demonstration of vaccine efficacy in humans will be challenging considering that YFV-specific nAbs that are established as a correlate of protection for YFV-17D are absent (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and hence protection against lethal infection may instead need to be shown in nonhuman primate vaccine challenge models. Previous safety and immunogenicity studies of chimeric live attenuated viruses (JE-CVax and ChimeriVax-DEN2) in humans indicated that preexisting immunity to the parental YFV-17D vaccine virus does not interfere with immunization but rather induces long-lasting cross-neutralizing antibody responses (

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Importantly, if our data on the dual protection conferred by c-LAV in mice could be translated to other species, including humans, this would imply that the JE vaccine JE-CVax (and likewise Imojev) may provide dual protection, i.e., against both JEV and YFV. A dual protective effect may be of particular relevance in case YFV may one day—as is suspected (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)—cause outbreaks in (sub)tropical Asia. Given the capacity problems with the production of the current YFV vaccine, having another licensed vaccine (i.e., JE-CVax/Imojev) available as an alternative means to protect against YFV may at such time help to contain an outbreak. In addition, those already vaccinated with JE-CVax may be expected to be protected against YFV. A similar principle may apply to other chimeric flavivirus vaccines that consist of a YFV-17D backbone (such as CYD-TDV/Dengvaxia) (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and others under development (such as our recently proposed chimeric YFV-17D/ZIKV vaccine candidate) (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Likewise, c-LAVs could be generated against DENV and other viruses that may cause ADE using the backbone of the parent virus (e.g., DENV) from which the prM/E genes have been replaced by that of antigenically more distantly related viruses or serotypes, in line with experimental evidence that the DENV NS1 protein can also serve as a protective antigen (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Such an approach may avoid potentially harmful nAb responses. The same principle may apply to c-LAV for ZIKV using a ZIKV backbone (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) and prM/E sequences of another flavivirus that has not been shown to cause ADE.
