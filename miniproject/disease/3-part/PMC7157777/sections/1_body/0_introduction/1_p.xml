<p>Several flaviviruses, such as the yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus, are important human pathogens. Flaviviruses are spread worldwide, though some species show a pronounced restriction to defined regions of endemicity, such as YFV to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Latin America and JEV to Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific. Certain flaviviruses, such as DENV, WNV, and, most recently, ZIKV, are (re-)emerging in new areas (
