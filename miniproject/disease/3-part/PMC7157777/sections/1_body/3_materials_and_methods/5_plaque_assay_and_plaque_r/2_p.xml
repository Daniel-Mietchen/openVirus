<p>Throughout the study, all the virus neutralization assays, i.e., PRNT and CPE-based virus neutralization testing (CPENT), were performed with YFV-17D and JE-CVax. JE-CVax has previously been established as a safe substitute for JEV, a BSL3 pathogen, when virus neutralization tests need to be performed at BSL2 (

Briefly, a step was added, in which different serum dilutions made in the assay medium were first inoculated with YFV-17D (20 to 50 PFU) or JE-CVax (50 to 100 PFU) virus for 1 h at 37°C and then added to the cells. All sera were assayed in triplicate in serial dilutions 1:20, 1:66, 1:200, 1:660, 1:2,000, and 1:6,600. Plaques were manually counted and PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> were calculated using the Reed and Muench method (
