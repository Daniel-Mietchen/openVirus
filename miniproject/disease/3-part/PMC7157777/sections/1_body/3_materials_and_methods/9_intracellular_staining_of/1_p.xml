<p>HEK 293 cells transfected with pCMV-YFV-17D NS1-IRES-EGFP or infected with YFV-17D-mCherry were detached with trypsin-EDTA (0,05%), centrifuged (at 2,500 rpm and 4°C for 5 min), and suspended in FACS-B (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline [DPBS], no Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>/Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, 2% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 2 mM EDTA). Not more than 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per well were seeded into round-bottom 96-well plates (Costar, Corning Inc.) and spun down, and the supernatant was removed. Dead cells were stained 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with ZombieAqua (Biolegend; 1:500 diluted in DPBS) to exclude from further analysis. After washing and fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde (in FACS-B), cells were permeabilized by 0.1% saponin (in FACS-B with 1% normal mouse serum) with streptavidin added (streptavidin/biotin blocking kit; Vector Laboratories) to block endogenous biotin (permeabilizing and blocking solution). The cells were then stained with anti-NS1 primary antibody solution (clone 1A5; 5 μg/ml), or JE-CVax-vaccinated mouse serum (1:10) in permeabilizing and blocking solution. Anti-NS1 antibody binding was detected by a biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog no. A16076; 1:200 dilution). The biotinylated secondary antibody was stained subsequently with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7 (Biolegend; 1:200 dilution). After the cells were washed, they were resuspended in FACS-B and filtered through 100-μm nylon meshes (Sefar; ELKO Filtering; 03-100/44) prior to analysis on a flow cytometer (LSR Fortessa X-20; Becton, Dickinson). The data were analyzed using FlowJo 10 software (TreeStar). The gating strategy for the analysis is depicted in
