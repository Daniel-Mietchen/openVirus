<p>Immunodeficient IFN-α/β and -γ receptor knockout mice (AG129; B&amp;K Universal, Marshall BioResources, UK) were bred in-house. AG129 mice have been shown to be highly susceptible to lethal YFV-17D infection, serving as a well-established surrogate rodent challenge model for wt YFV infection (

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Six- to 8-week-old male AG129 mice were used for all experiments after random assignment into different groups. Animals were kept in individually ventilated type-2 filter top cages on a 12-h/12-h day/night cycle with water and food

Housing of animals and procedures involving animal experimentation were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines approved by the Ethical Committee of the KU Leuven, Belgium (licenses P168/2012, P103/2015, P140/2016, and P005/2018). Throughout the study, animals were vaccinated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax, 1/6th human dose of Ixiaro (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), or 2% assay medium. Animals vaccinated with Ixiaro were boosted on 14 dpv with 1/6th human dose of Ixiaro. All the vaccinated animals were challenged i.p. with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of either YFV-17D or JEV SA14-14-2 (both corresponding to 1,000 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) 28 dpv, if not stated otherwise. An additional 4 weeks after YFV-17D challenge, some animals were rechallenged i.p. with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of ZIKV-MR776 (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Animals were observed for morbidity (weight loss) and humane endpoint once daily. The humane endpoint is defined as either paresis/difficulty in walking, paralysis (hind legs/soured eyes), moribundity/ataxia/tremors/difficulty in breathing, 20% weight loss, or quick weight loss (15% within 1 or 2 days); animals were immediately euthanized once a humane endpoint was reached. Throughout the study, bleedings were performed through submandibular puncture on day 0 (prevaccination), day 28 (postvaccination), and day 56 (postchallenge).
