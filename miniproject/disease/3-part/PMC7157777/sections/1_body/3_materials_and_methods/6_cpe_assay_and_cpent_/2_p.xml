<p>CPENTs were performed similarly to the CPE assays for viral titration, with some modifications. Briefly, a step was added, in which different serum dilutions made in the assay medium were first inoculated with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of YFV-17D or JE-CVax virus for 1 h at 37°C and then added to the cells. All sera were assayed in triplicate in serial dilutions 1:20, 1:66, 1:200, 1:660, 1:2,000, and 1:6,600. CPE neutralization was calculated with the following formula: percent neutralization activity = percent CPE reduction = (OD
 <sub>virus+serum</sub> – OD
 <sub>VC</sub>) × 100/(OD
 <sub>CC</sub> – OD
 <sub>VC</sub>), where OD is optical density; 50% neutralization titers (CPENT
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated using the Reed and Muench method (

 <sub>50</sub> values for each sample represent geometric means of three independent repeats, and data are presented as log
 <sub>10</sub> CPENT
 <sub>50</sub> (mean ± SD). CPENT for detection of nAbs was validated against a standard PRNT, yielding a strong correlation (
