<p>Viral titers for culture-derived YFV-17D or JE-CVax (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) and 50% neutralizing antibody titers (log
 <sub>10</sub> CPENT
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined using CPE-based cell assays and CPE-based virus neutralization tests, respectively, on BHK-21J cells as described previously (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>), with some modifications. In brief, 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> BHK-21J cells/well were plated in 96-well plates overnight in seeding medium. The medium was then replaced with assay media containing different virus dilutions and cultured for 5 days at 37°C. Later, assays were first visually scored for CPE and then stained with MTS/phenazine methosulphate (PMS; Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 1.5 h at 37°C in the dark. Post-MTS/PMS staining, absorbance was measured at 498 nm for each well. All assays were performed in six replicates, and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per milliliter was determined using the Reed and Muench method (
