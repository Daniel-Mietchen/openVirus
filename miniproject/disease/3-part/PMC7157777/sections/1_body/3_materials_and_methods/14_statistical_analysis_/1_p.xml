<p>GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for all statistical evaluations. Quantitative data were represented as means ± standard deviations and obtained from at least three independent experiments. For ADCC assays, flow cytometry analysis and ELISpot assay data were represented as means ± standard errors of means (SEMs). Statistical significance was determined using survival analysis with log rank (Mantel-Cox) test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (neutralization titers and ELISA), two-way ANOVA (ADCC), paired 
 <italic>t</italic> test (flow cytometry), and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (comparison of paired postvaccinated and postchallenge samples). Correlation studies were performed using linear regression analysis with Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Values were considered statistically significantly different at 
 <italic>P</italic> values of ≤0.05.
