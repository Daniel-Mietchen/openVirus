<p>Serum antibodies recognizing YFV NS1 were detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in essence as previously described (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). In brief, ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 1 μg/ml of recombinant YFV NS1 (Bio-Rad; catalog no. PIP052A) in 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) overnight at 4°C. After three washes with PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween 80), plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-T for 1 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. After three washes with PBS-T, wells were treated with serial dilutions of test sera (2-fold serial dilution in PBS-T) for 2 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of the YFV NS1-specific mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody (clone 1A5, kindly provided by J. J. Schlesinger) (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) starting at 10 μg/ml served as a standard. After four washes with PBS, plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog no. AP124P; diluted 1:3,000 in PBS-T) for 1 h. After another four washes with PBS, bound antibodies were detected via conversion of added tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; SureBlue TMB microwell peroxidase; KPL). The reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding equal quantities of 1 M HCl solution, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. After background subtraction, relative anti-YFV NS1 titers were determined by comparison to the standard curve generated for MAb 1A5 included in each assay plate. To that end, the dilution at which each individual test serum yielded an OD at 450 nm (OD
 <sub>450</sub>) of 1 was used to calculate an absolute anti-NS1 antibody concentration (equivalent concentration), assuming a binding similar to that of YFV-17D NS1 by MAb 1A5. Only values that exceeded three times the background signal were considered positive.
