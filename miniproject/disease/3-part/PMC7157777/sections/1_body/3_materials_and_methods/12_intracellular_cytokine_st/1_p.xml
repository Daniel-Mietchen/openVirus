<p>To restimulate memory T cells, freshly isolated single cell suspensions of splenocytes were seeded at 3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> per well in a round-bottom 96-well plate and incubated with either 5 μg/ml of the MHC class I- restricted peptide from YFV-17D NS3 (ATLTYRML) (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) or 50 μg/ml of total cellular antigen (infected or noninfected Vero E6 cell lysate). Following overnight incubation, the splenocytes were incubated for 2 h with 5 μg/ml of brefeldin A (Biolegend) for intracellular trapping of cytokines and then stained with Zombie Aqua (1:200) in PBS for 15 min. Splenocytes were then stained for CD3 (4 μg/ml eFluor 450 α-mouse CD3 antibody; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and CD8 (2 μg/ml of allophycocyanin [APC]/Cy7 α-mouse CD8a antibody; Biolegend) in PBS for 20 min before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilization and blocking in a mixture of 0.1% saponin and 1% normal mouse serum. Finally, splenocytes were stained intracellularly for TNF-α (6.5 μg/ml PE anti-mouse TNF-α; Biolegend) and IFN-γ (2 μg/ml of APC anti-mouse IFN-γ; Biolegend) prior to analysis on a flow cytometer (LSR Fortessa X-20; Becton, Dickinson). Gating on forward scatter A (FSC-A)/side scatter A (SSC-A) excluded debris; SSC-H/SSC-W and FSC-H/FSC-W excluded doublet cells. The data were analyzed using FlowJo 10 software (TreeStar). To determine the percentage of responding CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, the percentages of responders from samples stimulated with noninfected Vero E6 cell lysates were subtracted from the corresponding responses. The gating strategy for the analysis is depicted in
