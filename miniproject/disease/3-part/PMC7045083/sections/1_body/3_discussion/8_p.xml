<p id="p0140">The authors acknowledge that these results are counter-intuitive based on the adverse events data collected following vaccination with LAIV versus TIV, previously 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, we performed two randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trials with 271 participants who completed symptom questionnaires allowing us to interrogate the effects of vaccination in the setting of existing or new 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation. The differences between groups were not apparent prior to the intervention, indicating these are true biological effects. What is important to note is that symptoms were driven not just by the vaccine alone, but strongly associated with the 
 <italic>S. pneuomoniae</italic> colonisation afterwards. We demonstrated that LAIV impaired neutrophilic degranulation upon 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and it is for example possible that this, or another immune mechanism that was altered by LAIV, led to the differences in symptoms. We believe these results highlight that the environment and microbiota can therefore affect symptomology differentially following vaccination with attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Importantly, the order of vaccination had an impact of symptom reporting, as it did on microbiological endpoints (
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonisation) in the trial
