<p id="p0080">We investigated whether colonisation status led to symptoms following vaccination. In the TIV group, more nasal and non-nasal symptoms were reported by colonised participants (52%; n = 12/23) compared to non-colonised participants (34%; n = 13/38) following inoculation (&gt;=4 days) with statistical significance seen for all reported nasal symptoms, sore throat, cough and overall assessment (

These were total nasal symptoms which were reduced and headache which was increased in colonised participants after inoculation (OR 0.17 and OR 22.17; p &lt; 0.005) (

Similarly, fewer symptoms were observed in non-colonised participants who received LAIV prior to inoculation (31%; n = 9/29) compared to those participants who received TIV (47%; n = 18/38). However, statistical significance was only seen in non-nasal symptoms; sore throat, headache and overall assessment (p &lt; 0.05) (
