Briefly, participants were randomised to receive either nasal LAIV (Fluenz Tetra or FluMist Tetra, AstraZeneca, UK; used interchangeably due to procurement shortages; both are pharmaceutically identical but have different packaging and labelling) with an intramuscular placebo (0.5 mL normal saline), or a nasal placebo (0.2 mL normal saline) with an intramuscular Tetravalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccination (TIV) (Fluarix Tetra, GlaxoSmithKline, UK).
