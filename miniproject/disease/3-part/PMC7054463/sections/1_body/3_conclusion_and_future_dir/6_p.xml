<p>Consideration has also been given to the potential role of influenza vaccines prior to, or during, pregnancy as a preventive measure to limit the prenatal teratogenic influence of viruses (
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>). The seasonal influenza vaccine has established efficacy in preventing maternal infection, as well as partially preventing the infant through passive immunity, and its administration remains best practice for protection of mother and child, with the World Health Organisation recognising pregnant women as a priority vulnerable group. In addition, educating pregnant women to contact their healthcare provide if they have a fever is recommended in order to expedite administration of antiviral medication and supportive care (

Although neurodevelopmental outcome data are largely lacking, some mouse models suggested that influenza vaccination early in pregnancy can indeed promote behavioral function and neurogenesis in the offspring, and confer protection from the effects of MIA with LPS (

 <xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>). One note of caution has been raised by a cohort study of nearly 200,000 children in California which reported a small but statistically significantly increased risk of ASD following first trimester vaccination (
 <xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>); unsurprisingly the report was controversial, with ensuing disagreement concerning interpretation of the findings and whether the correct statistical measures were used (
