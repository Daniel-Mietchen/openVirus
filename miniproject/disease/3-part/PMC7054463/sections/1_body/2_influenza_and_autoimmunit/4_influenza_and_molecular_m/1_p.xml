<p>The association between influenza infection and NMDAR autoantibody status may have structural molecular basis. The influenza A M2 channel and NMDAR share a ligand, the antiviral compound amantadine (
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>), suggesting putative structural homology which could form the basis for NMDAR autoimmunity occurring after infection. In molecular mimicry, there is sharing of sequences, such as linear amino acid sequences, by molecules from dissimilar genes or their protein products. In infection, if the virus shares cross-reactive epitopes for B or T cells with the host, the host immune cells can target both the infecting agent and the host itself, potentially inducing autoimmune disease (

 <sub>c</sub> cells damaging self-tissue by lysis or T
 <sub>h</sub> cells releasing cytokines. Cytokines in turn activate macrophages or stimulate secretion of antibodies, and antibodies bind to cross-reactive epitopes on the surface of tissues, triggering further cytokine production by macrophages (
