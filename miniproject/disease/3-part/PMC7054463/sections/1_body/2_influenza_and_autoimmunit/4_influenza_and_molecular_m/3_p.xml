<p>Further evidence for molecular mimicry as a bridging link between influenza infection, the adaptive immune response and neurodevelopmental risk for schizophrenia comes from gene sequence overlap between the H5N1 virus and genes abnormally regulated in schizophrenia (
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>). Furthermore, the H1N1 influenza antiviral protein hemagglutinin was found to share peptide structure with a variety of human axon guidance proteins; the majority of proteins identified as containing homologous sequences are involved in processes which, if disrupted, could lead to deviant neurodevelopmental trajectories. The observed peptide matches were conserved across influenza strains and frequently involved experimentally validated hemagglutinin epitopes (

 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>). The findings suggest that anti-pathogen immune responses to the influenza A virus may cross-react with multiple schizophrenia-related proteins. This reaction could potentially trigger processes which may ultimately lead to schizophrenia. Work from our group has confirmed the higher-than-expected overlap between the influenza proteome and schizophrenia-relevant proteins, additionally identifying hemagglutinin as contributing, amongst influenza proteins, the most extensive peptide sharing [Kepinska et al.,
