<p>Cytokines are induced in response to inflammation by neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, with the role of activated microglia in schizophrenia pathogenesis being the object of much recent attention (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). MIA exposure leads to alterations of the microglial transcriptome, with an initial shift to a more reactive state proximal to the MIA insult, followed by a delay in the maturation of brain microglia, as compared to controls (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). Alterations in the microglial transcriptome also lead to phagocytic function abnormalities and behavioral abnormalities in the adult MIA offspring (

 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Some studies report increased microglial density [e.g. (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>)], morphology [e.g. (
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>)] or expression of activation markers [e.g. (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>)], while other studies using late MIA have failed to demonstrate long-term changes in microglia density, morphology, or activation (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). Inference regarding the translational relevance of these findings, too, has been limited by a lack of clarity around the utility of the putative human markers of microglial activation such as translocator protein (TSPO), bound by ligands in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, and of microglial markers used in post-mortem studies; notably, in addition to microglia, both astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells show dynamic changes in TSPO expression in response to inflammatory stimuli, and in a mouse model schizophrenia-relevant behavioral abnormalities and increased inflammatory cytokine expression were associated with reduced, rather than increased, prefrontal TSPO levels (
