<p>Notably, most rodent (and primate) MIA models use a dose of poly(I:C) which models a high intensity, acute and transient (&lt;24 h) infection, the physiological relevance of which could be questioned. Furthermore, factors such as the source, molecular weight, and endotoxin contamination of experimental poly(I:C) may be unrecognised sources of variability in foetal outcomes (

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>), a series of MIA studies using human H1N1 influenza infection by the group of S. Hossein Fatemi are particularly valuable in elucidating potential mechanisms of psychosis risk. Broadly, maternal human H1N1 infection has been demonstrated to cause abnormalities, within the offspring, of the following [summarized in (
