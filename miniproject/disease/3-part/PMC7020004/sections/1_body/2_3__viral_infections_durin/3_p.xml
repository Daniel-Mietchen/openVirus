<p>As a member of 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family, herpes simplex virus (HSV) is also associated with the risk of fetal transmission that can lead to abnormalities, especially in the central nervous system of newborns. The majority of HSV infections during pregnancy are caused by HSV-2, and there exists greater risk of HSV transmission during vaginal birth [

 <italic>α−herpesviridae</italic> Varicella zoster virus (VZV) may cause congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Although rare, congenital VZV infections can result in serious fetal manifestations, including neurodevelopmental defects when the infection occurs during the first two trimesters [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Cellular and molecular analysis has revealed that VZV DNA can be detected in the placenta and amniotic fluid, while VZV is able to successfully replicate in CTBs [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Although the exact mechanisms of VZV transmission in the placenta are unknown, VZV-infected T cells can be localized to the basal decidua, where VZV replicates and spreads to the adjacent placenta in the intervillous blood space [
