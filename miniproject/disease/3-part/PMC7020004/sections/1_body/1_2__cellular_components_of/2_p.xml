<p>At the outermost layer of the placenta, two populations of trophoblasts are responsible for coordinating maternal–fetal interactions, and serving as an initial line of defense against pathogens [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs) are a multinucleated, fully differentiated population of trophoblasts that form a continuous layer above cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), which are undifferentiated mononuclear stem cells of the placenta that are able to differentiate into other trophoblast types [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While CTBs form the anchoring villi, STBs form the floating villi and are responsible for the exchange that occurs at the villus surface between maternal blood and fetus [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Aggregates of CTBs also organize into extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVTs), which are placental trophoblasts that invade the maternal decidua, anchor the placenta, and subsequently lead to the transfer of nutrients to the fetus [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition to separating the fetus from maternal tissues, the layer composed of STBs and CTBs is particularly important in terms of protecting the semi-allogenic fetus against maternal immune attacks [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. STBs and CTBs do not express MHC class I and II molecules, and this lack of expression may explain why the maternal immune response tolerates the fetus [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The expression of MHC class I molecules by EVTs has been suggested to aid in the invasion of the maternal decidua. It is important to note that abnormalities in the EVT-induced invasion of the maternal blood vessels are associated with pregnancy complications such as FGR and even pregnancy loss [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Trophoblasts are also known to secrete high levels of extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These EVs are involved in maternal–fetal communication and possibly antiviral activity. As an example, isolation and characterization of EVs from human trophoblasts in Ouyang et al. demonstrated the antiviral activity of placental EVs derived from human trophoblasts [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These findings emphasize the important immunoregulatory role of placental trophoblasts.
