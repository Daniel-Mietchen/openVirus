<p>Placental trophoblasts are known to produce high levels of exosomes [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Extracellular miRNAs can be initially packaged and secreted by exosomes, which are small EVs derived from placental trophoblasts, mainly involved in intercellular communication [

 <xref rid="B133-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Being enclosed in exosomes might explain why miRNAs circulating in plasma are highly stable. Exosome-mediated transfer of miRNAs specific to the placenta is one mechanism of maternal–fetal communication, especially in the context of regulating maternal immune response to pathogen infections. Valadi et al. have demonstrated the ability of exosomes to shuttle various RNA species that can be translated and ultimately regulate the activity or differentiation of these recipient cells [

Moreover, exogenous expression of the entire C19MC in non-placental cells via exosome-mediated delivery drastically reduces virus infection, and select expression of C19MC family members miR517-3p, miR516b-5p, and miR512-3p alone significantly limited the replication of both RNA and DNA viruses [

 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of placental trophoblasts at the maternal–fetal interface in terms of limiting the spread of pathogens through miRNA-mediated regulation.
