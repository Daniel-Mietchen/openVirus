<p>Although animal models provide useful platforms for supplementing and elevating cell-based in vivo studies, these techniques fail to reflect the physiological parameters and cellular communication occurring in human conditions, which are essential to understanding the mechanisms of placental development and disease. Given the limitations of the pregnant animal model, it will be ideal to characterize virus–host interactions using primary cells isolated from human placenta. Single-cell RNA and DNA sequencing can help to identify the characteristics of maternal and fetal cells in the decidua and placenta, and how these cells interact with one another. Recently, a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomics atlas of the maternal–fetal interface during early pregnancy was completed by Vento-Tormo et al. [

Researchers mapped over 70,000 single cells at the junction of the uterus and placenta, revealing how cells cross-talk to each other to modulate immune response and maintain pregnancy. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed the diversity of trophoblast subtypes and patterns of differentiation in the human placenta. Different cell subtypes from placenta secrete diverse polypeptide hormones, as a source of many hormones involved in fetal growth and maternal adaptation to pregnancy. Newly identified cell types have been reported, including CD68-positive HBCs called macro_1 and macro_2 [
