<p>Mice have been the most frequently used animal models not for their similarities to humans, but for the practicality of their small size and short generation times. Mice and humans share similar placental cell types and genes that regulate placental development, but trophoblast invasion in mice is shallow and limited relative to the extensive invasion of maternal uterine vessels that occurs during human pregnancy [

Mouse mutants, specifically, have been useful in understanding the different genetic pathways involved in controlling placental development, and how morphogenesis and placental cell differentiation can be affected in these mutants. Furthermore, studies of genes associated with placental defects in mice have demonstrated the importance of placental defects as a major factor contributing to abnormal embryonic development [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. According to Perez-Garcia et al., co-occurrence of placental defects and embryonic defects are more common than previously thought, and are often accompanied by defects in the fetal heart and brain, as observed in mouse models.
