<p>Cells, grown on coverslips to 30 to 50% confluence, were either mock treated, infected with wt LACV or LACVdelNSs, or treated with α-amanitin for the indicated times. After the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, they were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Unspecific staining was reduced by incubating the cells in blocking and staining solution (2% bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The following primary antibodies, diluted in blocking and staining solution, were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-LACV N (1:500), mouse monoclonal anti-LACV G
 <sub>C</sub> (1:400, kindly provided by Francesco Gonzales-Scarano, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA), Elongin A (1:500, rabbit; Sigma-Aldrich, HPA005910), Elongin B (1:100, rabbit; Santa Cruz, sc-11447), Elongin C (1:250, mouse; BD Transduction Laboratories, 610761), and nucleolin (1:1,000; Abcam, ab22758). The primary antibodies were incubated on cells at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three washes in PBS. The secondary antibody was either Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, A21202), Alexa Fluor 555 Donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, A31570), Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, A31572), or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, A21206) used. The nuclei were visualized by staining the chromatin with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 1:100) at the same time as the secondary antibody incubation. After 45 min of incubation, the cells were washed again three times in PBS and once in H
 <sub>2</sub>O and then mounted using Fluorsave solution (Calbiochem). Images were taken with an Apotome (Zeiss) at a magnification of ×63.
