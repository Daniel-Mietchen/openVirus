<p>In summary, we have shown that LACV NSs triggers the destruction of RNAP II in a surprisingly fast manner, starting at 1 h p.i. This is in line with the earlier observation that the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I of the IFN immune system is capable of recognizing already the incoming LACV nucleocapsids, thus requiring an immediate viral counterreaction (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The fast RNAP II degradation by NSs leads to general blockade of host mRNA production and hence to an inability of the cell to produce IFN and alert the surrounding cells. RNAP II degradation is due to ubiquitination and proteasomal activity and involves the host factor Elongin C that is expelled from the nucleoli during the course of these events. This fast and efficient way of shutting down the IFN response contributes to the virulence of LACV, and it will be interesting to see whether other pathogenic orthobunyaviruses are using the same mechanism.
