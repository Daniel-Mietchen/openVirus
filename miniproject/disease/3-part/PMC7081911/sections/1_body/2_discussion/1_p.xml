<p>Morphological changes of nucleoli were long known as a hallmark of orthobunyavirus infection (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Moreover, recently a nucleolar localization sequence important for NSs action was described for the orthobunyavirus SBV (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Our findings that Elongin C (i) colocalizes with nucleolin in uninfected cells, (ii) contributes to the NSs-mediated RNAP II degradation, and (iii) becomes redistributed in the presence of NSs are in line with those earlier observations. Thus, Elongin C appears to be a player in the anti-IFN strategy of LACV, a view further underscored by the increase in IFN induction and RNAP II activity by&gt; log
 <sub>10</sub> step in Elongin C-deficient cells that were infected with wt LACV.
