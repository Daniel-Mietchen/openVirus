<p>An interesting side observation of our studies was the establishment of Elongin C (but not A or B) as a nucleolar protein. We were able to locate Elongin A in a database of the nucleolar proteome (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) but not Elongin C. We therefore hypothesize a transient and weak association, which is probably disrupted upon cell lysis or nucleoli preparation. In support of this, LACV (and SBV) NSs disturbs the nucleolar organization only slightly (and LACV NSs still allows RNAP I activity there [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]), but this might be sufficient to release Elongin C. Î±-Amanitin, in contrast, dissolves nucleoli entirely and also redistributes Elongin C.
