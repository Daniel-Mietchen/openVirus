<p>The entire multiplication cycle of bunyaviruses takes place in the cytoplasm. After entering the host cell via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and subsequent low pH-driven membrane fusion, mRNAs are transcribed from the incoming genome RNA nucleocapsids by L RdRP (“primary transcription”). The transcription is primed by 12- to 18-nt 5′-capped oligonucleotides that had been cleaved from host mRNA by an endonuclease activity residing in the N terminus of L (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). After translation of the viral proteins, the viral genome RNA (vRNA) is replicated via a positive-sense, encapsidated full-length intermediate, the copy RNA (cRNA). The newly generated vRNA nucleocapsids can give rise to more mRNAs produced by secondary transcription or become packaged by peptidase-processed Gn/Gc on Golgi membranes and leave the cell via the exocytosis pathway (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
