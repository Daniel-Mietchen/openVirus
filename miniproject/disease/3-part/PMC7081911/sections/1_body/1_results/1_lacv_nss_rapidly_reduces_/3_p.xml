<p>Besides LACV and related orthobunyaviruses, also Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>, order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>) encodes an NSs that strongly inhibits RNAP II activity (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The two NSs proteins play the same biological role (IFN induction antagonism) and target the same cellular function (RNAP II mRNA transcription) but are unrelated with respect to size and amino acid sequence. Using recombinant RVFV encoding the NSs genes of either LACV or RVFV (both equipped with a Flag tag), we compared their RPB1-destructive activities, again in HuH-7 cells within the first 4 h of infection at an MOI of 10. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, the NSs of RVFV is expressed from 1 h p.i. on, but exhibited no RNAP II-destructive activity. RVFV-expressed LACV NSs, in contrast, becomes detectable at 3 h p.i. and diminishes RNAP IIo from this time point on. Thus, taken together, our data show an astonishingly rapid attack of RNAP II by LACV NSs, with an efficiency comparable to a pharmaceutical transcription blocker. Moreover, the RNAP II inhibition profile is different from the other established bunyaviral RNAP II inhibitor, RVFV NSs.
