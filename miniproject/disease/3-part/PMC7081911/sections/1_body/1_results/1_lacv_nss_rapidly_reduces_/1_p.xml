<p>To become transcriptionally active, the 260-kDa large subunit RPB1 of RNAP II gets hyperphosphorylated at the 52 heptad repeat sequences that are situated at the CTD (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This results in a gain of molecular weight and hence in a band shift on immunoblots. The NSs proteins of both the orthobunyavirus type species BUNV and of LACV trigger the disappearance of the high-molecular-weight hyperphosphorylated RNAP II, termed IIo, and with some delay also of the lighter nonphosphorylated, transcriptionally inactive form (IIa) (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Moreover, the RPB1 CTD has two major phosphorylation sites within each of the 52 heptad repeats (consensus sequence YSPTSPS), serine 2 and serine 5. CTD-serine 5 phosphorylation is a hallmark of promoter-bound RNAP II, whereas CTD-serine 2 phosphorylation indicates transcriptional elongation (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Both BUNV and LACV were shown to preferentially affect CTD-serine 2 phosphorylation, indicating specific inhibition of host mRNA elongation (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).
