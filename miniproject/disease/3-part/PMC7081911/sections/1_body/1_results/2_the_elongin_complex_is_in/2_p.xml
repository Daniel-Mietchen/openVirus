<p>We also measured another hallmark of NSs action on RNAP II, the suppression of γ-actin intron RNA levels. Introns have a short half-life (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and blockade of RNAP II elongation by LACV NSs dries out their supply within 4 h of infection (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, wt LACV infection suppressed γ-actin intron RNA down to approximately 3% of mock levels. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated removals of either Elongin A, B, or C were all able to rescue γ-actin intron RNA significantly and to a certain extent, but again the Elongin C knockdown reached the highest level. Compared to the control siRNA, Elongin C siRNA alleviated the wt LACV-triggered γ-actin intron RNA reduction from 3 to 19% of the mock levels, i.e., by a factor of ∼6.
