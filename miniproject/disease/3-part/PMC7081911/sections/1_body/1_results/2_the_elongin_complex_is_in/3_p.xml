<p>The biologically relevant reason for LACV NSs to degrade transcribing RNAP II is suppression of IFN induction at the mRNA transcription level (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). When expression of the three Elongins in A549 cells was individually suppressed by siRNA transfection and IFN induction was measured, a similar picture as with the γ-actin intron RNA reduction emerged. Suppression of Elongin C rescued IFN-β mRNA induction in wt LACV-infected cells from ∼400-fold to &gt;7,000-fold (compared to the approximately 70,000-fold measured for the delNSs virus), i.e., by more than 1 log
 <sub>10</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). siRNAs against Elongin A or B, in contrast, rescued IFN-β induction in wt LACV-infected cells at a lower, but still significant level. ISG56 (IFIT1) is another virus-induced gene that plays a role in the immediate early antiviral state (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Also, ISG56 mRNA induction was rescued best in wt LACV-infected cells when Elongin C expression was impeded (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Importantly, under these single-step growth conditions (MOI of 10, 16 h of infection) none of the Elongin knockdowns significantly influenced viral RNA levels, neither of wt LACV nor of LACVdelNSs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). However, since some siRNAs did increase IFN and ISG56 mRNA levels in wt LACV-infected cells, we also tested the effect of the Elongin knockdowns in the IFN-competent A549 cells under multistep growth conditions (MOI of 0.01), at an extended incubation time (24 h) and with virus titrations. Indeed, with this more sensitive setting we observed the expected difference between wt LACV and the LACVdelNSs virus (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and that the knockdown of Elongins A or C (but not B) reduced the growth of both wt LACV and the LACVdelNSs virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Thus, again Elongin C turned out to be a factor exhibiting a clear impact on LACV.
