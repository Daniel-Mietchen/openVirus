<p>WNV is maintained in nature by ornithophilic 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and wild birds, with the particular mosquito species varying by region in the United States and worldwide (reviewed extensively by Kramer et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). 
 <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> drive epidemic transmission in the western United States while 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> is the main vector in the eastern United States. 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex nigripalpus</italic> are important vectors for WNV in the southeastern United States [
