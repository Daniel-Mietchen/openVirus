<p>Several commonalities unite the clinical presentation of WNV in the most affected vertebrates: birds, horses and humans. These include neurotropism characterized by primarily mononuclear inflammation, neuronal necrosis and gliosis which frequently affects gray matter and varies according to host and virus strain. In addition, renal and ocular tropism seems to be a conserved aspect of clinical disease in birds and humans.</p>
