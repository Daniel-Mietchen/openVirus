<p>These data highlight the inadequacy of syndromic management, the current standard of care, for CT, NG, and TV in this high-risk population of adolescents and young adults with HIV. Our evidence indicates that the majority of these infections are asymptomatic and supports the introduction of targeted molecular STI testing as a key element of comprehensive HIV care for adolescents and young adults in low-resource, high-burden settings. Prevention programs need to target correct and consistent condom use and empower women to seek alternatives to transactional and age discordant relationships. Differentiated service delivery may be needed for adolescents and young adults who have acquired HIV horizontally as opposed to adolescents and young adults who acquired HIV perinatally. Point-of-care Xpert screening and testing services for adolescents and young adults living with HIV should be rapidly adopted, particularly for females, given the poor performance of syndromic screening and the potential for adverse health consequences due to untreated CT, NG, or TV. Adoption of such testing, if financial resources allow, is possible within the framework of comprehensive HIV care for adolescents and young adults with HIV living in high-burden settings and has the potential to decrease HIV transmission via improved identification and treatment of STIs.</p>
