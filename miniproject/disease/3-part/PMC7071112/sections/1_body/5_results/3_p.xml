<p>With Xpert CT/NG and Xpert TV as the reference standard, urine leukocyte esterase (LE) in ESAP had a sensitivity of 84.0% (male, 100.0%; female, 80.0%) and specificity of 65.9% (male, 83.6%; female, 53.8%) (

 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There were large differences in test performance attributable to sex, with LE testing and syndromic screening offering higher sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values in males (
