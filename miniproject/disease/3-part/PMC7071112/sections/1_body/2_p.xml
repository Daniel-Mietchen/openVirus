<p>There are data clearly linking CT, NG, and TV with acquisition and transmission of HIV when the HIV viral load is detectable [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Existing data suggests that adolescents living with HIV and with detectable viral loads (DVLs) have a higher prevalence of STIs [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The effect of STIs in increasing the risk of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV has also recently been elucidated [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. There is both sentinel site surveillance data demonstrating high rates of CT, NG, and TV among the general population in LMICs with generalized HIV epidemics, such as South Africa [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Eswatini [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as well as baseline data on prevalence in populations at risk for HIV acquisition from HIV prevention studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Adolescents and young people, aged 15 to 24 years, are a priority group for the detection of STIs as are people living with HIV, but there is very little data defining STI prevalence and risk factors in adolescents and young adults living with HIV who are engaged in care and treatment in LMICs. This is a population in whom targeted testing and treatment for STIs, regardless of symptoms, may be feasible and pathways for laboratory testing and interpretation are generally established [
