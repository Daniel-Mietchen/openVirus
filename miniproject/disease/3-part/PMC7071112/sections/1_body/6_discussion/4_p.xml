<p>The gender disparity in STIs among people with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa holds true in Eswatini among adolescents and young adults with HIV. In addition to a disproportionate burden of STI prevalence, women are more likely to experience negative health outcomes secondary to STIs. Among female ESAP, 19.8% (20 of 101) had an STI, but of those with an STI, only 20.0% (4 of 20) were identified through syndromic screening. This high prevalence at baseline in a comprehensive HIV care setting, already incorporating robust syndromic screening, indicates the need to introduce Xpert CT/NG and TV screening for sexually active adolescents and young adults who are enrolled in comprehensive HIV care.</p>
