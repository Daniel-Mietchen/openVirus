<p>There is very little data on the prevalence of STIs among adolescents and young adults with HIV and enrolled in chronic care in high-burden settings. Existing data on incidence in adolescents and young adults with HIV, primarily from US populations, estimate an incidence of any bacterial STI at approximately 1.56–2.6 per 100 patient-years, which was similar to HIV-uninfected populations [

These data are not directly comparable to our own because we collected cross-sectional data on prevalence rather than incidence, but our prevalence of 8.7% among all participants and 15.5% among ESAP suggest that adolescents (15–19 years) and young people (20–24 years) with HIV in high-burden settings are at significant risk for STIs. This high prevalence in a population routinely screened for STI symptoms is consistent with surveillance data demonstrating the lack of efficacy of syndromic screening and management on reducing STI prevalence [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Self-report of any prior sexual activity by questionnaire was a reliable predictor of STI risk in this cohort, indicating that if adolescents are approached in a way that allows them to answer truthfully, this can be an effective initial screening question to assess STI risk.
