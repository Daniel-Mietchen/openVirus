<p>PCR amplification was performed in a T100 thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) using MyTaq one-step RT-PCR kit (Bioline, Memphis, TN, USA). PCR reactions were prepared in a 25 µL mixture containing 12.5 µL of one-step mix, 1 µL (10 pmol) of each primer, and 2 µL of the extracted RNA. PCR cycling conditions were: reverse transcription at 45 °C for 20 min, 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 51 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final step at 72 °C for 5 min. After the first round of PCR amplification, one µL of PCR product underwent the nested amplification (35 cycles), performed using MyTaq red mix kit (Bioline). The PCR cycle included 1 min of initial denaturation at 95 °C; followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 48 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 10 s with a final elongation step of 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gel stained with GelRed
 <sup>®</sup> (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA). Standard precautions were taken to prevent false-positive results.
