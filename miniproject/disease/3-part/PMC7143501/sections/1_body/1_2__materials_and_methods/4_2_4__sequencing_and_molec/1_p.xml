<p>PCR amplicons were purified using a Montage PCRm96 microwell filter plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and were subjected to automated sequencing by BioFab Research (Rome, Italy), using the PCR amplification primers. As no ORF2 sequences could be obtained from the samples collected in 2017â€“2019 by Sanger sequencing, due to undetectable or unspecific PCR products, Next- Generation Sequencing (NGS) was also performed to sequence even low amounts of amplified specific fragments. All reactions of the ORF2 nested amplifications were pooled and sequenced by ultra-deep sequencing onto a MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described [
