<p>This surveillance of human wastewaters allowed us to generate data on the circulation of HEV in the general population in Italy. HEV RNA, genotype 1 and 3, were detected at the WTP entrance, with the highest rates reported from the central regions of Italy. Viral sequences were genetically close to those reported in clinical specimens. A marked predominance of G3 strains was detected as expected, however, G1 strains were also identified, except in years 2016â€“2019, pointing to the circulation of this genotype also in nonendemic areas.</p>
