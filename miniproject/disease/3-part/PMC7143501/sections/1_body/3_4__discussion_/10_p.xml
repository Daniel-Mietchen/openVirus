<p>The occurrence of HEV in urban wastewater raises the question of whether sewage-contaminated surface waters can be responsible for HEV waterborne transmission. A recent review by Fenaux et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] highlighted the need to investigate the possible transmission of the hepatitis E virus by water in high-income countries. Indeed, HEV has been detected in different water matrices even in these countries; moreover, HEV survival in water is similar to other enteric viruses since it seems that the virus has similar resistance to inactivating factors like heat, UV, and chlorine [
