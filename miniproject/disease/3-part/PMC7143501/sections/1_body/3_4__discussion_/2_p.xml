<p>As for animal HEV, it has been demonstrated that HEV circulates largely within pig herds in Italy [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Genotype 3 is widespread among Italian pigs, even though genotype 4 was also reported in swine farms in Northern Italy [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HEV RNA has also been detected in pig slurry collected in Italian farms, showing a high degree of identity with strains detected in autochthonous HEV cases [
