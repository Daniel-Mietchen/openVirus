<p>As for quantitative data, we found overall low HEV concentrations in raw sewage (range of concentrations ~20 to 2.8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> g.c./L), with only nine samples exceeding 10
 <sup>3</sup> g.c./L and a median value of quantifiable samples of 3.2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> g.c./L. Few studies have been performed on HEV quantitative levels in raw sewage, and comparison of available data is hindered by the diversity of analytical methods and by WTP capacity. In three studies carried out in Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] most of the positive samples were below the corresponding LOQs and, overall, only two samples were quantified with concentrations of 7.8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> c.g./L [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 4.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> c.g./L (25). Miura and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] in their study performed during an HEV outbreak on an island, reported virus concentrations in inlet sewage up to 6.3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> c.g./L after the outbreak, with values decreasing to 10
 <sup>3</sup> c.g./L within a month. Therefore, the quantitative data of the present study seem to confirm that, during the observation period, the detection of HEV occurred at concentrations lower than those presumably associated with relevant outbreaks in the populations.
