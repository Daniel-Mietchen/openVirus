<p>Large-scale outbreaks of acute hepatitis occur in regions where HEV is endemic, such as Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. In such countries, HEV is primarily a waterborne illness associated with large epidemics due to contaminated water and water supplies and poor sanitation conditions [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In contrast, hepatitis E occurs as sporadic cases in Europe, Japan, and the USA, where HEV is spread mainly by zoonotic transmission, and domestic pigs and wild boars are considered main reservoirs [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Europe, the incidence of confirmed cases has steadily increased over the last decade [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-02059" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The recognition of a high anti-HEV seroprevalence in a significant proportion of healthy individuals from nonendemic countries suggests widespread infection, which most likely occurs at a subclinical or asymptomatic level [
