<p>Results of HEV detection by nested PCR are reported in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-02059-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Positive and negative controls, used to avoid the risk of false-positive or false-negative results, always gave the expected results. Overall, 74/1374 (5.4%, CI 95%; 4.3–6.7%) samples tested positive using the ORF1 assay: 23/529 (4.3%, CI 95%; 2.9–6.5%) in Northern Italy, 42/590 (7.1%, CI 95%; 5.3–9.5%) in Central Italy, and 9/255 (3.5%, CIm95%; 1.8–6.7%) in Southern Italy. A statistically significant difference (chi-square 
 <italic>p</italic> value = 0.042) was present in HEV detection in the three geographic areas. No positive samples were detected in 7 regions (Basilicata, Campania, Liguria, Sardinia Tuscany, Umbria, and Valle d’Aosta), while in the remaining 13 regions HEV occurrence ranged from 3.0% (Veneto) to 14.2% (Molise).
