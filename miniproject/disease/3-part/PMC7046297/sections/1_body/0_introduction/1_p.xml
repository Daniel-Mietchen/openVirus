<p>The first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since then the country suffers from repeated outbreaks of MERS-CoV in different provinces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>)[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There are two main routes of MERS-CoV transmission: animal-to-human and human-to-human[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is suspected that dromedary camels are the source of human infections[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] but the transmission route of MERS-CoV to humans is yet not well understood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, transmission from camels to humans is confirmed from the isolation of near-identical strains of MERS-CoV from epidemiologically coexisting camels and humans[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The patients might be exposed to MERS-CoV by consumption of raw camel products[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (e.g. milk and dairy products, raw meat, etc.). Meanwhile, human-to-human transmission has been reported in society and hospital settings[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with the virus being transmitted between humans during close human-to-human contact through droplets of respiratory secretions. Potential propagation to nearby and more distant regions is also a high-risk possibility as an outbreak of MERS-CoV is likely to emerge in areas such as nearby countries in the Middle East and eastern Africa where the camel trade connects the different regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Unfortunately, as for now, MERS-CoV vaccines are only at the preclinical phase[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], increasing our understanding of its epidemic potential and knowledge on the drivers of MERS-CoV variability might help to achieve better preparedness ahead of forthcoming epidemics.
