 </sup> During brain development, ganglioside expression undergoes massive qualitative and quantitative changes.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup> The ganglioside expression profile changes so that in embryonic rodent and human brain the predominant gangliosides are simple gangliosides like GM3 and GD3, while in adults more complex species such as GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b predominate

 </sup> This difference in ganglioside expression reflects changes in the expression of various glycosyltransferases, i.e., the enzymes needed for the synthesis of gangliosides.
