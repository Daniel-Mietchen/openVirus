<p id="Par8">Glycosphingolipids contain a hydrophobic ceramide or sphingoid lipid tail, which is usually anchored to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). They also contain an oligosaccharide moiety and are classified according to this carbohydrate structure (ganglio, isoganglio, lacto etc.).

 </sup> Gangliosides are a peculiar and particularly important subclass of glycosphingolipids, because they contain negatively charged sialic acids (N-acetylneuraminic acid or N-glycolylneuraminic acid) linked to the lipooligosaccharide moiety. Gangliosides are named and classified according to the number of sialic acid residues attached (M for one, D for two, T for 3 and Q for 4) to the inner sugar moiety and according to their chromatographic mobility (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup> The somewhat illogical numbering of the gangliosides (5−
 <italic>x</italic>) is based on the number (
 <italic>x</italic>) of the inner sugar moieties (glucose, galactose or GalNAc) according to the original experimental classification of Svennerholm.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> Thus, if 
 <italic>x</italic> is 4, the gangliosides are: GM1, GD1, GT1, 
 <italic>x</italic> = 3 for GM2, GD2, GT2, and 
 <italic>x</italic> = 2 for GM3, GD3, and GT3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).
