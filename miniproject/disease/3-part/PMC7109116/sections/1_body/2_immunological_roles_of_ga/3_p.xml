<p id="Par13">Another major immunological function of gangliosides and sialic acids is to protect our cells from our own complement attack and from autoimmunity. In general, sialic acids are not very immunogenic, although in some cases and with specific sialic acids immunization may occur and cause immune damage (see below). Gangliosides function in the recognition and protection of host organs and tissues from complement attack by binding the complement regulatory protein factor H.

 </sup> The complement system has a potentially strong cytotoxic and inflammation-inducing activity. Sialic acids provide a robust protection against complement killing of autologous cells. This is mediated by the binding of the soluble complement inhibitor factor H to the surface sialic acids, when the surfaces are threatened by C3b deposition.
