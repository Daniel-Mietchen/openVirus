<p id="Par4">Molecular targets for neuronal autoimmunity are being better recognized, but in some diseases, like multiple sclerosis (MS) and narcolepsy, uncertainty about the real targets still exists. The targets are not always exclusively proteins, but could include lipids or glycolipids, as well. Our aim in the present review is to summarize and highlight the possibility that antiganglioside antibodies (AGAs) could have a pathophysiological role and help in the diagnostics or prognostic evaluation of the diseases. AGAs are autoantibodies produced against gangliosides, which are sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids (Box

 </sup> In recent years, gangliosides received renewed interest as targets for cancer immunotherapy. It is known that the GD3 ganglioside is strongly expressed by melanoma cells.

 </sup> The clearest pathophysiological role for AGAs has been demonstrated in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). GBS and AGA appearance have been associated with different infectious agents such as
