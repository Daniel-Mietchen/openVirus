 <label>Box 1. Sphingolipids and sialic acids</label>
 <p id="Par6">Sphingolipids are constituents of plasma membranes that fulfill various functions, like membrane stability, adhesion, signaling and cell protection. They also act as receptors for hormones or toxins.

  </sup> A particular derivative of sphingolipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, has signaling functions to regulate the growth and survival of various cell types.

 <p id="Par7">Sialic acids are nine carbon acidic sugars that are enriched in the membranes of all vertebrate cells, and also in a few invertebrates. They can be attached to lipids or proteins.

  </sup> They owe their name to the term “saliva” (Greek σάλιο) because they were first identified in 1955 in the bovine salivary mucins.

  </sup> Given their negative charge, sialic acids can prevent unwanted interactions of erythrocytes in the blood circulation. They are necessary for maintaining the filtering function of the glomerular basement membranes of the kidney. They are also believed to affect neuronal plasticity.

  </sup> The functions of gangliosides remain related to the cells and the molecules which carry them.

  </sup> Sialic acids are also exploited by viruses like the influenza viruses, to be internalized into the host cells through interactions between the viral hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with sialic acids on the surfaces of e.g., the host respiratory epithelial cells.
