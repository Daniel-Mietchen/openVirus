<p id="Par24">Gangliosides have many roles in the development of infectious diseases and neurological conditions triggered by infections. In the beginning of infection, gangliosides and other glycosphingolipids can serve as receptors for the entry of many viruses, and for binding of bacteria and fungi, or for toxins produced by bacteria. Pathogens may also carry structural elements on their surfaces, e.g., lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS) which resemble gangliosides. This structural similarity may protect pathogenic bacteria from both innate and adaptive immune defense reactions of the host. On the other hand, in the absence or upon loss of tolerance to these structures, the microbial infections may lead to production of autoantibodies against gangliosides. These would be due to immunological cross-reactions that lead to production of AGAs, which recognize also host gangliosides.</p>
