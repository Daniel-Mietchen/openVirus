<p id="Par26">AIDP is the most common form of GBS. It is characterized by demyelination, probably mediated by antibodies against antigens in the paranodal region or directly on the Schwann cells. AIDP has been associated with antibodies against paranodal proteins like neurofascin 155 and contactin 1.

 </sup> Associations of AIDP with AGAs, such as GT1b

 </sup> are still controversial in the literature because a substantial number of AIDP cases could be reclassified as AMAN or AMSAN.

 </sup> As previously mentioned, axonal forms of the disease have been described, in which direct axonal damage is mediated by the attack of AGAs against gangliosides located in the nodes of Ranvier.

 </sup> Two main axonal forms of GBS are recognized: acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). According to Hughes and Cornblath, antibodies to GM1, GM1b, GD1a, and GalNac-GD1a are in particular implicated in acute motor axonal neuropathy and also, with the exception of GalNac-GD1a, in acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy.
