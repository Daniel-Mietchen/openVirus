<p id="Par17">As stated above, gangliosides are particularly enriched on the outer leaflets of neuronal membranes. Lipid rafts and gangliosides therein have been suggested to serve important neuronal functions, such as modulation of ion channels and transporters, neuronal interactions and recognition, Ranvier node stability and synaptic transmission. In general, gangliosides seem to have important roles in the maintenance of the nervous system.</p>
