<p id="Par18">Various diseases, especially those involving the neurological system and many neurodegenerative diseases may arise from disturbed ganglioside metabolism or alternatively from the action of antibodies directed against single or multiple targets. In 2004 mutations to GM3 synthase were identified as the cause of an autosomal recessive infantile-onset epilepsy syndrome.

 </sup> In addition, mutations in ST3GAL5, which codes for an enzyme necessary for ganglioside biosynthesis, result in an early-onset seizure disorder with motor and cognitive disturbances. Furthermore, mutations in B4GALNT1, a gene encoding for another enzyme of the ganglioside biosynthetic pathways, result in hereditary spastic paraplegia and intellectual deficits.
