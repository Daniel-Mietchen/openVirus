<p id="Par42">Gangliosides and especially their key variable components, sialic acids, are at the border of immune tolerance. In general, sialic acids protect and shield human cell and tissue structures against immune attacks. In consequence, certain microbes have learnt to mimic or exploit these structures to escape immune attack or to use them as receptors for entry into human tissues. On some occasions, however, the tolerance is broken, and the immune system succeeds in responding to the microbial mimics of sialic acids with consequent autoimmunity as a byproduct. Examples include neuronal autoimmune diseases like Guillain–Barré and Miller–Fisher syndromes.</p>
