<p id="Par35">It has been suggested that in Guillain-Barr√© syndrome AGAs play a role in the destruction of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of nerve cells. NMJ is rich in gangliosides and resides outside the blood-nerve barrier thus making it more vulnerable to attack by antibodies. In the Miller-Fisher variant of GBS, characterized by ataxia, areflexia and ophtalmoplegia, high titer AGAs against GQ1b are present in the majority of patients in the acute phase. These AGAs cross-react often with GT1a, and may react with GD3 and GD1b gangliosides, as well. They activate the human complement system and mediate complement-dependent injury in the motor nerve terminal.

 </sup> Complement activation will also attract leukocytes to neurons and contribute to activation of neutrophils and macrophages. Often, also T lymphocytes have been detected in the area of damage indicating a cell-mediated immune response. The activated immune cells can release cytokines and oxygen radicals to further damage the target cells. As a result, the protective myelin sheath and even the neuronal axons may become destroyed.
