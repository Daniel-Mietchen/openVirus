 </sup> The prevalence of narcolepsy is circa 30 per 100,000. It occurs in a bimodal distribution with two peaks at the ages of 15 and 35 years.

 </sup> Cataplexy is defined as a sudden loss of bilateral muscular tone, usually brought on by a strong emotional response. It is essentially unique to narcolepsy type I.

 </sup> A clue to the etiology of narcolepsy was obtained, when narcoleptic dogs were found to be genetically deficient in the orexin receptor type 2.

 </sup> Human NT1 is caused by a reduced orexinergic signaling, probably due to a loss of orexinergic neurons in the hypothalamus.

 </sup> The neuropeptide product of the neurons, orexin, is also known as hypocretin, encoded by the
