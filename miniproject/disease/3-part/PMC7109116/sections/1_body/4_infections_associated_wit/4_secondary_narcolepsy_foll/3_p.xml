<p id="Par39">Surprisingly, narcolepsy has been associated with the pandemic H1N1 flu vaccine. In Finland and Sweden, between October 2009 and August 2010, and later in other countries, after the vaccination campaign against the H1N1-type influenza A with the 
 <italic>Pandemrix</italic> vaccine (GSK), a clear increase in narcolepsy cases was reported. The cases were observed in particular in children and adolescents, ranging from 4 to 19 years of age. The vaccination increased the risk of developing narcolepsy 6.5–14.4-fold in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated ones.

 </sup> An increase in narcolepsy was not restricted to the flu vaccine. Interestingly, in China, in the absence of vaccination, a 6-fold increase in the incidence of narcolepsy was observed after the 2009 influenza pandemics.
