  <p>A model for the pathogenesis of secondary narcolepsy following Pandemrix® vaccination. In susceptible recipients, i.e., in those, who harbor the HLA- DQB1*06:02 allele, antigen presenting cells (APCs, dendritic cells and macrophages) gather at the injection site after the vaccine shot. Following the uptake of and response to vaccine components (e.g., H1 and N1 proteins, squalene, α-tocopherol, possible nucleoprotein or ganglioside impurities) the APCs migrate to the lymph node presenting the antigens to the T-cells through the MHC class II, inducing their activation. Eventually, through a process of molecular mimicry this mechanism could lead to a targeted attack against hypothalamic orexinergic neurons and to the subsequent narcolepsy onset. Antiganglioside antibodies could emerge upon complex formation between H1N1 proteins and the gangliosides, which would be picked up by the ganglioside responding B cells. T cells specific for the H1N1 proteins would provide the necessary help for antibody formation by B cells, and subsequently by plasma cells. Antiganglioside antibodies have an ability to both activate complement and to neutralize the complement inhibitory gangliosides on neuronal cell surfaces</p>
