<p>Brazil has been affected by outbreaks caused by viruses of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, such as dengue (DENV), Zika, and yellow fever viruses, along with co-infections with other arboviruses (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>). The amino acid sequences of polyproteins from viruses of this genus are very similar, which has limited the development of detection methods, often resulting in cross-reactions within serocomplexes during serologic testing (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>2</italic>
 </xref>). Therefore, tracking in areas where mosquito-specific flaviviruses co-circulate may have led to underestimated infections because of the detection and the hierarchy of disease based on medical importance.
