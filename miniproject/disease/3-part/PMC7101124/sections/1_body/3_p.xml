<p>Using nested PCR with genus-specific primers (

 </xref>), we detected the ROCV nonstructural (NS) 5 gene in 2 of the 121 samples. We used the amplified sequences from the ROCV NS5 gene for phylogenetic analysis, which confirmed 100% identity with the consensus sequence of ROCV NS5 in strain SPH 34675, the strain isolated from the 1975 encephalitis outbreak. Furthermore, the detected NS5 ROCV gene (ROCV 18) is related to Ilheus virus from the Japanese encephalitis virus complex and did not change the topology of the phylogenetic tree with other pathogenic flaviviruses, as previously reported (
