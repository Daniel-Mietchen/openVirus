<p>Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase is an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> designed enzyme homologue of 
 <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> DNA polymerase I. The enzyme contains 5′-3′ DNA polymerase activity and strong strand displacement activity, but lacks 5′-3′ exonuclease activity. Compared to its wild-type homologue, Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase has improved thermostability, salt tolerance, yield, and provides faster amplification [
