<p>Detection of amplified products in LAMP assays can also be accomplished by agarose gel electrophoresis. Here positive reactions generate ladder-like patterns, which correspond to the series of inverted repeats of the amplified target gene and cauliflower-like structures obtained from LAMP products reactions. This has been a popular method of detection for LAMP-based ZIKV assays [
