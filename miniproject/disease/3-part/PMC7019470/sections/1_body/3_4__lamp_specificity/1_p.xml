<p>For clinical validation of a diagnostic test, determination of its analytical and diagnostic specificity is required. Analytical specificity refers to the ability of an assay to unequivocally detect the target pathogen in a sample while remaining negative in the presence of relevant, non-target pathogens. Diagnostic specificity, in turn, refers to the probability that the test will be negative when the disease is absent (true negative rate).</p>
