<p>Recently, Guo et al. (2018) developed a real-time fluorescence RT-LAMP assay for ZIKV detection targeting the NS5 gene. In this study, the authors tested the assayâ€™s specificity against eight pathogens: 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC700603, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> ATCC19606, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> ATCC49619, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC25923, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic> ATCC49456, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC27853, 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> ATCC49766, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC25922. The results showed excellent specificity for the detection of ZIKV [

While exciting, this study evaluated analytical specificity only against bacterial species and not against arboviruses that cause similar symptoms to ZIKV. Moreover, the ZIKV strain used was the historical MR766 ZIKV strain, which is genetically very different from the contemporary epidemic ZIKV strains.
