<p>Similar to specificity, analytical and diagnostic sensitivities are key parameters for the validation of a diagnostic test. The analytical sensitivity, also known as the limit of detection (LOD) is the lowest amount of the analyte that can reliably be detected in a sample. On the other hand, diagnostic sensitivity refers to the probability that the test will be positive when the disease is present (true positive rate).</p>
