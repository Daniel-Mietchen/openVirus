<p>The LAMP for ZIKV has the potential to provide diagnostic performance equal to, or even superior to, RT-qPCR. This type of POC tool can bring decentralization of health care through diagnosis and also have great potential for producing reliable and fast results to assist physicians in decision-making and therapeutic management of patients. The next priorities for the field are to operationalize this capability into robust and simple kits for mainstream use.</p>
