<p>Other previously published papers also evaluated the efficacy of the RT-LAMP for diagnosis of the ZIKV in clinical samples and compared these results with RT-qPCR [

Using 131 clinical samples from suspected patients collected during the acute phase of the disease, including 68 saliva and 63 urine specimens, an RT-LAMP assay was able to detect the ZIKV in 53.4% of the total number of samples. Interestingly, this study showed that ZIKV detection using saliva had a faster time to positivity compared to urine samples [
