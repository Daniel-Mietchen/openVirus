<p>â€¢ The authors considered daily pageviews on 128 different Zika-related Wikipedia articles in 96 languages. However, it is not clear if the Web news captured all 96 languages. Similarly, the TV captions appear to only include English and Spanish. Therefore, it is not clear if the analyses performed are correct given that the different data streams analyzed may be measuring different populations. In short, the same languages should be captured in all the data streams.</p>
