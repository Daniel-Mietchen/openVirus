<p>As originally defined by Sandman [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], individual perception of risk is the result of a combination between the actual hazard and the emotional response in terms of concern, fear or anger. Sandman’s theory is often exemplified by the equation: Risk = Hazard + Outrage and it was one of the first attempt at ascribing to the public a role in risk communication, since in his view it’s the interplay between the external threats and personal aspects that shape the meaning of risk. Individual perception of risk during the 2016 ZIKV outbreak has probably decreased quickly, after it became clear that the infection did not pose an immediate threat to most individuals.
