<p>We showed Wikipedia data can capture collective attention during outbreaks, however, we did not link such signal with a measure of individual behavioral response or the adoption of health protecting behaviors in the population. Detecting health-related behavioral changes from Web sources remains a challenging task. Previous studies have used TV viewing data to infer the behavioral response during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico [

Further research is needed to infer causal patterns between collective attention and behavioral responses, and to identify the most suitable approach to integrate them into disease-behavior models.
