<p>These states are also those where the epidemic ZIKV activity in 2016 was the highest. In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007633.s009">S7 Table</xref>, we report results including all states with the only exception of Alaska, where no ZIKV cases were reported in 2016. We train the model via state-wise cross-validation and evaluate its performance using the determination coefficient 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient 
 <italic>r</italic> and the Spearman’s 
 <italic>ρ</italic>. Despite its simplicity, this equal-time linear regression demonstrates that both media signals, taken independently, are already quite informative of the Zika population-rescaled pageview time series: using exclusively TV close captions we obtain 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.61 and 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.80, while using only Web news we obtain 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.52 and 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.78. Combining both features, the linear model achieves 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.63 and 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.82. Similar results are obtained when considering the Spearman’s 
 <italic>ρ</italic> as a measure of performance (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As model performance is evaluated via state-wise cross-validation, these results highlight that national-level media signals are highly informative of state-level pageview time series, once they are rescaled to take into account population size. As a reference, we compare the results obtained with media features with an equal-time linear regression informed only by the epidemiological signal, that is the ZIKV incidence in each state. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, first row, the predictive performance of ZIKV incidence is generally poor with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = −0.398, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.032 and 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.152, in line with the time series analysis presented above.
