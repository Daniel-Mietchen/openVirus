<p>The available spatial granularity of Wikipedia pageview data allowed us to further inspect how the above picture changes when moving from a national perspective to States and U.S. cities. Notably, the temporal dynamics of attention to the Zika-related Wikipedia pages in 2016 was highly synchronized across all the 50 States. Although the relative risk of case importation and local transmission varied significantly from state to state, being the Southern States more at risk due to vector’s presence and abundance [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the cross-correlation matrix of Wikipedia pageview time series by State ranges from

 <italic>r</italic> = 0.99 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) for New York and New Jersey. Overall, the correlation of the Wikipedia pageviews in each state with the national timeline was always higher than 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.88 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), indicating a high degree of spatial uniformity across the country. Given the above mentioned correlation of Wikipedia pageviews with the TV coverage of the epidemic and the mentions of Zika on the Web, the attention patterns at State level were also highly correlated with the national media coverage suggesting a fundamental role of news exposure as a driver of public attention at all geographic scales.
