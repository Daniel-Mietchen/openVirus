<p>ZIKV is a RNA virus from the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family which is mainly transmitted by infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, although there have been cases of sexual and perinatal transmission. Infection is mostly asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but it can lead to serious and sometimes fatal neurological defects in neonates born to ZIKV infected women. In particular, following the association between ZIKV and a cluster of microcephaly cases in Brazil [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As of March 2017, ZIKV has spread worldwide to 79 countries where there has been evidence of an ongoing vector-borne virus transmission. The most affected region has been the American continent with 47 countries or territories reporting local ZIKV transmission, due to the extensive presence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in almost all the region’s countries [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In such epidemiological context, the ZIKV epidemic has posed peculiar communication challenges to the public due to its association with microcephaly in newborns, its transmission modalities, and its prevalence in areas where the virus was never detected before and that was suddenly characterized by intense international travel due to the 2016 Summer Olympics [
