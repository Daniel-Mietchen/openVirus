A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources&#x02014;Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive&#x02014;to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Despite its importance for public health policy-makers, understanding the impact of media coverage on collective attention during disease outbreaks remains an elusive research task, due to the lack of available data, especially at high spatial granularity. In this paper, we study the dynamics of collective attention received by the 2016 Zika epidemic in the USA and its interplay with the media coverage of the outbreak, at level of US states and cities. We measure the attention to Zika through geo-localized Wikipedia page view data, and we compare it with mentions of Zika in US news outlets and TV shows. We also compare the collective attention received by the outbreak with the incidence of Zika reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in each state. We find that the attention dynamics was highly synchronized across states, irrespective of the local risk of transmission of the virus. By building a linear regression model, we show that the dynamics of collective attention is highly predictable, even at state level, only based on the national media coverage received by the outbreak.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007364</institution-id><institution>Fondazione CRT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lagrange Project</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>MT, AP, DP and CC acknowledge the support by the Lagrange Project of the ISI Foundation funded by the CRT Foundation.

A 2013 study [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] found that 59% of U.S. adults had looked for health information on the Web in the previous year and that about one in three U.S. adults use the Internet to figure out what medical condition they have. The fruition of news sources, either traditional such as television, radio and newspapers, or digital such as Web news or online social networks, has become crucial in how health information is delivered and it can play a fundamental role in shaping opinions, awareness and behaviours. In the past ten years, several studies have addressed the impact of awareness and information spread during epidemic outbreaks and it has been reported that the degree of public attention and concern induced by an epidemic threat might affect the disease transmission dynamics [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, modeling efforts have been mostly theoretical and a large-scale empirical characterization of the adoption of health protective behaviours, either induced by information spread or media exposure, and its interplay with the disease dynamics during an epidemic outbreak has been elusive so far due to the lack of available data [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Here, we study a large-scale dataset on spatio-temporally resolved accesses to Wikipedia pages on the 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, regarded as a proxy for collective attention to this emerging health threat. The epidemic started in Brazil in 2015 and spread to other parts of South and North America in 2016. This study focuses on attention patterns in the United States throughout 2016, and on their relation to media coverage of the epidemic.</p><p>ZIKV is a RNA virus from the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family which is mainly transmitted by infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, although there have been cases of sexual and perinatal transmission. Infection is mostly asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but it can lead to serious and sometimes fatal neurological defects in neonates born to ZIKV infected women. In particular, following the association between ZIKV and a cluster of microcephaly cases in Brazil [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ZIKV epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on February 1st, 2016 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The emergency lasted until November 18th 2016, when the WHO declared the PHEIC to be over [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As of March 2017, ZIKV has spread worldwide to 79 countries where there has been evidence of an ongoing vector-borne virus transmission. The most affected region has been the American continent with 47 countries or territories reporting local ZIKV transmission, due to the extensive presence of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in almost all the region&#x02019;s countries [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In such epidemiological context, the ZIKV epidemic has posed peculiar communication challenges to the public due to its association with microcephaly in newborns, its transmission modalities, and its prevalence in areas where the virus was never detected before and that was suddenly characterized by intense international travel due to the 2016 Summer Olympics [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The communication challenges posed by ZIKV are well exemplified in a manual released in 2017 by the WHO European Region [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] on how to deal with the complex communication challenges of ZIKV and mosquito borne disease outbreaks in general. Among the main communication issues listed in the manual, besides <italic>Dealing with uncertainty</italic> and <italic>Rumor management</italic>, there are <italic>Increase in information demand</italic> and <italic>Managing evolving information</italic>. The last two are particularly interesting as they refer to the massive demand for information from the public, and from media as well, and to the necessity of adapting public health communication as more is learned about the outbreak and scientific knowledge about Zika virus and its complications evolve.</p><p>Public polls conducted in the United States evidenced the lack of knowledge about ZIKV in the general population and more specifically in groups at risk, such as pregnant women [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The novelty of the disease and the lack of previous knowledge of it in the affected areas make the 2016 ZIKV epidemic an ideal case study to characterize collective attention patterns, identify their drivers and test traditional modeling assumptions. Intuitively, mass media coverage represents the main driver of public attention during an epidemic. Indeed, several peculiarities of media narratives around public health hazards [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and infectious diseases [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have been elucidated, but a general and quantitative comprehension of how the public opinion responds to media exposure during an emerging epidemic threat is still lacking. The majority of modeling studies assume that media exposure is driving behavioural changes, hence media exposure effects are incorporated into some kind of <italic>media function</italic> that modulates individual behaviors and may affect disease dynamics [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The general assumption is that as the number of cases increases and is reported by mass media, the susceptibility of individuals will decrease due to increasing awareness and the associated behavioral changes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, for most disease outbreaks, such modeling assumptions have never been supported by direct empirical evidence.</p><p>Our study analyses time-resolved and geo-localized Wikipedia pageview counts to investigate the dynamics of public attention in the United States, during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic. Accesses to Wikipedia pages represent a signal of information seeking behavior, defined as the deliberate process in which individuals actively aim to acquire new knowledge by searching for information on a specific topic [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our study, we considered such indicator to be a proxy for measuring the collective attention to the outbreak. Specifically, we considered the daily pageview counts on 128 different Zika-related Wikipedia articles (96 languages) in the U.S. to be an unambiguous indicator of collective attention to the epidemic. We investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of pageviews in relation to the timeline of ZIKV incidence reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and in relation to the coverage of the ZIKV epidemic by local and national media sources. In particular, we focused on news coverage of the ZIKV epidemic by online media and television in 2016, available in digital format through the GDELT project and the Internet Archive (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Methods</xref> for a full description of the data under study).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Temporal profile of collective attention and news coverage</title><p>Public attention and media coverage of the 2016 ZIKV epidemic showed a distinct and synchronous temporal pattern, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The daily timeline of Wikipedia pageviews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) highlights two distinct peaks of attention in 2016: the first, in the beginning of February 2016, corresponding to the international alert raised by the WHO and by the CDC at national level; the second, in August 2016, corresponding to the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which attracted significant attention due to the health concerns for athletes and the related risk of case importation. Such spikes of attention visibly correspond to similar spikes in the media coverage profiles, both in the TV coverage of the epidemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and in the Web news coverage of Zika (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

The number of new ZIKV cases in the United States reported by the CDC every week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) gradually increased from the beginning of 2016 until the summer, with a peak between the end of August and the beginning of September. Notifications of new cases declined afterwards. Summer 2016 was also characterized by the first reports of local ZIKV transmission in Florida and in Texas, events that were also responsible for an increased news coverage of Zika. However, the surge of reported ZIKV cases in the United States did not result in an increased level of attention with respect to the initial spike observed at the beginning of the outbreak. The epidemic profile is indeed not correlated with the timeline of Wikipedia pageviews (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.26) or the media coverage profiles (<italic>r</italic> = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.80 for TV and <italic>r</italic> = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.47, for Web news). Such dynamics of public attention can be ascribed to the initial novelty of the outbreak, which was presented as a novel and serious health threat even in the presence of a small number of imported cases. As the extension of the outbreak and the associated risks became clearer to the public, the interest of Americans in looking for additional information on Wikipedia faded over the course of the year, with relatively smaller increments linked to important events such as the Olympics. Such observation is consistent with the presence of a memory effect in the dynamics of Wikipedia pageviews: individuals retain information for some time before their attention toward a topic is elicited again by novel events or anniversaries [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Spatial patterns of collective attention</title><p>The available spatial granularity of Wikipedia pageview data allowed us to further inspect how the above picture changes when moving from a national perspective to States and U.S. cities. Notably, the temporal dynamics of attention to the Zika-related Wikipedia pages in 2016 was highly synchronized across all the 50 States. Although the relative risk of case importation and local transmission varied significantly from state to state, being the Southern States more at risk due to vector&#x02019;s presence and abundance [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the Wikipedia pageview timelines were all highly correlated, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g002">Fig 2</xref>.

Given the above mentioned correlation of Wikipedia pageviews with the TV coverage of the epidemic and the mentions of Zika on the Web, the attention patterns at State level were also highly correlated with the national media coverage suggesting a fundamental role of news exposure as a driver of public attention at all geographic scales.</p><fig id="pcbi.1007633.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007633.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Correlation of public attention timelines by state.</title><p>Pearson correlation matrix of the daily Wikipedia pageviews time series of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007633.g002"/></fig><p>One could argue that local patterns of attention may be influenced by local news and local epidemic events, such as case importations or a local increase of disease prevalence. We tested these hypotheses by comparing Wikipedia pageview counts in each state to Web news mentioning the word &#x0201c;Zika&#x0201d; and the name of the state, and to the local ZIKV incidence profiles. Attention profiles in each state were generally positively correlated to Web news mentioning the name of the state, however the degree of correlation ranged from <italic>r</italic> = 0.004 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.98) in Wisconsin to <italic>r</italic> = 0.75 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) in Texas, showing significant spatial differences across the country (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007633.s005">S3 Table</xref> in the Supporting Information). Interestingly, ZIKV incidence in each state could explain such geographic variations as a negative driver of attention. On the one hand, local patterns of attention in each state were generally not correlated with disease incidence, with the exception of Montana (<italic>r</italic> = 0.33, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007633.s006">S4 Table</xref> of the Supporting Information. On the other hand, Web news covering Zika in each state were positively correlated with the local incidence profiles (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003e; 0.20) only in 13 states out of 50 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007633.s007">S5 Table</xref> in the Supporting Information) and, at the same time, these states showed the smallest degree of correlation between news and attention. A direct comparison of the 50 states ranked by degree of correlation between news and ZIKV incidence, and between news and attention, showed a negative rank correlation: weighted Kendall&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> = &#x02212;0.25 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Overall, in those states where local news were following more closely the local epidemic patterns, the dynamics of public attention was not driven much by news. Instead, local attention patterns followed more closely the state news where the latter was more similar to the national one and less correlated with the local ZIKV epidemiology.</p><p>It is natural to ask whether correlations between patterns of attention and disease risk may change by looking at different spatial resolutions. To answer this question, we examined the attention to ZIKV in 788 cities of the United States with a population larger than 40,000 and compared it to their total Wikipedia viewership. By ranking the U.S. cities based on their total volume of Wikipedia pageviews in 2016, and comparing such ranking with the one based on pageviews of Zika-related articles only, we identified locations where the attention to ZIKV was higher than expected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, cities on the East Coast of Florida showed the highest relative attention to ZIKV, when compared to their overall Wikipedia activity. Other relevant outliers with high attention were cities in Texas and in the Northeast. On the contrary, the lowest attention to ZIKV was observed in cities in California, and in the Midwest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These results suggest that increases in public attention at city level may be explained by risk perception due to the presence of the vector (as in Florida and Texas). However, the high level of attention in other places, such as Union City, NJ, can not be easily explained by epidemiological risk factors and it may be due to specific events, such as one or more case importations, that do not appear in our dataset.</p><fig id="pcbi.1007633.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007633.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Spatial patterns of attention.</title><p>Cities of the United States, with population higher than 40,000, where the volume of attention to ZIKV related pages was higher (panel A) or lower (panel B) than expected based on the total volume of pageviews to Wikipedia in 2016.

To better assess the mutual relationships between news coverage, Wikipedia pageviews and Zika incidence, we turn to a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, a technique that is commonly used in the analysis of multivariate time series [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

By computing the Schwartz-Bayes information criterion (BIC) and the Hannan-Quinn criterion for different VAR(<italic>L</italic>) models, with <italic>L</italic> ranging between 1 and 40, we identify the optimal time lag to be <italic>L</italic> = 8 days. A Granger causality test based on the best VAR model shows that each variable does Granger-cause the other two variables in the model, with a smaller effect of Web news (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) with respect to TV (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) and Wikipedia pageviews (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). On the other hand, a Wald-type test supports a relationship of instantaneous causality among all the three variables: Web news instantaneously cause Wikipedia pageviews and TV mentions (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 86.321, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>); TV mentions instantaneously cause Wikipedia pageviews and Web news (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 97.335, df = 2, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>); Wikipedia pageviews instantaneously cause Web news and TV mentions (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 89.23, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>).</p><p>To include the ZIKV incidence timeline in our analysis, we build another VAR model with 4 weekly time series: Zika-related pageviews, TV mentions, Web news and ZIKV incidence. For this model we identify the optimal time lag to be <italic>L</italic> = 2 weeks, based on the Schwartz-Bayes information criterion. A Granger causality test using the VAR(2) model identifies a causal relationship between Wikipedia pageviews and the other variables (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>), and a causal relationship between Web news and the other variables (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Again, based on a Wald test, an instantaneous causal relationship between TV captions, Web news and Wikipedia pageviews and the other variables is supported (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>).

That is, we assume that information seeking behavior in Wikipedia is driven, at any given point in time, by same-week exposure to media sources. Since our goal is uncovering drivers of collective attention, rather than achieving optimal prediction of the empirical time series, we choose an equal-time modeling approach over standard time series modeling techniques (e.g., autoregressive models). More specifically, we start with a linear regression model that predicts population-rescaled pageview counts for a given week and a given state using only national Web news and TV data for the same week. We focus on 43 states with population in excess of 1 million, comprising more than 98% of the U.S. population according to 2016 United States Census Bureau estimates [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>These states are also those where the epidemic ZIKV activity in 2016 was the highest.

Despite its simplicity, this equal-time linear regression demonstrates that both media signals, taken independently, are already quite informative of the Zika population-rescaled pageview time series: using exclusively TV close captions we obtain <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.61 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.80, while using only Web news we obtain <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.52 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.78. Combining both features, the linear model achieves <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.63 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.82.

Collective attention to the ZIKV outbreak thus seems to have been mainly driven by news exposure and much less by the disease transmission dynamics, although the epidemic profile of ZIKV infections varied significantly from state to state and the risk of local transmission was not uniform across the country. Such picture describes a scenario where the awareness of the epidemic in the country is globally present, while local effects, as those due to the local spreading of awareness, play a less important role, following the terminology first introduced by Funk et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Media outlets in the U.S. have a prominent role in defining the on-line public discourse [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The impact of media exposure on the collective awareness and risk perception during epidemic outbreaks has been investigated in previous works [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], however, only a few studies have attempted to quantitatively measure the effect of media engagement on epidemic awareness using empirical data from Web sources on a large scale [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While previous studies have focused on newspaper coverage of epidemics [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we investigated the relationship between the exposure to TV coverage and online news, and the attention to Wikipedia pages. Our study confirms the high sensitivity of Wikipedia searches to breaking news and official announcements, in particular in the case of disaster events, as found by previous studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand, the temporal dynamics of Wikipedia pageviews during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic showed a nonlinear dependence with media coverage: the Wikipedia pages activity was high in the initial phases of the outbreak, but it declined more quickly than media coverage. This can be explained by the fact that information on Wikipedia is rather static, and users will view Wikipedia pages immediately after the news breaks but they will not return in the next days, unless more recent events renew their attention [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Although assuming that collective attention follows media coverage is rather plausible, a Granger-causality analysis did not evidence a preferential causal relationship between pageviews and news sources. On the other hand, our data support an instantaneous causal relationship between Wikipedia readership and media coverage, suggesting that nowcasting Wikipedia pageviews based on the volume of media coverage is feasible.</p><p>During the 2016 ZIKV outbreak, different aspects of the epidemic, and the risks associated with the disease, received different levels of coverage by traditional media sources, depending on their level of newsworthiness. In general, media coverage was influenced by several factors, and only to a lesser extent by the progression of the epidemic. Although from a journalist&#x02019;s perspective, it may be expected that news did not necessarily follow the number of ZIKV cases, such result highlight the limitations of several behavioral epidemic models that incorporate media effects. Indeed, choices made by journalists regarding newsworthiness of specific aspects related to ZIKV infection affected the level of knowledge and familiarity in the US population [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Also, the media narrative around ZIKV evolved over time, as found in a recent study by Yotam Ophir [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The content of the ZIKV news coverage shifted from focusing on scientific themes, at the beginning of the outbreak, to the description of social disruptions during the Summer Olympics. Since we did not examine the textual content of news items in our dataset, further research should identify specific themes emerging from media outlets that are most significantly associated to Wikipedia viewership during epidemic outbreaks. Also, we relied on the automatic tagging system provided by GDELT to identify news items mentioning Zika. However, the classification algorithm may have limitations and some items could be less relevant than others. Further research should assess the quality of the GDELT news tagging algorithm in the specific case of epidemic outbreaks [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Another limitation of our analysis is that we considered the content of mass media outlets only, and did not look into other news sources, such as online social networks. However, social media often provide an amplification channel for traditional media sources and online users consume information that is not very different from what appears on mass meda [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>From an epidemiological standpoint, our results are consistent with the recent findings of Bragazzi et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], who analysed various data streams to measure the global reaction to the 2015-2016 ZIKV outbreaks in different countries. Similarly, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the viewership of Wikipedia pages and the ZIKV incidence data in the U.S. The correlation between ZIKV incidence and media coverage was also mild, and varied from state to state, confirming that media coverage was only relatively influenced by the actual progression of the epidemic over time.</p><p>The spatial granularity of Wikipedia pageview data would in principle allow for a more detailed geo-spatial analysis of time series data, in particular regarding languages and behavioral response by geographic areas. On the other hand, increasing the spatial resolution of the pageview data analysis could expose sensitive information about Wikipedia users&#x02019; locations and preferences. In our study, we decided to limit the risks associated to such analysis by looking only at cumulative pageview data in the US cities.</p><p>Our results have implications from a public health perspective. The importance of mass media coverage in eliciting the public attention to announcements by the CDC at the beginning of the Zika outbreak was highlighted by a recent study by Southwell et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Consistently, we found that Wikipedia page activity was highest in conjunction of the alert raised by the CDC, suggesting that media coverage of official communications by public health authorities could effectively capture the public attention and elicit information seeking.</p><p>One might argue that our results may not generalize to all epidemic outbreaks. Indeed, the peculiar characteristics of the ZIKV infection, such as its association to mild symptoms and the relatively small size of the population at risk, due to the spatial distribution of the vector, may have influenced the attention dynamics during the outbreak.</p><p>As originally defined by Sandman [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], individual perception of risk is the result of a combination between the actual hazard and the emotional response in terms of concern, fear or anger. Sandman&#x02019;s theory is often exemplified by the equation: Risk = Hazard + Outrage and it was one of the first attempt at ascribing to the public a role in risk communication, since in his view it&#x02019;s the interplay between the external threats and personal aspects that shape the meaning of risk. Individual perception of risk during the 2016 ZIKV outbreak has probably decreased quickly, after it became clear that the infection did not pose an immediate threat to most individuals.</p><p>Moreover, survey based studies have found the perceived risk of infection for oneself to decrease considerably over time, during the course of a chikungunya outbreak, another vector-borne disease similar to ZIKV [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>From the point of view of media coverage, the fact that most of ZIKV cases were asymptomatic, may have reduced newsworthiness, as media tend to pay more attention to visually compelling topics [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Epidemic outbreaks caused by different pathogens, possibly characterized by a higher transmissibility and more evident clinical symptoms, such as the Ebola virus or pandemic influenza, may lead to different attention patterns by media outlets, raising substantial more concern, and more persistently, in the population. However, it is reasonable to believe that media coverage would be, in any case, the main driver of collective attention, as it also has been during the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The increasing availability of novel data streams, such as social media, Web search queries and participatory surveillance data, provides an invaluable resource to measure and quantify the complex interplay between the spread of information, collective attention and the epidemiology of infectious diseases [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recently, Wikipedia pageview data have been increasingly used by researchers in epidemiology and infectious disease modeling [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The overall value of Wikipedia data to measure and forecast the dynamics of infectious diseases has been debated [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and, in general, Wikipedia-based forecasting models have been proved successful in the case of endemic or seasonal diseases, such as influenza, dengue or tubercolosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. On the other hand, our study demonstrates that Wikipedia page viewership can provide a temporally resolved measure of collective attention during epidemic outbreaks caused by novel emerging diseases, at a high spatial granularity. Previous works have investigated the effects of external events on the activity of Wikipedia editors and on the number of pageviews [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. More generally, the characterization of the usage of Wikipedia as a source of information and as a proxy for measuring the global attention to real-world events has been studied [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The results of our study add further evidence of the value of Wikipedia data in the field of digital epidemiology, especially for capturing information seeking behavior, and attention patterns during disease outbreaks [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>We showed Wikipedia data can capture collective attention during outbreaks, however, we did not link such signal with a measure of individual behavioral response or the adoption of health protecting behaviors in the population. Detecting health-related behavioral changes from Web sources remains a challenging task. Previous studies have used TV viewing data to infer the behavioral response during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. More recently, Poletto el al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] showed that an increased collective attention was correlated to changes in the hospital management of MERS-Cov patients, reducing the time from admission to isolation. Further research is needed to infer causal patterns between collective attention and behavioral responses, and to identify the most suitable approach to integrate them into disease-behavior models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Data sources</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Wikipedia pageview counts</title><p>We collected hourly pageview data of the English Wikipedia pages &#x0201c;Zika virus&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus</ext-link>) and &#x0201c;Zika fever&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_fever">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_fever</ext-link>) and their counterparts in 96 different Wikipedia projects.

All 3 reviewers, in some form, raised the issue of interpreting correlations as causative and the direction of that causation. R3, in particular, raises several issues about whether or not information seeking or simply increased attention, and specifically increased media attention. This should be discussed further in a revision.</p><p>R1 and R3 raise several questions about the inclusion of articles in the study (and the possibility of duplicates). If it is possible to address these by looking at the sensitivity of the results to alternate inclusion criteria, this should be done. If this is not possible, then the authors should at least provide text that would answer to the reviewers' questions in the main text.</p><p>The reviewers also raise a number of small technical questions that should be clarified.</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold></p><p>Reviewer #1: The authors have submitted an enjoyable, thoughtful, and timely paper. I enjoyed assessing it. The manuscript and the study harbor some important weaknesses, however, that should be addressed before moving forward.</p><p>Although the paper is generally well written, the piece would benefit from some additional copyediting. For example, there appears to be an errant question mark in brackets on page 11 of the PDF. The title also may be somewhat misleading, as I believe this is a study of behavior in the US relative to the Zika outbreak but the 2016 outbreak wasn't limited to the US nor was it really centered in the US, per se. The transmission that actually occurred in the US was quite limited. The authors might just want to revisit how exactly they are framing the phenomenon being studied. There was US transmission but much of the news coverage driving the search behavior reflected international events, unless I am mistaken.</p><p>The authors also miss an opportunity to connect this work to other highly relevant results that have appeared in other journals. Consider, for example, Southwell et al. in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a piece that connects news coverage, search data, and social media data regarding the Zika outbreak discussed here. The story is remarkably similar to what we found and so that would be an important foundational citation for the discussion here. Of course, the outcome measures of information seeking are somewhat different but nonetheless the story of ephemeral effect driven by news coverage that was not completely tied to actual epidemiological patterns is consistent. Beyond that, the authors also have an opportunity to connect this piece with a limited but nonetheless important subset of the communication research literature which has looked at communication as a process unfolding over time and which as a result has included time-based analysis of news effects on behavior.</p><p>On a related note, the other major limitation of the paper is the mismatch between theoretically longitudinal concerns with correlational data. Chances are good that time series analysis will tell us a similar story as the correlational analyses here but nonetheless because cases are ordered in time there is a risk that the analysis presented unfairly capitalizes on lurking autocorrelation in the data. The authors should comment on that and either present their findings using time series analysis or at least assure readers that such analysis provides a similar story in a detailed note.</p><p>If the authors can address these concerns, they will very likely improve the contribution of the piece.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Southwell, B. G., Dolina, S., Jimenez-Magdaleno, K., Squiers, L. B., &#x00026; Kelly, B. J. (2016). Zika virus&#x02013;related news coverage and online behavior, United States, Guatemala, and Brazil. Emerging Infectious Diseases, 22(7), 1320-1321.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This paper attempts to measure the drivers leading to information seeking in Wikipedia during the 2016 U.S. Zika outbreak. Specifically, the authors applied various statistical approaches to compare Wikipedia page view data against U.S. news outlets and TV shows at various spatial resolutions (i.e., national, state, and city level). The authors found that Wikipedia searches were driven by national media coverage and not by the magnitude of the outbreak. Although the methodology used is simple, the results are important for understanding the impact of media exposure on collective population behavior.</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>&#x02022; Overall, very limited results are presented for the state and city-level analyses. Given the geo-localized Wikipedia pageview available to the authors, the paper could be strengthened by providing timeseries at the state and city level as well as more detailed analyses that showcase the various behavioral responses by geography and language.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors considered daily pageviews on 128 different Zika-related Wikipedia articles in 96 languages. However, it is not clear if the Web news captured all 96 languages. Similarly, the TV captions appear to only include English and Spanish. Therefore, it is not clear if the analyses performed are correct given that the different data streams analyzed may be measuring different populations. In short, the same languages should be captured in all the data streams.</p><p>&#x02022; A discussion on why the authors decided to only use Zika and Zika virus for most of the articles analyzed is warranted. Similarly, a justification on why they decided to focus on 43 states with population in excess of 1 million is needed.</p><p>&#x02022; Are duplicate news articles included or removed from the analyses (GDELT)?</p><p>&#x02022; What is the scaling exponent for city-level analyses? Does the scaling exponent (beta) change for each state or it remains constant across all the states?</p><p>&#x02022; The authors should consider including tables for the correlations between Wikipedia and TV shows in the supplementary material.</p><p>&#x02022; It&#x02019;s hard to read the states in Figure 3, consider increasing the font.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>&#x02022; A reference is missing in page 11.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This is a very important, well-articulated, and thorough study, creatively using preexisting novel data to evaluate the relationships between Zika cases, news coverage, and Wikipedia visits. I have several reservations regarding the analysis and would strongly suggest you adding some missing literature (see below), but I believe these may be addressed through a revision. I applaud the authors for the meticulous and creative methodological work. My specific comments are as follow:</p><p>1) I suggest you add Sandman's perspective of risk into your literature and into the interpretation of the results. Sandman in his work on risk perception did a pretty good job explaining why experts perceive risk differently from health organizations such as the CDC. He has a list of what he called outrage factors - like novelty (see Sandman, 1987. Risk Communication: Facing Public Outrage), that could really explain why people in your study seem to have lost interest with time. Paul Slovic had some similar work that could also be implemented here - in any case, I think you should add a discussion of risk perception of laypersons and how it is different from that of experts - both Sandman and Slovic could be useful here. Following their perspective - your results are expected and make sense.</p><p>2) Information seeking - you seem to shift back and forth between collective attention and information seeking. First, I think some additional literature is needed re health info seeking - Nehama Lewis recently wrote a value on information seeking and scanning (2017) for the International Encyclopedia of Media Effects that could be useful. Second, be consistent with your main DV. Do you measure attention to information seeking?</p><p>3) Your analysis will also benefit from discussing a recent study that looked at the relationships between Zika news coverage and public knowledge, familiarity and information sharing in the US - using a large national survey. The paper is: Ophir &#x00026; Jamieson (2018). The Effects of Zika Virus Risk Coverage on Familiarity, Knowledge and Behavior in the U.S. &#x02013; A Time Series Analysis Combining Content Analysis and a Nationally Representative Survey. This seems especially relevant to your inquiry.</p><p>4) on p3 - you need to elaborate more on why ZIKV is a communication challenge - the explanations you bring are for why it was a public health challenge, not necessarily a communication one. Use risk or crisis communication literature here.</p><p>5) p4 - CDC should be Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (add "and Prevention")</p><p>6) p5 - I'm very concerned with the use of Pearson correlation for variables that will definitely be influenced by autocorrelation. In such case, where I expect autoregression in both observed and unobserved variables that could be correlated with the dependent, I strongly prefer the use of vector auroregression models (VARS). VARS models could be coupled with Granger causality tests to support a causal direction as well.</p><p>7) also on p5 - it has to do with the literature but I really don't think you should have expected a linear relationship between number of new cases and public reaction. First of all, while it's true that new cases were added, other prior cases were solved... and in almost all cases - Zika came and went without leaving any harm. So it completely makes sense to me that people lost interest in Zika after a while (with an exception for the Rio olympics where people probably considered its effects on visitors and athletes-- which was also prevalent in news coverage).</p><p>8) Similarly for the media - we have strong reasons to expect the media NOT to follow the number of cases. Again, I think some literature is missing here - something on newsworthiness (Galtung &#x00026; Rouge, 1965 or something similar). For various reasons, Zika was just not interesting for journalists. It gained some attention when it was new and mostly unknown, but other than its effects on golfers etc. it wasn't a big deal for journalists. You can see more about changes in content in Ophir. (2018). Coverage of epidemics in American newspapers through the lens of the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication Framework</p><p>9) p6 - how reliable do you believe the geographic data is? is it based on ip addresses? these are often inaccurate</p><p>10) still on p6 - you measure correlations, but by doing that you assume the public follows the media. While plausible, it could also be that journalists "feel" the public interest and opinion (for example in social media) and are therefore affected by people's attention to the disease. You should be careful about the causal assumption here and explain that it could be the other way around. Again - it would be helpful to use autoregressive models with Granger causality to provide additional support for direction, including the optimal lag.</p><p>11) p11 - line 254 - there is a question mark where a citation number should appear - "disease similar to ZIKV [?]"</p><p>12) p12 - I think you're too harsh on yourself saying you didn't measure public behavior. Information seeking is a behavior - you could say that you didn't measure behavior on the individual level, or did not measure health-related behavior, but information seeking is definitely a behavior and Wikipedia seems like a reasonable proxy for that.</p><p>13) I'm worried about your decision to limit articles to those including both Zika and United States - Do you really think all relevant articles will include the term "United States"? For example,- people interested in the Rio olympics in Brazil will look at articles that do not use the term US. Also - you assume that only articles that explicitly connect the disease to the States will have an impact, which might not be the case. Anyway - I would remove the US condition from your search and look at all US media mentions of Zika. But if you decide to stick with your decision, at least explain why you did so in the discussion section and how it affects your conclusions.</p><p>14) notice that figures are in low resolution.
