<p>Reliable and cost-effective diagnostics for HEV infection are necessary for both low- and high-income countries. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the diagnostic robustness of HEV antibody tests (IgM, IgG and in a subgroup IgA) versus HEV PCR in a large German cohort and to investigate if immunosuppression has an impact on the reliability of the diagnostics.</p>
