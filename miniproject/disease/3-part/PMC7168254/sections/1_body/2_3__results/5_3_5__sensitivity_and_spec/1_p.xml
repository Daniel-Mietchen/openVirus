<p>Next, we wanted to evaluate if the lack of detection of HEV-specific antibodies in HEV RNA positive individuals differs between immunocompetent patients and patients under immunosuppression. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00137-f002">Figure 2</xref>, HEV IgG antibodies were detectable in all immunocompetent HEV RNA positive individuals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13, 100%), while 17 (35.4%) immunosuppressed patients with HEV RNA had no HEV IgG antibodies. HEV IgM was absent in one immunocompetent patient (7.7%) with detectable HEV RNA and in eleven (22.9%) immunosuppressed patients. HEV RNA positive/HEV IgM and IgG negative patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 20.8%) were only to be found in the group of immunosuppressed patients (two patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, three patients after liver transplantation, one patient after kidney transplantation, one patient with overlap syndrome with primary biliary cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis under immunosuppressive therapy, two patients with lymphoma and one patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia). Overall, these data indicate that especially in immunosuppressed patients HEV antibody testing without additional detection of HEV PCR is insufficient. In addition, also in immunocompetent HEV RNA positive patients, HEV IgM can be missing.
