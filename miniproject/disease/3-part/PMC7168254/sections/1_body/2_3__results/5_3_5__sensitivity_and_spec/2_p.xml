<p>Overall, when comparing the detection of HEV IgM by Euroimmun ELISA with the “gold standard” of HEV RNA detection, immunosuppression was associated with a reduction of sensitivity and specificity of the HEV IgM ELISA test. The estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV, respectively) for the total of our patient cohort and the immunocompetent and immunosuppressed subgroups are shown in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00137-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Especially the reduced sensitivity in immunocompromised individuals indicated that at least in this patient cohort HEV RNA testing was mandatory to confirm diagnosis of HEV infection.
