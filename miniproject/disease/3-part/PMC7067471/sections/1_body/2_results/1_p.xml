<p>A total of 393 mosquitoes were collected in four samples, all identified as 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>(Stegomyia) albopictus</italic> (Skuse, 1894) and females. ZIKV was amplified in the subsample 2f (subsample f of sample 2). The presence of the human Cytb gene in the subsample 2f suggests that one or more mosquitos in such a pool were engorged. Subsample 3i (subsample i of sample 3) was positive for DENV-1, and no human DNA was detected in it (
