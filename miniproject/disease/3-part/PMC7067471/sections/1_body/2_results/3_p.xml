<p>The envelope gene of the DENV-1 was successfully amplified and sequenced. The reconstructed phylogenetic tree shows that DENV-1 found in the study belongs to genotype V (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229847.g002">Fig 2</xref>, clade A). This virus was closely related to strains identified in other Brazilian states in previous years: São José do Rio Preto, in 2012 and 2013, São Paulo in 2013, Goiânia in 2013, Rio de Janeiro in 2010, and Pernambuco in 2010, with 100% bootstrap support. This clade shares a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with a sample obtained in Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean. Another two Brazilian clades were identified: Clade B basal to all another DENV-1 genotype V (except by the clade previously mentioned and four samples from Puerto Rico), and clade C close related to Colombian and Venezuelan strains (
