<p>The envelope gene of the DENV-1 consensus obtained here by deep sequence was then aligned to globally sampled DENV-1 genomes from all five genotypes using the method implemented in the CLC Genomics Workbench. A dataset containing 93 sequences with 1,485 nucleotides (complete envelope region) was used to infer a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree in PhyML implemented in SeaView v.4 [
