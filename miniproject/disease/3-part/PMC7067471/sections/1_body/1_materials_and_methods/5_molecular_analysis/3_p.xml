<p>Molecular tests for arboviruses detection were made through Real-Time PCR. Dengue detection was made according to Huhtano et al. (2010) [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and serotype determination was accessed using primers and probes serotype-specific described by Callahan et al. (2001) [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Zika RNA detection was done using the protocol developed by Lanciotti et al. (2008) [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] employing their second set of primers and probe (ZIKV-1086/1162c). Finally, chikungunya Real-Time PCR was also done using the protocol described by Cecilia et al. (2015) [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
