<p>Sequence analysis identified ZIKV-specific reads for three of the four replicates from Case 3, and none for the other samples and the negative controls. A nucleotide Blast analysis of the consensus sequence was performed versus GenBank. Blastn was performed on 250 sequences; 245 sequences were conserved (excluding three synthetics, according to their titles names, and two duplicated sequences) for further examination. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00296-f001">Figure 1</xref>b presents the results obtained for these 245 more closely related sequences. Sequence analysis showed that all 16 SNPs were specific of the Asian genotype. Further examination revealed that 141 sequences in GenBank were 100% identical with Case 1â€™s sequence, and all of them corresponding to ZIKV strains from Southeast Asia; 17 sequences from the same geographical region had one nucleotide mismatch and one had two mismatches. By contrast, 86 sequences from the American strains displayed three or more mismatches.
