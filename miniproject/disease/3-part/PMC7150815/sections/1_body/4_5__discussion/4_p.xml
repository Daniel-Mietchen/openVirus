<p>In conclusion, this study allowed identifying the genotype (Asian) and the most probable geographical origin (Southeast Asia) of the ZIKV strain implicated in the first Zika virus local vector-borne transmission in Europe. It shows that virus genotyping can be obtained from samples with low viral load by combining SNPs identification and NGS sequencing. It finally calls to a careful interpretation of experimental competence studies, which can indeed provide a comparative estimate of the transmission capacity associated to specific mosquito and virus strains, but reflect specific combinations of mosquitoes, viruses and environmental conditions.</p>
