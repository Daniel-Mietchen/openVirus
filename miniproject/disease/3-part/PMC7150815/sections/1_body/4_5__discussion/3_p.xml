<p>Second, environmental conditions may have contributed to allow local transmission despite the limited vector competence suggested by the limited amplitude of the epidemic event. Some inhabitants in the area of transmission reported unusually high vector densities, which epidemiological field investigations linked to the existence of an unmaintained pool that acted as a “mosquito factory”. The meteorological conditions in 2019 were quite specific: The peak temperature occurred early (in July vs. August usually) and was higher than the previous years; in addition, the summer months were very dry. Such conditions may have contributed to create specific transmission conditions, different from those observed under experimental conditions.</p>
