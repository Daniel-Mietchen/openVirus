<p>First, the actual transmission potential of the incriminated ZIKV strain by local 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> may be higher than suggested by previous competence studies. The mosquitoes used in these studies (collected in Corsica (2017) and Montpellier (2018)) may not adequately represent the populations implanted in Hyères. This may be investigated by renewing these experiments using mosquitoes collected at the precise location where autochthonous transmission occurred. Similarly, the transmission potential of the Asian strain used in competence studies (namely ZIKV Cambodia isolated from a human case in 2010 (FSS 13025, Asian genotype, passage 3, GenBank reference: KU955593)) may be different from that of the Hyères strain. This strain includes one mismatch in the sequence described above, which is associated with a L/M amino-acid substitution. However, in the absence of isolation and complete genomic sequencing of this strain, it will be difficult to further investigate this item.
