<p>The receptor-binding tropism of H7N9 changing to human receptors is possibly owing to the acquisition of two hydrophobic residues by substitution of Gln226Leu and Gly186Val. These substitutions were found in influenza pandemic viruses H2N2 and H3N2 in 1957 and 1968, respectively, as well as aerosol-transmissible H5N1 mutants.

 </sup> The receptor binding properties of the human H7N9 virus are diverse, comprising different lineages of avian H7N9 isolates, but the cleavage activity of its NA is clearly low for human-type Î±2,6-linked sialic acid receptors. Regarding the pathogenicity of H7N9 viruses, disease caused by virus infection is usually asymptomatic and mortality is rare in chickens, ducks, and other birds. Similarly, various studies have demonstrated that H7N9 viruses replicate well in ferrets,

 </sup> Sequence analysis has indicated that human HPAI H7N9 clinical isolates, such as A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017 and A/Taiwan/1/2017 possess mutations in the 627K domain of the PB2 subunit, conferring efficient replication in mammals.
