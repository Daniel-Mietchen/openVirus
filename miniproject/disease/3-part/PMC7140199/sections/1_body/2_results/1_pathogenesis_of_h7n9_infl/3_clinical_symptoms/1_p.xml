<p>H7N9 AIV has jumped the species barrier, causing sporadic human infections since 2013. H7N9 human influenza virus A/Anhui/1/2013 has sporadically infected humans, with a high mortality rate of about 40%. However, earlier H7N9 isolates lack the multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site that are usually present on highly pathogenic AIV strains.

 </sup> Clinical observations show that patients with confirmed H7N9 avian influenza present with high fever (≥39°C), productive or nonproductive cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, lower respiratory tract inflammation, shortness of breath, and infiltrates have also been noted on chest imaging.

 </sup> Complications in human cases of H7N9 AIV infection include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory hypoxemia, rhabdomyolysis, encephalopathy, acute renal dysfunction, multiple organ dysfunction, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and bacteremia.

 </sup> These features differ from those of previous human cases of infection with H7 subtype AIV, which generally presents as mild flu-like illness or conjunctivitis.

 </sup> The three first human H7N9 viruses (A/Shanghai/1/2013, A/Shanghai/2/2013, and A/Anhui/1/2013) isolated from patients were found to be identical in all eight viral gene segments. However, A/Shanghai/1/2013 has been found to be phylogenetically distinct from the other two strains mentioned above.

 </sup> Compared with human cases of infection with HPAI H7N9 (e.g., A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 or A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017), most patients infected with A/Shanghai/1/2013 have viral pneumonia and some patients have displayed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially elderly people, who also have high fatality rates.

 </sup> Overall, the clinical presentation of HAPI H7N9 infection is similar to that of LPAI H7N9 infection;
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr22-0300060519845488" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
 </sup> however, fewer patients with HPAI than LPAI H7N9 infection have underlying conditions.
