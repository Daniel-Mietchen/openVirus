<p>The newly emerged avian H7N9 influenza virus is known to cause human infection with high mortality. Antiviral drugs are critical tools for the control, treatment, and prevention of H7N9 virus infection as humans lack immunity against H7 subtype influenza viruses. Both M2 ion channel blockers (adamantanes, amantadine, and rimantadine) and NA inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir) are used clinically as antiviral drugs for influenza infection in humans.

 </sup> Owing to the S31N mutation in the M2 protein, emerging H7N9 viruses are reported to be resistant to adamantine antiviral drugs,

 </sup> which are therefore not recommended for clinical therapy. Oseltamivir, generally used as treatment for influenza infection, reduces the viral load in the respiratory tract of patients. Drug resistance to NA inhibitors is unusual among influenza viruses. However, some patients with H7N9 AIV infection have poor clinical outcome. The arginine to lysine substitution at residue R292K and E119V mutation in NA protein are linked with resistance to NA inhibitors, including oseltamivir and peramivir.

 </sup> Ribavirin is a well-characterized, broad-spectrum nucleoside inhibitor, which is used for the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and capping of mRNA. Ribavirin also has antiviral activity against NA inhibitor-resistant H7N9 virus infections.

 </sup> Human infections with avian H7N9 influenza virus mainly originate from contact with infected poultry. An effective strategy to minimize the risk of human H7N9 infections would be to administer aerosolized ribavirin to the nasal mucosa. Regarding drug resistance of HPAI H7N9 isolates, A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016(H7N9) strain has been reported to have NA-292R residue, similar to A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), and sensitivity to all three NA inhibitors.
