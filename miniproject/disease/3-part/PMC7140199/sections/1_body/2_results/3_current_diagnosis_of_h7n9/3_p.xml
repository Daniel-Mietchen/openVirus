<p>Viral isolation, considered the gold standard for influenza diagnosis, includes three different techniques: viral isolation using embryonated chicken eggs, viral culture, and shell viral culture. Viral isolation using embryonated eggs has some disadvantages, such as it is time consuming, has high biosafety level (BSL) requirements, and requires the use of eggs.

 </sup> These disadvantages are drawbacks for efficient diagnosis; hence, viral isolation is more useful for subsequent viral analysis and, importantly, in the initial investigation of an outbreak. Molecular diagnostic tests such as real-time RT-PCR provide more rapid results for more efficient diagnosis.

 </sup> Viral culture uses cell lines, which are infected, incubated, and monitored. Viral detection in cells can be done using different techniques, including specific antibody staining, hemadsorption, or immunofluorescence microscopy. In shell viral culture, cells are grown in 1 dram shell vials and stained with specific monoclonal antibodies for influenza detection. Serological tests include hemagglutination inhibition (HAI),

 </sup> ELISA, one of the most commonly performed laboratory assays, uses mono- and polyclonal antibodies against nucleoproteins on the influenza virus. However, the sensitivity of ELISA is lower than that of molecular testing.

 </sup> HAI is a common assay based on HA-specific antibody that prevents influenza virus attachment to red blood cells, but HA has low sensitivity.

 </sup> VN assays require the use of infectious viruses, which are then neutralized with virus-specific antibodies. VN is more sensitive than HAI, but BSL2 or BSL3 laboratory conditions are required. The SHR assay measures complement-mediated hemolysis via antigen–antibody complex induction; this assay is more sensitive than HAI.
