<p>In this study, we report that human patients with H7N9 AIV infection develop severe illness, dysregulation of the cytokine and chemokine response, late viral clearance, and impaired immunity.

 </sup> Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by H7N9 is the predominant factor leading to hypercytokinemia, an important risk factor triggering multiple organ damage, thereby increasing the mortality rate in human cases of infection with H7N9 AIV.

 </sup> Reports have indicated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells have greater susceptibility to H7N9 than H5N1 virus, and H7N9 could more efficiently infect B and T lymphocytes than H5N1 (p&lt;0.01).

 </sup> Another study indicated that hypercytokinemia is associated with interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 dysfunction, which could be useful in the prediction of H7N9-induced mortality.

 </sup> In addition, H7N9 AIVs show greater tropism for the respiratory epithelium as well as nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues than H5N1 viruses.

 </sup> Similar results have been found in H7N9 virus-challenged mice and ferret models.

 </sup> Since the end of 2017, a new H7N9 AIV (A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017) has been identified as an HPAI strain in China. This HPAI H7N9 virus was generated from its LPAI counterpart

 </sup> These characteristics demonstrate the capability of H7N9 viruses for adaptation and binding, thus opening the door for the virus to develop drug resistance, thereby presenting a challenge for drug and vaccine development as the clinical symptoms of these mutants differ from the original H7N9 virus, including respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, acute renal dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction.

 </sup> These symptoms may be related to the presence of IP-10 and IL-6 in patients with severe H7N9-induced disease, as these induce an acute inflammatory response and extensive tissue destruction.
