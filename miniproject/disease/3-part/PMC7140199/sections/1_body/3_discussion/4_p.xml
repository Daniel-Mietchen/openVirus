<p>In addition, comparative cohort studies have indicated that the sex ratio is much higher in urban than rural areas in infections with both H7N9 and H5N1 viruses.

 </sup> The reason might be correlated with sex-based differences in exposure to AIVs rather than to differences in immunity.

 </sup> For instance, higher numbers of cases of H7N9 infection have been reported among men in Shanghai city, where men have a greater tendency than women to have more frequent retail exposure to live poultry. Other possible reasons for this difference have been reported, including worse prognosis for infected men than infected women, and differences in health-seeking behaviors.

 </sup> However, some reports indicate that differences in immunity between men and women remain a consideration.

 </sup> reported that an increasing trend of H7N9 human infections in rural areas of Zhejiang Province in China during 2013–2017 was the result of rural live poultry markets that remained open despite the epidemic; this suggests that closing live poultry markets is an effective way to control H7N9 human infections.
