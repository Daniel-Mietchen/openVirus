<p>Herein, we conducted a systemic literature review for the novel emerged H7N9 AIVs with respect to pathogenesis, vaccine development, and current diagnosis. Although current major H7N9 epidemics are in China, this reassorted virus has gradually evolved from LPAI to HAPI. Currently, HPAI H7N9 AIV has the capability of causing severe syndromes and inducing high mortality in both avians and humans. The WHO has also pointed out that among current AIVs, those that cause human infection are H5N1 and H7N9, thereby necessitating the continuous monitoring of genetic and antigenic change and variation in H7N9 AIVs.

 </sup> Understanding the pathogenesis of the virus, developing prophylactic vaccines, and enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of H7N9 AIV diagnostic methods are urgently required.
