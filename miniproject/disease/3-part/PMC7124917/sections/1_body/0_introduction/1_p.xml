<p>Dengue is a vector-borne disease caused by four types of dengue viruses (DENV1-4, Flaviviridae, and 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) and is transmitted by the bite of infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, primarily 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. The global burden of dengue is estimated as 390 million infections per year which is larger than previously believed.

 </sup> The rise in dengue incidence can be attributed to geographic range expansion of competent vectors, increased speed at which viremic humans can transport viruses across large distances, and increased urbanization.
