<p>Live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) have saved millions of lives and continue to prove themselves as one of the most important inventions in modern medical history. Smallpox was successfully eradicated in 1980 using the closely-related vaccinia virus [

While some concerns remain about the ability of LAVs to revert toward a wild-type genotype in humans, the adverse effects and risks associated with these vaccines remain very low and are clearly outweighed by the health benefits they provide at a global scale. Over recent years, alarming episodes of pathogen (re-) emergence for which there are no licensed vaccines, such as Ebola, Lassa, or Zika virus, have been witnessed [

 <xref rid="B7-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, the emergence potential of currently neglected pathogens such as Powassan virus and Eastern equine Encephalitis Virus [
