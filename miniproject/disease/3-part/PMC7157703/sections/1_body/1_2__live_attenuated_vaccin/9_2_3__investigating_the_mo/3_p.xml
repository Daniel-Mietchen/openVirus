<p>Description of genetic differences alone can hardly explain the effects they have on host–pathogen interaction and immune regulations. Therefore, a large body of research on molecular mechanisms governing LAV attenuation has been conducted in vitro. LAVs have, for instance, been found to differ in cell entry mechanisms in comparison to their virulent counterpart. Enhanced CD46 receptor utilization by MV-LAV has been described and is influenced by mutations in the hemagglutinin (H) protein [

 <xref rid="B132-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. YFV-17D and YFV-Asibi also exhibit distinctive usages of cell entry pathways and cell surface molecules, which were associated with differential viral spread and cell–intrinsic-immune-response induction [

 <xref rid="B134-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Differences in viral replication and cytokine induction have also been observed in cell culture. YFV-17D replicates more extensively than YFV-Asibi in hepatoma cell lines [

 <xref rid="B137-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. However, YFV-Asibi causes a stronger and more sustained pro-inflammatory response than YFV-17D [

 <xref rid="B140-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] in primary human vascular endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, MDMs and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). The Sabin type 3 OPV displays genetic differences from poliovirus type 3 that decrease the binding of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) at its viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Lower PTB binding to Sabin type 3 OPV IRES impaired protein translation in neurons, and was suggested to mediate viral attenuation in the central nervous system [
 <xref rid="B141-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Finally, reduced YFV-17D replication in dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro has been suggested to promote antigen presentation in the lymph nodes (LN) by preventing DC apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B143-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Unlike YFV-Asibi, the replication of YFV-17D in MoDCs also stimulates IFNγ production in CD4+T cells [
 <xref rid="B140-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Another interesting concept for explaining LAV attenuation relies upon the genetic stability of these pathogens. For instance, YFV-17D is poorly prone to diversify into multiple quasi-species in comparison to YFV-Asibi, and YFV-Asibi diversification is not associated with the emergence of attenuation mutations [
 <xref rid="B144-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. A more recent study reported that YFV-17D has a stronger resistance to mutations, and suggested that YFV attenuation could be related to a higher fidelity of the YFV-17D replication complex [
