<p>Mass vaccination campaigns in Africa and South America have succeeded in controlling yellow fever in endemic areas over the past 80 years. However, recurrent outbreak episodes have taken place in areas with limited vaccination coverage since the introduction of YFV-17D, with dramatic consequences at times such as in Ethiopia in 1961, where over 100,000 cases and 30,000 fatalities were reported [

YFV-17D vaccines provide effective immunity in 80â€“100% of vaccinees 10 days after vaccination, and more than 99% of vaccinees within 30 days of vaccination [
