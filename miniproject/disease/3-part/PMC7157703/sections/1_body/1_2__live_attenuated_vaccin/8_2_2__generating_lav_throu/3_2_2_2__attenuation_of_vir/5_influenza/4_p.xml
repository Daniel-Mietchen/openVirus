<p>LAIVs have progressed from monovalent to trivalent and quadrivalent as new genera of influenza virus have been discovered [

 <xref rid="B118-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The most successful and stable LAIVs are reassortant cold-adapted vaccines [
 <xref rid="B119-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] that are passaged at progressively lower temperatures until 25 Â°C has been reached on primary chicken kidney cells or embryonated eggs [

 <xref rid="B121-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. The reduced growth of LAIV at higher temperatures restricts virus replication primarily to the upper respiratory tract, which mimics natural infection and prevents viral spread in the lower respiratory tract and throughout the body [

 <xref rid="B122-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. LAIVs have been used in Russia for decades with very few adverse effects other than transient febrile reactions [
 <xref rid="B123-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>], and the first LAIV to be used in the United States was a trivalent cold-adapted vaccine, which was licensed in 2003 [
