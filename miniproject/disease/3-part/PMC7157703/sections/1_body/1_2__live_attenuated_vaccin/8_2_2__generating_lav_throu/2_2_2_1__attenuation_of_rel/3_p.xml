<p>Apprehension regarding TB following World War II led multiple health organizations to advocate for the BCG vaccine [

 <xref rid="B70-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Consequently, the WHO introduced a seed lot system for LAV uniformity in 1956 and, in the countries reporting to the WHO, more than ten BCG strains are currently in use [

Statistical analyses of efficacy studies show that the BCG vaccine is most effective in providing protection against severe extrapulmonary (non-lung) forms of pediatric TB, but is unreliable in its protection of adults against pulmonary TB [
