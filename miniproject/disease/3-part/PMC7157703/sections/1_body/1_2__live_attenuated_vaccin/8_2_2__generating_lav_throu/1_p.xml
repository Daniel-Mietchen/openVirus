<p>Following Jenner’s success with smallpox vaccines, Louis Pasteur made strides that initiated a novel generation of LAV. This advancement was the attenuation, or weakening, of the pathogens responsible for disease. After finding that cultures of 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>, the bacterium of chicken cholera, were attenuated when left out and exposed to air, Pasteur procured a vaccine from this [

In 1885, Pasteur’s attenuated rabies vaccine was successfully administered to a human patient, establishing itself as the first truly attenuated human LAV [
