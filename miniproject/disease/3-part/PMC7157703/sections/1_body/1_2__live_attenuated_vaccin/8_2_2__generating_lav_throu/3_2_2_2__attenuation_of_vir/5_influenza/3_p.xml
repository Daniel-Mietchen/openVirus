<p>The influenza virus was isolated from the nasal discharge of infected patients by Wilson Smith, Sir Christopher Andrews, and Sir Patrick Laidlaw in 1933 [

 <xref rid="B116-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] or in cell culture [
 <xref rid="B76-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], purified through centrifugation, and chemically inactivated [

 <xref rid="B118-vaccines-08-00036" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. These vaccines are used more than whole-virus influenza vaccines due to their reduced reactogenicity [
