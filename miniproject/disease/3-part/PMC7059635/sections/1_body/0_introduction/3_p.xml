<p>However, NIMART nurses still lack confidence to manage PLWH. An initial comprehensive literature review study was conducted, and no framework or model was identified that could guide training and implementation of NIMART. According to Lekhuleni, Kgole and Mbombi (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), student nurses still lack knowledge and confidence to implement, monitor and evaluate HIV programmes. Furthermore, it was identified that both training and mentoring are partner-driven. Therefore, in this article, the researchers aimed to develop and describe a conceptual framework (CF) that could strengthen NIMART training and implementation to improve patient and HIV programme outcomes in the North West province. A model that characteristically supports the CF should guide effective training and implementation. In this article, the Dickoff, James and Wiedenbach’s (
