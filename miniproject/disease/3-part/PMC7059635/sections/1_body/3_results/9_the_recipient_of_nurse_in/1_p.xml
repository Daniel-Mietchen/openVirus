<p>According to Dickoff et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>), a recipient is a person or thing that receives action from the agent. In this framework, the recipient is any healthcare worker receiving NIMART training. These can be professional nurses, facilitators, student nurses, nurse educators or programme managers. According to WHO, task shifting was recommended for nurses to initiate and manage ART rather than rely solely on the doctors to meet the increasing demand of healthcare services. It is evident from the study results that the agent should provide comprehensive quality training to improve the skills, competence and confidence of NIMART nurses in the provision of quality care to the patients and to facilitators and educators to transfer the skills to these students. In addition, the patients indirectly benefit from the NIMART training as they equally receive care from the NIMART nurse.
