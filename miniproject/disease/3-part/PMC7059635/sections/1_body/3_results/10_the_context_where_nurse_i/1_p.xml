<p>Context refers to resources, activities and environment which enable or facilitate implementation (Dickoff et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>). It is evident from the study that a combination of organisational resources and a conducive, safe and comfortable environment within the districtâ€™s PHC system can facilitate implementation. The availability of adequate, independent, experienced, skilled HR with positive attitudes towards PLWH and HIV programme facilitates robust implementation. Again, the development of a standard integrated NIMART curriculum and the use of effective interactive strategies that stimulate critical thinking and facilitate integration of theory and practice can influence implementation. Moreover, provision of NIMART or HIV management pre-service training to student nurses, CPD and in-service training on HIV changes can facilitate NIMART implementation. It is evident from the study that availability of good communication and relationship skills, including compliance to HIV and TB and PHC policies, guidelines, protocols and SOPs, facilitates implementation. In addition, treating patients and nurses with respect and attending to their concerns or challenges can also facilitate implementation.
