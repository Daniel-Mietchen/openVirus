 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Additional tracer indicators of monitoring VL, VL collection (VLC), VL suppression (VLS), LTFU and death were analysed to obtain a clearer picture of the impact of NIMART training on patients receiving ART in the NMMD. Furthermore, five focus group discussions (FGDs) with 28 NIMART nurses (5, 5, 6, 5 and 7 NIMART nurses per group, respectively)which lasted for 90–120 min and unstructured in-depth interviews amongst HIV programme managers were used to collect data in the qualitative study. Data saturation was reached with 28 NIMART nurses (De Vos et al.
