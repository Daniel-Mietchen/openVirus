<p>The CF was crafted based on the findings of QUAN-qual initial studies. Dickoff et al.’s (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>) practice-oriented theory and Donabedian’s (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>) SPO model were used simultaneously to classify and categorise the characteristics, activities and functions of the NIMART training and the implementation of the HIV programme within PHC facilities. There is a symbiotic relationship between Dickoff et al.’s practice-orientated theory and Donabedian’s SPO model. The two therefore provided a starting point for the development of the CF. The typical characteristics, activities and functions were outlined and described through the process of abstraction, starting from the concrete level of experience to the higher level of abstraction in order to determine an ideal framework (Mouton &amp; Marais
