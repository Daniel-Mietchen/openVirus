  <p>Computational workflow for the analysis of DI mRNAs and dependency of DI mRNAs on single-cell virus yield. At 12 hpi, single PR8-infected MDCK cells (MOI = 10) were investigated for released virus yields by the plaque assay (as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and the presence of DI mRNAs on S1–S3 by scRNA-seq. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based computational workflow to detect DI mRNAs. Read pairs were mapped to the influenza reference genome. The estimated insert sizes were gathered from the alignment files. Typically, in the absence of structural variation, read pairs have an expected average insert size of about 250 nucleotides, which refers to FL mRNA. However, in the presence of large internal deletions, the insert size is larger than 1000 nucleotides, which refers to DI mRNAs. Chimeric reads spanning the deleted region can be used to locate the position of the deletion with its actual length. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Ratio of DI to FL mRNAs in cells classified as “low”- and “high”-yield single cells (as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). The log
   <sub>2</sub>-ratio between the number of large insert sizes and short insert sizes was used and a pseudo-count of 1e-7 was added to avoid a log of zero. Colors indicate the lower and upper 22.86% of cells with respect to the virus yield (“low” and “high”, respectively). *,
