  <p>Influence of total viral mRNAs and DI mRNAs on the single-cell virus yield. At 12 hpi, single PR8-infected MDCK cells (MOI = 10) were investigated for virus yield by plaque assay (as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>), the total viral mRNA content and the presence of intracellular DI mRNAs on S1–S3 by scRNA-seq. Single cells were subdivided into DI mRNA positive and negative cells, according to the presence and absence of large insert sizes (&gt;1000 bp), as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>A. Total viral mRNA content in transcripts per million (TPM) was calculated by removing read pairs with a large insert size. Colors indicate the lower and upper 22.86% of cells with respect to the virus yield (“low” and “high”, respectively), as shown in
