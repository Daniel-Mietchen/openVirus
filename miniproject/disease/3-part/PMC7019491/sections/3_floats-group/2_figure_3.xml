  <p>Impact of ribosome quantity, fraction of viral and host cell mRNAs on single-cell virus yield. Single PR8-infected MDCK cells (MOI = 10) were incubated until 12 hpi (as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Afterward, virus yields were investigated using the plaque assay, intracellular 18S rRNA via real-time RT-qPCR, or intracellular host cell and viral mRNA via scRNA-seq. n
   <sub>S</sub> indicates the number of single-cell measurements. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Dependency of single-cell virus yield on the ribosome content. The ribosome quantity was estimated based on the assumption that exactly one 18S rRNA molecule is associated with each ribosome. Next, the fold change over the average single-cell 18S rRNA expression was calculated. The pooled data of multiple independent experiments are shown (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Histogram of the single-cell virus yield of cells investigated by scRNA-seq (panel (C)). Colors indicate the lower and upper 22.86% of cells with respect to the virus yield (“low” and “high”, respectively). The pooled data of multiple independent experiments are depicted (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Host cell and viral mRNA content. Expression values (TPM ≥ 1) for host and viral genes are plotted on a log-scale for cells classified into low and high virus yields, as shown in
