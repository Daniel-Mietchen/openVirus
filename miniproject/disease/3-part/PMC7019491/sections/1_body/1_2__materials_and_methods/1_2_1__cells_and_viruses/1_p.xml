<p>Adherent Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures, #84121903) were cultivated in Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 g/L peptone. The infection medium comprised GMEM, 2 g/L peptone, and porcine trypsin (5 BAEE U/mL), but no FCS. Cultivations and infections were conducted at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Influenza virus strain PR8 was provided by the Robert Koch Institute (Berlin, Germany, #3138). Seed virus titer was determined by 50% tissue-culture-infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay on MDCK cells [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and multiplicity of infections (MOIs) were calculated based on this titer. We used one seed virus for all independent infection experiments.
