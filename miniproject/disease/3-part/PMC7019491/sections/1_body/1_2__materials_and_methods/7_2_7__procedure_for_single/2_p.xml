<p>Reverse transcription was followed by a preamplification step that was performed on magnetic Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Thermo Scientific): 17 µL of beads was mixed with the RT mix and incubated for 8 min. The plate was put on a magnetic stand for 2 min and the supernatant discarded. To each well, 16 µL of PCR mastermix was added (8 µL of 2x KAPA Hifi Mix, 0.2 µL of ISPCR-primer (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3′, 10 µM) and 8 µL of nuclease free water) and the following PCR program was run: 98 °C for 3 min, 18 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 67 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 6 min, followed by a final incubation at 72 °C for 5 min.</p>
