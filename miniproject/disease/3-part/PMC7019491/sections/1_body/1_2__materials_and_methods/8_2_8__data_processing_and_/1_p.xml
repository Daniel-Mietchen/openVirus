<p>Gene expression was quantified by Salmon [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], version 0.7.2 including the parameter libType = IU, --posBias and --gcBias. The transcriptome index was built using the Ensembl version 86 Canis familiaris (genome assembly CanFam3.1) cDNA sequences, the genome of IAV of strain PR8, and the sequences of the ERCC RNA spike-ins. For the coverage analysis, STAR (version 2.5.2a) [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] was used in the paired-end and single-end mode, allowing a minimum chimeric segment length of 10 (chimSegmentMin = 10).
