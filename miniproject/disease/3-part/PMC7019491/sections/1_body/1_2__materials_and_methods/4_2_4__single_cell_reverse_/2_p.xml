<p>For RT, 5 µL of the sample was mixed with 0.5 μL dNTPs (10 mM) and 0.5 μL primer (10 mM), and filled up with nuclease-free water to 7.25 μL. The reaction mix was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then 4 °C for 5 min. Afterward, we added 2 μL of 5× Reaction Buffer, 25 U (equal to 0.25 µL) RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase, 10 U (equal to 0.25 µL) RiboLock RNase Inhibitor, and 0.25 μL nuclease-free water (all reagents from Thermo Scientific). RT reaction was performed at 42 °C for 60 min, and terminated at 70 °C for 10 min. Samples were either stored at −20 °C, or immediately subjected to PCR.</p>
