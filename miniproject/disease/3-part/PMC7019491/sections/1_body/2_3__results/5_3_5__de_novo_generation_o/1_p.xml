<p>Next, we studied the de novo generation of DI vRNAs in single cells as well as in cell population-based samples. Therefore, we first compared the seed virus used for infection with the progeny virions produced in an infection using bulk RNA-seq. In addition, we investigated DI mRNAs, derived from de novo generated DI vRNAs, in single-cell infections using scRNA-seq. Note that all bulk- and single-cell infection conditions were identical in this study (
