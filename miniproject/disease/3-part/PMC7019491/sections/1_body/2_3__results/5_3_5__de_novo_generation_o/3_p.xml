<p>Interestingly, utilizing scRNA-seq analysis, we observed deletion junctions of DI mRNAs in infected single cells at similar regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), which seems to confirm their identity as DI mRNAs arising from DI vRNAs. Moreover, we observed six deletion junctions in the single-cell DI mRNAs that were identical to those identified in the DI vRNAs of the seed virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>A), indicating the amplification of these pre-existing DI vRNAs (and thus, DI mRNAs) in single cells. Furthermore, we also detected 25 deletion junctions not observed in the seed virus, implicating the de novo generation of DI vRNAs that can be observed at the single cell level. In agreement with this, we also observed such apparent de novo generated DI vRNAs in single cells by RT-PCR analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, as indicated by the presence of faint signals corresponding to DI vRNAs. However, also note the presence of six single-cell DI mRNA deletion junctions that were identical to those observed for apparently de novo generated DI vRNAs present in the progeny virions of the bulk infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Such an observation most likely relates to low levels of pre-existing DI vRNAs in the seed virus that were not detectable. Nevertheless, our results strongly indicate the generation of highly diverse de novo DI vRNAs at the single-cell level, which unveils an additional facet of the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in IAV replication.
