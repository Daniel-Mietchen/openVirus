 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>C shows the content of DI vRNAs of S1, S2, and S3 of IAV-infected single cells. Surprisingly, we observed a large cell-to-cell diversity in intracellular DI vRNAs. Specifically, the between-cell heterogeneity comprised differences regarding (i) the presence or absence, (ii) the signal intensity, (iii) the length (in bp) of the DI vRNAs, and (iv) the genome segment on which DI vRNAs occur. Please note that only S1–S3 were investigated as these segments typically bear deletions [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, it appeared that single cells showing a virus yield of ≥60 plaque-forming units (PFU) contained less frequently DI vRNAs overall, which was most apparently observed for S3. Likewise, we observed DI vRNAs on S2 more frequently in cells that displayed a virus titer &lt;60 PFU. Concurrently, FL vRNAs were more frequently observed (for S3) for single cells that released ≥60 PFU. The absence of a signal corresponding to the FL vRNA in some single cells most likely indicates a concentration that was below the limit of detection of the RT-PCR assay established. Please also note the presence of faint signals of DI vRNAs, which either suggest low levels, or de novo generated DI vRNAs at the single-cell level. Occasionally, we also observed high-productive IAV-infected single cells that nevertheless contained DI vRNAs. These cells may indicate rarely occurring defective, non-interfering vRNAs [
