<p>As described above, a high load of viral mRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>C) and a low content of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>) was observed in high-yield single cells. We next investigated whether the two factors can both, independently from one another, affect single-cell virus titers. For this, we subdivided cells that contained or did not contain DI mRNAs based on the presence and absence of large insert sizes (indicating DI mRNAs). Subsequently, we investigated whether in each group, a higher level of viral mRNA content could be observed for high-yield cells compared to low-yield cells. For this, we subtracted all read pairs with a large insert size (indicating DI mRNA) from the total viral mRNA content.
