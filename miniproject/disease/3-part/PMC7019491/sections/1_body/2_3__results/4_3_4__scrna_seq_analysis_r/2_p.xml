<p>Using this workflow, we quantified the expression of DI and FL mRNAs and determined their quantity ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). In line with our previous results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref>), we observed that low-yield cells showed a significantly higher ratio of DI to FL mRNAs compared to high-yield cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>B and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, we also found low-yield cells with no detectable DI mRNAs (as indicated by the outliers (five cells in total) in the left violin plot at the bottom, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). On the other hand, some high-productive cells nevertheless contained DI vRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, lower right corner). Such rare cells likely indicate additional factors that can affect the single-cell virus yield, besides DI mRNAs or DI vRNAs. In summary, scRNA-seq analysis confirmed that the load of intracellular DI mRNAs, derived from DI vRNAs, most likely affects the virus release of IAV-infected single cells.
