<p>DI vRNAs typically retain the terminal 3′ and 5′ ends harboring the promoter regions, which are necessary for viral transcription [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, the majority, if not all, DI vRNAs are able to transcribe and generate DI mRNAs [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, we continued analyzing DI mRNAs by scRNA-seq. Indeed, using sequence analysis, we observed a high heterogeneity in the coverage profiles of viral mRNAs, in particular for S3, which may indicate the presence of DI mRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S3</xref>). For a more detailed analysis, we developed a computational workflow (similarly seen elsewhere [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]) as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, aiming to pinpoint individual DI mRNAs. Briefly, paired-end reads were mapped against the influenza genome providing an estimate of the distance (insert size) of the mate pairs. We used an insert size cut-off of 1000 bp to distinguish between short and long insert sizes representing FL transcripts and deletions, respectively. Furthermore, chimeric reads allowed the breaking point of the deletions to be located and were used as an additional but not necessary condition to indicate the presence of DI mRNAs. In agreement with previous reports [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we have only scarcely detected putative DI mRNAs on S4–S8, and thus, focused on the analysis of S1–S3.
