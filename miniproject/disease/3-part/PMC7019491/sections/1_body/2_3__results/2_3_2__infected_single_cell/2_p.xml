<p>Subsequently, we calculated the quantity ratio of DI to FL vRNAs for each cell by dividing the sum of signal intensities of DI vRNAs on S1–S3 by the sum of signal intensities of the FL vRNAs on S1–S3. Note that a low level of FL vRNAs typically coincided with a high load of DI vRNAs (see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>C), most likely since the DI vRNAs inhibit the synthesis of the cognate FL vRNAs [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref>B shows the dependency of the quantity ratio of DI to FL vRNAs on the single-cell virus titer. It appeared that the lower 50% of cells (regarding the cell-specific virus yield, “lower”) showed an overall higher quantity ratio. In agreement with our previous observations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), statistical analysis of the dataset revealed a significant difference between the “upper” and “lower” cells regarding the quantity ratio of DI to FL vRNAs (shown by the Wilcoxon rank sum test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This difference is visualized in the corresponding percentile graph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). Here, for instance, 80% of the “upper” cells showed a quantity ratio of DI to FL vRNA of ~1.3 or less, while 80% of the “lower” cells showed a ratio of ~3.4 or less. In summary, we show that a low single-cell virus yield is connected with a high DI vRNA content, and vice versa. Therefore, DI vRNAs appear to be a factor that can affect the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of IAV replication.
