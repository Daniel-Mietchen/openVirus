<p>Nevertheless, the expression of viral mRNAs was high enough for the accurate analysis of DI mRNAs by scRNA-seq. Note that the results of bulk RNA-seq indicated similar junction regions of the DI vRNAs in comparison to the single-cell DI mRNAs (~250–400 bp apart from the terminal ends, in agreement with previous observations [

 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]), which confirms their identity as transcriptional descendants of the DI vRNAs. Such DI mRNAs, which can result in the translation of small polypeptides, were described previously for IAV-infected cells [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It was long speculated that some of these polypeptides may have a function, like contributing to the defectiveness or interference of a DIP [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Moreover, it was shown that such small polypeptides can act immune–stimulatory and thus, can contribute to the antiviral activity of DIPs [
