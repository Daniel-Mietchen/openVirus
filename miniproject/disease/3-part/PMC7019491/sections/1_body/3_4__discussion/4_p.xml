<p>Upon infection, IAVs hijack the cellsâ€™ biosynthetic machinery including ribosomes. More specifically, ribosomes are recruited for the translation of viral proteins that are necessary for virus propagation. Previously, a correlation between cellular resources required for protein synthesis and virus release was suggested for the T7 phage infection [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed a vast cell-to-cell diversity in the ribosome content of IAV-infected MDCK cells with quantitative differences that spanned roughly four orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, however, a correlation between the single-cell virus release and the ribosome content was not observed. This indicates that ribosomes are sufficiently present in each individual cell, despite the large quantitative between-cell variability, and that they do not pose a bottleneck in IAV production.
