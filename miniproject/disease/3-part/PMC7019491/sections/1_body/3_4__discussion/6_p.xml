<p>However, the concentration of host cell mRNAs of the single-cell samples was very low. Thus, the measurements were affected by a high degree of technical noise, preventing the accurate identification of host cell transcripts that are specific for high- or low-yield cells. Note that in other studies, host cell mRNAs of virus-infected single cells could be reliably identified [

First, a relatively high volume (5 ÂµL) of single-cell lysates was investigated, leading to low analyte concentrations and thus, decreased sensitivities when compared to the volumes (in the pico- and nanoliter range) that can be achieved with the microfluidics-based technologies [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], but presumably, low cellular gene expression levels. Finally, experiments were performed at high MOI, leading to a strong virus replication and likely, an enhanced suppression of host cell gene expression.
