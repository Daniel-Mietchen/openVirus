<p>Occasionally, large internal deletions or point mutations [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] occur during the replication of the vRNA genome, which give rise to defective interfering (DI) vRNAs. The conventional deletions in DI vRNAs are believed to arise by erroneous translocation of the viral polymerase, called the “copy-choice” mechanism [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Deletions can comprise hundreds up to roughly two thousand, base pairs. However, DI vRNAs typically retain the terminal 3′ and 5′ ends, which harbor the promotor (important for transcription and replication) and the genome packaging signal [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, deletions in segment 1 (S1)-S3, which encode for viral polymerase proteins, are most frequently observed [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Interestingly, such DI vRNAs are preferentially synthesized and packaged into progeny virions over their cognate full-length (FL) vRNAs, which results in the release of DI particles (DIPs) [
