<p>Due to the lack of genomic information, DIPs are defective in virus replication and cannot replicate in the context of an infection [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, in the case of a co-infection with an infectious standard virus (STV), this defect can be overcome. However, as a result, STV replication is then suppressed, and mainly non-infectious DIPs are produced. This interference is believed to be caused by a replication advantage of the DI genome, which may out-compete the FL vRNA for limited viral or cellular resources [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, DI vRNAs are suggested to multiply faster due to their reduced length [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Finally, DI genomes were found to competitively inhibit the packaging of their predecessor FL vRNAs into progeny virions [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Due to their ability to inhibit STV replication, previous research suggests that DIPs may be used as an antiviral agent [
