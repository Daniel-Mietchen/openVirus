<p>In this study, we performed single-cell analysis of IAV replication and compared extracellular progeny virus titers and intracellular DI vRNAs, or their derivatives, DI mRNAs, via conventional RT-PCR or scRNA-seq, respectively. Our experiments revealed an extreme cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the content of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs in IAV infection. In addition, results obtained from scRNA-seq indicate the de novo generation of a diversity of DI vRNAs, observed at the single cell level, which further adds to the large cell-to-cell variability in IAV replication. Moreover, an increased intracellular level of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs correlated with a low progeny virus titer, and vice versa, which implicates that both deleted RNA species can contribute to the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in IAV replication. However, we also found some exceptions from this observation, suggesting the presence of additional factors that can affect or generate single-cell diversity in virus release. Finally, we investigated the impact of some of these factors on the cell-specific virus titer. These results may help to unravel the complexity of between-cell variability in virus infections.</p>
