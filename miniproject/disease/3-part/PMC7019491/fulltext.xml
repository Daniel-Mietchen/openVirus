Here, we study the effect of defective interfering (DI) particle (DIP) co-infection on cell-to-cell variability in influenza A virus (IAV) replication. DIPs contain a large internal deletion in one of their eight viral RNAs (vRNA) and are, thus, defective in virus replication. Moreover, they interfere with virus replication. Using single-cell isolation and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we uncovered a large between-cell heterogeneity in the DI vRNA content of infected cells, which was confirmed for DI mRNAs by single-cell RNA sequencing. A high load of intracellular DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs was found in low-productive cells, indicating their contribution to the large cell-to-cell variability in virus release. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of host cell mRNA expression (some factors may inhibit virus replication), but not the ribosome content, may further affect the strength of single-cell virus replication. Finally, we show that the load of viral mRNAs (facilitating viral protein production) and the DI mRNA content are, independently from one another, connected with single-cell virus production. Together, these insights advance single-cell virology research toward the elucidation of the complex multi-parametric origin of the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>single-cell analysis</kwd><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>cell-to-cell heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>defective interfering particles</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>next-generation sequencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-12-00071"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause respiratory disease and are important human pathogens that can lead to a high morbidity. IAV epidemics occur annually, but occasionally severe pandemics can also arise. IAVs harbor a segmented and single-stranded RNA genome of negative polarity comprising eight individual viral RNAs (vRNAs) [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The vRNAs occur encapsidated with multiple copies of the viral nucleoprotein and the tripartite viral polymerase complex [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], forming so-called viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Upon infection and import into the cell nucleus, vRNPs are able to catalyze the transcription of viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as well as the synthesis of complementary RNAs, which are themselves encapsidated in complementary ribonucleoproteins that serve as a template for the replication of progeny vRNAs [<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Occasionally, large internal deletions or point mutations [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] occur during the replication of the vRNA genome, which give rise to defective interfering (DI) vRNAs. The conventional deletions in DI vRNAs are believed to arise by erroneous translocation of the viral polymerase, called the &#x0201c;copy-choice&#x0201d; mechanism [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Deletions can comprise hundreds up to roughly two thousand, base pairs. However, DI vRNAs typically retain the terminal 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends, which harbor the promotor (important for transcription and replication) and the genome packaging signal [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, deletions in segment 1 (S1)-S3, which encode for viral polymerase proteins, are most frequently observed [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Interestingly, such DI vRNAs are preferentially synthesized and packaged into progeny virions over their cognate full-length (FL) vRNAs, which results in the release of DI particles (DIPs) [<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Due to the lack of genomic information, DIPs are defective in virus replication and cannot replicate in the context of an infection [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, in the case of a co-infection with an infectious standard virus (STV), this defect can be overcome. However, as a result, STV replication is then suppressed, and mainly non-infectious DIPs are produced. This interference is believed to be caused by a replication advantage of the DI genome, which may out-compete the FL vRNA for limited viral or cellular resources [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, DI vRNAs are suggested to multiply faster due to their reduced length [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Finally, DI genomes were found to competitively inhibit the packaging of their predecessor FL vRNAs into progeny virions [<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Due to their ability to inhibit STV replication, previous research suggests that DIPs may be used as an antiviral agent [<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, DIPs can reduce virus yields in cell culture-based vaccine production [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and may affect the efficacy of live-attenuated vaccines [<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>At the single cell level, virus replication is highly heterogeneous and shows a vast cell-to-cell variability, with up to roughly 1000-fold differences in intracellular viral RNA levels and progeny virus yields [<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Moreover, whole-transcriptome analysis via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that, for instance, proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation, signal peptide processing and membrane trafficking, ubiquitination, oxidative and ER stress response, and mitochondrially encoded genes can further affect the strength of virus replication in a single cell [<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, not all causes of the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus infections have been identified, and a detailed comprehension of their complex dependencies remains largely elusive.</p><p>DIPs exert strong inhibitory effects on virus replication. Moreover, for a given concentration of DIPs in the infecting virus population, a large variation in the number of infecting DIPs per cell must be assumed, and a certain fraction of individual cells might not even become infected by a DIP. Most likely, this heterogeneity has a significant impact on cell-to-cell variability in progeny virus production.</p><p>In this study, we performed single-cell analysis of IAV replication and compared extracellular progeny virus titers and intracellular DI vRNAs, or their derivatives, DI mRNAs, via conventional RT-PCR or scRNA-seq, respectively. Our experiments revealed an extreme cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the content of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs in IAV infection. In addition, results obtained from scRNA-seq indicate the de novo generation of a diversity of DI vRNAs, observed at the single cell level, which further adds to the large cell-to-cell variability in IAV replication. Moreover, an increased intracellular level of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs correlated with a low progeny virus titer, and vice versa, which implicates that both deleted RNA species can contribute to the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in IAV replication. However, we also found some exceptions from this observation, suggesting the presence of additional factors that can affect or generate single-cell diversity in virus release. Finally, we investigated the impact of some of these factors on the cell-specific virus titer. These results may help to unravel the complexity of between-cell variability in virus infections.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00071"><title>2.

For this, we (i) subtracted the background of the gel image, (ii) selected and transformed each band to a graph that displayed the grey value against the distance of the gel, and (iii) determined the area under the curve (AUC) of each band. Subsequently, all extracted AUCs of each band were normalized against the AUC obtained from a specific band (300 bp) of the DNA ladder. This was necessary for comparability of the numeric values obtained across different agarose gels.

For this, we isolated influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8)-infected adherent Madin&#x02013;Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10) in 384 well plates utilizing a limiting dilution approach, as described previously [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. At 12 h post infection (hpi), the virus yield in the supernatant of single cells was quantified using a plaque assay. Moreover, the single cells were investigated for the presence of intracellular DI vRNAs via RT-PCR. Here, the RT and PCR primers hybridize to the terminal end of vRNAs, which facilitates their complete amplification in RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>B).

Specifically, the between-cell heterogeneity comprised differences regarding (i) the presence or absence, (ii) the signal intensity, (iii) the length (in bp) of the DI vRNAs, and (iv) the genome segment on which DI vRNAs occur. Please note that only S1&#x02013;S3 were investigated as these segments typically bear deletions [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Concurrently, FL vRNAs were more frequently observed (for S3) for single cells that released &#x02265;60 PFU. The absence of a signal corresponding to the FL vRNA in some single cells most likely indicates a concentration that was below the limit of detection of the RT-PCR assay established. Please also note the presence of faint signals of DI vRNAs, which either suggest low levels, or de novo generated DI vRNAs at the single-cell level. Occasionally, we also observed high-productive IAV-infected single cells that nevertheless contained DI vRNAs. These cells may indicate rarely occurring defective, non-interfering vRNAs [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or additional unknown factors that can affect the single-cell virus yield beyond DI vRNAs.

Note that a low level of FL vRNAs typically coincided with a high load of DI vRNAs (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>C), most likely since the DI vRNAs inhibit the synthesis of the cognate FL vRNAs [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref>B shows the dependency of the quantity ratio of DI to FL vRNAs on the single-cell virus titer.

Furthermore, we filtered out genes that were detected (transcripts per million (TPM) &#x02265; 1) in less than five samples, leading to a set of 2755 host cell genes. The remaining cells had an average host gene detection rate of 1381 genes (median 845 genes) per cell, which is an overall low detection rate in scRNA-seq [<xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This may be explained by the high viral transcriptional activity, likely suppressing host cell gene expression and dominating the cellular transcription by more than three orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S5B</xref>). Interestingly, high-productive cells showed a significantly lower fraction of host cell mRNAs and significantly higher fraction of viral mRNAs compared to low-productive cells (Wilcoxon rank sum test <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup> for the host and <italic>p</italic> = 8.23 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> for viral mRNA). In agreement with this, we observed a negative correlation between the host cell mRNA level and the virus titer, and a positive correlation between the viral mRNA level and the virus yield (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S5C,D</xref>). Unfortunately, the signal for host cell expression was too low and noisy to perform reliable differential expression analysis for the identification of potential marker genes affecting IAV replication (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, the signal for virus-derived mRNAs was strong enough to allow for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, we observed no correlation of the ribosome content of single cells with the virus titer. Moreover, scRNA-seq analysis showed that fractions of viral mRNAs were increased, and those of host cell mRNAs decreased in high-yield cells compared to low-yield cells. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-12-00071"><title>3.4. scRNA-Seq Analysis Reveals an Association of the DI mRNA Content and the Single-Cell Virus Yield</title><p>DI vRNAs typically retain the terminal 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends harboring the promoter regions, which are necessary for viral transcription [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, the majority, if not all, DI vRNAs are able to transcribe and generate DI mRNAs [<xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, we continued analyzing DI mRNAs by scRNA-seq. Indeed, using sequence analysis, we observed a high heterogeneity in the coverage profiles of viral mRNAs, in particular for S3, which may indicate the presence of DI mRNAs (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S3</xref>). For a more detailed analysis, we developed a computational workflow (similarly seen elsewhere [<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, aiming to pinpoint individual DI mRNAs. Briefly, paired-end reads were mapped against the influenza genome providing an estimate of the distance (insert size) of the mate pairs. We used an insert size cut-off of 1000 bp to distinguish between short and long insert sizes representing FL transcripts and deletions, respectively. Furthermore, chimeric reads allowed the breaking point of the deletions to be located and were used as an additional but not necessary condition to indicate the presence of DI mRNAs. In agreement with previous reports [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we have only scarcely detected putative DI mRNAs on S4&#x02013;S8, and thus, focused on the analysis of S1&#x02013;S3.</p><p>Using this workflow, we quantified the expression of DI and FL mRNAs and determined their quantity ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). In line with our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref>), we observed that low-yield cells showed a significantly higher ratio of DI to FL mRNAs compared to high-yield cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S4</xref>).

On the other hand, some high-productive cells nevertheless contained DI vRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, lower right corner). Such rare cells likely indicate additional factors that can affect the single-cell virus yield, besides DI mRNAs or DI vRNAs. In summary, scRNA-seq analysis confirmed that the load of intracellular DI mRNAs, derived from DI vRNAs, most likely affects the virus release of IAV-infected single cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-12-00071"><title>3.5. De Novo Generation of DI vRNAs Observed at the Single-Cell Level</title><p>Next, we studied the de novo generation of DI vRNAs in single cells as well as in cell population-based samples. Therefore, we first compared the seed virus used for infection with the progeny virions produced in an infection using bulk RNA-seq. In addition, we investigated DI mRNAs, derived from de novo generated DI vRNAs, in single-cell infections using scRNA-seq. Note that all bulk- and single-cell infection conditions were identical in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Using the chimeric reads as a marker to identify different DI vRNAs, we observed 16 distinct DI vRNAs in the seed virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Strikingly, the number of different DI vRNAs increased to 141 in the progeny virions, implicating 125 de novo generated DI vRNAs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>B shows the inferred lengths of DI vRNAs with respect to the expression level of DI vRNAs. We approximated the expression level of DI vRNAs by the normalized number of chimeric reads spanning the deletion junction. However, the number represents a lower bound for the expression level as read pairs mapping beyond the deletion junction cannot be technically distinguished between FL and DI vRNAs. We observed that DI vRNAs pre-existing in the seed virus became more abundant in the progeny virions, suggesting that they were amplified within a single cycle of high MOI infection, as to be expected for DIP propagation [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accordingly, the apparently de novo generated DI vRNAs showed lower expression levels in the progeny virions. Moreover, all DI vRNAs contained breaking points situated ~250&#x02013;400 bp apart from the terminal ends of S1&#x02013;S3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), which is in accordance with previous observations [<xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, utilizing scRNA-seq analysis, we observed deletion junctions of DI mRNAs in infected single cells at similar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), which seems to confirm their identity as DI mRNAs arising from DI vRNAs. Moreover, we observed six deletion junctions in the single-cell DI mRNAs that were identical to those identified in the DI vRNAs of the seed virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>A), indicating the amplification of these pre-existing DI vRNAs (and thus, DI mRNAs) in single cells. Furthermore, we also detected 25 deletion junctions not observed in the seed virus, implicating the de novo generation of DI vRNAs that can be observed at the single cell level. In agreement with this, we also observed such apparent de novo generated DI vRNAs in single cells by RT-PCR analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, as indicated by the presence of faint signals corresponding to DI vRNAs. However, also note the presence of six single-cell DI mRNA deletion junctions that were identical to those observed for apparently de novo generated DI vRNAs present in the progeny virions of the bulk infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Such an observation most likely relates to low levels of pre-existing DI vRNAs in the seed virus that were not detectable. Nevertheless, our results strongly indicate the generation of highly diverse de novo DI vRNAs at the single-cell level, which unveils an additional facet of the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in IAV replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-viruses-12-00071"><title>3.6. Viral mRNA Level and DI mRNA Content Are Both Connected with the Single-Cell Virus Yield, Independently from One Another</title><p>As described above, a high load of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>C) and a low content of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>) was observed in high-yield single cells. We next investigated whether the two factors can both, independently from one another, affect single-cell virus titers. For this, we subdivided cells that contained or did not contain DI mRNAs based on the presence and absence of large insert sizes (indicating DI mRNAs). Subsequently, we investigated whether in each group, a higher level of viral mRNA content could be observed for high-yield cells compared to low-yield cells. For this, we subtracted all read pairs with a large insert size (indicating DI mRNA) from the total viral mRNA content.</p><p>Indeed, we observed higher levels of viral mRNA in high-yield cells in each group of cells that were either negative or positive in DI mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f006">Figure 6</xref>). However, this difference was only significant in the group of cells that were positive in DI mRNAs, and not in cells negative in DI mRNAs. This might be explained by the low sample size in the latter group, which may have not provided enough statistical power. Nevertheless, it appeared that regardless of whether DI mRNAs were present or not, the total level of viral mRNA was correlated with the single-cell virus yield.</p><p>Conversely, in the group of low-yield cells, we observed a subset of cells that nevertheless contained relatively high levels of total viral mRNAs. Intriguingly, these cells tested positive regarding the presence of DI mRNAs. These results suggest that, despite higher levels of viral mRNAs, the presence of DI mRNAs (indicative for DI vRNAs) likely resulted in interference with virus replication, and thus, a decrease in virus yield. Although not significant, a similar trend was observed in the group of high-yield cells where the cells containing a higher level of mRNAs, in turn, also tested positive for DI mRNAs. We concluded that the DI mRNA content and the level of viral mRNAs are both, independently from one another, connected with single-cell virus production.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-12-00071"><title>4.

We conducted single-cell analysis of IAV replication and reveal an association of DIP co-infections and single-cell progeny virus yields. Thus, differences in the content of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs (observed between individual cells) may well contribute to the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus release. However, we also found a few exceptions from this observation, which may be explained by scarcely occurring DI vRNAs, which cannot interfere with standard virus (STV) replication for unknown reasons [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or more likely, the presence of additional factors that can influence single-cell virus yield.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed a multifaceted single-cell variability in intracellular DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs that involved (i) the presence or absence, (ii) the load and (iii) the length, and (iv) the genomic segments on which the DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs occurred. Such a large heterogeneity may well reflect the virus-to-virus diversity in the DI vRNA content of individual DIPs in the infecting virus population. Alternatively, some DI vRNAs might have originated de novo during the infection. In particular, our results of single-cell RT-PCR and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>C) and of scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>) indicate de novo generation of DI vRNAs, observed at the single-cell level. This hints at an additional facet of the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in IAV replication. </p><p>Previously, single-cell virus replication under the influence of DIP co-infections has been studied in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cells [<xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and IAV-infected cells [<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], however, the latter study focused on the effect of DIP co-infections on the host cell response. In particular, an association between defective viral genomes and the stimulation of the innate immune response was observed [<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, a direct correlation of the load of intracellular DI RNAs with single-cell progeny virus release was not investigated. The same is true for previous studies involving single-cell VSV infections [<xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Here, the authors instead co-infected VSV-infected cells with different multiplicities of DIP (MODIP). In line with our results, the authors observed a reduction and delay in VSV replication once co-infected with increasing MODIP [<xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Upon infection, IAVs hijack the cells&#x02019; biosynthetic machinery including ribosomes. More specifically, ribosomes are recruited for the translation of viral proteins that are necessary for virus propagation. Previously, a correlation between cellular resources required for protein synthesis and virus release was suggested for the T7 phage infection [<xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed a vast cell-to-cell diversity in the ribosome content of IAV-infected MDCK cells with quantitative differences that spanned roughly four orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, however, a correlation between the single-cell virus release and the ribosome content was not observed. This indicates that ribosomes are sufficiently present in each individual cell, despite the large quantitative between-cell variability, and that they do not pose a bottleneck in IAV production.</p><p>Furthermore, we showed that high-yield cells harbor an elevated fraction of viral mRNAs as compared to low-yield cells. This observation is in agreement with a previous study, where we observed elevated levels of vRNAs in IAV-infected single cells showing high virus titers [<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this context, it may be conclusive that a higher number of vRNAs leads to an elevated transcription of viral mRNAs, which, in turn, provide more templates for an enhanced translation of viral proteins that are required for virus particle production. Conversely, we found that the fraction of host cell mRNAs was decreased in high-yield cells. This was similarly observed for herpes virus-infected single cells [<xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Here, a higher cellular gene expression coincided with lower viral gene expression. It was speculated that specific host cell determinants are responsible for a supposed suppression of virus replication. Such determinants may be the innate immune response [<xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and other antiviral host cell factors that were previously identified by scRNA-seq [<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>However, the concentration of host cell mRNAs of the single-cell samples was very low. Thus, the measurements were affected by a high degree of technical noise, preventing the accurate identification of host cell transcripts that are specific for high- or low-yield cells. Note that in other studies, host cell mRNAs of virus-infected single cells could be reliably identified [<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We suppose that the following technical and experimental differences of our study are responsible for the noisy data. First, a relatively high volume (5 &#x000b5;L) of single-cell lysates was investigated, leading to low analyte concentrations and thus, decreased sensitivities when compared to the volumes (in the pico- and nanoliter range) that can be achieved with the microfluidics-based technologies [<xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] used in the above-mentioned studies. Second, we used an open single-cell cultivation system in 384-well plates, which may be susceptible to contamination with ubiquitously present ribonucleases [<xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Third, highly permissive MDCK cells were used, which allow for strong virus replication and high virus titers [<xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], but presumably, low cellular gene expression levels. Finally, experiments were performed at high MOI, leading to a strong virus replication and likely, an enhanced suppression of host cell gene expression.</p><p>Nevertheless, the expression of viral mRNAs was high enough for the accurate analysis of DI mRNAs by scRNA-seq. Note that the results of bulk RNA-seq indicated similar junction regions of the DI vRNAs in comparison to the single-cell DI mRNAs (~250&#x02013;400 bp apart from the terminal ends, in agreement with previous observations [<xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]), which confirms their identity as transcriptional descendants of the DI vRNAs. Such DI mRNAs, which can result in the translation of small polypeptides, were described previously for IAV-infected cells [<xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It was long speculated that some of these polypeptides may have a function, like contributing to the defectiveness or interference of a DIP [<xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Moreover, it was shown that such small polypeptides can act immune&#x02013;stimulatory and thus, can contribute to the antiviral activity of DIPs [<xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Finally, our results suggest that the level of viral mRNAs and the load of DI mRNAs are both, independently from one another, connected with single-cell virus yield.</p><p>Taken together, our results underline that elucidation of the origins of the high cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus replication is a complex multi-parametric problem, where many different factors each exert an individual effect. In particular, we showed that DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs (interfering with virus replication), total level of viral mRNAs (facilitating the production of viral proteins), the fraction of host cell mRNAs (of which some factors may inhibit virus replication), but not the ribosome content, may have an impact on yields of a single IAV-infected cell. Nevertheless, it seems that various additional determinants remain to be elucidated. Overall, single-cell virology qualifies as a valuable tool to broaden our understanding of the vast cell-to-cell variability in virus replication.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-viruses-12-00071"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="viruses-12-00071-s001"><media xlink:href="viruses-12-00071-s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/1/71/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/1/71/s1</uri>, Figure S1: Quality control; Figure S2: Technical variability; Figure S3: Coverage plot of PB2, PB1 and PA of example cells; Figure S4: Amount of DI RNAs affecting the virus titer; Figure S5: Controls for and statistical analyses on the impact of ribosome quantity, fraction of viral and host cell mRNAs on single-cell virus yield (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>); Table S1: Data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B; Table S2: Single-cell gene expression after quality control (QC); Table S3: Sample annotation after QC; Table S4: Small and large insert size counts; Table S5: Identified and annotated chimeric read junctions.</p></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, S.Y.K., L.-H.L., S.T.B., S.H., U.R., and B.T.; Methodology, S.Y.K. and S.T.B.; Software, L.-H.L., S.T.B., and S.H.; Validation, A.R.; Formal analysis, L.-H.L., A.R., S.T.B., S.Y.K., S.H., M.V., and B.T.; Investigation, L.H.L., A.R., S.T.B., and S.Y.K.; Resources, B.T. and S.H.; Writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, S.Y.K. and L.-H.L.; Writing&#x02014;review and editing, S.T.B., U.R., S.H., M.V., B.T., and A.R.; Visualization, L.-H.L. and S.Y.K.; Supervision, U.R., S.H., M.V., and B.T.; Project administration, U.R., M.V., and B.T.
