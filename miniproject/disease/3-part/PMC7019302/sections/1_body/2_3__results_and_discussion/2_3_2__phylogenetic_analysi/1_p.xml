<p>The maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis regarding WNV strains resulted in two bush-like groups, representing the two major subclades of WNV strains circulating simultaneously in Central Europe as previously described by others [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the circulating WNV strains of 2018 were segregated into two different subgroups, indicating the simultaneous circulation of members from these two clades of the virus in Hungary in 2018. Partial NS3 and NS5 sequences both supported this observation. One of these phylogenetic clusters was related to members of the Balkans subclade, while the other contained WNV strains mainly from Southern and Western European countries. One Western European sequence, which was imported to Belgium from Hungary, was grouped to the Balkanian subclade. This offers a more precise evolutionary origin regarding this imported case than previously published [
