<p>Attempts to isolate the virus on C6/36 and VeroE6 cell lines proved to be successful in the case of one 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> mosquito pool (
 <italic>n</italic> = 50) homogenate from the Serbian/Hungarian border and one northern goshawk (
 <italic>Accipiter gentilis</italic>) brain tissue homogenate. Unfortunately, repeated attempts to isolate the virus from horse brain tissue homogenates failed regarding both cell lines. Following the third blind passage, we could not detect WNV RNA in the supernatants of lysed cells by the previously mentioned real-time RT-PCR system, likely due to the loss of viability of virus particles as a consequence regarding the condition of carcasses at the time of collection, handling, and storage methods of the samples.
