Entomological surveillance of larvae and adult stages of mosquitoes was further performed in Hungary, examining the adjacent area of horse WNV cases in Dunaföldvár in 2018.

Larvae collection was performed using the standard dipping method, while adult stages were collected via CDC light traps (BioQuip Products, CA, USA) and hand aspirators. Larvae samples and adult mosquitoes were pooled, including a maximum of 20 specimens per tube, and subjected to molecular analysis. Mosquito samples were identified via morphological characteristics [
