<p>Until 2004, only the presence of lineage 1 and 3 WNV strains appeared in Europe [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Following the first emergence of lineage 2 WNV in Hungary in 2004 [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], this genetic variant was characterized by an explosive spread and genetic diversification in the region [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and was responsible for several epidemics across Europe (Italy, Greece, Serbia, Austria, etc.) in both human and animal populations. The epidemics have resulted in approximately 200â€“300 human cases annually since the emergence of lineage 2 WNV [
