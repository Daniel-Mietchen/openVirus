  <p>MAYV infection is associated with acute production of inflammatory mediators. 6-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated or not with wt MAYV (2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL, i.pl.) and levels of (
   <bold>a</bold>) IL1-β; (
   <bold>b</bold>) IL-6; (
   <bold>c</bold>) IFN-γ; (
   <bold>d</bold>) TNF-α; (

   <bold>i</bold>) CCL2; (
   <bold>j</bold>) CCL3; (
   <bold>k</bold>) CCL4 and (
   <bold>l</bold>) CCL5 in the spleen were analyzed by ELISA in different time-points. Results are expressed as pg/100 mg of spleen. Data is representative of two experiments expressed as mean ± SEM. *p &lt; 0.05 when compared to control uninfected mice (MOCK), as assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.
