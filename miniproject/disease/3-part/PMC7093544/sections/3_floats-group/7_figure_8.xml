  <p>Immunogenicity and efficacy of the live attenuated MAYV/IRES vaccine in A129 mice. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Experimental design. (
   <bold>b–g</bold>) 8-week-old A129 mice were inoculated with 2 × 10
   <sup>4</sup>, 2 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> or 2 × 10
   <sup>2</sup> PFU/50 μL of either MAYV/IRES or wt MAYV strains and lethality rates (
   <bold>b</bold>,
   <bold>d</bold>,
   <bold>f</bold>) and body weight (
   <bold>c</bold>,
   <bold>e</bold>,
   <bold>g</bold>) analyzed every 12 hours until day 14 post-virus inoculation. Results are shown as % survival or body weight. Intermediary inoculum (2 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU/mouse) was chosen for further experiments (
   <bold>h–o</bold>). Analysis were conducted 4 d.p.i. h) Total and differential cell counts of inflammatory cells in the blood. (
   <bold>i</bold>) Plaque assay analysis of hind paw, PLN, quadriceps muscle, spleen, liver, brain and serum. Results are shown as the log of PFU per/g of tissue or PFU per/mL of serum. (
   <bold>j</bold>) Footpad swelling was assessed by measuring the height and width of the perimetatarsal area of the hind foot. Results are shown as mm
   <sup>2</sup>. (
   <bold>k</bold>) ALT levels in serum. Results are show as U/L of serum. (
   <bold>l</bold>) Anti-MAYV IgM and IgG titers in serum collected 0, 7 and 14 d.p.i. Results are expressed as O.D. (
   <bold>m</bold>) Footpad swelling was assessed by measuring the height and width of the perimetatarsal area of the hind foot before and after wt MAYV challenge. Results are shown as mm
   <sup>2</sup>. (
   <bold>n</bold>) % of body weight. (
   <bold>o</bold>) % of survival. Results were expressed as median (
   <bold>i</bold>) or mean ± SEM (
   <bold>b–h</bold> and 
   <bold>j–o</bold>) and are representative of two experiments. *p &lt; 0.05 when compared to control uninfected mice (MOCK). 
   <sup>#</sup>p &lt; 0.05 when compared to naïve wt MAYV infected group, as assessed by two-way (
   <bold>b–g</bold>) or one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test (
   <bold>h–o</bold>).
