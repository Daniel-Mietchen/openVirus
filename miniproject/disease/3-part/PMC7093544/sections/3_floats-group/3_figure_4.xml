  <p>The MAYV/IRES attenuated vaccine strain is associated with reduced production of inflammatory mediators 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>, and upon antigen stimulation 
   <italic>ex vivo</italic>. 6-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated either wt MAYV or MAYV/IRES (2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL, i.pl.) and levels of (
   <bold>a</bold>) IL1-β; (
   <bold>b</bold>) IL-6; (
   <bold>c</bold>) IFN-γ; (
   <bold>d</bold>) TNF-α; (

   <bold>i</bold>) CCL2; (
   <bold>j</bold>) CCL3; (
   <bold>k</bold>) CCL4 and (
   <bold>l</bold>) CCL5 in the spleen were measured in different time-points. Results are expressed as pg/100 mg of spleen. (

   <italic>Ex vivo</italic> stimulation of splenocytes isolated from MOCK-, wt MAYV-, and MAYV/IRES-inoculated mice 28 d.p.i. Splenocytes were then re-stimulated with 2 μg/mL ConA, inactivated wt MAYV or inactivated MAYV/IRES. Cell supernatants were harvested after 48 hours of stimulation for cytokine (
   <bold>m</bold>) IFN-γ; (
   <bold>n</bold>) IL-17; (
   <bold>o</bold>) TNF-α and (
   <bold>p</bold>) IL-10 measurements as described in methods. Results are expressed as pg/100 mL of culture supernatant. Data is representative of two experiments expressed as mean ± SEM. *p &lt; 0.05 when compared to control uninfected cells (MOCK). 
   <sup>#</sup>p &lt; 0.05 when compared to wt MAYV stimulated cells, as assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test. ND, not detectable.
