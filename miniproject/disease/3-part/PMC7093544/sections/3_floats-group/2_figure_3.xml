  <p>The MAYV/IRES attenuated vaccine strain induces stronger cellular and humoral responses in BALB/c mice. 6-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated or not with either wt MAYV or MAYV/IRES (2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL, i.pl.). (
   <bold>a</bold>) Mechanical hypernociception was assessed at different time points after virus inoculation, as described in figure legend 1. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Total and differential cell counts of inflammatory cells in the blood. (
   <bold>c–g</bold>) plaque assay analysis of hind paw (
   <bold>c</bold>) LNP (
   <bold>d</bold>), quadriceps muscle (
   <bold>e</bold>), spleen (
   <bold>f</bold>) and serum (
   <bold>g</bold>). (
   <bold>h</bold>,
   <bold>i</bold>) Anti-MAYV IgM and IgG titers of pre- and post-infection serum samples collected on day zero and every 7 days until day 49. (
   <bold>j</bold>) Neutrophil influx to the hind foot was measured indirectly by evaluation of MPO activity. (
   <bold>k</bold>) Macrophage influx to the hind foot was measured indirectly by analysis of NAG activity. (
   <bold>l</bold>) Shows semi-quantitative analysis (histopathological score) and representative pictures of hind paw sections of control and MAYV-infected mice, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 d.p.i. Results were expressed as median (
   <bold>c–g</bold>) or mean ± SEM (
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>b</bold> and 
   <bold>h–l</bold>) and are representative of two experiments. Original magnification: 200×. Scale bar: 100 µm. *p &lt; 0.05 when compared to control uninfected mice (MOCK), as assessed by two-way (a, i and h), one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test (
   <bold>b–g</bold>, 
   <bold>j</bold>,
   <bold>k</bold>) or Mann-Whitney test (
   <bold>l</bold>).
