 </sup>. This possibility underscores the need for new ways of preventing or treating MAYV infection, including the need for an approved vaccine. Knowledge about MAYV-induced immunopathology frequently derives from studies with other alphaviruses

 </sup>. In the present study, we described a novel model of MAYV infection in adult immunocompetent mice, which emulates the major manifestations of MAYV infection in humans. The major findings of the present study can be summarized as follows: (a) MAYV inoculation into young adult immunocompetent mice induced persistent articular hypernociception, transient viral replication in target organs, systemic production of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines; and specific humoral IgM and IgG responses; (b) Inoculation of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES) in adult BALB/c mice induced stronger cellular and neutralizing antibody responses; (c) MAYV/IRES vaccination of immunocompetent and A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice resulted in protection from disease induced by the virulent wt MAYV strain.
