<p id="Par30">In the present study we also performed an in-deep characterization of a live-attenuated vaccine (MAYV/IRES), which showed beneficial responses in infant immunocompetent CD1 mice and in Interferon-receptor deficient mice

 </sup>. The live-attenuated MAYV/IRES strain did not replicate to comparable titers as the WT strain in adult BALB/c and A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice; however, the vaccine candidate elicited a robust and specific antibody responses, similar to that observed with the wt MAYV strain. The vaccine analyzed in this work showed to confer protection against MAYV challenge and to be safe in an adult immunocompetent model. When compared to the WT, the MAYV/IRES strain induced lower levels of all the cytokines and chemokines analyzed showing lower inflammatory potential. 
 <italic>Ex vivo</italic> analysis with splenocytes confirmed the ability of the MAYV/IRES vaccine to induce strong and long lasting cellular and humoral responses against wt MAYV strain. Accordingly, vaccinated mice challenged with wt MAYV showed reduced hypernociception, lower viral loads and decreased inflammatory markers in comparison to challenged non-vaccinated animals. MAYV/IRES vaccination also elicited augmented cellular responses, characterized by elevation of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bloodstream. There was reduced level of MPO and increased NAG levels on the inoculated hind paw of vaccinated group as compared to wt MAYV-infected naïve mice. Plaque assay revealed a massive reduction of infectious virus recovery from the hind paw and a complete prevention of virus spread to the PLN, quadriceps muscle, spleen and serum. Indeed, histopathological analysis from the hind paw of MAYV/IRES-vaccinated mice revealed maintenance of tissue architecture, in contrast to the disruption caused by WT-MAYV injection. Finally, vaccinated mice showed lower levels of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α, as well as, the chemokines, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5. As these molecules are associated to monocytes response and to alphavirus normal response

 </sup>, our data indicate lower level of monocyte activation by the vaccinal strain as compared to the WT virus. This is important for a vaccine for MAYV since activation of monocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of MAYV-induced arthritis

 </sup>. Finally, flow cytometric analyses of spleen leukocytes showed more robust immune response in MAYV/IRES immunized mice when compared to the WT strain. Immunization with MAYV/IRES induced splenic DC accumulation and activation, accompanied by a greater activation of splenic macrophages. MAYV/IRES also augmented T CD8
 <sup>+</sup> immune response, as indicated by the higher frequency of cells TCD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells expressing CD44. Indeed, we observed higher production of IL-17 by CD4
 <sup>+</sup> Th17 cells in the spleens of in MAYV/IRES vaccinated mice. Taken together, our results show that vaccination of immunocompetent mice with the live attenuated MAYV/IRES virus was safe and induced fully protection against a virulent WT MAYV strain challenge.
