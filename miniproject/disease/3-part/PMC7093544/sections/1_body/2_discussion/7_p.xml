<p id="Par31">We also tested this vaccine in a lethal model of MAYV infection in A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice. In this model the vaccine maintains the behavior observed in the immunocompetent model with a major phenotype of protection. Of note, if given in a higher inoculum (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>), MAYV/IRES inoculation induced 100% lethality of A129
 <sup>−/−</sup>. Although this strain is attenuated, MAYV/IRES still replicates in host cells and A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> are deficient in important innate immune components, more specifically the type I interferons α/β receptor. These molecules (IFN-α and β) play a significant role in preventing viral replication and protecting the host against arboviral infections

 </sup>. The vaccine proved to be safe, inducing good immunological responses with low viral loads and no local swelling. Since it seems only a matter of time for a large outbreak of MF to arise in Brazil, the development of a vaccine is crucial. Our data allow us to deduce that the vaccine candidate studied elicits good immunological response in the BALB/c model. The development of this vaccine must continue including testing additional animal models with a close attention to immune memory.
