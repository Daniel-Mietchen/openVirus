 </sup>. The sensitization of primary afferent nociceptors leads to a state of hyperalgesia and/or allodynia, in humans, better described as hypernociception in animal models
 <sup>

 </sup>. Articular hypernociception is usually indirectly evaluated in mice by mechanical and thermal tests

 </sup>. Using these methods, we have shown significant hypernociception in response to mechanical stimulation upon Dengue virus infection

 </sup>. Accordingly, we and others

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup> have demonstrated that infection of mice with wild type strains of MAYV induces increased mechanical hypernociception up to 21 days of virus inoculation. Interestingly, MAYV-IRES vaccination of mice was able to prevent the hypernociception induced by WT MAYV challenge.
