<p id="Par22">Finally, in A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice inoculated with 2 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU of the wt MAYV strain induced progressive body weight loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8g</xref>), which culminated in 100% of death by day 10 after virus inoculation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref>). In contrast, the MAYV/IRES-infected group exhibited transitory body weight loss and 100% of survival (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f,g</xref>). These results clearly suggest that low inocula of MAYV/IRES are safe in mice that are immunodeficient. Further experiments evaluated the inflammatory response and viral loads after vaccine and the WT virus inoculation in A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice. The intermediate inoculum of 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU was used and analysis were performed at day 4 after infection, before the death of A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice infected with the WT strain.
