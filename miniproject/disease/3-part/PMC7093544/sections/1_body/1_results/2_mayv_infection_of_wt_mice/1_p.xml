 </sup>. We evaluated the production of inflammatory mediators during the course of MAYV infection in BALB/c mice. MAYV infection induced acute production of several pro-inflammatory molecules in the spleen such as IL1-β (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and IL-6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) from days 1 to 7 of infection; IFN-γ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) from days 1 to 5 and finally, TNF-α (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) at the early time-points of 1 and 3 days post-MAYV inoculation. Indeed, the growth factor VEGF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), the cytokine IL-17 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>) were also elevated from days 1 to 5 post-MAYV inoculation. Finally, several chemokines involved in leukocyte recruitment were augmented upon MAYV-inoculation: CXCL-1, involved on the recruitment of neutrophils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>), CCL2 of monocytes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>); CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 associated with recruitment of monocytes, dendritic cells and activated T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j–l</xref>). Most of those chemoattractants were elevated from day 1 to day 5 except for CCL3, which was augmented only from days 1 to 3 and CCL5 that increased at day 3 and lasted until day 7. Of note, all mediators returned to baseline levels as in MOCK controls by day 14 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–l</xref>). In serum, elevated levels of IL1-β were detected at days 1 and 3 after MAYV inoculation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>) but were no detectable levels of TNF-α or IL-6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b,c</xref>).
