<p id="Par6">Experiments were conducted in 6-week-old immunocompetent (BALB/c strain) mice inoculated with 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/50 μL of MAYV via the s.c. intraplantar (i.pl.) route and several analyses were performed to assess kinetics of infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Non-infected mice (MOCK) received a 50 μL s.c. i.pl. injection of C6/36 cell culture supernatant. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> shows that MAYV-infected mice resulted in hypernociception from day 1 until day 21 after virus inoculation and this was much greater than responses observed in control littermates. At day 28, all values returned to baseline levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Total and differential blood leukocyte analysis revealed elevated numbers of monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes on the MAYV-infected group, from day 1 to day 14, in comparison to non-infected controls. At day 21, all leukocyte subtypes returned to baseline values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Viable viruses were recovered from the paw at days 1 to 7 p.i (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), while in the popliteal lymph node (LNP) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), quadriceps muscle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), spleen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>) and serum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>) virus recovery occurred at days 1 and 3 post-infection. Of note, no detectable virus was recovered from the liver at any analyzed time points (data not shown).
