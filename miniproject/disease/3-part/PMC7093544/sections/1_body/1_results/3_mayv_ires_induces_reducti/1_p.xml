 </sup> further by using the immunocompetent mouse model described above. Results showed that while mice infected with the wt MAYV strain presented elevated hypernociception from day 1 until day 21 of virus inoculation (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), the intensity and duration of hypernociception was significantly reduced in the MAYV/IRES-inoculated group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). By day 14, nociceptive levels in MAYV/IRES mice returned to levels similar to those observed in MOCK-controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Interestingly, an acute increase in circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes (days 1 and 3) was found in MAYV/IRES mice, in comparison to wt MAYV infected controls. At days 7 and 14, values were significantly reduced in comparison to wt MAYV littermates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Of note, by day 21, all leukocytes subtypes returned to baseline values similar to those found in MOCK controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). As expected, the recovery of infectious virus was greatly less in MAYV/IRES-infected mice, as shown in the paw (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), popliteal lymph node (LNP) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), quadriceps muscle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), spleen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) and serum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) in comparison to the wt MAYV strain. Specific anti-MAYV IgM and IgG responses were greater in the MAYV/IRES group than in wt MAYV-infected littermates. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref> shows there was a 2-fold greater increase in IgM levels in the MAYV/IRES group, at day 7 after virus inoculation, when compared to WT virus. Similarly, IgG levels were massively augmented at days 7 and 14 post-MAYV/IRES inoculation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). However, after day 21, IgG levels were equally elevated in both infected groups in comparison to MOCK controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>).
