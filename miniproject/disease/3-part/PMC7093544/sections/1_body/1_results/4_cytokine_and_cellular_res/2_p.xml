<p id="Par14">Next, we decided to confirm the ability of the MAYV/IRES vaccine to induce cellular responses against MAYV challenge 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Spleens from non-infected and wt MAYV or MAYV/IRES-infected mice were collected, splenocytes isolated and plated. Two hours later, media was harvested and splenocytes stimulated with one of the following: media, Con-A (2 µg/mL), inactivated MAYV/IRES (iMAYV/IRES) or inactivated wt MAYV (iwt MAYV) for 48 hours followed by investigation of cytokine levels in the supernatant. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m–p</xref> shows that splenocytes from the MAYV/IRES vaccine group stimulated with either iMAYV/IRES or iwt MAYV were able to produce IFN-γ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m</xref>) and IL-17 cytokines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4n</xref>) but not IL-10 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4o</xref>) or TNF-α (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4p</xref>). Interestingly, cytokine production in response to iwt MAYV was higher in comparison to iMAYV/IRES–stimulated splenocytes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m,n</xref>). Negative control cells produced low levels of the tested cytokines, while the polyclonal stimuli concanavalin A (ConA, positive control) induced elevated levels of all tested mediators (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m–p</xref>). These results demonstrate that MAYV/IRES vaccine is able to induce rapid, strong and long lasting cellular and humoral responses against MAYV.
