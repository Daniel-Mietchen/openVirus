 </sup>. Viral replication and titration by plaque assay of both MAYV/IRES (vaccine) and wt MAYV strains was performed using the African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells obtained from the Banco de Células do Rio de Janeiro (BCRJ). Results are shown as the log of PFU per/g of tissue or PFU per/mL of serum. In some experiments, wt MAYV and MAYV/IRES were inactivated by heat (56 °C) for 60 min in the water bath. Inactivation was confirmed by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells.
