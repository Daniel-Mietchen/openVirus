<p id="Par4">MF is a dengue-like febrile syndrome. The incubation phase lasts for 7 to 12 days, followed by onset of high fever, frontal headache, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, articular edema (mainly in wrist, knees and ankles), retro-orbital pain, malaise, skin rash, vomiting, diarrhea among others. Arthralgia and arthritis are common hallmarks of MF, which is painful and very debilitating, sometimes lasting for weeks-to-years after the clearance of infection

 </sup>. The similarity of the clinical presentation of MF with other arboviral diseases, such as dengue, along with the absence of good diagnostic kits in areas of co-circulation of multiple arboviruses suggest that the precise number of cases is probably underestimated and the incidence of MAYV infection could be much higher

 </sup>, e.g., it has been suggested that about 41.5% of riverside inhabitants have antibodies against MAYV

Nevertheless, there is no approved vaccine or specific treatment for MF and the development of a vaccine is essential to prevent future outbreaks of this potentially important human disease.
