<p id="Par5">Here, using a wild-type (WT) strain of MAYV, we developed a model of MAYV infection in immunocompetent mice that emulates several aspects of the human disease, including arthritis and hypernociception. In parallel, we evaluated the response profile of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES)

 </sup> by conducting an in-depth characterization of clinical, virological and immunological parameters in comparison to the WT strain. Finally, we investigated the protective role of MAYV/IRES vaccination in both immunocompetent and A129
 <sup>−/−</sup> (interferon type I receptor-defective) mice followed by a challenge with the virulent wt MAYV strain.
