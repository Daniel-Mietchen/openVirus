<p>IVE estimates were calculated overall and type/subtype specific for the whole season and during different time periods of the season. A prerequisite for the IVE calculation was the epidemic influenza virus activity, as indicated by a rate of influenza positive samples of ≥50%. In addition overall and type/subtype specific IVE were also calculated for different age-groups (6 month to 14 years, 15–64 years and above 65 years).</p>
