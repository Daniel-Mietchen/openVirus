<p>Influenza virus detection and genotyping of the HA- and NA-gene were performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Briefly, sentinel specimens were tested for influenza viruses by reverse transcription realtime PCR (RT realtime PCR). After RNA extraction, amplification, and purification, sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems ABI 3130xl platform (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were performed using software package MEGA Version 4 (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). “Kimura-2” distance method and “Neighbour-Joining” algorithm were used for the phylogenic tree reconstruction.
