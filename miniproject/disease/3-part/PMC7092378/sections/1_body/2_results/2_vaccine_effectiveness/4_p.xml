<p>In contrast to the previous one in the following season 2017/18, dominated by influenza B viruses with a co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 strains, an overall IVE of 39% [A(H1N1)pdm09 25%, influenza B 45%] was observed (

Despite the low overall IVE and the pronounced influenza B lineage mismatch of the TIV/aTIV vaccine strain a quite good IVE against influenza B viruses of 63% could be observed in children aged 6 month to 14 years. Analyzing IVE for the QIVs, which were available in Austria for the first time during this season, revealed a slight increased overall IVE of 46% and an IVE of 76% for children between 6 month and 14 years of age.
