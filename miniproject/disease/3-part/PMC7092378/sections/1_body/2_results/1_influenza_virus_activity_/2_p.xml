<p>The season 2016/17 was a moderate influenza season with an influenza incidence of 270,000 cases in Austria and was characterized by the nearly exclusive circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The season 2017/18 was dominated by influenza B viruses and with co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were only detectable in a minority of samples. Despite the dominance of influenza B viruses, season 2017/18 was a very severe influenza season with an incidence of 440,000 influenza cases in Austria. In the following season 2018/19, again, a totally different pattern of virus circulation was observed. This season was dominated by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with co-circulating A(H3N2) viruses. The influenza incidence was 145,000 influenza cases in Austria, and it was therefore a moderate influenza season.</p>
