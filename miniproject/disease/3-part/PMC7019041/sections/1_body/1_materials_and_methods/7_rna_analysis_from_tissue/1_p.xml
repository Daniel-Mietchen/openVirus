<p>Whole lung tissue was stored in RNAlater (Ambion, Loughborough UK) at post-mortem examination. RNA was extracted from tissue using RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Manchester UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a TissueRuptor probe (Qiagen) for tissue homogenization. RNA was then treated with DNAseI (Ambion) to remove genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contamination. For a quantitative analysis of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed in a 20 μL volume (SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix; Thermo), and 2 μL of complementary DNA (cDNA) was used for each real-time reaction. RT-qPCR was performed using the primers listed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) and 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle (cT) method (Applied Biosystems). Target gene transcription of each sample was normalized to the respective levels of beta-Actin mRNA and represented as fold change over gene expression in control animals.
