<p>Plasma was isolated by centrifugation of whole blood taken via cardiac puncture into a heparinized syringe and stored at −70°C. Plasma IL-6 levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Biolegend ELISA MAX Deluxe, London UK). Values below the blank were reported at the limit of detection for statistical purposes. To determine circulating influenza HA antibodies following influenza vaccination, a direct ELISA was done. Here, flat MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated overnight with the vaccine (diluted 1:3000 in DPBS, or 0.01 μg/mL HA) or live virus (1.28 HAU/mL) at 100 μL. Using a commercial ELISA reagent kit (eBioscience catalog number BMS412, Loughborough UK), plates were washed three times and blocked for 1 h with 200 μL of assay buffer. After washing, 100 μL of serially-diluted plasma was incubated at room temperature (RT) for 2 h. After washing, 100 μL of sheep, anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)-G horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibody (Amersham catalog number NA931, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire UK) diluted 1:4000 was incubated at RT for 2 h before final washes and 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate development. Absorbance was determined at 450 nm by SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Wokingham UK). Vaccine take was confirmed for all vaccinated mice with HA-IgG ELISA at 1:100 dilution of plasma.</p>
