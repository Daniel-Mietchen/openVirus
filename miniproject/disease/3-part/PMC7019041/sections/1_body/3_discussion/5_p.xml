<p>Another possibility is that NK cells regulate the accumulation of adaptive, cytotoxic (CD8+) effector T cells at the site of infection, thereby reducing tissue damage but slowing viral clearance. In RSV infection, for example, CD8+ cells are directly associated with weight loss and depleting them reduces disease (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, thus far, in influenza vaccination models CD8+ T cells appear to contribute to both reduced viral load and reduced disease severity (

Due to limitations of cell numbers, we were unable to characterize the responsiveness of T cells in this study and therefore further work is needed to determine whether the lack of NK cells removes the brake on adaptive T cell responses during influenza infection.
