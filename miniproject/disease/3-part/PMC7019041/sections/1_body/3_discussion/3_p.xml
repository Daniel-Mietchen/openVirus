<p>Although we saw a clear impact of NK cell depletion on the post-vaccination response to influenza in both male and female mice, we did observe some sex-specific differences in our data. Whilst we do not have a complete, replicated set of all data in both sexes at every time point, limiting our ability to draw specific conclusions regarding the impact of sex on the role of NK cells during influenza infection and vaccination, we found that NK cell-depleted unvaccinated male mice (but not female mice) lost significantly more weight than intact mice after infection (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)] however, many previous studies to determine the role of NK cells during acute influenza infection mice have used male or female mice only, or have failed to define the sex of the mice used (
