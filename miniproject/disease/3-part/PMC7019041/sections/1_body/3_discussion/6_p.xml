<p>In a recent study (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), murine NK cells licensed on self MHC were shown to localize to infected lung tissue and produce IFN-Î³ after influenza A (strain PR8) infection. Unlicensed NK cells, in contrast, were enriched in draining (mediastinal) lymph nodes, produced GM-CSF and promoted dendritic cell infiltration and CD8+ T cell responses. It is therefore likely that distinct subsets of NK cells may selectively promote inflammation or antiviral immunity. Furthermore, this may differ depending on levels of adaptive immunity.
