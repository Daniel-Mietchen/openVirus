<p>Previous work has suggested that the role of NK cells during influenza infection is dependent on the infecting dose of the virus, with NK cells being protective during low dose infection (0.5 HAU) and pathogenic during high dose infection (5 HAU) (

Although we used the A/California/4/2009 strain of influenza rather than PR8 strain used by Zhou et al. we used an infecting dose that is similar to the low dose used by Zhou et al. (0.5 HAU) and saw a similar trend. Interestingly, an opposite effect was seen during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection where NK cells prevented pathology at high viral doses but enhanced disease at low doses (
