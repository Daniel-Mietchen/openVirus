<p>There are some important caveats to keep in mind, however. Firstly, in contrast to previous studies using mice lacking NK cells at the time of infection or vaccination, or depleted of NK cells with antibodies on animals of different sexes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S1</xref>), we used an inducible, endogenous method of NK cell depletion which may have fewer limitations (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Nevertheless, DT treatment alone lead to some limited weight loss and pulmonary pathology, likely due to death of ~15% of lung leukocytes, although there was no induction of inflammatory cytokines nor any influx of immune cells into the lung. It remains a possibility, therefore, that the mild inflammation induced by NK cell depletion may have affected the outcome of the experiments. Further, sex differences in influenza-mediated lung pathology have been noted (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Secondly, the ethically-approved humane end point for our study was deemed to be 20% weight loss (after which animals were euthanized), essentially precluding determination of long-term survival after NK cell depletion but some studies have shown only limited correlation between weight loss and long term survival (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), with viral challenge dose a greater predictor of survival despite similar weight loss kinetics (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A further caveat of the Rosa-DT conditional “NK cell” depletion system used here is a potential parallel depletion of mature NKp46+ ILC1 and ILC3 cells (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Studies in deficient 
 <italic>ncr1</italic>
 <sup>gfp</sup> mice, which are susceptible to lethal influenza A infection, demonstrate systemic loss of ILC1, whilst maintaining NKp46 negative NK cell subsets (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Although rare in the non-pathologic lung, our studies do therefore not exclude a potential contribution of ILC-1s to inflammatory processes after influenza vaccination or challenge infection. Lastly, characterization of cytokine protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid would be beneficial in understanding transcriptional changes observed in this study.
