<p>Finally, we measured the relative frequency of infiltrating leukocytes and neutrophils in the lung by flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, males). Influenza infection led to an infiltration of CD3+ T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, gating 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S15</xref>) into the lung of NK-depleted mice, both CD4+ and CD8+ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Infection of unvaccinated mice was associated with an increase in the frequency of activated (CD69+) T cells in the lung (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>); this was attenuated by vaccination (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and increased by depletion of NK cells. There were no obvious effects of infection or vaccination on the frequency of CD19+ B cell populations in the lung; the modest apparent increase in B cell proportions in NK cell-depleted mice (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) may simply reflect distortion of cell percentages by the absence of NK cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, gating 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S16</xref>). However, given that influenza infection increases the influx of CD11b+ cells into the lung (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), we further characterized influx of both inflammatory monocytes (%Ly6C-high) and neutrophils (%Ly6G+) in the lungs of NK-depleted mice. The modest reduction in leukocyte infiltration in the lung that was evident from histology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), was reflected in reduced infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the lung in unvaccinated NK cell-sufficient animals compared to NK-depleted animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), but there was no additional effect of combining vaccination and NK cell depletion. Neutrophil infiltration into the lung was also increased with NK cell depletion, with the frequency of Ly6G+ polymorphonuclear cells being significantly higher in both vaccinated and unvaccinated influenza-infected NK cell-depleted mice compared to NK cell sufficient mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). A single experiment in female mice also found a trend for an increase in Ly6G+ neutrophils in vaccinated and NK cell-depleted mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S9</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the increased weight loss observed with influenza infection in NK cell-depleted vaccinated mice compared to NK cell intact vaccinated mice may be due, in part, to failure of NK cell-depleted mice to control cellular infiltration into the lungs, despite reduced viral burden.
