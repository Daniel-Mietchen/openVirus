<p>To determine if the effects of NK cell depletion on post vaccination immunity to influenza were mediated by NK cells present at (and potentially affected by) vaccination (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), we depleted NK cells (by a single treatment with 2.5 Î¼g of DT) 3 weeks after influenza vaccination (as previously) but then waited another 3 weeks before challenging the mice (to allow repopulation) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In this case, removal of NK cells present at vaccination and subsequent NK cell repopulation resulted in influenza infections that were not significantly different from those in intact mice, with no significant differences in disease severity (weight loss;
