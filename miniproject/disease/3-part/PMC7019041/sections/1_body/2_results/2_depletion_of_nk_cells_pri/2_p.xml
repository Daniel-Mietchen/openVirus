<p>Depletion of NK cells prior to influenza challenge infection led to a significant decrease in influenza burden in the lung in vaccinated animals (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, vaccinated and infected animals which lacked NK cells had prolonged weight loss which was more severe (10%) than in NK cell-intact vaccinated mice (5%) and recovered to baseline only by day 14 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This exacerbated weight loss of infected NK-depleted animals at 4 days post infection compared to NK-cell sufficient mice was seen in both sexes (
