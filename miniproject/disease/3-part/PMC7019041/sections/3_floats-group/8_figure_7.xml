  <p>Summary model of role of NK cells in influenza vaccination and challenge. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Influenza virus infection in na√Øve mice results in an influx of inflammatory monocytes (Ly6C
   <sup>high</sup>) into the lung, with evident histopathology and rapid weight loss. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Vaccination reduces lung virus load and associated pathology (weight loss). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> In unvaccinated animals, NK cell depletion reduces viral load and associated inflammation after influenza infection compared to NK cell replete animals, but animals still lose a significant amount of weight. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> NK depletion of vaccinated mice further reduces influenza viral load and weight loss after infection, yet pathology scores are similar to those of NK intact mice. However, vaccination combined with NK depletion is accompanied by an increase in infiltration of neutrophils and activated T cells into the lung after influenza infection, suggesting that NK cell depletion enhances the control of virus replication as a result of enhanced adaptive immunity but that this comes at the price of significantly increased morbidity. Model created with BioRender.
