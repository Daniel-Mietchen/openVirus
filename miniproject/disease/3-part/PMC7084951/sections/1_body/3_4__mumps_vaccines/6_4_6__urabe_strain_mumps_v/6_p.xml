<p>Canada developed molecular studies on mumps vaccine when the authorities received the reports of aseptic meningitis cases related to the vaccination with MMR vaccine (containing the Urabe mumps virus strain) [
 <xref rid="B117-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. It was found that the Urabe vaccine was a mixture wild type A and variant G virus strains [
 <xref rid="B116-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The MMR vaccine (containing the Urabe strain) was therefore withdrawn from the market in Canada in 1990 [

 <xref rid="B114-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. A study in United Kingdom showed that the rate of aseptic meningitis was 9 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses [
 <xref rid="B119-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. This result was confirmed by a study conducted in multicenter. According to these findings, mumps vaccine (containing Urabe strain) was stopped purchasing in the United Kingdom in 1992. In Japan, nationwide surveillance was run by the Japan Ministry of Health and Welfare during 1989, and reported an incidence of 49 cases of aseptic meningitis per 100,000 doses of MMR vaccine (containing the Urabe mumps strain) [
 <xref rid="B120-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Until 1993, a cumulative incidence of aseptic meningitis achieved 100 cases per 100,000 doses of MMR (containing the Urabe mumps strain), therefore all MMR vaccines were withdrawn from market of Japan in April 1993 [
