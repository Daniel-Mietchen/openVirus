<p>In Germany, children aged 14–24 months who received one dose of the MMR vaccine was conducted to explore the immunity response [

It found a protective efficacy among persons vaccinated with mumps vaccine (containing the Rubini strain) was 6%, whereas the protective efficacy among persons vaccinated with mumps vaccine (containing the Urabe strain) was of 73%, and the persons vaccinated with mumps vaccine (containing Jeryl Lynn strain) was 62% [
