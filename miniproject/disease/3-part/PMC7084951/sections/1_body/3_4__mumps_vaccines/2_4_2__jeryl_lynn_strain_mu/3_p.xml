<p>The Jeryl Lynn strain, named after a woman who developed mumps with unilateral parotitis in 1963, was the first vaccine strain to be produced in the USA by passaging the virus in embryonated hen eggs and chicken embryo fibroblast cultures [

 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The strain was licensed in the USA in 1967 and since then a live attenuated Jeryl Lynn vaccine has been used in many countries [

 <italic>n</italic> = 167) children who vaccinated with one dose of MMR vaccine (containing the Jeryl Lynn strain) at 18 months of age persisted to be seropositive at time of vaccination 12 years later, and 93% were seropositive after a second dose of mumps vaccination [

 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], a 9-year serological follow-up period was performed among 254 children. Among these children, one dose of MMR vaccine (containing the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain) was given to children at the ages of 14–18 months and six years. The seroconversion rate was 86% among the vaccinated children, and the seropositivity rate was 95% after revaccination. These results indicated that a two-dose MMR vaccination resulted in a high mumps immunity level. In the Dominican Republic [
 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], a clinical evaluation of a new measles (Schwarz strain), mumps (Jeryl Lynn strain), and rubella (Cendehill strain) combined live vaccine was conducted. In this study, there were more than 900 study children with a 94% seroconversion rate for mumps vaccines among the study children aged one to six years [
 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-17-01686" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. It was found that the occurrence of mumps increased with time elapse since vaccination in the epidemic of mumps in USA, suggesting waning of immunity is likely to play a role [
