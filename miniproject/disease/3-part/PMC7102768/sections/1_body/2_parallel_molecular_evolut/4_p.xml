<p id="par0070">Parallel evolution and adaptation may also target larger genome regions, and sites involved in post-translational modification. For example, the hemagglutinin of H7 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) can acquire a N-glycosylation site when the virus jumps from wild to domestic birds [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and highly pathogenic strains of AIV have emerged independently many times, through the evolution of different polybasic cleavage sites in hemagglutinin [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For HIV-1, it is now understood that, after zoonosis, groups M and O independently evolved the ability to antagonise human tetherin (an anti-viral restriction factor), but did so using entirely different retroviral accessory genes [
