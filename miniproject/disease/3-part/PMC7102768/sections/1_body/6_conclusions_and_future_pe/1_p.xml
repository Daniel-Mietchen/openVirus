<p id="par0110">Detecting parallel evolution in viruses, and inferring the mechanisms that underlie such changes, can benefit both basic and applied problems. If, in a rapidly evolving virus population, parallel mutations repeatedly arise in the context of the same change in phenotype or environment (i.e. 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b), then at least some aspects of virus evolution are predictable. Such repeating patterns, at the sequence or structural level, may help to forecast virus emergence and cross-species transmission events in the future. Further, placing these changes within a structural context could be used to triage newly discovered viruses, enabling surveillance and research to focus on those with the greatest predicted propensity for cross-species transmission or emergence. We note, however, that instances of parallel evolution identified by computational means must be interpreted with caution; confirmation of the fitness costs of evolutionary change ultimately depends on experimental validation, as shown for some recent outbreak scenarios [
