<p id="par0090">Steps (
 <italic>ii</italic>) and (
 <italic>iii</italic>) are less straightforward. It is tempting to detect associations between a mutation and a phenotype by calculating the mutation frequencies in viruses that do or do not exhibit the relevant phenotype. This generates a contingency table of observed counts (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ) that is evaluated using a Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. However, it has long been known in the evolutionary literature that this approach can lead to false positive conclusions, because the counts are not independent observations, but instead are correlated due to shared ancestry [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The problem can be resolved by considering the phylogenetic history of the trait in question (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, recurrent acquisition of a mutation in the context of independent changes in phenotype (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b) indicates that the mutation is evolutionarily linked to the phenotype. However, if mutation and phenotypic change occur only once in the phylogeny (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a) then their association could be due to chance. Bhattacharya 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] referred to the latter situation as the ‘founder effect’ and used a phylogenetically corrected statistical test to demonstrate that previously reported HLA-associated escape mutations in HIV [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] were not statistically robust. Another phenomenon that may cause mutations to appear artefactually linked to a specific phenotype or environment is genetic hitchhiking, whereby an observed mutation does not affect the associated phenotype, but is genetically linked to a mutation that does. Further, the phylogenetic association between a mutation and a phenotype may be weak if the phenotype is polygenic in nature, or depends on an interaction between the viral genotype and the environment.
