We developed and used a portable IAV sequencing and analysis platform called <italic>Mia</italic> (Mobile Influenza Analysis) to complete and characterize full-length consensus genomes approximately 18&#x02009;h after unpacking the mobile lab. Exhibition swine are a known source for zoonotic transmission of IAV to humans and pose a potential pandemic risk. Genomic analyses of IAV in swine are critical to understanding this risk, the types of viruses circulating in swine, and whether current vaccines developed for use in humans would be predicted to provide immune protection. Nanopore sequencing technology has enabled genome sequencing in the field at the source of viral outbreaks or at the bedside or pen-side of infected humans and animals. The acquired data, however, have not yet demonstrated real-time, actionable public health responses. The <italic>Mia</italic> system rapidly identified three genetically distinct swine IAV lineages from three subtypes, A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and A(H1N2). Analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of the A(H1N2) viruses identified &#x0003e;30 amino acid differences between the HA1 of these viruses and the most closely related CVV. As an exercise in pandemic preparedness, all sequences were emailed to CDC collaborators who initiated the development of a synthetically derived CVV.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Swine are influenza virus reservoirs that have caused outbreaks and pandemics.

These studies relied on the transfer of raw read data to centralized institutions harboring high-performance computational resources to perform extensive phylogenetic analyses. These analyses resulted in a deep understanding of the viral evolution during the outbreak, as well as an estimation of transmission chains. Their reliance on vast databases and computationally intensive algorithms limited their ability to influence real-time prevention strategies and potentially stop further transmission events. Furthermore, the lack of vaccines to these viruses meant that the real-time-derived sequence data could not be leveraged to identify a suitable vaccine. On the other hand, influenza viruses have multiple enzootic reservoirs, cause annual epidemics in humans, and rapidly evolve, which necessitates constant genomic surveillance and iterative vaccine development. Given this need, we have an opportunity to mitigate the risk of an influenza outbreak at its source in real time by analyzing the viral genomes present and, subsequently, developing the best-matched candidate vaccine virus (CVV).</p><p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulating in swine have the potential to infect humans and are capable of causing pandemics (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), as evidenced by the 2009 H1N1 virus pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Since that pandemic, there have been 465 human cases of swine-origin influenza viruses (termed variant influenza viruses) in the United States resulting from exposure to swine, most commonly during attendance at agricultural fairs, and sporadic cases have been reported periodically in other countries (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Exhibitors travel with their swine across geographical regions in the United States to attend national, state, and local exhibitions. At these exhibitions, swine of various ages and from many geographical regions intermingle. Throughout the exhibition, swine are walked around the barns, shuttled into staging pens, and exhibited in a corral simultaneously with a dozen or more swine. The swine are typically shepherded by children, as many exhibition rules require that individuals presenting a swine within the exhibition ring be under the age of 20. The exhibition itself can last up to a week, during which time swine are living in immediate proximity to others and have direct contact with humans. Children in particular may be immunologically naive to swine influenza viruses that are genetically and antigenically distinct from recent seasonal influenza viruses or vaccines to which they have been exposed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/variant-cases-us.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/variant-cases-us.htm</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Genetic relationship of human and swine virus lineages. Green, orange, purple, and blue arrows follow the evolution of hemagglutinin, while black errors follow other segments. Human seasonal lineages are green, classical swine-H1N1pdm09 is orange, the classical swine lineage is purple, and the Eurasian swine lineage is blue. In 2009, influenza A/H1N1Pdm09 virus displaced the previous human seasonal A/H1N1 virus from humans which continues circulating in swine. This virus reassorted, picking up the N2 segment from the triple-reassortant viruses into the A/H1N2 Other-Human (OH)-1B.2 lineage that caused human infections in the summer of 2018. The history of this HA can be traced back to the avian virus that caused the 1918 pandemic, through extinction and reemergence, and through decades of human seasonal activity.

To date, 11 CVVs representing antigenically diverse groups of swine influenza viruses have been proposed or already developed for prepandemic preparedness purposes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/en/">https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/en/</ext-link>).</p><p>Collecting samples in the field, shipping them to centralized laboratories, sequencing their genomes, and analyzing them often takes several weeks or months. Thus, the current surveillance process is less able to contribute real-time data during the emergence of pandemic threats (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The increased risk at this unique interface warrants concerted proactive surveillance and simultaneously serves as a proving ground for new real-time in-field genomic approaches to help prevent zoonotic infections and potential outbreaks. Here, we describe the development and deployment of a rapid and portable IAV sequencing pipeline we call <italic>Mia</italic> (Mobile Influenza Analysis [mi&#x00259;, MEE-uh]) and the genomic results obtained from this surveillance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Development of the <italic>Mia</italic> platform.</title><p>We created a mobile influenza virus genomics platform to estimate the risk to humans posed by viruses within a local IAV outbreak by performing in-field extraction and amplification of influenza A viruses, complete genome sequencing, automated genome assembly, BLAST comparisons, phylogenetic analysis, and variant detection to candidate vaccine viruses. We used our high-throughput influenza virus sequencing pipeline as a template for developing <italic>Mia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Our goal was a rapid workflow in a compact platform that is easily transported by two people on a commercial airliner. For RNA extraction, we elected to use Akonni Biosystems&#x02019; TruTip rapid RNA kit due to its small footprint and demonstrated effectiveness on influenza A viruses (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). We chose the mini8 by miniPCR due to its small size, ability to run 8 samples at a time, low cost, low power needs, and overall simplicity. Due to the high fidelity of our rapid amplification strategy, we were able to simplify amplicon quality control from fragment analyzation to fluorometric quantification, which is already a necessary step for amplicon pooling. For sequencing, we chose the Nanopore sequencing platform MinION for its extremely small size, rapid sequencing speed, and live access to data as it is sequencing. Direct RNA sequencing of IAVs has recently been demonstrated, and while this technique is extremely fast (&#x0003c;2&#x02009;h from RNA to sequencing), it is not yet suitable for clinical applications due to a lack of sensitivity and multiplexing (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

The swine began arriving on Sunday (day 0) and received an initial veterinary screening upon entry. We began scouting swine on day 3 for influenza-like illness (ILI) and noted the locations in the exhibition barn of animals with clinical signs of respiratory disease. During the day, the barns were very crowded with swine, presenters and their families, farm hands, visitors, and event staff. To avoid interfering with the event&#x02019;s proceedings, swabbing and sequencing were conducted during the event&#x02019;s off-hours. On day 4, we swabbed ILI-identified swine and their pen neighbors (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;94) for influenza A virus (IAV) with the Flu Detect swine kits. We detected seven IAV-positive samples but suspected that additional samples collected from pen neighbors might be positive by sequence analysis. At 11 p.m. on day 4, we erected the <italic>Mia</italic> platform inside the exhibition barn and began the workflow on 24 samples collected from the rapid-test-positive swine and their immediate neighbors. Overnight, we extracted RNA, amplified the full genome, barcoded amplicons, and quantified the barcoded amplicons. Sample concentrations ranged from 12.7 to 41.9&#x02009;ng/&#x003bc;l (Table S2 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/s/b4cc885050283a40dfcd">https://figshare.com/s/b4cc885050283a40dfcd</ext-link>]). We normalized and pooled the barcoded samples to 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g total. The final library amounted to 279&#x02009;ng. The library was ready for sequencing at 6 a.m., and at this time, people were arriving at the barn to begin exhibition activities. To avoid disrupting the event, once the sequencing was initiated, we transported the sequencer attached to the laptop powered by the laptop&#x02019;s battery to a hotel room.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Base calling and genome assembly.</title><p>Sequencing produced 99,988 reads that were base called and demultiplexed with Albacore v2.2.7.

We created <italic>Mia</italic> by selecting and optimizing laboratory equipment that fits into a cooler and two standard-sized suitcases (Fig. S43 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/s/b4cc885050283a40dfcd">https://figshare.com/s/b4cc885050283a40dfcd</ext-link>]), which can be set up and operated in the field by two people (Fig. S44 at the URL mentioned above) to produce a high-quality multiplexed NGS amplicon library in 7&#x02009;h. Our automated analysis pipeline performs base calling, quality control, genome assembly, phylogenetic analysis, BLAST searches, and amino acid comparisons to current CVVs without an Internet connection. We are able to monitor all of these results in real time on the laptop performing the analyses. <italic>Mia</italic> will be continuously improved and adapted for use in harsher field environments (see Text S1 at the URL mentioned above).</p><p>In the field, the data generated indicated that while multiple lineages were cocirculating, the numerically dominant subtype, H1N2, was genetically different from the most similar WHO prepandemic CVV, including variation in known antigenic sites. Moreover, we determined that these viruses posed a risk of causing disease in a young population, as similar H1 viruses disappeared from seasonal circulation in humans in 2010 and were replaced by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Therefore, the sequence data were used to initiate the synthesis of an optimal CVV approximately 18&#x02009;h after unpacking <italic>Mia</italic>. This proactive strategy of identifying the predominant swine influenza viruses in exhibition pigs prior to the start of annual agricultural fairs in the United States proved to be very useful, as zoonotic infections caused by the predominant A(H1N2) virus found in exhibition pigs were detected in humans exposed at fairs in July and August 2018 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html">https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html</ext-link>). Had this virus caused a severe outbreak or pandemic, our proactive surveillance efforts and vaccine derivation would have provided an approximate 8-week time advantage for vaccine manufacturing.</p><p>By returning samples from the field, we were able to confirm the sequencing results with our Illumina sequencing pipeline (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Without considering a coverage threshold for the Nanopore data, we sequenced 13 full genomes in the field. These same 13 samples were also successfully sequenced in the lab on an Illumina MiSeq platform. By comparing MiSeq- and MinION-produced sequences, we saw that the maximum MinION-derived sequence accuracy is achieved at 10&#x000d7; to 20&#x000d7; mean coverage (Fig. S32 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/s/b4cc885050283a40dfcd">https://figshare.com/s/b4cc885050283a40dfcd</ext-link>]). If we apply a 20&#x000d7; coverage threshold to the Nanopore data, only 4 genomes were successful in the field but with 8 HA segment sequences passing. Importantly, the HA sequence is the most critical for making vaccine strain determinations. Also, we have higher confidence in consensus sequences from low-coverage viruses that are near identical to other viruses with higher coverage. As we are likely sampling the same transmission chain in real time, we can use the global sequence alignment to manually estimate the true sequence, particularly in fixing the frameshift mutations that are MinION&#x02019;s most common error. In future experiments, we can ensure that coverage thresholds are met by monitoring coverage in real time and more deliberately deciding when to stop sequencing, rather than simply sequencing for a defined 6&#x02009;h as we did here. Illumina sequencing also allowed us to confirm the accuracy of our in-field-generated consensus sequences (99.3% overall). This level of accuracy confirms the validity of the suite of analyses that we performed in the field with the Nanopore data.</p><p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are a perpetual threat to global health security, both as human-endemic seasonal viruses and the more insidious pandemic viruses. IAV pandemics result from zoonotic transmission of IAVs to humans followed by onward human-to-human spread in populations lacking sufficient immunity. The swine-human and avian-human interfaces are of keen interest for future in-field surveillance efforts due to the pandemic risk of avian and swine influenza viruses that circulate in these settings (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). <italic>Mia</italic> will be a useful tool to enhance the current centralized surveillance framework and can be deployed into resource-poor settings and operated by two technicians. This technology can serve to bolster IAV surveillance by monitoring important transmission interfaces for emerging viruses that have pandemic potential. Moreover, it might not always be possible to return samples from the field. In such cases, portable Nanopore sequencing and data transmission can take advantage of a distributed sequencing network while maintaining the advantages of a centralized database. This has the potential to greatly expand the reach of the current global influenza virus surveillance network.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Logistics.</title><p>Our inventory was finalized after three full practice runs and consisted of three main pieces of luggage to transport <italic>Mia</italic> (Table S1 and Fig. S43 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/s/b4cc885050283a40dfcd">https://figshare.com/s/b4cc885050283a40dfcd</ext-link>]).

We amplified the full genome by cycling the mixture as follows: 98&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s; 5 cycles of 98&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;s, 45&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02009;s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1.5&#x02009;min; 30 cycles of 98&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;s, 64&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02009;s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1.5&#x02009;min; and a final extension of 72&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min. We cleaned the amplicons with 0.5&#x000d7; AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter) and washed them with 80% ethanol before resuspending them in 25 &#x003bc;l nuclease-free water.</p><p>We used three miniPCR mini8 thermocyclers (Cambridge, MA, USA) under laptop control for elution buffer heating, fMRT-PCR, barcoding, and library preparation. Following barcoding, we quantified the products using a Qubit DNA broad-range/high-sensitivity (BR/HS) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantification data allowed us to normalize and pool the barcodes and served as our only quality control check during the molecular workflow. Once pooled, we prepared the amplicons for Nanopore sequencing using the SQK-LSK 108 library kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). This protocol required cooling to 20&#x000b0;C; however, the temperature in the barn was roughly 30&#x000b0;C, and the fan-cooled mini8 thermocyclers could not get below ambient temperature. To solve this issue, we placed the thermocycler on a bed of ice, which effectively lowered the ambient temperature and allowed the mini8 to cool to 20&#x000b0;C. We sequenced the pooled samples on a MinION Mk 1B Nanopore sequencer using the flow cell FAH58363 equipped with R9.5.1 chemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s4.5"><title>Real-time analyses.</title><p>For real-time analyses, we used a high-performance Dell Precision 7720 laptop (Round Rock, TX, USA) with 64 Gb of ram, four-core Intel Xeon 3.00&#x02009;GHz central processing unit (CPU) E3-1505M v6 (2 threads/core), and two 1-Tb solid state hard drives, partitioned separately into a Windows 10 OS and Ubuntu 16.04 OS. <italic>Mia</italic>&#x02019;s custom analytical application runs on the Ubuntu partition and initiates automatically via crontab upon MinION read file (fast5) origination during active sequencing. We base called and demultiplexed fast5 read files with Albacore v2.2.7 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and assembled subsequent fastq files into consensus sequences with IRMA v0.6.7 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We used a custom MinION configuration module for IRMA that changes the default &#x0201c;FLU&#x0201d; module parameters as follows: dropping the median read Q score filter from 30 to 7, raising the minimum read length from 125 to 150 bases, raising the frequency threshold for insertion and deletion refinement from 0.25 to 0.75 and 0.6 to 0.75, respectively, and lowering the Smith-Waterman mismatch penalty from 5 to 3 and the gap open penalty from 10 to 6. We checked consensus sequences against a local database containing clade-annotated IAV sequences using BLASTn v2.7.1+ (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and used top BLAST matches to interpret a sample&#x02019;s IAV genome constellation. We aligned consensus sequences against reference sequences with MUSCLE v3.8.31 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We built phylogenetic trees with FastTree double precision version 2.1.8 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) with a generalized time-reversible model, branch lengths optimized under a gamma distribution, and local support values produced from bootstrap sampling 10,000 times and visualized the trees in R v3.4.4 with GGtree (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We determined amino acid differences to each candidate vaccine virus sequence in our database with a custom Python script that translates DNA consensus sequences and MUSCLE aligns the mature HA1 protein sequences. Analytical and processing status results were fed into a SQLite v3.11.0 database (Hwaci, Inc., Charlotte, NC) and visualized in a Web browser with an interactive R Shiny (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) application.</p><p><italic>Mia</italic>-processed reads in 4,000-read batches for the first 5 iterations, followed by 20,000-read batches for another 5 iterations and then 40,000-read batches until reads are no longer produced by the sequencer. This stepwise batching provides the user an understanding of the run&#x02019;s quality within minutes of sequencing, allowing the user to decide if it is worth continuing the run while maximizing computational resources. Results seen within the first hour of a sequencing track across a 6- or even 48-h run, with the extended run time increasing coverage and resolving a scant number of consensus bases.</p></sec><sec id="s4.6"><title>Postfield analyses.</title><p>We transported field-derived RNA and amplicons on dry ice back to the CDC in Atlanta, GA, and processed them with the Influenza Genomics Team&#x02019;s standard Illumina MiSeq influenza surveillance pipeline (San Diego, CA, USA). We processed and assembled reads with IRMA&#x02019;s Flu-sensitive module (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and calculated the identity of MinION-derived consensus sequences based on alignment to the sample&#x02019;s MiSeq-derived consensus, which is considered the gold standard. Out of 425 swine sampled through our standard surveillance efforts at the exhibition, 136 swine tested positive for IAV by RT-PCR. Complete genome sequencing via our standard Illumina pipeline was attempted on 79 of those and produced 65 full genomes.</p><p>We performed phylogenetic analyses with the MiSeq-produced sequences and an annotated set of swine IAV sequences. The annotated data set was constructed by downloading all publicly available swine IAV data collected in North America from the Influenza Research Database (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) on 1 June 2018. Each gene was aligned with MAFFT v7.294b (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and the best-known maximum likelihood phylogeny for each alignment was inferred using IQ-TREE v1.6.2 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), with the model of molecular evolution automatically selected during the tree search. Each gene was classified to an evolutionary lineage and/or phylogenetic clade (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
