<p id="p0235">The nature of the virus allows us to propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. By losing their membrane and cellular structure within the host cell, the viruses are living beings that sequester the host and make available to them precursors for the synthesis of their specific molecules and to the hostâ€™s genetic information processing machines. In the translation, this created unique parasitic and evolutionary opportunities. This fusion model proposes that viruses originated from parasitic cellular organisms that fused with their host cell. Among modern viruses the life cycle of poxviruses and other complex viruses provides convincing evidence for the fusion model. Some of these viruses have indisputable cellular remnants that are better explained by an evolutionary origin of cell ancestors (
