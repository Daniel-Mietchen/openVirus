<p id="p0265">Theoretical and experimental studies of the CRISPR–Cas bacterial immune system, where the behavior of well mixed compensation mechanisms and losses are counteracted, suggest that there is a regular loss of immunity on the part of the host bacteria, which can thus produce phage–host. Although both mechanisms can have a stable coexistence, only the immune loss does so robustly within realistic parameter ranges (
