<p id="p0305">The majority of arboviruses are RNA viruses that lack polymerases with correction activity and, therefore, exhibit error frequencies of ≈10–4 (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Steinhauer et al., 1992</xref>). Its high mutation frequencies, rapid replication and large population sizes allow these viruses to adapt rapidly to fluctuating environments. However, comparisons of RNA arbovirus sequences reveal that they are relatively stable in nature, and genetic studies suggest that strong purifying selection dominates their evolution (

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Jerzak et al., 2005</xref>). This stability may result from the requirement of replication in two different hosts, which presents contradictory demands for replication and adaptation and which may restrict adaptation to any of the hosts only by imposing a cost of physical conditioning where the adaptations are antagonistic (
