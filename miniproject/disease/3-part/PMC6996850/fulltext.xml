in the developing countries. The basis for high mortality among pregnant hepatitis E patients remains unclear. Importantly, a large proportion of infected pregnant women present with subclinical infection as well. In order to understand the possible mechanisms influencing clinical presentation of hepatitis E in pregnant women, we explored a system biology approach. For this, PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR, acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters, acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes.</p><p>In contrast to exclusive up-regulation of nonspecific, early immune response transcripts in the NPR patients, the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection. Induction of IFN&#x003b3; gene was not detected during the acute phase irrespective of pregnancy. Association of response to vitamin D, transcripts related to NK/NKT and regulatory T cells during subclinical infection are noteworthy.</p><p>The data obtained here could be correlated with several studies reported earlier in hepatitis E patients suggesting utility of PBMCs as an alternate specimen. The extensive, informative data provided here for the first time should form basis for future studies that will help in understanding pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis E.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>VAA Financial support for this study was provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Ministry of health and family welfare, Government of India. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.icmr.nic.in/">https://www.icmr.nic.in/</ext-link> The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="32"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data generated in this study has been deposited in NCBI-Short Read Archive (SRA) under the accession number SRP100353 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?cmd=search_obj&#x00026;m=&#x00026;s=&#x00026;term=%22SRP100353%22&#x00026;go=Search">https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?cmd=search_obj&#x00026;m=&#x00026;s=&#x00026;term=%22SRP100353%22&#x00026;go=Search</ext-link>).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data generated in this study has been deposited in NCBI-Short Read Archive (SRA) under the accession number SRP100353 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?cmd=search_obj&#x00026;m=&#x00026;s=&#x00026;term=%22SRP100353%22&#x00026;go=Search">https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?cmd=search_obj&#x00026;m=&#x00026;s=&#x00026;term=%22SRP100353%22&#x00026;go=Search</ext-link>).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes waterborne epidemics and is the major contributor of sporadic acute viral hepatitis in adults from developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. India is hyperendemic to Hepatitis E and sporadic as well as epidemic HEV infections are exclusively caused by genotype 1 HEV [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The disease is usually self-limiting with &#x02264; 0.5% mortality. However, an exceptionally high mortality (~20%) is recorded in pregnant women, especially in the later trimesters [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In India, fulminant hepatitis E in nonpregnant women and men has been recorded [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A recent report documented severity of hepatitis E in pregnant women from developed countries [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. So far, chronic hepatitis E is restricted to immuno-compromised patients from the industrialized nations [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Early symptoms and clinical features among pregnant patients are similar to nonpregnant patients, however, there is a high risk of rapid progression to poor maternal, obstetric and foetal outcome. These include deranged coagulogram, encephalopathy, death, intra-uterine death and premature deliveries [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Understanding mechanism(s) of disease severity and mortality in pregnant women is of utmost importance and relevance for the endemic countries. However, pathogenesis of hepatitis E in general and during pregnancy in particular is not well understood. This is primarily because of the lack of small laboratory animal model and inability of nonhuman primate models to replicate fulminant disease during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recent reports of pregnant rabbit and BALB/c models may prove useful in understanding the basis for observed complications of HEV infection [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Association of viral load with disease severity is controversial [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and host response seems to be primarily responsible for differential outcomes of HEV infection. TLRs have been evaluated in hepatitis E patients with pregnancy. Contrary to the temporal activation of TLR4/TLR7/TLR8 at protein and mRNA levels in the NPR patients, the ANC-patients and controls exhibited reduced TLRs indicative of impaired TLR response [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Importantly, a significant reduction was recorded in the fulminant category [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The expression of TLR3 was associated with recovery while the patients with lower expression progressed to acute liver failure. A significant downregulation of TLR3 and TLR9 and downstream MYD88 signaling molecules IRF3 and IRF7 was shown in pregnant women with FHF-E than with acute hepatitis E [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>As against the classical activation of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes in the non-ANC patients, impaired response was recorded in the ANC-patients while the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations were similar in both patient groups [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Though cytokine levels have been measured either in serum or HEV protein stimulated PBMCs from pregnant women, no conclusions can be made about the causal role of these molecules [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Upregulation of PBMC miR-450b correlated with poor outcome of HEV during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Our observations of hepatitis E in pregnancy are twofold. First, confirmation of high mortality during later pregnancy and extending the etiology of fulminant hepatitis to non-pregnant women and men [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; Second, the observation of large proportion of pregnant women infected with HEV develop subclinical infection, the ratio of clinical: subclinical ratio in the later trimesters being 1:13 [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].Thus, HEV infection in pregnant women also leads to very mild symptoms and we believe that the understanding of basis for such milder infections is as important as the fulminant disease form with high mortality.</p><p>In view of the time dependent immunologic changes during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the differential effect of HEV infection, we thought that a system biology approach may help us in getting insight in the alterations caused by the virus, pregnancy and pregnancy with virus infection. RNA-seq is a powerful tool that provides unbiased, simultaneous profiles of gene expression and is particularly suitable to get an overview of differential, complex interactions of a very large number of genes. Such a global analysis is likely to identify mechanisms that need to be addressed further in terms of functional analyses.</p><p>Though liver is an ideal organ for studies of hepatotropic viruses, this organ cannot be accessed in population groups needed for such comparisons. We therefore opted for PBMCs as the test specimen with easy accessibility and for the first time present whole transcriptome analysis in non-pregnant patients and pregnant women with clinical or subclinical presentation.</p><sec id="sec002" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was <bold>approved by the &#x0201c;Institutional Human Ethics Committee&#x0201d;,</bold> of the National Institute of Virology (NIV), India.

When compared to control PR women in 2<sup>nd</sup>/3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters, 6 IgG genes in the PR-2-SC and 5 Ig genes in the PR-3-SC categories were upregulated. Thus, the number of Ig genes expressed was proportional to the disease severity.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>TNF</title><p>TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and TNF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> have antiviral activity and synergize with interferons in the induction of resistance to both RNA and DNA virus infections [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The production of TNFs is induced by viruses; virus-infected cells are selectively killed by TNFs and this activity is accelerated by IFN-&#x003b3;. The present study revealed that induction of TNF gene was associated with subclinical HEV infection in both the trimesters (4.8 fold and 4.2 fold respectively). During the second trimester, 1.7fold increase was seen in healthy controls and acute disease whereas no change was recorded during the 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study for the first time provides comparative transcriptome analysis of PBMCs obtained from hepatitis E patients and addresses impact of pregnancy. Next generation sequencing technology has proved to be a powerful tool providing comparative mRNA transcript levels of a very large number of genes from a clinical sample in a quantity that can be easily collected from a patient. However, as post-transcriptional modifications are important in determining functional outcome, such studies are generally used as useful pointers to identify target genes / pathways that must be validated by appropriate experiments. The data presented here highlights significant differences among clinical and subclinical infections in pregnant women that need to be extended to fulminant disease and confirmed by well-defined immunologic assays.</p><p>We first defined characteristic transcriptome profiles among the non-pregnant patients during early-acute and convalescent disease phases. The acute phase was characterized by early, non-specific immune response whereas during convalescence, cytokine/chemokine, inflammatory, innate and T /B cell adaptive immune response was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The results revealed that at transcriptional level, a moderate immune response was generated in the NPR patients. Based on the microarray analysis of sequential liver tissues, Yu et al [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] concluded generation of attenuated immune response in chimpanzees infected with HEV when compared to HCV-infected chimpanzees. The similarity of observations in the liver (chimp study) and PBMCs (human, present study) is noteworthy and adds special significance to the PBMC-based data.</p><p>Second, we sought to identify features of the whole-blood transcriptome that were unique to the disease in pregnancy. For this, later trimesters (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>) known to be associated with high mortality were considered separately and compared with non-pregnant and healthy pregnant controls in the corresponding trimesters. The results clearly showed that the responses during 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters were distinct and these categories should not be pooled together for fine immunologic analyses. In contrast to exclusive expression of nonspecific immune response genes in the NPR patients, the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. In fact, the acute-phase PR patients induced transcription of several additional adaptive-immunity-associated pathways than even the convalescing NPR patients.</p><p>Pathogen recognition is an important step in the activation of inflammatory pathways. Of the three types of pattern recognition receptors, our data shows possible involvement of TLRs and NLRs in HEV infection. Of note, we earlier reported temporal activation of TLR4/7/8 (protein and gene levels) and TLR3 (gene) in the NPR patients that was reduced in the PR patients. This reduction actually reflected pregnancy status and not HEV infection [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The overexpression of toll-like receptor signaling pathway, TLR-4 signaling pathway and pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway suggests role of TLR4 in the PR patients. Additionally, patients in the third trimester enriched MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In the light of these findings, we would like to point out that expression of TLR2 / TLR3 /TLR4 genes was increased in acute hepatitis E patients while a significant reduction was evident in the fulminant category [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another important study by Sehgal et al [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] documented that the expression of TLR3 and TLR9 and downstream MYD88 signaling molecules IRF3 and IRF7 were significantly down regulated in pregnant women with FHF-E than with acute hepatitis E.</p><p>Taken together, TLR3/4/9 seem to play crucial role in modulating disease severity during pregnancy and deserve further in-depth studies in relation to prognosis as well as therapy.</p><p>Importantly, for the first time, possible involvement of NOD1 signaling pathway in acute disease during the third trimester is shown. Association of NOD1 with subclinical HEV infection during 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester was pregnancy driven. Though NOD1 and NOD2 members of the NLR family are activated by specific bacterial peptides [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], similar to dengue [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and RSV [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we report HEV-induced NLR activation. In the light of increased expression of NOD1 in hepatitis C patients [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the involvement of NOD1 through interaction with dsRNA in hepatocytes infected in-vitro or in-vivo with HCV [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], current observations with PBMCs need to be extended to hepatocytes.</p><p>Our next aim was to examine if we can identify transcripts specific to subclinical HEV infection in pregnant women that otherwise constitute high-risk category for severe liver disease. We could identify several GO terms specific to subclinical infection when compared to NPR controls. However, several of these were related to pregnancy as evidenced by comparisons with pregnant controls. The relationship of immunoglobulin genes with disease presentation is noteworthy. The subclinical infection correlated with upregulation of lesser number of Ig genes (6 in the PR-2-SC and 5 in the PR-3-SC) than the corresponding acute disease (26 and 48 genes respectively). Further, humoral responses associated GO terms were enriched during subclinical infection during 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester while no difference was seen among PR-3-SC and PR-3-acute patients. In fulminant hepatitis E, the number of antigen-specific, IgG-producing B cells increased following polyclonal stimulation of PBMCs than in the patients with uncomplicated clinical disease [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].We, on the other hand, reported (i) higher anti-HEV titres in the fulminant hepatitis patients than the self-recovering non-pregnant patients [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and (ii) lower IgG-anti-HEV titres in the pregnant women with subclinical HEV infection than those with clinical disease [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Taken together, antibodies seem to play an important role in disease severity. Role of antibodies in disease severity has been reported for several viral infections such as influenza [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], SARS [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], dengue [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and measles [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Of note, RNA-seq data with respect to defensins, S100 and Ig genes was further confirmed by the gene-specific real time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g012">Fig 12B&#x02013;12D</xref>) strengthening the association of modulation of these genes with hepatitis E and clinical presentation. A single pregnant woman in the third trimester with fulminant hepatitis E showed downregulation of defensin and S100 genes. At recovery defensin expression increased while that of S100 remained low. This observation of lowered innate immune response needs to be confirmed with a large series.</p><p>We now would like to address two small antimicrobial peptides of innate immune system that seem to have a role in protection/pathogenesis of hepatitis E. The observed upregulation of some of the S100 series molecules transcripts during acute disease with either downregulated or normal levels during subclinical infections suggests possible association with the outcome of HEV infection. High levels of S100A4 protein in human carcinoma cells are strongly associated with their metastatic capability [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] S100A4 was demonstrated to be a strong indicator of a poor prognosis of human breast cancers [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Overexpression of alpha defensins in hepatitis E patients (irrespective of pregnancy and clinical presentation) suggests definite role in protection. These small, cationic peptides have broad anti-microbial activity and the ability of human &#x003b1;-defensins to neutralize viruses has been described. Neutralization of the enveloped viruses depends on the disruption of viral lipid envelope, steric interference with receptor binding, interaction with cellular factors, or post-entry blocks [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In a mouse model deficient in activated &#x003b1;-defensins in the small intestine, Paneth cell &#x003b1;-defensins could protect mice from oral infection by a pathogenic mouse adenovirus 1 virus [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Antiviral activity through potentiation of neutralizing antibody response adds to the possible mechanisms of alpha defensins-dependent immunity. The role of both alpha defensins and S100 series molecules need to be confirmed by functional assays and extended to fulminant hepatitis E. Response to vitamin D was uniquely associated with subclinical infection during 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester. Activated vitamin D is known to act as an immune system modulator preventing excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines, increasing &#x0201c;oxidative burst&#x0201d; potential of macrophages and stimulation of the expression of potent anti-microbial peptides including defensins present in neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells and certain epithelial cells.</p><p>In an interesting study by Huang et al [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], microarray analysis of PBMCs from asymptomatic and symptomatic Influenza infections following experimental infection of the virus to human volunteers showed that activation of all known classes of PRRs led to symptomatic infection while the absence or downregulation was characteristic of asymptomatic infection. Though the differentiation of immune response during symptomatic and asymptomatic HEV infection in the present study is complicated by the pregnancy status and duration of pregnancy, a similar trend is seen when compared to non-pregnant controls. Acute disease was characterized by the activation of TLRs and additionally NOD1 signaling pathway in the 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester. On the contrary, NOD-like receptor signaling was associated with subclinical infection in the 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester.</p><p>The transcriptome analysis did not identify increased expression of mRNA levels of the cell-specific markers of immune cell types such as dendritic cells, natural killer cells and macrophages in any of the groups studied. However, the involvement of NK and NKT (NK cells carrying T cell receptor) was suggested by the increased expression of GZMM and CD1d genes respectively in the NPR patients. CD1d alone was detected in self-recovering PR patients during the acute phase and was part of pregnancy-associated immunomodulation. Previously our lab recorded higher proportion of activated CD16+ Cd56+/CD3+ cells in the NPR patients [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In view of this, it is interesting to note that in a transgenic HBV transfer mouse model, induction of acute hepatitis was mediated by CD1D-restricted NKT cells [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Myocarditis in BALB/c was shown to be mediated by CD1D-restricted immune response. For RSV, LCMV, CMV and HSV1, a beneficial effect was seen. The role of NK cells in determining fulminant outcome of HEV infection needs to be evaluated. Similarly, our data pointing possible involvement of T regulatory cells in subclinical infection during 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester should be confirmed and extended to severe disease.</p><p>The absence of induction of IFN&#x003b3; gene during acute phase irrespective of pregnancy and 2.99fold increase during convalescence among NPR patients is noteworthy and in accordance with our earlier observations of (i) a significant reduction in the circulating IFN&#x003b3; levels in the NPR patients that were further reduced in the PR patients [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. (ii) no significant release of IFN&#x003b3;in the culture supernatants of rORF2-stimulated PBMCs(acute phase) coupled with (iii) a significant increase in IFN&#x003b3; release when the samples were collected during convalescence [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the FHF patients, IFN&#x003b3; levels increased significantly, a further rise marked recovery. Patients with unaltered IFN&#x003b3; levels succumbed to the infection [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results suggest protective role of this Th1 cytokine. Majumdar et al [<xref rid="pone.0228068.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] confirmed these findings. The concordance in the expression at gene and protein levels emphasizes definite role of IFN&#x003b3; in recovery even from fulminant disease. Further studies are needed to explore the role / utility of this gene/molecule in modulation /treatment of severe disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec033"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data documented heightened innate immune response in terms of highly upregulated expression of transcripts associated with non-specific primary response and robust inflammatory response in the pregnant women with self-recovering hepatitis E. The study revealed that immune responses during the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters were distinctly different and recorded definite differences between clinical and subclinical infections during these trimesters. Disease presentation was associated with differential expression of S100 series, inversely proportion to overexpression of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in the pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggested a role in protection. Based on the confirmation of the gene expression profiles obtained in this study by several functional studies reported earlier in acute as well as fulminant hepatitis patients with or without pregnancy, it may be summarized that clinical presentation in hepatitis E represent distinct transcriptional profiles with respect to immune response. The extensive, informative data provided for the first time should form basis for future studies that will help in understanding pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis E during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec034"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0228068.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in PBMCs of healthy pregnant controls and HEV infected patients.</title><p>Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes with altered expression in healthy pregnant trimester 2 (C), 3 (D) control groups, sub-clinical (J and K), acute HEV infected pregnant trimester 2 (G) and 3 (H) and non-pregnant acute (E) patients as compared to healthy non-pregnant control group (A).A heat map illustrates two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of selected 384 immune-related genes identified as differentially regulated in early acute non-pregnant patients, pregnant women during trimester 2 and 3 with subclinical and clinical infection and healthy pregnant women in trimester 2 and 3 versus healthy non-pregnant controls.
