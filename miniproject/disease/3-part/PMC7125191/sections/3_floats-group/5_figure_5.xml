  <p>Continuous mutation model. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Percentage of sweeps in its dependence on 
   <italic>σ</italic> (for indicated 
   <italic>p</italic> values), continuous case. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The same plot for the mutation probability. Dashed lines are linear fits. (
   <bold>c</bold>) A finite-size effect is visible at large 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.07 comparing a lattice of 300 by 300 points (black) compared to 200 by 200 points (green) and 100 by 100 points (brown) (for 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0, 0.015 and 0.07, from bottom to top).
