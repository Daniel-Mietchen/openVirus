<p id="Par13">We initially start with a network of susceptible nodes and a single randomly chosen infected site. After a certain time, the system reaches a stable equilibrium where no infected nodes remain. The fraction of recovered nodes depends on the infection and recovery probabilities 
 <italic>λ</italic> and 
 <italic>μ</italic> as well as on the topology of the network. For simplicity, we set the recovery probability to 
 <italic>μ</italic> = 1 so that an infected node is recovered or removed after one time step.
