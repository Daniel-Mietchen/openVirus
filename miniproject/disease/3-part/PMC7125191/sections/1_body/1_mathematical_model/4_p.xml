 </sup> and were generally found to support generation of mutants even if they are less fit. This may also lead to faster adaptation in multi-peaked fitness landscapes since the mutants explore the fitness space quicker. We here propose a model where the spatial structure is more complex by allowing local spatial contacts and, additionally, far-reaching contacts.
