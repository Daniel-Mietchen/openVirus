<p id="Par17">Here we assume that the individuals at each node are collectively at the same genetic state. This may appear unrealistic at first; however, it depends indeed on the respective time scales of mutations, fixations and transmissions to determine how close a population is to this scenario. Given the phylogenetic data for instance for the case of Ebola epidemic in 2013-2016, it appears that the genetic variability of the entire virus population of the outbreak is much larger than the variability at each infection site or country

 </sup>. Following this line of thought we consider the limit in which establishment of a strain at each node occurs quickly, so that the local population is collectively characterized by a single virus strain. We will study two scenarios, one for pathogens requiring a small number of mutational steps for adaptation and one for pathogens requiring a large number of steps, where a continuous approximation may be valid:
