<p id="Par35">For larger noise, the scaling depends on the fraction of long bonds. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> presents the logarithm of the sweep fraction plotted versus the inverse of 
 <italic>σ</italic>. There appears an exponential relation for a range of approximately 4 &lt; 1∕
 <italic>σ</italic> &lt; 7 with the slopes depending on 
 <italic>p</italic>. For larger rewiring probabilities 
 <italic>p</italic> there emerges a slight kink for higher values of 1∕
 <italic>σ</italic>. This effect is due to the finite grid size. Simulations with lattices of different sizes show that the large-noise regime extends to higher 1∕
 <italic>σ</italic> for larger lattices (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Results for lattice sizes 200 × 200 and 300 × 300 agree for 1∕
 <italic>σ</italic> values up to 7, which also appear to limit the range of linear fitting.
