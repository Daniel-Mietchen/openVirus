<p id="Par7">We specifically study the situation where the agentâ€™s infection probability is initially subcritical (in the sense of percolation theory) but may mutate into a state with higher, supercritical infection probability. We find that in networks without small-world links, the probability of an escape to the supercritical state remains small, even if the mutation probability is large. In contrast, if small-world links are present, a supercritical mutation occurs frequently even for moderate mutation rate. The genetic change then entails a transition to a supercritical infection probability, which in turn causes a global infection of almost all nodes of the network. In contrast to the former case of epidemics assisted by small-world links, we here obtain a regime with a high chance of complete infestation of the host species due to the escape process driven by mutations. For larger numbers of long-range links, i.e., for networks approaching the global mixing of random graphs, the sweeping outbreaks disappear again.</p>
