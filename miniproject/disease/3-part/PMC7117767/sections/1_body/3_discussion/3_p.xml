<p>Likewise, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> alone was reported in the northern part of Cameroon whereas both 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were found sympatric in the southern part. The invasive species, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, first detected in Cameroon in 2000 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], tends to replace the native species, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. However, both are suspected to contribute to ZIKV transmission. Interestingly, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> collected in Gabon (Central Africa) in 2007 during concurrent chikungunya/dengue outbreak was found naturally infected with ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Level of transmission rates reported in both 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species suggested that both species can potentially cause major outbreaks in the region. However, it is important to highlight that other parameters such as the feeding behaviour and mosquito densities can modulate pathogens transmission in nature. Indeed, preliminary studies in Central Africa showed that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> occurs across the region and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is found under 6°N latitude. Meanwhile, in the sympatric areas, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is almost dominant except in some rare locations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and irrespective to the season in the areas with short dry season [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It was also demonstrated that in Yaoundé (Cameroon), 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> preferentially fed on humans rather than on available domestic animals. In this study, mixed blood meals animal-human were detected, confirming that this species could act also as a bridge vector for zoonotic pathogens [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In Central Africa, data on blood meal preference and biting behavior of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> are quite scarce. Further studies in this regard, could help to determine the epidemiological role of each species in ZIKV transmission. In addition, as our results showed that the transmission rate in both species vary according to the population origin, mosquito microbiome composition, genetic structure and gene flow of both species across the central African region, should be further explored to determine their impact on ZIKV transmission. These findings highlight the urgent need to plan a vector surveillance program and control methods against Zika vectors in the region in order to prevent future outbreaks.
