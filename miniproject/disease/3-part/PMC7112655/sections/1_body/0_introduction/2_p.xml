<p id="par0025">There is a great diversity of known pathogens among free ranging populations of carnivores, which can be transmitted to both domestic and stray animals. Thus, epidemiological surveillance and improvement of current methodologies for pathogen detection are crucial to understand the ecology, impact and dynamics of the diseases [
