<p id="par0205">Free-ranging carnivores are of vital importance to the stability and integrity of most ecosystems, but some viral infectious diseases have shown the potential to negatively impact wild populations and cause declines [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Almost half of the known infectious diseases of free-ranging carnivores are of viral origin [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although the three viruses here studied have been associated with mortality in wild and domestic canids worldwide, and some viruses could, theoretically, threaten the viability of small isolated populations (e.g. CPV [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), their impact in wild carnivore populations is still largely unknown, particularly among the northern Portuguese populations. Despite high prevalence levels of CPV and CDV our populations, none of these pathogens seem to have been associated with declines in Iberia, or listed among the major threats to the wild carnivores [
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This can be explained by a greater impact of fragmentation (road-kills) and illegal hunting, and/ or simple lack of robust data and regular disease surveillance. Nevertheless, our results suggest a high and common exposure to CPV and CDV, with a higher seroprevalence of Abs when compared to similar studies conducted in the Iberian Peninsula [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, we detected different antibody titers towards CPV and CDV, suggesting different contact timings between the animals and the viral pathogens. Immune response towards CPV and CDV infection is considered lifelong, thus detection of seropositive animals implies exposure but also protection against the virus [
