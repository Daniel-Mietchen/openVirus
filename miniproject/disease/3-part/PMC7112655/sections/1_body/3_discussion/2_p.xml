<p id="par0145">Diagnosis and detection of viruses and other pathogens in wildlife populations can be extremely difficult. Long-term collection of samples allowed us to show that all three taxonomic families (
 <italic>Canidae</italic>, 
 <italic>Viverridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Mustelidae</italic>) have been exposed to CPV, CDV and CCoV in northern Portugal. Viral detection in free-ranging animals was confirmed by molecular and serological data.
