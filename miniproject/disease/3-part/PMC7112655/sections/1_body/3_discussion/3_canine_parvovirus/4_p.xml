 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], may explain the higher detection of CPV DNA, with variability of the viral load. Nevertheless, there was a lower seroprevalence of CPV, as positive samples were approximately 30 % lower compared to results obtained through molecular assays. This discrepancy may be explained by several factors including: the use of lung, liver or spleen tissue extracts as the biological matrix for Ab detection; the use of the anti-dog conjugate in the ELISA assay for canids samples, and the lower sensitivity of ELISA assays for Abs detection versus qPCR for nucleic acid detection [

 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, we found a link between sample preservation status and seropositivity. Yet, the seropositivity rate obtained suggests a high rate of CPV exposure, but a low rate of CPV induced mortality [
