<p>The most striking hematological manifestation is cryoglobulinemia, and the pathophysiology is largely unknown. One hypothesis is that there may be an increased expression of serum B cell-activating factor (BAFF), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± family member required for B cell survival that has been documented in certain autoimmune diseases and hepatitis C infection. Thus, cryoglobulinemia has been reported in conjunction with other autoimmune or inflammatory disorders [

 <xref rid="B79-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Thus, for the association between cryoglobulinemia and HEV, it is possible that either HEV causes cryoglobulinemia whose mechanism is currently unknown, or pre-existing cryoglobulinemia weakens the immune system of the patient who subsequently acquires HEV infection [

 <xref rid="B81-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. the changes in lymphocyte and platelet counts are most likely to be non-specific, found following inflammatory stimuli as these changes had no clinical consequences [
