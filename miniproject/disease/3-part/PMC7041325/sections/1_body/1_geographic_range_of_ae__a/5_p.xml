<p>It is generally believed that the first incursion of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Africa to the Americas occurred during the slave trade era in the 1600s (Tabachnick

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Inherently, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is less tolerant to stressful climatic conditions such as temperatures below 10Â°C, implying that present and future incursion and establishment into subtropical and temperate regions are linked to climate change (Almeida et al. 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, Liu-Helmersson et al. 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). On the other hand, factors driving the disappearance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the 1970s from the Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Macaronesian and Atlantic Ocean regions (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., Madeira, Canary Islands, and the Azores) have been connected to establishment of appropriate water infrastructure and improved hygiene through development of piped water systems (Saliternik 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>, Holstein 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>). Furthermore, the use of insecticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), as part of malaria control, has significantly contributed to elimination of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. It has also been suggested that the vector has undergone natural extinction (Holstein 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>). Since then, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has reestablished in southern Russia, Madeira, Georgia, and northeastern Turkey (Almeida et al.
