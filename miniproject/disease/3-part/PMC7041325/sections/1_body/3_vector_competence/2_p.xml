<p>Vector competence studies infer that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has become a more effective vector for CHIKV and is currently able to cause disease within a few days postingestion of infected blood (Moutailler et al. 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, Rohani et al. 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Interestingly, a single amino acid change in the envelope 1 gene (E1), at position 226 (A226V), was found to be responsible for the increased adaptability and improved transmission of CHIKV by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> compared with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Tsetsarkin et al. 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Studies also demonstrate that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, when coinfected with DENV and CHIKV, are able to replicate and disseminate both viruses independently (Vazeille et al. 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, Nuckols et al. 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
