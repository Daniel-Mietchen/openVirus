<p>Vector competence (ability for infection, dissemination, and transmission of virus) differs between mosquitoes of different species and among virus strains. 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are known to transmit all four dengue virus serotypes, yellow fever virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus and suggested to be potential vectors of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Larsen and Ashley

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> feeds on a wide range of hosts and is known to be a significant biting irritant with the potential to become a serious health threat as a bridge vector for many zoonotic pathogens to humans (Benedict et al. 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This mosquito vector is able to transmit at least 22 arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and Sindbis viruses (Gubler and Rosen

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has been shown experimentally to transmit other arboviruses as well, such as Ross River, Western equine encephalitis, Oropouche, Jamestown Canyon, San Angelo, and Trivittatus viruses (Moore and Mitchell
