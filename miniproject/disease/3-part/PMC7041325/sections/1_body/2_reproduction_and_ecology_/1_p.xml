 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> thrive in warm and humid climate and they are predominantly day feeders (Van Kleef et al. 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> undergoes estivation, and in some cases, the eggs may survive temperatures below 0°C, whereas 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is intolerant to lower temperatures, especially freezing temperatures (Romi et al. 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, Gould and Higgs 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, Rios and Maruniak 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Thomas et al. 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females lay multiple batches of eggs, whereas 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> lay single batches after a bloodmeal. Although these two mosquito species are container-inhabiting mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has a preference for human settlements, whereas 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is inclined to periurban and rural environments (Christophers 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>, Chan et al. 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>, Braks et al. 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Tsuda et al. 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). During favorable conditions, especially at high temperatures and flooding, eggs of both 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> hatch within a few days into larvae. The larvae undergo thereafter four molts, which may take between 9 and 13 days. The male mosquitoes develop faster than the females and molt earlier into pupae. After a period of ∼2 days, the pupae develop further into adult mosquitoes; see
