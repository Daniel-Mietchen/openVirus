<p>Members of the mosquito genus 
 <italic>Aedes (Ae.)</italic> are associated with transmission of many arboviruses. Presently, 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> mosquitoes, specifically 
 <italic>Ae. (Stegomyia) aegypti</italic> (Linnaeus 1762) and 
 <italic>Ae. (Stegomyia) albopictus</italic> (Skuse 1894), are of main interest due to their association with emerging and reemerging infectious diseases with serious public health consequences (Weaver and Reisen 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These two mosquito vectors are competent vectors of four major arboviruses, for example, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus, which cause heavy health burden and economic losses globally. For many years, these vectors and viruses have been endemic and restricted to particular regions, but now they are spreading into new tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas, thus expanding the global coverage, a situation that may escalate large-scale epidemics (Kraemer et al. 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A fundamental question is whether it is plausible for these globally spread 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> species to trigger a global epidemic comprising of simultaneous outbreaks of these arboviruses. In addition, is there a multinational response and containment strategy?
