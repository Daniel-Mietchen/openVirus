<p>Given the clinical data suggesting the high efficacy and safety of DAA therapy, international organizations have recently recommended more streamlined approaches to the laboratory monitoring of HCV treatment.

 <xref rid="hep41482-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> The 2018 European Association for the Study of Liver (EASL) guideline update recommends measurement of HCV viral load, renal function (specifically for SOF‐containing regimens), and a hepatic function panel only prior to therapy and at 12 weeks following completion of therapy. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a similar approach as EASL for LMICs with HCV viral load, renal function, hepatic function panel, and CBC prior to therapy and at 12 weeks following completion of treatment. It should be noted that EASL also endorses a simplified version of monitoring when using pan‐genotypic regimens, which recommends only a pretreatment assessment and considers the 12‐week end‐of‐treatment HCV viral load as optional. Similarly, the AASLD/Infectious Diseases of America guidance in their November 2019 update published a simplified algorithm for treatment‐naïve patients without cirrhosis, which no longer recommends on‐treatment laboratory monitoring in uncomplicated patients.
