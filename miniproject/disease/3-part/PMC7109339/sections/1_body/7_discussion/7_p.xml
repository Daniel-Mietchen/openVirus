<p>Several clinical investigations used in this study, according to guidelines at the time of study initiation or due to study entry criteria, may warrant further adaptation or investigation. HCV genotype was assessed for all participants as entry criteria in the study for treatment with LDV/SOF, which is approved as a first‐line treatment only for GT 1 and GT 4. However, since the initiation of our study, several pan‐genotypic regimens have been approved and are now recommended for use in LMIC without consistent access to routine pretreatment genotyping, including SOF/daclatasvir, SOF/velpatasvir, and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.
 <xref rid="hep41482-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Although affordability and access to some of these regimens remain limited, ongoing prequalification and generic manufacturing for several of these drugs is encouraging for increased access, thereby reducing the need for genotyping and further decreasing the cost of HCV treatment. In this study, abdominal ultrasound was performed prior to treatment initiation to exclude HCC. However, in clinical practice, it may be warranted to reserve abdominal ultrasound for patients with evidence of advanced fibrosis based on noninvasive markers. Algorithms for HCC screening may warrant specific investigation, particularly in highly endemic regions with limited treatment options for HCC, such as SSA.
 <xref rid="hep41482-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> Additionally, participants in this study had research visits every 4 weeks while on treatment, which may have contributed to the high level of adherence seen in our study. The optimal frequency of clinic visits while on DAA therapy will likely need to be tailored depending on the clinical setting.
