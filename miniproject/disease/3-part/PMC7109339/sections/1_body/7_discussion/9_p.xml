<p>Overall, this study provides high‐quality evidence supporting simplification of on‐treatment laboratory monitoring for HCV in a LMIC. Our findings support updated simplified algorithms suggested by several expert HCV guidelines committees, and may suggest even further simplification by obviating the need for follow‐up testing for renal insufficiency or liver enzymes in patients with normal baseline values. Simplification of these algorithms would likely result in direct financial savings and efficiency gains to both patients and health systems, and facilitate increased coverage of HCV treatment services and improvement in the overall HCV care cascade.</p>
