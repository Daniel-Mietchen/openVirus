<p>Consistent with the clinical trial data,
 <xref rid="hep41482-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> the results of our study suggest a limited role for on‐treatment laboratory monitoring. Although 1 participant in our study was noted to have a suboptimal HCV viral load decline at week 4, poor adherence to therapy was detected on routine patient interview without the need for an HCV viral‐load measurement. Additionally, our findings support a limited role for monitoring of renal function, liver enzymes, and CBC during or after completion of the treatment course, given the absence of clinically significant AEs, including renal insufficiency, transaminitis, and anemia. Our lower‐than‐expected SVR12 response rate was found in both SHARED‐2 and SHARED‐1 participants and appeared to be caused by the prevalence of subtype 4r isolates, which have been found to have higher half‐maximal effective concentration to ledipasvir 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> compared with other GT‐4 subtypes.
