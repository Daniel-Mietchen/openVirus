  <p>Evaluation of Nipah virus (NiV) antigen-specific antibody responses following immunization of pigs with BoHV-4 vectors. Pigs were immunized with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK, BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK or ALVAC NiV G on 0 (prime) and 21 (boost) dpv. Recombinant NiV sG (
   <bold>A</bold>) and NiV mcsF (
   <bold>B</bold>) proteins were used in ELISAs to assess antigen-specific antibody responses. NiV G or F specific-antibody endpoint titers for the respective groups were measured in sera collected on 21 and 42 dpv (
   <bold>C</bold>) and in BAL fluid (BALF) collected on 42 dpv (
   <bold>D</bold>). Mean data ± SEM are shown for each vaccine group.
