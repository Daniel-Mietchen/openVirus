  <p>Evaluation of NiV antigen-specific T cell responses following immunization of pigs with BoHV-4 vectors. Pigs were immunized with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK, BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK or ALVAC NiV G on 0 (prime) and 21 (boost) dpv. Responses of PBMC to stimulation with NiV G and F peptide pools was monitored weekly by IFN-γ ELISpot and responding cells phenotyped by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays. ELISpot data are presented as the mock-corrected number of IFN-γ spot forming cells (S-C) per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (
   <bold>A</bold>) and ICS data shown as the medium-corrected % TNF-α
   <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
   <sup>+</sup> CD4
   <sup>+</sup> (
   <bold>B</bold>) and CD8α
   <sup>+</sup> cells (
   <bold>C</bold>). Mean data ± SEM are shown for each vaccine group.
