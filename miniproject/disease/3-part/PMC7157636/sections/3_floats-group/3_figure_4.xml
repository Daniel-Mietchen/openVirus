  <p>Evaluation of NiV neutralizing antibody responses following immunization of pigs with BoHV-4 vectors. Pigs were immunized with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK, BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK or ALVAC NiV G on 0 (prime) and 21 (boost) dpv. NiV neutralizing antibody titers were assessed using NiV-M (
   <bold>A</bold>) and NiV-B (
   <bold>B</bold>) pseudoviruses and presented as the reciprocal serum dilution to inhibit pseudovirus entry by 90% (IC
   <sub>90</sub>). Neutralizing antibody responses were confirmed by classical VNT; longitudinal serum samples were assessed for neutralization of NiV-B (
   <bold>C</bold>) and day 42 sera tested for cross-neutralization of NiV-M, NiV-B, and HeV (
   <bold>D</bold>). Sera was assessed for neutralization of NiV-mediated cell–cell fusion using a quantitative fusion assay with cells expressing NiV-M (
   <bold>E</bold>) or NiV-B (
   <bold>F</bold>) glycoproteins. Mean data ± SEM are shown for each vaccine group.
