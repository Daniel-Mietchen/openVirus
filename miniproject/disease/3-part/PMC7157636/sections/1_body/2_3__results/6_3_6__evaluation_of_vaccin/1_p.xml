<p>A broad assessment of T cell responses was conducted by longitudinal measurement of IFN-γ secretion using an ELISpot assay after ex vivo stimulation of freshly isolated PBMCs with a pool of either NiV F or G peptides. Stimulation of PBMCs with NiV G peptides pool induced the strongest IFN-γ response in the group vaccinated with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and with the greatest response at 42 dpv (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The kinetic of the response to the NiV G peptides in the group vaccinated with ALVAC NiV G was comparable but of a far lesser magnitude which did not achieve statistical significance. Responses from BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK immunized animals were significantly higher than those immunized with ALVAC NiV G at day 14, 28, 35, and 42 dpv (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and with the greatest increase after the boost at 28 dpv (
