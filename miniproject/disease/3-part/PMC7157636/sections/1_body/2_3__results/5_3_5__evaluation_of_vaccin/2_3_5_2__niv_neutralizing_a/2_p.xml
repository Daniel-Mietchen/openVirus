<p>A classical VNT, utilizing NiV-B, revealed low titers of virus neutralizing antibodies in 3/6 BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK pigs, 1/5 BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTKpigs and 0/6 ALVAC NiV G pigs after the prime immunization (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). Mean neutralizing titers (above the Limit of Detection, LoD) were obtained in all groups when sera were tested with the two NiV strains; both NiV G vaccine groups had significantly higher titers than the BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, only the BoHV-4 NiV F group displayed a mean HeV neutralizing titer above the LoD. Sera was finally assessed for capacity to neutralize NiV-mediated cell–cell fusion using a quantitative fusion assay based on adapted bi-fluorescent complementation technology. Sera was tested using cells expressing NiV-M (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00115-f004">Figure 4</xref>F) glycoproteins. Only sera from BoHV-4 NiV F immunized pigs showed a significant inhibition of NiV-M mediated cell–cell fusion, which was observed from 28 dpv (28 dpv significant from 0 dpv (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); 28 and 42 dpv significant from BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK pigs (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 respectively); and 35 dpv significant from ALVAC NiV G pigs (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01)). A lower % inhibition of NiV-B mediated fusion was seen with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK sera (42 dpv significant from 0 dpv and from BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTKpigs (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 respectively)).
