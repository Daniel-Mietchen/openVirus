<p>We wished to assess the potential of BoHV-4-vectors expressing NiV-M F or G as prototype recombinant vaccines in pigs. NiV is classified as a biosafety level 4 (BSL4) agent, which makes challenge studies extremely expensive; therefore, an immunogenicity study in pigs was performed. Recombinant BoHV-4 were engineered and their ability to induce immune responses in pigs was benchmarked against the protective ALVAC NiV G. Both BoHV-4 vectors induced potent antibody and T cell responses supporting their further evaluation as effective candidates for NiV vaccination in pigs.</p>
