<p>Nipah virus (NiV), along with the related Hendra virus (HeV), are classified as members of the 
 <italic>Henipavirus</italic> genus within the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. NiV is enveloped and possess a negative sense genome coding for 6 genes and flanked by 3′ leader and 5′ trailer regions. The viral genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) and complexes with the viral phosphoprotein (P) and polymerase (L) to form the ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The RNP is surrounded by the viral envelope, which consists of the surface glycoproteins for attachment (G) and fusion (F), and the inner matrix protein (M), which is required for viral assembly and budding [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The G protein is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptors; for NiV this has been shown to be ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 [
 <xref rid="B3-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. NiV F is synthesized as an inactive precursor F
 <sub>0,</sub> which is proteolytically cleaved by a host cell protease, into the fusion active F
 <sub>1</sub> and F
 <sub>2</sub> subunits, which facilitate cell-to-cell spread of virus [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Antibodies against NiV G or F proteins can neutralize virus and play a crucial role in protection [
 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Two genetically distinct strains have been described, Malaysia (NiV-M) with a genome length of 18,246 bp and Bangladesh (NiV-B) with a genome length of 18,256 bp. Nucleotide similarity between the NiV-M and NiV-B strains is 91.8%, with similarities between proteins at ≥92% [
 <xref rid="B7-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of the NiV strain isolated from humans during the a recent outbreak in the Indian state of Kerala (NiV-K) in 2018 [
 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], showed a genome length of approximately 18,100 bp, with 96.15% similarity to NiV-B. Despite this high similarity, NiV-K forms a separate genetic cluster [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Whereas, NiV-K gene sequences encoding NiV G and F showed higher homology with NiV-B isolates (≥95%,) [
 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Old World fruit bats of the genus 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> are considered the natural host and reservoir for NiV; NiV-M has been found in 
 <italic>P. hypomelanus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. lylei</italic> and 
 <italic>P. vampyrus</italic>; and NIV-B and NiV-K in 
 <italic>P. giganteus</italic>. This is likely to be an ancient co-evolution since experimentally infected bats are completely asymptomatic, even after a high dose of NiV infection [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. NiV is capable of infecting a wide range of mammalian species, including pigs, horses, ferrets, squirrel monkeys, and humans, and causing encephalitis and pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The wide species tropism of NiV is due its use of highly conserved ephrin B2/B3 molecules as its entry receptors [
 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is likely that spillover infection of NiV from bats to humans and animals has occurred sporadically for centuries, but this has only been recognized recently due to the improvement of diagnostic tests [
 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. NiV was first described in 1998 following an outbreak of severe encephalitis among pig farmers and abattoir workers in Malaysia and Singapore [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This outbreak was caused by the spillover of NiV from bats to Malaysian pigs which is thought to have occurred through consumption of fruit contaminated with infectious bat secretions. Subsequent transmission of NiV from pigs to humans occurred through close contact with saliva, urine, and excretory waste from infected pigs, resulting in 105 deaths from 276 confirmed cases (56% fatality rate). Subsequent sporadic NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh and India have occurred on a smaller scale and involved direct transmission from bats to humans, probably because pig farming is rare in these countries [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Human infection following contact with infected pig secretions was confirmed in 1999, highlighting the role that pigs can play as an intermediate/amplification host for NiV [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The clinical manifestation of NiV infection in pigs, although unspecified by pathognomonic symptoms, is characterized by an acute febrile illness with respiratory symptoms such as barking cough, nasal discharge and labored breathing; these symptoms are more severe in suckling piglets. Respiratory symptoms can be accompanied by neurological signs and first trimester abortion in pregnant sows [
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The name assigned to NiV induced disease in Malaysian pigs was porcine respiratory and neurological/encephalitis syndrome or barking pig syndrome [
