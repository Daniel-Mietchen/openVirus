BoHV-4 has been proposed as a candidate for gene delivery vector for immunoprophylaxis and gene therapy thanks to its molecular and biological characteristics, such as: little or no pathogenicity, absence of oncogenicity; capability to accommodate large amounts of foreign genetic material; ability to establish persistent infection and to be maintained in an episomal state in dividing cells, combined with the ability to maintain transgene expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Moreover, several cell type from different animal species are susceptible to BoHV-4 infection, including some human cell lines, usually without cytopathic effect (CPE). BoHV-4 is able to establish persistent infections in its natural bovine host and in an experimental host like the rabbit, without eliciting the production of vector-neutralizing antibodies. Lastly, BoHV-4 can be manipulated using infectious BoHV-4-derived bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomes cloned in
