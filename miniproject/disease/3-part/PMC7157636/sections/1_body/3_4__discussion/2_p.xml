<p>NiV vaccine candidates generated to date are based on envelope glycoproteins F and/or G delivered as adjuvated subunits or by viral vectors [

 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Both NiV F and G are neutralizing antibody target antigens; however, the majority of studies have focused on the G protein. A comparison of the immunization of pigs with ALVAC vector expressing NiV G and/or F, showed that either antigen could be protective, although the highest virus neutralizing titers and level of protection was observed with the former [
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The recombinant soluble G (sG) HeV subunit vaccine, Equivac
 <sup>Â®</sup> HeV, is licensed for use in Australian horses and has been shown to experimentally protect a range of species [

 <xref rid="B72-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Rather unexpectedly, Equivac HeV failed to protect pigs, and this was accredited to the incapacity of the vaccine to produce a cellular immune response [

Herpesviruses naturally induce potent T cell responses and herpesviral vectors are emerging as a new vaccine platform that may induce substantial memory T cell responses that accumulate at the mucosal sites which serve as the initial site of infection and replication of many pathogenic viruses, including NiV [
