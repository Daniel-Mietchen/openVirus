<p>Most promising, were the potent CD4 and CD8 T cell responses which were, as hypothesized, induced by the BoHV-4 vectors. BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK responses were an order of greater than those induced by the ALVAC NiV G vector. Phenotyping the T cell response was unexpectedly challenging due to what appeared to be a down-regulation of both CD3 and CD8α on the responding cells. Whilst such an observation is not published widely in the vaccine literature, it is known that following TcR-activation, the entire receptor complex, including CD3 is internalized and degraded by the lysosome [

Initially thought to be a mechanism to aid peripheral tolerance, CD8 down-regulation on primed/activated T cell populations has been described in both humans and mice in a variety of contexts including in response to infection [

 <xref rid="B84-vaccines-08-00115" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. We therefore speculate that a combination of the magnitude of the BoHV-4 vector induced T cell response and the high concentrations of peptides used in the recall assay may have contributed to the decreased CD3/CD8α surface expression.
