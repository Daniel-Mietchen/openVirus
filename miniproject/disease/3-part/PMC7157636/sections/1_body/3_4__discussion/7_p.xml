<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that BoHV-4 vectors expressing NiV glycoproteins induce immune responses in pigs that meet and, in terms of T cell immunogenicity, exceed those of a viral vector known to induce protective responses. These data support the further evaluation of these vectors for efficacy against NiV and potentially further development as DIVA vaccines which could be prophylactically or reactively to prevent/control NiV outbreaks. The prodigious T cell responses demonstrated with the BoHV-4 vectors also supports their evaluation in the delivery of antigens from other porcine viruses for which T cells are thought to play an important role in protection of, e.g., African swine fever [
