<p>Codon optimized DNA representing amino acids 71–602 of a NiV-M G protein (NiV sG) was cloned into the pHL-Sec vector and the resultant plasmid amplified in bacteria. DNA was extracted using a commercial plasmid DNA maxi-prep kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and transfected into HEK293T cells in roller culture using PEI transfection reagent. Tissue culture supernatant containing the secreted NiV sG was harvested at 7 days post-transfection and clarified by centrifugation (500× 
 <italic>g</italic>) before being dialyzed overnight and then loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap
 <sup>™</sup> High Performance column (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK). The column was then washed with 20 mM imidazole in PBS and protein eluted using 300 mM imidazole in PBS. Column elution fractions were then analyzed and protein containing fractions pooled and re-dialyzed with PBS and PMSF Protease Inhibitor. The protein concentration of this dialyzed eluted fraction was then calculated, and additional analysis performed for endotoxins, protein integrity and oligomeric status.
