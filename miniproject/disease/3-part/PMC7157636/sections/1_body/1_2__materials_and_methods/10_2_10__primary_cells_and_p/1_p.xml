<p>Fibroblast-like primary cells were infected in triplicate at a MOI of 1 with BoHV-4EGFPΔTK in cEMEM with 2% FBS and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h. After a washing with serum-free EMEM, the cells were overlaid with cEMEM and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Supernatants were collected and titrated at 24 and 48 h post infection. PECs were infected at a MOI of 0.1, 1, or 5 with BoHV-4EGFPΔTK and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in cEMEM with 2% FBS. After washing with serum-free EMEM, the cells were overlaid with cEMEM and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Supernatants were collected and titrated at 24 and 48 h post-infection. PECs were also infected at a MOI of 1 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell with BoHV-1 or BVDV in EMEM with 2% FBS and after 2 h incubation, the viral inocula was removed and the cells overlaid with fresh complete EMEM. Cells were incubated for 72 h and the supernatants collected every 24 h and titrated.
