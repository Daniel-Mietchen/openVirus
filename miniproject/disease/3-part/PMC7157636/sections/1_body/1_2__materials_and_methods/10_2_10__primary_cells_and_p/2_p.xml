<p>To produce the recombinant viruses for the porcine immunogenicity study, PECs grown in cEMEM were infected with a MOI of 0.1 with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK or BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK in cEMEM with 2% of FBS. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> the viral inoculum was removed from the cells and substituted with fresh cEMEM and the cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 24 h of infection, the medium was changed to EMEM with 10% of pig serum (PS; Gibco from Thermo Fisher Scientific). The infected cells were then incubated for a further 24 h, until the CPE affected ~20% of the cell culture monolayer. After freeze/thawing of the flasks, the medium containing the recombinant virus was then harvested and titrated in MDBK or BEK cells.
