<p>Targeting vectors were evaluated in HEK293T. Cells were transiently transfected with pTK-CMV-NiV-F-TK and pTK-CMV-NiV-G-TK targeting vectors or pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Takara Bio Europe SA, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) as a transfection control, using polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent (Polysciences, Inc. Warrington, Pennsylvania, USA). Briefly, cells were seeded at 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were then incubated for 6 h with a transfection mix containing 3 μg of plasmid DNA and PEI (ratio 1:2.5 DNA-PEI) in DMEM high glucose (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) without serum. After incubation, the transfection mix was replaced by fresh cEMEM and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>.
