<p>BEK cells were infected with BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK, BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK, and BoHV-4-A at a MOI of 0.1 and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Infected cells were washed with serum-free EMEM and then overlaid with cEMEM. The supernatants of infected cultures were harvested daily, and the amount of infectious virus was determined by limiting dilution on BEK cells. Viral titer differences between each time point are the average of triplicate measurements ± standard errors of the mean (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 for all time points as measured by Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test).
