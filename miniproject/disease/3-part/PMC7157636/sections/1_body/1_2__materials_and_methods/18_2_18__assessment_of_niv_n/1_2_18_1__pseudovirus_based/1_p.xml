<p>HEK293T cells were plated at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per 10 cm
 <sup>2</sup> dish in cDMEM-10. The following day, the cells were transfected with 1 µg each of pCAGGS plasmid expressing NiV G and F from NiV-M or NiV-B, along with 1 µg p8.91 (encoding for HIV-1 gag-pol) and 1.5 µg CSFLW (the firefly luciferase reporter-expressing lentivirus-backbone) and 20 µL PEI (Sigma-Aldrich). The following day, the transfection mix was removed and replaced with 7 mL cDMEM-10. Cells were incubated for a further 48 h, after which supernatants containing pseudotyped NiV (NiV-Mpp or NiV-Bpp) were harvested and centrifuged at 1300×

 <sup>4</sup>/well in a 96-well plate one day prior to harvesting pseudotypes. The following day, NiV-Mpp and NiV-Bpp were titrated 10-fold on target cells and the remainder stored at −80 °C. After 72 h, firefly luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System substrate (Promega) as per manufacturer’s instructions on a GloMax Multi + Detection System (Promega).
