All cell lines were cultured in Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 1mM of Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco), 2 mM of L-glutamine (Gibco), 100 IU/mL of penicillin (Gibco), 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy), and 0.25 μg/mL of amphotericin B (Gibco),—from here annotated as cEMEM and were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. HEK-293T and BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) cells (from the Cell Servicing Unit, The Pirbright Institute, UK) used in low bio-containment assays were maintained and cultured using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS (Life Science Production), 1% sodium pyruvate solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy) and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL; Life Technologies from Thermo Fisher Scientific)—from here annotated as cDMEM-10 and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>.
