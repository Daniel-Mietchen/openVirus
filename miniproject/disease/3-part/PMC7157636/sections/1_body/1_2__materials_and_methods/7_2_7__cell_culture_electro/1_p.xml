<p>BEK or BEK
 <italic>cre</italic> cells were maintained as a monolayer with cEMEM. When cells were sub-confluent (70%–90%) they were split to a fresh culture flask and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. BAC-DNA (~5 µg) was electroporated in 600 µL cDMEM without serum (Gene pulser Xcell, 270 V, 1500 µF, 4-mm gap cuvettes, Bio-Rad) into BEK and BEK
 <italic>cre</italic> cells. Cells were left to grow until the appearance of CPE.
