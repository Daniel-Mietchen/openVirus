Syndromes of infected people range from asymptomatic infections to severe neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome and microcephaly. Screening anti-ZIKV drugs derived from Chinese medicinal herbs is one method of identifying antiviral agents. In this paper, we report that (1) Cephalotaxine (CET), an alkaloid isolated from <italic>Cephalotaxus drupacea</italic>, was effective in inhibiting ZIKV activity <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> (i.e., in Vero and A549&#x000a0;cell lines) and (2) the mechanisms which underlie these effects involve virucidal activity and a decrease in viral replication. Specifically, CET was found to decrease ZIKV RNA and viral protein expression, inhibit ZIKV replication, and inhibit ZIKV mRNA/protein production. We also determined that CET is effective in inhibiting dengue virus 1&#x02013;4 (DENV1-4). Taken together, our findings indicate that CET could be an effective lead compound in the treatment of ZIKV and also suggest that further investigation and development of CET-derived drugs may lead to a new class of anti-<italic>Flavivirus</italic> medications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">CET against ZIKV infection via inhibiting replication and stability.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">CET was identified as a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infection.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">CET as a candidate compound for potential ZIKV treatment.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antiviral</kwd><kwd>Cephalotaxine</kwd><kwd>Viral production</kwd><kwd>Replication</kwd><kwd>Dengue virus</kwd><kwd>Zika virus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus and the Flaviviridae family (a family to which the Hepatitis C virus (HCV], Dengue virus (DENV], West Nile virus (WNV], Yellow fever virus [YFV], and Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV] also belong.) ZIKV was first isolated from rhesus monkeys near the Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947 [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The viral genome of ZIKV encodes a polyprotein which consists of a capsid, a premembrane/membrane, an envelope, and seven nonstructural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4 B, and NS5 [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In recent years, ZIKV infection has become a serious and escalating threat to global health. For example, ZIKV spread rapidly in 2015 in at least 33 regions and countries in Central and South America, such as Brazil, becoming an epidemic that affected between 0.5 and 1.5 million people [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>]. ZIKV infection has been associated with several neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in adults and microcephaly in infants [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">Prior to the outbreak which affected Brazil and other Central and South American countries, ZIKV infection was only considered to lead only to a mild disease. However, as the 2015 outbreak identified, when pregnant women are infected with ZIKV, their babies can be born with serious birth defects, such as fetal growth restrictions as well as neurological and ocular abnormalities. In some cases, ZIKV during pregnancy can even led to perinatal death [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ZIKV is also known to cause a benign febrile illness in approximately 18% of infected individuals. This illness leads to symptoms which are similar to those of other arbovirus infections, including DENV and the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Specifically, these symptoms include fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis, and less commonly, headaches, vomiting and jaundice [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Other clinical symptoms typical of ZIKV infection include fever, headaches, joint pain, conjunctivitis, and macular atrophy [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared ZIKV to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Strategies of fighting ZIKV infection include the development of vaccines and the screening of antiviral agents that inhibit different stages of the viral life cycle [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unfortunately, no approved antiviral ZIKV agents are currently available. There is thus an urgent need to develop safe and effective antiviral agents against ZIKV and to elucidate their mechanisms. Doing so should help identify lead compounds which have the potential for further clinical development in the fight against ZIKV.</p><p id="p0040">Cephalotaxine (CET), harringtonine (HT), homoharringtonine (HHT), isoharringtonine, and deoxyharringtoninea are alkaloids which can be isolated and purified from the Chinese coniferous tree <italic>Cephalotaxus hainanensis</italic> [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CET has shown promising antiviral activities against hepatitis B [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and has also been found to have antileukemic activities [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Due to their wide range of effects, CET drugs are also believed to have great potential in the treatment of other diseases, including some cancers [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. HT inhibits CHIKV replication by down-regulating viral protein expression, while HHT shows activity against HBV and the coronavirus. Previous research further determined that both HT and HHT are promising candidates for the treatment of diseases related to the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. Although such drugs have similar structures, their substituents vary widely, which may translate into differences in pharmacological activity [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, in the current study, we opted to investigate the potential anti-ZIKV activity of CET in Vero cells. Our results indicate that CET indeed possesses anti-ZIKV activity. Thus, we also opted to investigate the potential mechanisms which underlie the anti-ZIKV activity of CET. In so doing, we demonstrated that CET (1) disrupts the viral life cycle by preventing ZIKV from replicating and (2) exhibits virucidal activity against ZIKV. These findings suggest that CET has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent against ZIKV.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell lines, viruses, and drugs</title><p id="p0045">This study used Vero (African green monkey kidney cells; ATCC&#x000ae; CRL-1586TM) and A549 (Human lung carcinoma epithelial cells; ATCC&#x000ae; CCL-185&#x02122;) cells, as these cells are more permissive to ZIKV (PRAVABC59, ATCC&#x000ae; VR-1843&#x02122;) replication.

A and B), which means that the inhibitory effects of CET likely occur after virus entry. To investigate CET inhibition after ZIKV entry, Vero cells were infected with ZIKV, washed with PBS to remove viruses that had not infected the cells, and then treated with indicated concentrations of CET. Cell lysates and supernatants were collected after 24&#x000a0;h incubation for further analysis. Results showed that administering CET after the initial infection (i.e., the post-treatment group) suppressed viral RNA replication. In particular, when cells in the post-treatment group were administered 40 or 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CET, ZIKV RNA levels were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>C). FFU assays further revealed that the viral yield decreased in the post-treatment group when cells were administered 20, 40, or 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CET (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>D). In addition, virucidal assays showed that CET affected virus stability. FFU assays, in which cells were incubated with supernatant containing 50,000 FFU ZIKV with or without 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CET at room temperature for 6&#x000a0;h prior to detection, revealed that CET decreased the virus level after a 6&#x000a0;h incubation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>E), further confirming that CET likely possesses the ability to influence virus stability.<fig id="fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p><bold>Time of addition assay to investigate the effects of treating ZIKV-infected Vero cells with 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CET.</bold> (A) RNA levels and (B) virus progeny production.

Since then, ZIKV has become a flavivirus of great medical concern. Nonetheless, to date, despite significant efforts to develop effective vaccines, no effective treatment for this emerging pathogen has been found. Therefore, identifying broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and effective clinical compounds is critical for the treatment of ZIKV patients and for the control of ZIKV outbreaks [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="p0135">CET and its derived ester compounds (such as HT and HHT) have all been found to possess activity against leukemic cells [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The anti-tumor ability of these compounds is believed to arise from their inhibitory effects on protein synthesis [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previous research also determined that CET and its ester derivatives have inhibitory effects against HBV [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], VZV and CHIKV [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, this is the first study to demonstrate that CET inhibits ZIKV infection. Specifically, results of IFA revealed that CET treatment reduced viral infection in both Vero and A549&#x000a0;cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><p id="p0140">Researchers who previously assessed the viability of HEPG2 cells and ETBr cells treated with CET found that CET is not cytotoxic and whereas they induced dose-dependent anti-HBV and anti-bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) as a surrogate for HCV effects, respectively [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our results also demonstrated that CET possesses low cytotoxicity and does not affect cell viability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A). Moreover, viral RNA levels, protein expression levels, and viral titers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B, C, and 2D) in CET-treated Vero cells revealed that 20&#x02013;80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CET led to &#x0003e;50&#x02013;90% virus inhibition, consistent with previous findings.</p><p id="p0145">Previous studies demonstrated that HT and HHT inhibit replication of CHIKV, VZV [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the Sindbis virus (SINV) [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. HHT has further been shown to exert antiviral effects against coronavirus (CoV) [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and HBV [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both HT and HHT are able to inhibit the replication of both RNA and DNA viruses, which indicates that their antiviral activities are most likely due to cellular rather than viral factors and that cellular factors are essential for viral replication. CET esters have been shown to interfere with RNA translation by blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to acceptor sites on the large ribosomal subunit, thereby also blocking the subsequent formation of a peptide bond [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, HT has been found to limit the replication of CHIKV by inhibiting large ribosomal subunits and subsequently down-regulating the translation of viral proteins [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar to previous studies, results of our time of addition assay showed that CET affected the late stage of ZIKV infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A and B).</p><p id="p0150">We further sought to determine the possible mechanism by which CET influences ZIKV RNA replication. Previous research which investigated VZV determined that both HT and HHT likely employ other mechanisms in inhibiting ZIKV. For example, HT and HHT likely inhibit lytic gene expression and replication, which may in turn interfere with signal transduction pathways and transcription factors involved in VZV lytic gene expression. On the other hand, in herpesviruses (HHVs), HT and HHT are able to block cell cycle progression during the G1/S or G2/M transition, which in turn affects lytic gene expression and replication [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, the mechanisms by which HT, HHT [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and CET inhibit VZV replication may involve disrupting the cell cycle of infected cells.</p><p id="p0155">In virology, RNA levels are indicative of virus replication (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>C), and FFU levels are indicative of virus release (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>D). In the current study, for the post-treatment group (i.e., the Vero cells that received CET after ZIKV-infection), the decreases we observed in viral replication and viral release were the same, which suggest that the primary mechanism by which CET inhibited ZIKV involved viral replication, not virus release. However, the time of addition assay showed that the viral yield of the full-duration treatment group was lower than that of the post-treatment group (by approximately 0.5 logs, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B). This finding suggests that not only can CET disrupt viral replication, but it may also possess other anti-ZIKV activities. To determine this, we performed a virucidal assay of CET, the results of which confirmed that CET decreased viral stability, thereby reducing viral yield (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>E). In summary, our data indicate that CET is able to inhibit ZIKV infection by affecting both viral replication and viral stability.</p><p id="p0160">Finally, we also studied the effects of CET on four different dengue virus serotypes and found that CET reduced DENV RNA levels in a Vero cell model, in which CET inhibited all four dengue virus serotypes in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Therefore, CET may also be useful in the treatment of dengue virus infections.</p><p id="p0165">To conclude, our results indicate that CET is an effective antiviral agent against ZIKV. CET exerts anti-ZIKV activities through the inhibition of viral production and replication as well as through virucidal activity. The evidence reported here supports the further study of CET as a candidate compound for ZIKV treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0170">None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dick</surname><given-names>G.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kitchen</surname><given-names>S.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Haddow</surname><given-names>A.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Zika virus.
