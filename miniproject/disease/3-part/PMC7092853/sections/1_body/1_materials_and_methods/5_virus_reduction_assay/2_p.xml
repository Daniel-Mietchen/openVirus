<p id="p0060">Confluent monolayers of Vero cells were plated in 12-well microplates and incubated for 16 h. Subsequently, 500 μl of DMEM containing 2% FBS, various concentrations of CET, and 400 foci forming units (FFUs) of ZIKV were added to the cells. Following incubation for another 2 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then further treated with CET for an additional 48 h. After another two-day incubation period, supernatants were harvested and the viral titers contained therein were determined using IFA. Relative quantifications of ZIKV RNA in Vero cells were determined using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).</p>
