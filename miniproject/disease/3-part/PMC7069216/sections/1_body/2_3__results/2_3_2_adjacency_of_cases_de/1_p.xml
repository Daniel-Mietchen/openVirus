<p>We generated a sequence of graphs at varying TN93 distance thresholds for each data set, where each vertex represents a known case (sampled or diagnosed prior to the final year) and an edge indicates that the corresponding pairwise distance is below the threshold—in graph theory, the cases are said to be ‘adjacent’. Thus, each distance threshold defines a different partition of known cases into clusters, where a cluster may consist of only a single known case. Our objective is to determine which threshold results in the most information-rich partition of known cases for predicting where new cases will arise. As we will demonstrate below, there is no information value in either extreme of a single giant cluster or the complete atomization of cases into singular clusters. To quantify the information loss associated with different partitions, we compared two predictive models. First, we fit a null model that assumes the probability that a new case appears in a cluster (i.e. cluster growth) is only influenced by the number of known cases in the cluster, i.e. the cluster size. This is equivalent to assuming that every known case is equally likely to be adjacent (connected by an edge) to the new case. Second, we fit a weighted model where the probability of cluster growth is predicted by some linear combination of individual-level attributes among the known cases in the cluster.</p>
