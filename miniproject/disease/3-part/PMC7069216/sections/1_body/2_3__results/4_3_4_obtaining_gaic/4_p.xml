 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa011-F5">Fig. 5</xref>. In the Seattle graph, the largest cluster (Se1) comprising thirty-four known cases was adjacent to two new cases. The sample collection years associated with this cluster range from 2000 to 2012 with a mean of 2006.8 (interquartile range, IQR = 2006–2009). In contrast, the second largest cluster (Se2) comprised only ten known cases that were sampled more recently with a mean of 2009.6 (2008–2011), and accumulated six new cases. Similarly, the largest cluster in the northern Alberta graph (NA1) comprised twenty-two cases of which none were new, with a mean sample collection year of 2009.2 years (2008–2011). This contrasts a smaller cluster of ten known cases (NA2), of which five were collected in 2012 (mean 2010.5, IQR = 2009–2012), that gained twelve new cases in 2013. Finally, we observed a large cluster (Tn1) of seventy-two known cases in the Tennessee data set with only one new case and a mean sample collection year of 2007.6 (IQR = 2005–2010). In contrast, the cluster labelled Tn2 comprised thirty-nine known cases with a mean collection year of 2012 (IQR 2010, 2013) and three new cases. These simple examples illustrate the effect of optimizing the clustering threshold on the covariation of new case counts and the recency of known cases among clusters. As predicted by our model analysis, the effect of variation in case recency among clusters on the distribution of new cases is even clearer for the graph depicting clusters of cases stratified by year of diagnosis rather than sample collection (
