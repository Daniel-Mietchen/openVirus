<p>We repeated the cluster threshold evaluation on progressively censored subsets of the Seattle and Tennessee data to evaluate the consistency of the GAIC-optimized thresholds over time. This was accomplished by removing cases from the most recent year to a maximum of four years, and obtaining the GAIC measurements for all values of

 </inline-formula> for the remaining data at each step. Because of the limited size and temporal range of the northern Alberta data set, we did not use it for this sensitivity analysis. We also re-ran the experiment on random subsets of cases from the complete Seattle and Tennessee data sets, creating a total of ninety subsets; thirty subsets at three different proportions of the original total, 80 per cent, 60 per cent, and 40 per cet. For each resampling proportion, we obtained the kernel density for the optimal cut-off location over the thirty replicate samples and the GAIC measurements obtained by a smoothed function from all ninety resampled GAIC runs.
