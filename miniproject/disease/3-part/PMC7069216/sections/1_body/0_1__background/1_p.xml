<p>Spatiotemporal clustering is a fundamental public health methodology for the detection of infectious disease outbreaks (
 <xref rid="veaa011-B36" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al. 2010</xref>). The colocalization of cases in space and time can reveal the existence of a common source, and cases within a cluster tend to be related by recent transmission events. For example, an automated time–space clustering method (
 <xref rid="veaa011-B19" ref-type="bibr">Kulldorff et al. 2005</xref>) was demonstrated to retrospectively detect outbreaks of nosocomial bacterial infection in a US-based hospital, including the outbreaks that were detected contemporaneously by the hospital’s pre-existing infection control programme (

Early detection of a cluster represents a potential opportunity for a targeted public health response to prevent additional cases. Time–space clustering may be less effective, however, for pathogens that can establish a chronic infection with a long asymptomatic period (e.g. 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1; HIV-1) where the transmission event may have occurred months or years before diagnosis. Furthermore, pathogens with a relatively low per-act transmission rate present difficulties for time–space clustering because a single exposure in a specific location is unlikely to result in transmission. Under these circumstances, the spread of an epidemic is more likely to be shaped by a social network of repeated contacts between individuals, rather than shared venues.
