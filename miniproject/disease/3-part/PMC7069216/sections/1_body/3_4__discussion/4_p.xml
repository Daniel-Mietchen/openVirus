<p>Collection dates in units of years are most frequently available as sample metadata in association with published HIV-1 genetic sequences. We had a strong 
 <italic>a priori</italic> expectation for an association between new case adjacency and known case recency that we subsequently confirmed from these data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa011-F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>). On the other hand, we recognize that samples may be collected well after the start of a new infection, due to the long asymptomatic period of HIV-1 infection and social barriers to HIV testing (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>). Even when using diagnostic dates, there is potential conflation of recent transmission with late diagnosis. Although estimated dates of infection (e.g. the midpoint between the last HIV seronegative and first seropositive visit dates) will tend to be closer to the actual date of infection, the necessary information for accurate estimates are not routinely available in a public health context. We furthermore recognize that more precise dates of sample collection would likely confer greater prediction accuracy. Indeed, the granularity of time in the context of genetic cluster analysis represents an extension of MAUP that is known as the modifiable temporal unit problem (
 <xref rid="veaa011-B4" ref-type="bibr">Cheng and Adepeju 2014</xref>). While reducing the length of time intervals may produce more timely predictions, e.g. new cases in the next three months instead of the next year, the accuracy of prediction will erode with progressively shorter intervals. Finally, we propose that an informative assessment on the potential value of genetic clustering for public health would be to compare the GAIC of the genetic clustering method against the value obtained from the prioritization of groups by public health experts. However, the confidential information comprising the latter case is not likely to be found in the public domain.
