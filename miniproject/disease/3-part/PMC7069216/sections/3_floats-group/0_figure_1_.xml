  <p>(top) Distribution of sample collection years for the Seattle (blue), northern Alberta (orange), and Middle Tennessee (red) data sets. Absent bars indicate that no sampling was carried out in the respective years, and does not reflect an absence of cases. (bottom) Histograms of Tamura-Nei (TN93) genetic distances among pairwise comparisons of HIV-1 sequences. The height of each bin has been rescaled to reflect the total number of pairwise comparisons, for which the majority were censored from the data. An expanded section of the barplots in the range (0, 0.03) is provided as a figure inset to clarify differences among the distributions.</p>
