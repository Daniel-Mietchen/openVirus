 <caption>
  <p>Network visualizations of the graphs from the Middle Tennessee data (red), Seattle (blue), and northern Alberta (orange) data sets obtained at the respective GAIC-optimized distance thresholds, rendered using an implementation of the 
   <xref rid="veaa011-B18" ref-type="bibr">Kamada and Kawai (1989)</xref> algorithm. Vertices that corresponded to new cases were coloured in a darker shade, and the width of each vertex was scaled to the sample collection year with more recent cases drawn at a larger size. The vertices with zero degrees (singletons) were not drawn for clarity. Clusters with the largest number of new cases and/or the largest number of cases overall are highlighted for discussion in the text.
