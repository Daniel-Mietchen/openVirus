   <italic>In vitro</italic> competitive growth experiment. Vero-E6 cell lines were used for the hMPV competitive experiment. The MOI of infection was 50. There were five mixed genotype groups: 50:50, 20:80, 80:20, 10:100 and 100:10 (Genotype A:B). Cells were passaged every 4 days. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The input ratio of genotype A:B = 50:50. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The input ratio of genotype A:B = 20:80. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The input ratio of genotype A:B = 80:20. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The input ratio of genotype A:B = 10:100. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The input ratio of genotype A:B = 100:10. All the figures on the left show the ratio change in each passage post infection (Black represents genotype 
   <bold>A</bold>, and Blank represents genotype 
   <bold>B</bold>) and the figures on the right show the viral load of the two genotypes (Solid circles represent genotype A, and solid squares represent genotype B).
