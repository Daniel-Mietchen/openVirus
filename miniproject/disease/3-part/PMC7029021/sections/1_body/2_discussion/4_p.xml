<p id="Par21">In the present study, we sought to determine whether the competition exist between A and B subtypes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and a competitive replication system was used. First, in the mouse model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the trend of type A was down-up-down, and genotype B was predominant in the end. Except for when A:B = 80:20 during which the starting amount of genotype B was too small, the proportion of B increased slowly in the first 13d and decreased at 17d, and then increased at 20d. There may seem to have a phenomenon that no matter how virus input ratio was used, competition existed between the two subtypes and genotype B predominated in the animal models eventually. We speculated that the competitive advantage of subtype B may be related to its strong virulence

 </sup>, so we designed experiments to infect mice with A and B subtype or mixed subtypes to detect the severity of disease. However, based on our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiment results, the severity of illness was not related to infection with genotypes A and B in terms of weight changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), viral load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) airway hyperresponsiveness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) or histopathological changes in the lungs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This was shown not only for genotype A and B infection alone but also for 50:50, 20:80 and 80:20 mixed genotype infections. Although the results surprised us, previous clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in clinical manifestations between the two subtypes. From 2002 to 2004 in the USA, Apapov E 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup> first found that hMPV caused a viral genotype shift, but did not observe a difference in the severity of illness caused by various hMPV isolates. In Italy, from 2003 to 2004, Bosis S 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup> found that a high hMPV viral load was correlated with disease presentation, whereas the overall clinical and socioeconomic burden caused by infection with the two hMPV genotypes was similar. From 2006 to 2008 in southern Brazil, Debur MC 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found no correlation between genotype and disease severity in inpatients and outpatients
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>. In the same period (2006–2008) in China, no association was found between hMPV genotypes and disease severity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup>. In summary, we found that hMPV subtypes compete 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, but virulence is not the reason for its competitive advantages. The specific reasons need to be further explored, but we verified there is a competition between type A and B in animal at the first time, and this competition may play an alternating role in nature.
