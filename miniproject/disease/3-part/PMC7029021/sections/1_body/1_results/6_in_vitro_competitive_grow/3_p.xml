<p id="Par16">When the hMPV input ratio was adjusted to A:B = 80:20 and 100:10, subtype A account for a larger proportion at first. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>, during P1, the proportion of genotype A increased from 80% to 94.71%. However, at P3, the proportion of B increased, and B predominated (79.19%). Then, the proportion of B decreased from 25.22% (P5) to 1.57% (P6) until B was not detected (P8). A 10-fold difference in the input ratio was utilized to determine whether the competition between the two genotypes could still be observed. When the proportion of genotype A was ten-fold that of B (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>), competition of the two subtypes were also observed, genoype A decreased and then increased to be predominant strain.
