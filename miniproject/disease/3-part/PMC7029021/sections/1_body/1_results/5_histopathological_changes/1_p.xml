 </sup>. The highest viral load was observed on the fourth day, and the mice were sacrificed on the fifth day to assess the pathological changes. On the 5th day, a few infiltrating cells were found around bronchioles or vessels in non-infected mice, and infected mice showed swelling of the bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar dilation and extensive infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages in both bronchioles and pulmonary blood vessels, indicating a high mean score (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). The inflammatory responses in the infection groups were significantly more dramatic compared to those in the DMEM control group (P &lt; 0.05). However, there were no differences among the five infected groups (P &gt; 0.05) (Fig.
