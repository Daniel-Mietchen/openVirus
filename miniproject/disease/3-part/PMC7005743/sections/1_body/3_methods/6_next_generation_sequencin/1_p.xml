<p id="Par26">Viral RNA was extracted from respiratory swab samples collected from donor or recipient ferrets and from organs of donor ferrets, using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was subjected to reverse-transcription using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and the following primer: AGCRAAAGCAGG. Amplicons from the PB2 genes were generated by PCR from the cDNA using the following primers: A/H1N1 (CGCACTCAGAATGAAGTGGA (F), GCCGAAGGTACCATGTTTCA (R), amplicon size of 265 nucleotides), A/H3N2 (CATAGTAGTGCAGAAATGGTTCCGGAGAGA (F), CATAGTAGTGTTCGGCGTATCTTGACTTGA (R), amplicon size of 239 nucleotides) and A/H5N1 (CATAGTAGTGTGGAGCAAGACAAATGATGC (F), CATAGTAGTGCTCCCACTTCATTTGGGAAA (R), amplicon size 288 nucleotides). These fragments were sequenced using the Roche 454 GS Junior sequencing platform. The fragment library was created for each sample according to the manufacturer’s protocol without DNA fragmentation (GS FLX Titanium Rapid Library Preparation, Roche). The emulsion PCR (Amplification Method Lib-L) and GS Junior sequencing run were performed according to instructions of the manufacturer (Roche). Sequence reads from the GS Junior sequencing data were sorted by barcode and aligned to reference sequences using CLC Genomics software 6.0.2. The sequence reads were trimmed at 30 nucleotides from the 3′ and 5′ ends to remove all primer sequences. For quality control, sequence reads were trimmed for Phred scores of less than 20. The threshold for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms was manually set at 1% of the total number of reads per sample. Results were then expressed as percentage of the sum of the reads corresponding to the two possible nucleotides (untagged and tagged).</p>
