<p id="Par29">Human airway epithelia reconstituted in vitro (MucilAir
 <sup>TM</sup>) were purchased from Epithelix Sàrl (Switzerland). These human respiratory epithelia were reconstituted from nasal polyps obtained from patients undergoing surgical nasal polypectomy. At Epithelix Sàrl, mixtures of cells originating from 14 donors were seeded in Transwell-COL inserts and cultured at the air-liquid interface. After 45-days of culture, the epithelia became fully differentiated with a pseudo-stratified architecture with the three main types of cells: ciliated epithelial cells, mucus-producing goblets cells and basal cells. Cells were tested negative for mycoplasma, HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B and C. Cells were received when fully differentiated, were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and basal media was changed every two days. The total number of differentiated cells was estimated to be 400,000 cells per well. Before the inoculation, cells were incubated with PBS supplemented with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> (100 mg/L of CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 100 mg/L of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>−6H
 <sub>2</sub>0) for 45 min at 37 °C, 5%CO
 <sub>2</sub> and subsequently washed three times with PBS with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>. This treatment tightens the junctions and removes the mucus accumulated at the apical surface of the cells. Cells were then inoculated in duplicates with A/H1N1, A/H3N2 (A/Panama/2007/99), A/H5N1 or A/H5N1
 <sub>AT</sub> viruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 0.1 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell for three hours at 37 °C, 5%CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were then washed three times with PBS with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and then left at the air-liquid interface. At 1, 2 and 3 days after inoculation, cells were washed 5 times with PBS with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 3μm for immunohistochemical analysis as described above for the ferret nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelia. Each membrane was sliced at three different positions to have a representation of the infection pattern on the overall membranes. Representative pictures were taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope, an Olympus ColorView IIIu camera and acquisition Olympus Cell
 <sup>A</sup> software. The white balance of the pictures was adjusted using Adobe Photoshop.
