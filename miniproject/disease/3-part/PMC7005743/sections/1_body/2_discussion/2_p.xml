<p id="Par13">Here, it was shown for the first time that human A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses and mammal-adapted avian A/H5N1 virus are transmitted via the air from the URT, more specifically from the nasal respiratory epithelium, and not from the trachea, bronchus or the lungs of inoculated ferrets. Transmission was delayed and less robust than observed in previous experiments, in which the donor ferret is only inoculated intranasally and stay in contact with the recipient ferret for 14 days (rather than maximum 5 days)

 </sup>. The reason for this might be the fact that the donor ferrets were suffering from lower respiratory tract disease, possibly leading to impaired breathing, or that the donor ferrets were removed from the experiment in some cases too early.
