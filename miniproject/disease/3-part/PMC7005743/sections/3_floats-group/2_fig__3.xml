  <title>Airborne transmissible influenza A viruses infected the nasal respiratory epithelium of ferrets.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Representative pictures of ferret nasal respiratory and nasal olfactory epithelia 2 days after intranasal inoculation with A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1
   <sub>AT</sub> or A/H5N1 viruses. Influenza A virus nucleoprotein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and is shown as a red stain. HE: hematoxylin-eosin stain. Scale bar 50 μm. 
   <bold>b</bold> Percentage of epithelium that was nucleoprotein antigen-positive, as determined by IHC, were blindly assessed in the nasal respiratory epithelium (black) and nasal olfactory epithelium (light gray) of three ferrets inoculated with the respective viruses. Individual percentages are shown. Means are depicted by the horizontal lines. 
   <bold>c</bold> Individual virus titers in the homogenized nasal turbinates (containing both nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelia) were determined by end-point titration in MDCK. Means are depicted by the horizontal lines. The limit of detection of the virus titration is shown by the dotted line. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
