<p>Plasma samples were tested for each EVD survivor for Ebola virus antibodies using our previously described serological assay based on Luminex technology [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recombinant proteins of NP, viral protein-40 (VP40), and GP (from Mayinga and Kissoudougou strains) from Zaire EBOV species were used, and plasma samples were tested at 1:1000 dilution as previously reported. Antigen and antibody reactions were subsequently read on BioPlex-200 equipment (BioRad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France), and the results were expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per 100 beads.
