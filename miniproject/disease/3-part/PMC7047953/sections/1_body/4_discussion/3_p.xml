<p>In this study, we estimated that EBOV RNA can persist for up to 200 days in semen, which is longer than the 46-day estimate from our previous analysis on fewer patients (188 versus 278), fewer follow-up samples (mean of 2.8 versus 4.9), a shorter follow-up period, and, more importantly, using less-sensitive assays [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. With the more sensitive Ebola Xpert assay, almost all male survivors can be considered to be positive for Ebola RNA for up to 3 months, and 70% can be considered to be positive for up to 6 months. These data are in line with observations from studies in Sierra Leone and Liberia [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; ie, EBOV RNA was detected in all men within 3 months after ETU discharge in both countries and in 62% at 4 to 6 months in Liberia. No participants were enrolled in this period in Sierra Leone, but 8% and 25% were positive in Sierra Leone and Liberia, respectively, at 7 to 9 months after ETU discharge.
