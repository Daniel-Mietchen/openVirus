<p>Overall, our study shows that semen seems to be the body fluid at highest risk for additional transmissions after discharge from ETU, as also observed in previous reports [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although the aim of the study was not to compare performance of viral detection assays, we observed important differences among viral RNA detection techniques. Differences can be due to primer and probe sequences but also to sample volumes used in the tests or the viral RNA extraction methods. Moreover, performance and detection limits of the assays can also differ when used in different body fluids compared with blood. Thus, lower rates and absence of viral RNA detection in other body fluids is most likely underestimated depending on the assays used. This is clearly illustrated by retesting of a subset of breast milk and semen samples. Finally, because samples were tested at 3-month intervals, it cannot be excluded that we missed transient or sporadic positivity. However, given the high numbers of samples and patients tested, we expect that at least some samples would have been detected if these other body fluids were important viral reservoirs as was the case for semen in our study.
